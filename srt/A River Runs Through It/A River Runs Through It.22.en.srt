Tao Tao, let's go watch a movie tomorrow.

4
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,730
I can't tomorrow.

5
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,030
I have homework.

6
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,970
Homework again?

7
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,960
I have a lot of schoolwork this semester.

8
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,409
Let's go out for some fun. You won't miss much.

9
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,699
But this assignment really is very important.

10
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:51,400
My course credit for this semester depends on it.

11
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,619
Before, when I was busy rehearsing,

12
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:55,999
you were upset

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,590
since I couldn't hang out with you.

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,229
Now that I have time,

15
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,000
you aren't going.

16
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,640
Don't be like that.

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,740
How about accompanying me when I do homework?

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,369
All right?

19
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,470
Don't be like that.

20
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,999
Okay, I'll do it.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,019
I'll go with you. Let's eat first.

22
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,890
Eat.

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,000
Datu!

24
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,549
What's wrong?

25
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,880
Am I that scary?

26
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,859
How was the movie last night?

27
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:43,350
Xia Xiaoju, do you find playing me very interesting?

28
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,260
Get out of the way!

29
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,289
What's with you?

30
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:49,240
I'm fine. I don't need you to blindly worry about me.

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,759
Wait. Are you angry

32
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,859
that I asked you out to watch a movie on Shen Duo's behalf?

33
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:56,389
I just wanted to help act as a matchmaker.

34
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,549
Matchmaker?

35
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,179
Is there something wrong with you? Why are you putting together couples randomly?

36
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,770
You're the one with something wrong.

37
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,669
You like Shen Duo. And she likes you, too.

38
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,620
Is there something wrong with helping her if you both like each other?

39
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,029
Who told you I like Shen Duo?

40
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,629
If you don't like her, why did you ask me for help choosing a present for her?

41
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,159
Present?

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,470
Wh-What present? What are you talking about?

43
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,110
The red pen!

44
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,879
<i>I made an appointment for you with the psychologist we talked about last time.</i>

45
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,229
<i>As a professional psychologist, he will definitely be able to help you greatly. </i>

46
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:26,999
<i>You really helped me a lot.</i>

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,930
<i>Thank you.</i>

48
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,359
<i>Don't just say it.</i>

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,499
<i>If you really are grateful, you should actually do something.</i>

50
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,669
<i>Sure!</i>

51
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,440
<i>I'll get you a great gift another day.</i>

52
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,350
<i>What's that?</i>

53
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:46,009
<i>It's a gift. Is it pretty?</i>

54
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:47,730
<i>Let me see.</i>

55
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,220
<i>Well, this will work for me!</i>

56
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,629
<i>That won't work.</i>

57
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,549
<i>It's a deal!</i>

58
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,369
<i>It's just a pen. Plain and simple.</i>

59
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,830
<i>- Thanks.
- I really can't give that one. Let me get you something else.</i>

60
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,240
<i>I bought it as a gift for someone else!</i>

61
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,289
Is that what happened?

62
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:06,270
What were you thinking?

63
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,030
So who was the pen for in the first place?

64
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,730
Don't be so gossipy.

65
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,659
On the other hand, I think Shen Duo is quite a good person.

66
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:25,959
She's pretty, and she took the initiative in helping you with your hemophobia.

67
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,690
Xia Xiaoju! Do you ever stop talking?

68
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,599
I'd rather like you than like her!

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,229
What do you mean by that?

70
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,719
Thank you for that!

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,789
But you don't have to worry, I won't like you either.

72
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,389
You don't have to worry, either.

73
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,320
I'd rather like a pig than like you.

74
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,020
Fine then.

75
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,549
I'll say thank you for the pig.

76
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,490
Xia Xiaoju!

77
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,919
Come on. Don't be angry.

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,960
I was wrong.

79
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,059
I won't ask you out for Shen Duo in the future.

80
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:01,009
Stay away from me.

81
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,599
Don't be angry!

82
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,479
I'll treat you to a meal as an apology, all right?

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,689
Hotpot?

84
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,349
That's your favorite!

85
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,659
Let's have hotpot together.

86
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:11,990
I'll treat you, all right?

87
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,100
Come on.

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,380
Tonight at 7:00 p.m.

89
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,120
I'll be waiting for you at the newly opened hotpot restaurant in front of our school.

90
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,000
He's so hard to please.

91
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,310
Why don't you head back?

92
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,119
You don't have to stay here with me.

93
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:42,439
No, no.

94
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,449
I promised to be here. Continue.

95
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,789
It will take me a couple more hours to finish.

96
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,200
Are you sure you can sit for that long?

97
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
A couple hours?

98
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,509
Even if I can't sit still, I have to accompany you.

99
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,610
Or you'll be angry at me.

100
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,789
I won't be angry.

101
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:03,020
You staying here actually distracts me.

102
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,000
Hurry and go. I'll go find you when I'm done.

103
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,130
Then I'll go practice guitar.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,250
You agreed to it.

105
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,500
Don't get angry at me.

106
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,390
All right, I'm leaving.

107
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,339
Huang Jun.

108
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,670
Are you not with your girlfriend today?

109
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,949
She's studying at the library.

110
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm here to practice the guitar for a bit.

111
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,549
I'm feeling bored right now.

112
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:00,000
Why don't we go watch a movie together?

113
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,540
Us two?

114
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,589
That's not appropriate.

115
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,080
Why not?

116
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,619
Or do you have a guilty conscience

117
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:11,819
that you don't dare go out and watch a movie with me?

118
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,920
There's nothing between us. Why would I have a guilty conscience?

119
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,240
That's right.

120
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,439
What's wrong with watching a movie with a friend?

121
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,040
It's not like only couples can watch movies together.

122
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,599
Mainly it's because I heard the music in the movie is very great.

123
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,199
I really want you to listen.

124
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,920
Is that so?

125
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,249
- All right. Let's go. I'll treat you.
- Okay.

126
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:35,090
Let's go. Let's go.

127
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,250
It's still too early.

128
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,549
Would it look more sincere

129
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,350
if I wait for her downstairs?

130
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,300
Thanks.

Huang Jun. Why don't we buy some food?

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,100
What do you want? It's on me.

134
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,830
On you?

135
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,339
Coke and popcorn for two.

136
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,999
We have a couple's set.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,379
It's cheaper than buying them separately.

138
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,169
Would you like that?

139
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,439
Okay, we will have the couple's set.

140
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay.

141
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,450
The movie is quite good,

142
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,680
but I don't like the plot of unrequited love.

I will definitely let him know.

And I'm sure that he also know that I like him.

146
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,880
Why isn't he picking up?

166
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:04,420
The seats are full. Do you mind waiting?

167
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,030
Not at all.

168
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,500
Excuse me. There are quite a lot of people right now. Can we take your order now?

169
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,200
I'm sorry, can I wait a bit longer?

170
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,600
Why are you studying this late?

171
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,319
How did you know I'm here?

172
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:38,040
I'm here to borrow some books.

173
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,939
I just happened to see you. Let's go to the dining hall to eat together.

174
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:43,249
Let's go.

175
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:44,570
You didn't go to the hotpot restaurant?

176
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,249
What hotpot restaurant? I don't eat hotpot.

177
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:48,610
Is it because you want to eat some hotpot?

178
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,450
Is it–

179
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,450
What's up with him?

180
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,760
Why are you sitting outside?

181
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,130
Do you know how long I waited for you?

182
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,849
Why didn't you pick up my call? I almost froze to death.

183
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:54,479
Are you dumb? Why didn't you wait inside?

184
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,600
Don't you see how many people are waiting inside?

185
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,400
How could I t-take a seat and don't eat?

186
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,000
Why did you come just now?

187
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,800
I... Something came up last minute.

188
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
"Something came up last minute?"

189
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,400
You should have sent me a message!

190
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't you know how embarrassing it was

191
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,200
to sit there for hours?

192
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,400
I thought you asked me out for Shen Duo.

193
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,200
Why would I?

194
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,400
I went to your dorm to pick you up today.

195
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
I heard you said something to Shen Duo

196
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,500
that she could count on you and something like that.

197
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,300
I thought you were going to help Shen Duo again.

198
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,700
Shen Duo was helping you find a doctor.

199
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,800
She was afraid what she did before made you angry.

200
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,400
So she asked me to talk to you.

201
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,000
So is that what happened?

202
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,400
What were you thinking?

203
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,000
Am I a liar to you?

204
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,469
Okay, I wronged you.

205
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,600
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,200
The hotpot is on me.

207
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,900
I won't eat!

208
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,589
How about this?

209
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,500
I'm hungry anyway.

210
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,900
Just treat it as accompanying me in eating something, alright?

211
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I know I was wrong.

212
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,600
I was wrong. I was wrong.

213
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,100
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

214
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,300
Seeing how weird you have dressed,

215
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,900
I will reluctantly eat something with you.

216
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,400
Here.

217
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,700
Shiyi, be sure to fetch more beef, Shrimp Wah,

218
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,100
corns, and quail eggs later.

219
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't forget about pig brains!

220
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,400
Quickly go!

221
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,200
And enoki mushrooms too.

222
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
So delicious.

223
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,900
Slow down. Don't choke.

224
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,400
I'm telling you.

225
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
When having a hot pot buffet,

226
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,200
we must eat as much as possible.

227
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Understand? Quickly eat!

228
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,700
Since you like to eat this so much,

229
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,400
I can treat you again tomorrow.

230
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,600
I'm going out with someone to watch a movie tomorrow.

231
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,300
With whom?

232
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,000
Is it the one you liked before?

233
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,500
None of your business.

234
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't ask. I won't tell you.

235
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,400
I knew it.

236

Before what you said about the past being the past.

237

Whatever!

239
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,800
Why are you back so late?

240
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,500
Did you go on a date?

241
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,500
Why are you back late too?

242
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,700
I had hotpot with Xia Xiaoju.

243
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,500
I was wondering where the smell was coming from.

Nothing.

♫ <i>Those two worlds are walking farther away</i> ♫

331
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,600
She got stood up.

335
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,400
Shall we go to the hospital?

336
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,600
No need.

337
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,400
When I first started learning dance,

338
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,500
I often fell.

339
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,700
I'll be okay in a few days.

340
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,600
I'm sorry for making you worry.

341
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,200
It's okay.

342
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,200
Everyone has times where they are upset.

343
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,200
I'll keep it a secret for you.

344
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Seriously?

345
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,600
Was she really stood up?

346
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,700
Why are you here?

347
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,500
Let's head back to school.

348
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,100
I...

349
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,600
I want to sit here on my own for a bit longer.

350
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,200
Sit here on your own?

351
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,500
Go ahead and keep pretending.

352
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,800
The movie has ended. Do you still think he'll come?

353
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,100
Then...

354
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,500
Then maybe

355
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,300
he was delayed by something last minute.

356
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,700
I want to wait for a bit longer.

357
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,000
Are you a fool, Xia Xiaoju?

358
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,600
Do you think that being stood up by him

359
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,000
and acting like this shows deep love?

360
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,400
Come on, let's go back to the university.

361
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,600
Leave me alone!

362
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,200
Do you think I want to care about your lousy matters?

363
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
If you didn't stand here acting like a fool

364
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,700
and felt sorry for you,

365
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,800
I wouldn't even bother.

366
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,400
You are the fool.

367
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,500
Who are you to me

368
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,000
to care about me?

369
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,200
Yes, I'm a fool. What does it have to do with you?

370
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
I am willing to be a fool. It's none of your business!

371
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,600
Fine.

372
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,000
Not my business.

373
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,400
Xia Xiaoju, I'll tell you the truth.

374
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,500
I know who he is.

375
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,700
If he really likes you,

376
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,800
why would he keep you waiting here foolishly?

377
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,400
Even if something comes up last minute,

378
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,000
he'd make a call and notify you beforehand.

379
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,500
You are imagining that he also likes you.

380
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Xiaoju, listen to me.

381
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,700
Lu Shiyi! So what if I imagine that he likes me?

382
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,400
Leave me alone!

383
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,100
- Why are you angry again?
- Leave!

384
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,000
I'll treat you to the hotpot. Don't go.

385
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,200
Don't be angry.

386
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,800
Stop running.

387
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,200
Don't be angry.

388
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Don't be angry.

389
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,000
Stop pulling me!

390
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm not pulling you. Don't be angry.

391
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,800
- Stop following me!
- I was wrong.

392
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,700
It's my fault. I shouldn't have said that about you.

393
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,779
I have apologized. What else do you want from me?

394
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,350
- Don't be angry.
- Didn't you say I was a fool?

395
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,189
Didn't you say I was imagining he also liked me?

396
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,600
I'll ask him about it now!

397
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,400
Stop following me!

398
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,200
Xiaoju?

399
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,800
Did you watch the movie with Shiyi?

400
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,200
- Something came up last minute...
- If you didn't want to go watch a movie, you could've refused.

401
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,100
Why did you promise me, but not go?

402
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,800
There was an accident. Back in the studio, Lin You accidentally...

403
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,400
I knew it was because of Lin You.

404
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,100
She's not feeling well so I spent some time with her just now.

405
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,800
"She's not feeling well?"

406
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,500
She has a boyfriend to talk to when she's upset. What does it have to do with you?

407
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,010
Did you know that I was like a fool

408
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,100
waiting for you in front of the movie theater?

409
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,400
I'm sorry, Xiaoju. I thought you were okay with watching it with Shiyi instead.

410
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,000
Then you shouldn't have agreed to it in the first place.

411
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,200
Lin You has a boyfriend!

412
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,600
Showing up in front of her every day makes you a fool.

413
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Do you know?

414
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,900
Actually...

415
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Lin You has broken up with Yuan Ancheng.

416
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,600
- What's going on?
- No idea.

417
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,900
So-So, what?

418
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,300
You got another chance, right?

419
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,000
That's not what I mean!

420
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,000
Xiaoju!

421
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,300
- Cheng Lang.
- Are you alright?

422
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,500
- Cheng Lang...
- It's okay.

423
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,200
- Did you get burnt, Cheng Lang?
- I'm fine.

424
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,800
Let me see.

425
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,300
- Shall we go to the hospital?
- It's fine.

00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,700
I'm sorry, Cheng Lang. It's all my fault.
