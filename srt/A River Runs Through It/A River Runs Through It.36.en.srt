- I don't want to listen to your explanation.

127
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:35,549
I don't want to talk to you either.

From now on, we're strangers to one another.

129
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:42,300
I need to go to the restroom.

130
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:44,380

Endure it.

133
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:16,059
Xiaoju, I won't care about what happened between the two of you,

134
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:21,220

- Not yet.

Pengpeng is quite nice, though he's a bit dark.

Come over here.

148
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,866
Sit down. And be good.

149

You're so handsome now.

163
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
Well, if you say so.

164
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,680
Stop being so smug. Get back to the point.

165
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,410
That's right. Everyone come over here.

166
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,549
I want to say something to everyone.

167
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,780
There are many new and old friends here today.

168
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,370
Do you want to invite Baobao to be your master of ceremonies?

169
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,120
With how talkative he is, it really does suit him.

170
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,533
Xia Xiaoju, shut up.

171
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:41,510
Brainless.

172
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:45,000
Anyway, everyone must have a good time today.

173
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,669
Everything today is on me.

174
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,122
Great!

175
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,021
I'll give a toast to everyone.

176
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:55,310
- Is he paying?
- Please enjoy yourselves.

177
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:01,579
Baobao, aren't you stealing the show a bit?

178
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:04,220
You're not the groom.

179
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,400
Xia Xiaoju, let go of her.

180
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,788
You are the groom?

181
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,980
Yes, the authentic one.

182
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,188
Why is it him? Why didn't you tell me earlier?

183
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:31,299
Are you surprised?

184
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,229
- Of course, I'm surprised...
- Wait a second, Xia Xiaoju.

185
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,722
Why couldn't it be me?

186
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:36,421
Didn't you just say I was handsome?

187
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:38,999
I was joking with you. Did you actually take it seriously?

188
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,822
Joking?

189
00:15:40,822 --> 00:15:45,150
Xia Xiaoju, are you here to cause trouble?

190
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,220
Hold on.

191
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,044
Did you know a long time ago that Taotao is marrying Baobao?

192
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:55,022
Who are you? Didn't you say we're strangers?

193
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:57,340
Did you not want to speak with me?

194
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,199
- You...
- I didn't know who Le Tao was going to marry,

195
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,519
but I knew who my good brother Bao Xiangxiang was going to marry.

196
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,279
Why didn't you tell me a couple days ago then?

197
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,800
Did you ask me?

198
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,549
Besides, your best friend is getting married, but you don't even know who the groom is.

199
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,232
Do you really think you are best friends?

200
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:15,354
Shut up!

201
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:16,865
Didn't you ask me?

202
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:19,709
- I...
- Have you thought about

203
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,399
why she didn't tell you who the groom was?

204
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,939
- Xia Xiaoju, you're just a pig.
- You're the strange one!

205
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:25,820
- And a stupid pig.
- You are such a disgusting person!
- Stop arguing!

206
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,319
- There's not a more stupid pig than you.
- What are you saying? You are the pig.

207
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,788
- It's true.
- You're the pig!

208
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,400
Enough!

209
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,769
Don't get angry with him.

210
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,232
And you! You really kept this such a good secret for all these years.

211
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,400
I wanted to give you a surprise.

212
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,780
Xia Xiaoju, let's drink.

213
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,580
All right!

214
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,620
<i>I'll definitely surpass you!</i>

215
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,700
<i>I'll definitely surpass you!</i>

216
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,900
You were never my opponent when we were in school.

217
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,440
I'll let you see my power today.

218
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:11,210
Let me tell you. If I wasn't caught cheating,

219
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,000
you would have definitely been in last place!

220
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,520
Drink!

221
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:28,599
Tell Le Tao when you get there.

222
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,621
Take care.

223
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:31,009
Bye bye.

224
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,376
- Drink!
- Xiaoju, let's drink!

225
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:34,800
The two of you stop drinking!

226
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,450
Qiu Le Tao... l think you have bad taste in men.

227
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,333
Why did you find someone in last place?

228
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,069
That won't do.

229
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:48,254
All right, everything you say is right.

230
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:51,759
But can we stop drinking now?

231
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:54,610
- Be good.
- Xiaoju, let me tell you.

232
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,969
You shouldn't choose a boyfriend based on his grades.

233
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:01,043
No wonder you are still single.

234
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:02,740
Xia Xiaoju, keep on drinking!

235
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,220
Stop drinking!

236
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,676
Shiyi, what are you doing? Hurry and come help. These two can't keep drinking.

237
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:11,730
Xiaoju, hurry...

238
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,230
Shut up!

239
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,900
Enough, Boss Bao. Stop drinking.

240
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,976
Shiyi...

241
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:21,200
Don't pull my pants. I'm listening.

242
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,180
You're better than me at everything in school,

243
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:30,540
but I'm better than you at finding a girlfriend and a wife.

244
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,300
That's right. You are the best!

245
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,400
Shiyi!

246
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,560
I want to throw up.

247
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,554
I reserved a room upstairs in the hotel.

248
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:54,122
Take her up to rest first. She drunk too much.

Life is long. After many days of anticipation,

326
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,020
today, this new couple will get married here.

327
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:49,079
It is often sung that if love comes too quick, it is like a tornado.

328
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,009
Marriage, on the other hand,

329
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:54,021
is like the warm wind blowing in spring.

330
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:57,254
It symbolizes a new life and hope.

331
00:25:57,254 --> 00:26:01,159
At this time, the new couple has arrived by my side.

332
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,799
They'll shed the ostentatious of dating

333
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,559
and will be filled with hope as they spend the rest of their lives together.

334
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,349
Mr. Bao Xiangxiang, are you willing to take Miss Qiu Le Tao as your wife,

335
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,910
caring and loving her for the rest of your life?

336
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:17,760
I do!

337
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,899
Miss Qiu Le Tao, are you willing to marry Mr. Bao Xiangxiang,

338
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:27,380
loving and protecting him for all your life?

339
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:30,100
I do.

340
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:35,765
Someone once said, "I was not part of your past,

341
00:26:35,765 --> 00:26:38,840
but I'll have the honor of keeping you company until the end of your lifetime."

342
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,519
Today, the new couple have made their oath to one another

343
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,720
to hold each other's hand and grow old together.

It's time to throw the bride's bouquet.

00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,749
During this time,

348
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,310
if there are single boys and girls who want to find themselves a lover,

349
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:21,154
hurry and come up on stage

350
00:27:21,155 --> 00:27:24,260
to seize this opportunity.

351
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,960
There are this many single people here?

352
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,876
Okay. Let's see who's the luckiest today

353
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:33,539
and catch the one bride's bouquet.

354
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,129
Are you ready?

355
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,222
- Yes!
- Are you ready?

356
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,787
- I'm nervous...
- Why would you be?
- Let's welcome our bride to throw her bouquet.

357
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:40,154
- I can't recite all my lines.
- Three, two...

358
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:41,800
- It'll be fine.
- One!

359
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,129
Congratulations to Xiaoju for catching the bouquet!

360
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:49,500
Hurry! Let's go!

361
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,043
- Now? Wait! I...
- It's up to you now.

362
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:55,932
There's another short program today.

363
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,259
My good brother, Lu Shiyi...

364
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,509
- There's no time!
- Let's welcome him on stage.

365
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,065
I haven't memorized all of my lines.

366
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:02,243
Wait for just a moment.

367
00:28:02,244 --> 00:28:04,300
You must succeed this time!

368
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:09,349
Next, let's leave the stage to my brother, Shiyi.

369
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,400
Go on!

370
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,280
Hurry and go! I'll wait for you here.

371

Thank you, everyone.

373
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,279
I've liked a girl for many years,

374
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,711
so I want to use this opportunity to confess to her.

375
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:50,809
We've known each other for many years,

376
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,539
and we've lost too much time.

377
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:54,960
But time and distance...

378
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,140
allowed me to become clearer of my own feelings for her.

379
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,220
Xiaoju.

380
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,420
I used to run after you,

381
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,559
hoping you would look behind to see me some day.

382
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,620
But now, I don't want to stand behind you.

383
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,949
I want to walk shoulder and shoulder with you for the rest of our lives.
