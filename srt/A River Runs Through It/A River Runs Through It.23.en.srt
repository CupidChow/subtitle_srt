00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,580
What's with you and Cheng Lang?

4
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,900
I'm talking to you.

5
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,939
Nothing.

6
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,819
Are you still saying it's nothing?

7
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,120
You look like you want to eat him.

8
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,379
You two are attached at the hip usually.

9
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,670
Now, you consciously avoid him.

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,760
Only women can make your friendship break like this.

11
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,750
Perhaps... did you have a change of heart and like Lin You?

12
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,619
Xia Xiaoju likes Cheng Lang.

13
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:22,599
So you went after him like you ate a bomb these days?

14
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,389
Bro, is your brain full of formaldehyde?

15
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,909
Cheng Lang doesn't like Xia Xiaoju.

16
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,319
He likes Lin You.

17
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,119
You guys can't be considered rivals.

18
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:33,680
Besides, Lin You just broke up with her boyfriend.

19
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,240
What does that mean?

20
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,300
It means Cheng Lang has a second chance.

21
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,799
At this time, shouldn't you go and comfort Xia Xiaoju's broken spirit,

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,990
instead of going against Cheng Lang?

23
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,410
Cheng Lang, you're here.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,910
I'm going to make a phone call.

25
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,830
Talk it out with him.

26
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,339
Talk it out with him!

27
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:01,200
Take a seat, take a seat.

28
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,370
Have an apple.

29
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,129
Say it. What's your problem with me?

30
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,119
Why would I have a problem with you?

31
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,359
Then are you upset because your hemophobia treatment is not going well?

32
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,440
It's going quite well.

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,929
Then what's with you and Xia Xiaoju the last two days?

34
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:31,909
Especially Xia Xiaoju. She was so angry at me that day.

35
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,219
I think just for a movie, it's a bit overboard, right?

36
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,550
What do you mean overboard?

37
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,159
Xia Xiaoju has always been frugal.

38
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,760
It wasn't easy to invite you—

39
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,469
Invite us to watch a movie.

40
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,559
Yet you didn't go and wasted her movie.

41
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,960
Do you have no idea how expensive a movie ticket is?

42
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,189
Is it because of that?

43
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,909
Of course, it's because of that!

44
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,379
Did you forget? When Xia Xiaoju was in her senior year,

45
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,959
her shoe was already torn to that state, but she still didn't get a new pair.

46
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,959
Now you wasted her ticket.

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,159
How could she not feel bad for her money?

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,370
But I keep thinking there's something else about it.

49
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,519
She get's even angrier whenever I mention Lin You.

50
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,840
Wh-Why?

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,799
Is this so hard to explain?

52
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,219
Xia Xiaoju knew Lin You liked Yuan Ancheng.

53
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:17,439
Plus, she knew they were together for a long time.

54
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,009
But you idiotically cared about Lin You like a fool every day.

55
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,690
Xia Xiaoju was afraid you'd get hurt.

56
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,509
I know what I'm doing.

57
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:28,500
I'll take care of it.

58
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,700
<i>Xiaoju!</i>

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,480
Let's run together.

60
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,690
You're here so early.

61
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,760
I haven't trained in a long time.

62
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,040
I finally know why you like running so much.

63
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,449
Because when you're running, it'll get your mind off those troubles.

64
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,670
You just run with all your heart and soul.

65
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,160
Lin You.

66
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,880
Is there a misunderstanding...

67
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,550
between you and Yuan Ancheng?

68
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,270
No, there's not.

69
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,480
He just called to tell me...

70
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,040
he doesn't like me anymore and wanted to break up.

71
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,640
That's because he's blind.

72
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,830
You've to know that you've suitors lined up from the dance room to the university gate.

73
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,340
That's right.

74
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,159
Would I be afraid that no one likes me?

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,100
He doesn't like me because he's blind.

76
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,859
- That's right. Don't take it to heart.
- Okay.

77
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,880
Let me dry your tears.

78
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,199
I signed up for the 400 meter race for the Sports Meet.

79
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,439
You're so good at running.

80
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,779
Why don't you join me?

81
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,800
In this case, we can train together every day.

82
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,240
I-I won't be participating.

83
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,320
I recently just occasionally come here to train.

84
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,599
Now, I study at the library every day.

85
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:03,200
If I don't study hard, I may fail the exams again.

86
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,640
Fine.

How?

92
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,699
Much better.

93
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,980
Shiyi, do you have something on your mind recently?

94
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,279
- No.
- It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

95
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,599
But I still have to remind you.

96
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,679
Your therapy has been rather slow lately.

97
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:07,939
At this speed,

98
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:13,090
it'll be hard to recover fully before the anatomy class next semester.

99
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,439
I hope you can clear your mind,

100
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,350
and not let other things disturb your treatment.

101
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,210
I understand, Dr. Gu.

102
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,740
Thank you.

103
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,759
- Is it over?
- Yes.

104
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,349
What did the doctor say?

105
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,830
Just like that.

106
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,839
"J-Just like that?" What does that mean?

107
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,930
Like how it used to be.

108
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,910
- If you're not going to say it, then I'll go ask myself.
- Hey!

109
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,179
Can't you see that Dr. Gu is busy?

110
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,419
Don't bother him and take up his time.

111
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,549
I'll just tell you, okay?

112
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,879
He said that I was too nervous lately, and asked me to relax a bit.

113
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,419
- Is that it?
- That's it.

114
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,839
Wait, relax?

115
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,399
How should you relax?

116
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,959
Well, listening to music or something.

117
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,109
That's easy! Huang Jun can help treat you in the dorm.

118
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,909
Come on. I'd thank him if he doesn't make noise.

119
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:32,899
I'm very hungry. Let's go eat!

120
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,039
I'll buy you food to thank you. How about it?

121
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,519
Then I want to eat the chicken cutlets from the third canteen.

122
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,149
When it comes to food, your eyes suddenly shine.

123
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,469
Let's go.

124
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,470
Datu, you getting better is the happiest thing that happened to me lately.

125
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,100
Go and grab a spot.

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
- I have just enough here.
- Okay.

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,720
I want a serving of balls.

128
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,200
Okay.

129
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,400
What's up?

130
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,000
You look like you're unhappy to see me.

131
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,200
Are you still angry at me?

132
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,600
Not anymore.

133
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,100
I-Is your arm feeling better?

134
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,000
It's already fine.

135
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,000
Xiaoju, Lin You sprained her ankle that day,

136
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and she was very upset.

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,200
I was afraid she'd do something dangerous.

138
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,400
So that's why I didn't go to the movie theater.

139
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,600
I know. You don't have to explain it to me.

141
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm fine now.

142
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,100
Xiaoju, I would like to ask you a favor.

143
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,200
If you're not busy lately, can you spend more time with Lin You?

144
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,200
On the surface, she looks like she's all right,

145
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,300
but she's crying on the inside.

146
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,800
She entered the Sports Meet to vent out her emotions and to get her mind off them.

147
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,400
Her ankle hasn't healed yet either,

148
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,300
so I'm quite worried about her.

149
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,600
I'll accompany her.

150
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,500
Besides, didn't she just break up recently?

151
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
You can also go and accompany her.

152
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,200
I will. Thank you, Xiaoju.

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
Why are you here?

154
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
To eat.

155
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,700
What? Am I not welcomed?

156
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,200
Xia Xiaoju, go sit across the table.

157
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
I need to talk to Cheng Lang.

158
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,000
Can't you also talk to me while sitting over there?

159
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,000
What... What's wrong?

160
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,000
I want to check your arm.

161
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,500
How can I do that if I'm sitting across from you?

162
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,900
It has recovered rather quickly.

163
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,300
The red mark is almost gone.

164
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,000
It wasn't that serious to begin with.

165
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,500
Then I can put my mind to rest. Let's eat!

166
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Chicken cutlets.

167
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,200
I'm going back to the dorm first.

168
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
Don't you want to walk a while longer with us?

169
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
No, I'm going back first.

170
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,400
Why is Xiaoju also so emotional these days?

171
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,600
It's what all girls are like.

172
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,200
Let's go and play basketball.

173
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,500
I can't today.

174
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,100
I asked Lin You to do homework together tonight.

175
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,400
How's it going between you and her?

176
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,600
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

177
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,400
As usual.

178
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,800
Not as distant as we used to be yet not that close.

179
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,100
Why is your progress so slow?

180
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,600
I think this is quite nice.

181
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,800
Isn't it good to take things slow?

182
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,700
You talk different since you've started studying philosophy.

183
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
You're being all philosophical.

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,200
Listen, there are more wolves <i>(boys)</i> than there are meat <i>(girls)</i> in the Computer Science Department.

185
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
You don't know how many boys are eyeing Lin You.

186
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,500
You need to work harder!

187
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,100
Stop worrying.

188
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,400
Lin You is not such a casual girl.

189
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,600
How about this? Come to my dorm room tonight.

190
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
I'll let Huang Jun teach you.

191
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
He's got a way with girls.

192
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
You should learn from him.

193
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Shiyi, why do I have a feeling that you've been acting really strange lately?

194
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,000
Why do you care so much about me and Lin You suddenly?

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,900
Strange? Strange? What is so strange about it?

196
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm just afraid you'd get drunk and sleep with me again.

197
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
You need to forget about that incident, okay?

198
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,000
Really?

199
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Jacky Cheung is going to hold a concert here in Jiangzhou?
<i>(T/N: Hong Kong singer and one of the "Four Heavenly Kings.")</i>

200
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,600
Why would I lie to you?

201
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,700
He's my idol when I was in junior high school.

202
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,200
I didn't expect that you like Jacky Cheung.

203
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,800
I... I like him so much!

204
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,900
Da Huang.

205
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,200
Taotao.

206
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,600
I'm leaving.

207
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,700
Don't forget that the tickets go on sale the day after tomorrow.

208
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,500
I won't! I won't!

209
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,900
Taotao, let me tell you something.

210
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,400
Jacky Cheung is going to have a concert here in Jiangzhou.

211
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Really?

212
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,800
Really! I'm so happy. Let's go watch it together.

213
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,500
Okay?

214
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's talk about it later, okay?

215
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,500
I have something to ask you right now.

216
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,000
What's up?

217
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,000
I found this in your clothes.

218
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,300
Who did you watch the movie with?

219
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,200
I went with Xu Menglu.

220
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Who?

221
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
No, don't be like that. I can explain.

222
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,300
Don't be anxious about it first. Let me explain.

223
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,900
It's like this.

224
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
At that time, she asked us to go watch a movie.

225
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,300
I thought everyone would be going,

226
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,700
but in the end, I found out it was only her when I got there.

227
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,800
So you watched the movie with her?

228
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,200
O-Of course not!

229
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,400
I told her not to do that again.

230
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,700
Then I turned around and left.

231
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,600
Then why are these tickets with you?

232
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,100
And not only that, the ticket stubs were torn?

233
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,800
What happened was this.

234
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,300
She gave the tickets to the ticket taker when she saw me arrive.

235
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,800
Then she followed to shove them in my hand when she found out that I was about to leave.

236
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,800
She said that since she had already bought the tickets, it'd just go to waste otherwise.

237
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,900
But I'd rather die than to agree, so I turned around and left.

238
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,100
- It's true!
- Really?

239
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,600
Do you think I'm stupid?

240
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,300
If I went to watch a movie with another woman, wouldn't I know to destroy the evidence?

241
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,800
Would I wait to let you catch me?

242
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,400
That's true.

243
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,500
I'm not going to rehearse today.

244
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,700
Let's go and watch a movie.

245
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,700
Okay.

246
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,300
Then I'd like to watch Loved Letter.

247
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,200
Okay, no problem.

248
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,300
Let's go.

249
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,400
Let's go! Let's go!

250
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,900
Let's go and watch Loved Letter.

251
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,600
What are you doing? Did you fall asleep?

252
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,400
I'm just resting my eyes.

253
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,000
Why are you here? Sit.

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,900
No, I still have something to do for the student union later.

255
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,900
Here's the sign-up sheet for the Sports Meet. Fill it out, okay?

256
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm won't participate in the Sports Meet.

257
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,200
Why aren't you participating?

258
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,700
You run so fast!

259
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,300
Besides, I've already set it all up.

260
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,100
I can't make it right, if you don't attend.

261
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,000
You did the same thing during the singing contest last time.

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Now you're doing it again in the Sports Meet this time.

263
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,700
Why do you make it like a hard sell every time?

264
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
Please? Please?

265
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,200
Just help me consume a spot, okay?

266
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,000
Just fill it out and give it to me when you're back in the dorm.

267
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,600
I still have things to do so I'm leaving first. Bye bye!

268
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,400
Where are you going?

269
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Do you want to go eat breakfast?

270
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,000
Da Huang went to lineup to buy the concert tickets early in the morning.

271
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,400
I'm going to deliver some food to him.

272
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,600
Taotao, did you ask about the movie tickets?

273
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,800
Yes.

274
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
It was me who wrongly accused him.

275
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,800
All right then. As long as it's cleared up.

276
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

277
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Bye.

278
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Be back early.

279
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,200
<i>[Jacky Cheung: 1999 Live Concert]</i>

280
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,900
<i>Tickets! I'll buy your tickets at a higher price.</i>

281
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,300
<i>Tickets wanted! Tickets wanted!</i>

282
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
<i>I'll buy your tickets at a higher price.</i>

283
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,000
<i>I'll buy your tickets at a higher price.</i>

284
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Excuse me. Please let me through. Thank you.

285
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Da Huang!

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Taotao, you finally came.

287
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
You must be hungry.

288
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,400
I bought you some bread.

289
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Make do with it for now.

290
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,200
Eat slowly and drink some water.

291
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,400
Didn't you come here to lineup early in the morning?

292
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Why haven't you gotten it yet?

293
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,500
It'll be soon.

294
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,000
There were so many people already lined up here when I arrived at 8:00 a.m.

295
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
They came here to lineup at night instead of sleeping.

296
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
That's crazy.

297
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Because it's Jacky Cheung.

298
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,800
Are tickets sold out?

299
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
It's sold out.

300
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
We're already sold out.

301
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,400
Why are there none left?

302
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,700
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

303
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,800
We're really all sold out.

304
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,600
- We're all sold out. We're all sold out.
- Stop pushing. Stop pushing.

305
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,800
No, please check. Please check again.

306
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,200
- I've already lined up for half a day.
- We're really sold out.

307
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,300
You guys should go check some place else.

308
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm guessing they'll be all sold out, too.

309
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,900
Please hurry and leave.

310
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,400
Please hurry and leave. We're really all sold out.

311
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,700
Damn!

312
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,200
I didn't get the tickets either this time.

313
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,400
Drink some water first.

314
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,300
It's okay.

315
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,200
If we weren't able to buy a ticket this time, we can wait until next time.

316
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
Next time?

317
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,100
God knows when it will be.

318
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,000
I shouldn't have slept last night.

319
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,200
Do you want it?

320
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes, the ticket for Jacky Cheung's concert.

321
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,900
I bought an extra one. Do you want it or not?

322
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,400
If you want it, I can sell it to you for cheap.

323
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,800
Do you really have an extra ticket for Jacky Cheung's concert?

324
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,000
Sell it to me!

325
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
If you want it, I can just give it to you.

326
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,200
Money will ruin our friendship.

327
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,100
Seriously?

328
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,700
Xu Menglu, you're really my lucky girl.

329
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,900
You're amazing!

330
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,600
Taotao.

331
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,900
Wait, what's wrong?

332
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,800
What's wrong? Why are you angry again?

333
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Do you know that you always putting a long face like this

334
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,000
makes me lose face in front of my friends?

335
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,100
Is that so?

336
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,400
Then I'm really sorry.

337
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
I made you lose face in front of your goddess.

338
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,600
I was just too happy just now.

339
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,200
It's not like a lucky girl is a real goddess.

340
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,100
You're my only goddess.

341
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,600
Huang Jun.

342
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
You want to go to the concert with Xu Menglu.

343
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,100
Although I'm uncomfortable with that,

344
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,400
in order to let you have no regrets, I'll put up with it.

345
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,000
But you agreed just now without even asking me.

346
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,400
Isn't it because you don't have me in your heart?

347
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,500
You've really wronged me if you say it that way.

348
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,300
I was really just too happy earlier.

349
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,000
I said yes because I lost my mind.

350
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,500
I really didn't think too much about it.

351
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,400
What makes you think I'll let you go?

352
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,300
My Taotao is sensible.

353
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,400
How could you bear to let me live the rest of my life with regrets?

354
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,700
Since you're this angry...

355
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,200
Then I won't be going to the concert.

356
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll give the ticket back to her.

357
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,300
Fine.

358
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,900
You've just put so many tall hats on me.
<i>(T/N: Words of praise)</i>

359
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,500
If I still don't agree with it, it'd just make me look mean.

360
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
With that being said, do you agree?

361
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,300
You're so nice.

362
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,400
Go back first.

363
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm leaving.

364
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,800
Bye.

365
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,090
<i>[Greedy Eggs]</i>

366
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,200
You succeeded, Cheng Lang!

367
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,600
You're quite awesome.

368
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,200
We're still learning web design,

369
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,000
but you can already design a small computer game!

370
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,400
How can we go on living?

371
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,500
That's right.

372
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,400
I initially thought that you attended Computer Science Department classes to pursue girls.

373
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,000
I didn't expect you to actually come here to learn.

374
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,900
What nonsense are you talking about?

375
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,400
If the professor hears,

376
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
I can't walk into this classroom tomorrow.

377
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,200
Amazing.

378
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,400
Time for class! It's time for class!

379
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,500
Everyone return to your seats.

380
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,800
They were just joking.

381
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,200
Don't take it to heart.

382
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,000
It's okay.

383
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,000
But they were right about one thing.

384
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,200
You're really amazing.

385
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
It's time for class.

386
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,300
Okay, that's all for today.

387
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,000
Class is over.

388
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,000
Lu Shiyi, stay a minute.

389
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,400
What's going on with you lately?

390
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,600
You're always distracted in class.

391
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,600
Sorry, it won't happen again.

392
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Are you still worrying about your hemophobia?

393
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,400
How did you know, Professor?

394
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,600
How long did you think you could hide it?

395
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,000
Sorry. I didn't mean to keep it from you.

396
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,300
- I just...
- All right.

397
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm not here to question or punish you today.

398
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
You're a rare talent.

399
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,400
It's just that this illness is difficult to treat.

400
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,800
The anatomy class will start next semester.

401
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,000
I hope that you'll think about how you'll walk your future path.

402
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,700
If you don't fully cure your hemophobia,

403
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,100
then perhaps changing majors may be your best option.

404
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,500
What is it? Is something dirty on my face?

405
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,000
I was just thinking if you have a bit more brain cells than the rest of us.

406
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Why are you so smart?

407
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,700
As an auditor, you're better than us, official students, of the class.
<i>(T/N: Someone who attends a class without earning credits.)</i>

408
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
You put lots of pressure on us.

409
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,500
You're over exaggerating.

410
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,600
Not at all.

411
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,600
I heard that you borrowed all kinds of reference books for programming from our class monitor.

412
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,600
This is virtually increasing pressure on us.

413
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,100
What I did was just a small dumb game.

414
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm quite far from those real programming masters.

415
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,700
You're already much better than normal college students.

416
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Since you praised me like that, then I'll return the compliment.

417
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,400
If you come across any problems later on, you can come to me any time.

418
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,790
That's your promise.

419
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,900
Sure.

420
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,000
By the way, Lin You. How are your preparations for the Sports Meet?

421
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,400
I'm going to train at the sports ground later.

422
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,000
Then I'll accompany you during your training.

423
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,800
I thought you'd be against me entering the Sports Meet.

424
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,500
It's good to be participating in the Sports Meet.

425
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,600
Plus, we met each other because we both were in a Sports Meet before.

426
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,000
That's true.

427
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,400
If not for it, I don't know how I would've met you guys.

430
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,000
What are you thinking? You look gloomy.

431
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
Nothing.

432
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,300
You don't look right.

433
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,600
You're in a bad mood, is that it?

434
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
No.

435
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,000
What do you need from me?

436
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,600
Oh, yes. What songs do you like to listen to?

437
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,000
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

438
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Just answer. Don't ask why.

439
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,800
I like listening to some classical music recently.

440
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,600
Classical music? Can you understand?

441
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,200
How's that funny? Huang Jun makes so much noise every day.

442
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,400
I have to listen to some elegant music to make my ears better.

443
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,700
I feel quite nervous whenever I think about this Sports Meet.

444
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,000
Let's go.

445
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
If you're not leaving, then I will.

Huang Chan, I'm going to sign up for the Sports Meet.

Xiaoju.

463
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,100
My girl, why do you suddenly want to sign up for it?

464
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,600
400 meter. It just so happens that no one from our department signed up for it.

465
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,200
Thank you so much!

466
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,500
I did something foolish.

467
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,000
So did I.

468
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,400
What did you do?

469
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,400
Xu Menglu bought two tickets of Jacky Cheung's concert.

470
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,900
I became softhearted and agreed to let Da Huang go to the concert with her.

471
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,900
Just them two?

472
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,200
You're creating a chance for them to flirt.

473

I know.

474
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,400
But Huang really wanted to go to the concert.

475
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,300
He went to lineup for the tickets early in the morning.

476
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,600
He lined up for a long time and he still didn't get them.

477
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,200
I don't want him to miss it because of me even though he had the opportunity to go.

478
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,100
I'm afraid he'd feel upset.

479
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Then why didn't he think that you'd be uncomfortable with it?

480
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Okay, all right. Let's not talk about him.

481
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,600
Anyway, if he dares to fool around with Xu Menglu, I'd the first one to beat him up.

482
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,800
What stupid thing did you do?

483
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
I signed up for the 400 meter race in the Sports Meet.

484
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,800
How is that considered stupid?

485
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,500
Lin You also signed up for it.

486
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,200
I signed up for it because of her.

487
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,200
That day,

488
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,900
when Chang Lang helped me block the thermo,

489
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,200
I couldn't stop crying.

490
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,800
I clearly caused him to get injured, yet he still comforted me.

491
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,700
Why is he so nice?

492
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,600
Why must he be so kind to me?

493
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,800
That's why I couldn't get him out of my head.

494
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,800
So you entered the race

495
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,800
because you wanted to win against Lin You?

496
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,400
Is it very stupid?

497
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,000
It's not stupid at all.

498
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,800
I support you. You must win.

499
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,900
I'll try my best.

500
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,700
Try your best.

You're back. It's the women's 400 meter race in a bit.

503
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,000
Let's go and cheer for Xia Xiaoju.

504
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Xia Xiaoju also signed up for the 400 meter.

505
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
You... You didn't know?

506
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,500
- Come on, let's go. Let's go together.
- I'm not going.

507
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,100
I'm leaving then.

508
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,400
Whose cassette tape is this?

509
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,000
Xia Xiaoju delivered it to you early this morning.

510
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,200
She said you needed it urgently.

511
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,000
- Xia Xiaoju?
- Yes.

512
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,800

I just met your professor downstairs.

00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,000

Hurry up. They were calling you.

534
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,400
- I didn't hear him.
- Yes.

535

Remember your lanes.

536
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,300
Xiaoju?

537
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,600
Did you also sign up for the 400 meter?

538
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,700
Yes, that's right. She's also participating in it.

539
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,600
I was thinking if I could come in first place.

540
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,200
Now it seems like there's not much hope.

541
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,500
Why didn't you tell me?

542
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,100
I dragged her into it. She initially didn't want to participate in it.

543
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,600
Why are you distracted?

544
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,400
Did you hear what the judge just said?

545
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,900
You're in the fourth lane.

546
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,200
- Don't forget.
- Okay.

I still have things to do. Good luck!

I'm in the fifth lane.

549
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Do you think I can win second place if I run next to you?

550
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,000
I haven't trained much lately.

Cheng Lang, did you know that Xiaoju is also running the 400 meter race?

555
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,900
It looks like there's no hope for me to win first place.

556
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,800
I don't know if I can win second place.

557
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,600
I was thinking of winning first place.

- What are you doing?
- Don't cry later when you lose.

Can't you say something good?

560
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,200
I'm saying something good.

I'll take you out to have fun later, okay?

575
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,300
Xiaoju hasn't run yet.

576
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,500
Let's wait until after she finishes the race, okay?

577
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,400
You'd rather see Xiaoju run than go out to have fun with me?

578
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,100
I really doubt my place in your heart.

but when it comes to you, it's the opposite?

Huang Jun, are you still playing?

585
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,200
Go outside, if you want to get intimate.

586
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,000
You.

587
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,400
Sorry. I'm taking Huang Jun away.

588
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,700
Xu Menglu, help me continue.

589
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,400
Come on, let's go.
