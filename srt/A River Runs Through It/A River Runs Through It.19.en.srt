3
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,909
Xia Xiaoju, who did you like in the past?

4
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,940
You...

5
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,700
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

6
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,960
Do you still like him?

7
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,479
Things will eventually pass.

8
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,430
We... should be looking forward, right?

9
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,509
Don't mention it anymore.

10
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay, no problem.

11
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,800
Here, catch it, okay?

12
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,870
It's okay. Keep it up!

13
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,500
Watch me.

14
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,420
Okay, you try it.

15
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,500
Like this.

16
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,010
Look! I'm better than you!

17
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,290
Take a look. How is it?

18
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,029
Not bad, right?

19
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:31,310
Speakers and drums.

20
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,420
Who bought them?

21
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,899
Thanks to me, our school bought them specially for our Ultimate Band.

22
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:38,439
Not bad!

23
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,750
This place... is where our Ultimate Band's dream begins.

24
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,900
Let's do it!

25
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,200
Your paycheck this month.

26
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,359
Manager, it's not correct.

27
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,440
You've just advanced my paycheck.

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,390
Me and my bad memories! I gave you the wrong amount.

29
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,410
It's for Lu Shiyi. I gave you the wrong amount.

30
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:25,000
What? For Lu Shiyi?

31
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,740
Me and my big mouth.

32
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,469
That Lu Shiyi asked me many times not to tell you, but I still spilled the beans.

33
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,999
What's the matter?

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,389
Why are you being so mysterious?

35
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,389
Do you want to know?

36
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,530
Tell me.

37
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,059
One day, Lu Shiyi came to me and gave me 300 yuan.

38
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:47,419
<i>Boss, give this 300 yuan to Xia Xiaoju later as her advancement this month.</i>

39
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:49,270
<i>She really needs this money right now. </i>

40
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,760
<i>Besides, as a girl, it's hard for her to make a living.</i>

41
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:53,480
<i>What do you mean?</i>

42
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,319
<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

43
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,140
<i>You like her, right?</i>

44
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,470
<i>Just take it first.</i>

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,420
<i>Fine, I'll help you.</i>

46
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,119
<i>By the way, remember to return my money when you give her the paycheck at the end of this month.</i>

47
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,570
<i>You mustn't expose it!</i>

48
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,900
<i>Exposing it is a good thing!</i>

49
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,800
<i>I can see that you're a good guy.</i>

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,659
<i>How about I tell her on purpose?</i>

51
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,719
<i>If Xia Xiaoju knows you help her a lot in secret,</i>

52
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,239
<i>maybe she'll be touched and promise herself to you!</i>

53
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:27,690
<i>She won't.</i>

54
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,100
<i>You mustn't tell her. I don't want to give her any burden.</i>

55
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,000
<i>No problem.</i>

56
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,910
You scared me to death!

57
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,099
Why are you here?

58
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:53,669
I was going to look for you.

59
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,380
What for?

60
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,200
I had an extra 300 yuan for last month's food expenses

61
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,950
Datu, thank you.

62
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,299
Since when did you start becoming grateful? It's not your style.

63
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,290
When... When am I not grateful?

64
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,829
This is more like it. This fierce look is more like you.

65
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,250
You spoiled such a great atmosphere.

66
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,130
I was just thinking of how to thank you.

67
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,100
How about I do not hand in the red envelope money to my mom this year?

68
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,960
How about I buy you the whole set of Jin Yong's novels?
<i>(T/N: One of the most renowned wuxia novelists.)</i>

69
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,950
If you really want to thank me,

70
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,140
then be at my beck and call from now on. How about that?

71
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,949
Instead of the whole set of novels, you're exchanging it for me to become your servant?

72
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,170
You're really good at calculating!

73
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,350
What's wrong with you?

74
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,659
Is there a need to calculate everything so clearly between us?

75
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:15,719
If that's the case, then when

76
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,109
Auntie told you to bring me nice food before, how do we calculate that?

77
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,999
Fine. Then come home with me this weekend.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,789
I'll have my mom cook you some good food, okay?

79
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,060
Okay.

80
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,509
Okay. Help pass them to me.

81
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,580
- I'll rearrange them up there.
- Okay.

82
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,480
- This one?
- Yes.

83
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,270
Shiyi!

84
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,619
My goodness! Why are you bleeding so much?

85
00:06:57,619 --> 00:06:58,690
I'm fine. I'm fine.

86
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,830
How did you get cut?

87
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,820
What should I do, Shiyi? Are you all right?

88
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,220
Shiyi? Shiyi! Does it hurt, Shiyi?

89
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,809
Wait for me. I'll go get some bandaids.

90
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:13,380
Wait for me!

91
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,500
Shiyi! Shiyi!

92
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,120
<i>[Outpatient]</i>
<i>[Jiangzhou Hospital]</i>

93
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,059
Don't let the wound touch water.

94
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:36,949
Come and change the dressing every other day.

95
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,099
Doctor, we don't know why he suddenly fainted.

96
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,479
Does he need to do other examinations?

97
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,399
Did he faint? Does he have low blood sugar?

98
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,500
I don't know.

99
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,540
There are many reasons for suddenly fainting.

100
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,819
I suggest that he get a thorough examination first to find the reason.

101
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,569
Okay, okay. What kind of examination does he need?

102
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,219
I'm not a porcelain doll.

103
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:03,809
With you being this careful, others might think I have some terminal disease.

104
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:05,109
Hurry and knock on wood!

105
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,549
Knock on wood! Knock on wood!

106
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,380
What nonsense are you saying?

107
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,030
How could you curse yourself?

108
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,070
I just think you're overreacting.

109
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,729
Actually, I don't have to take a blood test.

110
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,479
Let's go back now. Let's go.

111
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,250
Come back!

112
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,779
Let me tell you. Getting examined can put your heart at ease.

113
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,389
I didn't say I won't get a check up.

114
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,549
Can I go and get a check up alone?

115
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,479
- No.
- You can go back first.

116
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,510
- No.
- I won't run away!

117
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,759
- Lu Shiyi?
- Are we going or not?

118
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,000
Xia Xiaoju?

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,339
Senior Shen, why are you here?

120
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,620
I'm an intern in the Psychology Department.

121
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,899
What has happened to his hand?

122
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:40,799
It's nothing.

123
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,879
His arm was scratched by a hook.

124
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,589
Then he fainted just now so the doctor said he should get further examined.

125
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:50,099
It's nothing. She's just overreacting.

126
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:52,989
Fainting is a serious matter. You need to get examined!

127
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:54,869
See? Even Senior Shen said that.

128
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:58,220
Yes, yes. Everything you said was right, okay?

129
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,759
How about this? Since we bumped into Senior Shen, let her accompany me to take the blood test.

130
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,420
And you hurry back to the convenience store right now.

131
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,689
Otherwise, your boss will really fire you. What will you do then?

132
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:08,220
Senior Shen is working.

133
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,180
Xiaoju, you can go back to work.

134
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,939
I'm not busy today. I'll take him there.

135
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:17,179
Don't worry. Senior Shen is here. How can I run away?

136
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:19,420
I'll definitely be obedient and get examined.

137
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,349
Really?

138
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,500
Yes. Go.

139
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,059
Then... Then I'm leaving first.

140
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,589
Senior, sorry for bothering you.

141
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:29,010
It's all right.

142
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,959
Wait. Put on the coat. It's too cold outside.

143
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,299
Hurry and put it back on.

144
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,130
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

145
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,640
Bye.

146
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,199
Be careful on the way.

147
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,610
- Okay, got it!
- Bye bye.

148
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,670
I can see you care about Xia Xiaoju quite a lot.

149
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,019
You're afraid of her losing her job, but why are you not afraid of bothering me?

150
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,400
Didn't you just say so yourself that you have nothing else to do later?

151
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,710
But it doesn't matter.

152
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,030
I can also do the check up on my own.

153
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,029
If you're busy, go on with your work.

154
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,909
I was just kidding.

155
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:07,059
As long as it is your business, I'll always have the time.

156
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:08,950
Come on, let's go.

157
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,550
I've promised Xia Xiaoju to take care of you.

158
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,450
If you don't want me to take care of you,

159
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,900
I'll ask Xia Xiaoju to return right now.

160
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,370
She shouldn't have gone too far.

161
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,250
Slow down.

162
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,200
Shiyi.

163
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,059
Shiyi!

164
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,550
Shiyi, what's wrong?

165
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,739
<i>Shiyi. Shiyi.</i>

166
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,669
<i>Shiyi, what's wrong?</i>

167
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,450
Shiyi.

168
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,240
What's wrong with him?

169
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,279
Why did you buy another guitar?

170
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,909
Don't you already have one?

171
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,739
The band doesn't have much money left.

172
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:25,839
The funds were raised by everyone.

173
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,079
Big Huang, be more frugal

174
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,789
or else there will be nothing left.

175
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,540
I know.

176
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,560
This guitar is too awesome!

177
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,330
The strings are also light. It's especially suitable for girls.

178
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,669
Why did you spend such money?

179
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,240
I can't play the guitar.

180
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,049
It's not for you. It's for Xu Menglu.

181
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,349
How is it?

182
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,279
Is this color beautiful?

183
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,030
Yes.

184
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,349
Doesn't she already have a guitar?

185
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,279
The one she has is an acoustic guitar.

186
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,549
We're a rock band.

187
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,839
Besides, she's the face of our band.

188
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,760
Her appearance is very important.

189
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,839
Xu Menglu! The guitar!

190
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,030
Huang Jun.

191
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,349
Is it beautiful?

192
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,349
You really bought a pink guitar?

193
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,959
Of course!

194
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,780
When do I not keep my promises?

195
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,370
Hurry and give it a try.

196
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,300
I just tuned it.

197
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,439
I love you so much!

198
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,870
How is it? Do you like it?

199
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,229
Don't misunderstand.

200
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,350
It's not that kind of love.

201
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,629
Hurry, hurry! Play that... Play that song!

202
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,210
It's distorted. Just strum it directly.

203
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,249
Huang Jun, I still have classes. I'm leaving first.

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,969
<i>Okay everyone. We'll end today's class here.</i>

211
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,260
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

212
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,740
No.

213
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,930
Did Huang Jun make you angry?

214
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,490
He bought Xu Menglu a guitar, and it's even a pink one.

215
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,930
Just now, they talked about music.

216
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,040
I felt that I was an outsider.

217
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,959
Especially that Xu Menglu.

218
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,730
She actually said "I love you" to Huang Jun right in front of me.

219
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,199
So you're saying that little lead singer is interested in Huang Jun?

220
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,029
Perhaps you're overthinking it.

221
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,319
No way!

222
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,669
A woman's intuition is very accurate.

223
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,340
There's definitely something wrong with her.

224
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,980
Then how about Huang Jun? Is he interested in that little lead singer?

225
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,540
I don't know.

226
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,010
I'm very confused right now.

227
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,099
How about this? Go and talk it out with Huang Jun.

228
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:35,459
You need to get him to understand that he already has a girlfriend

229
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,510
so he should keep an appropriate distance from other girls.

230
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,780
It'll be all right.

231
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,930
I'll talk to him.

232
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,300
How about you?

233
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,610
How are you with Cheng Lang?

234
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,209
What else can there be?

235
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:00,709
Just... continue to be penpals.

236
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,639
You hiding your identity like this,

237
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,959
no matter how touched he is, he won't know it's you.

238
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,250
I just hope he can be happy.

239
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,029
I really lost to you.

240
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,639
Love needs to be fought for by yourself.

241
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,250
Didn't you know?

242
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,190
Oh, by the way.

243
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,589
I still need to go see Datu.

244
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,400
Could you take my bag back to our dorm?

245
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,249
- I'm leaving!
- No, wait!

246
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:37,469
Where are you going?

247
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,840
What's wrong with Shiyi?

248
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,349
Nothing. I'll tell you later when I come back.

249
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:43,130
I'm leaving now. Bye bye!

250
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,229
What's the result of the examination this morning?

251
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,710
Nothing is wrong, right?

252
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,140
There's really nothing wrong?

253
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,909
I'm fine. Look at me.

254
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,549
I'm as strong as a bull right now.

255
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,989
This small injury is nothing. It doesn't hurt at all.

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,510
It was more painful when you used firecrackers to blow up my bottom last time.

257
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,029
Then the doctor didn't say

258
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,839
- when you scraped your arm...
- It hurts!

259
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,689
- Be gentle!
- Okay, I'll be more gentle.

260
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:42,139
The doctor didn't say why you fainted when you scraped your arm?

261
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,300
He...

262
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,639
He said I had low blood sugar.

263
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,930
You didn't have breakfast, again?

264
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,640
I'm too lazy to buy it.

265
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,319
Too lazy to buy it?

266
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,079
Do you know how important breakfast is to a person?

267
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,420
And yet you're someone who will become a doctor!

268
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,850
You always make me worried.

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,069
These are the bread and biscuits that I bought for you.

270
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,519
Leave them in your dorm.

271
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,619
When you're too lazy to buy food, at least eat a bit.

272
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,109
Once you finish them, just tell me.

273
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,200
I work at the convenience store so the boss will give me a staff discount.

274
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,679
What's wrong with you?

275
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,829
A-Are you feeling dizzy again?

276
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,510
Don't move.

277
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,420
I'm very tired.

278
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,090
Let me hug you for a while.

279
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,830
Just for a while.

280
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,380
Are you too tired these days?

281
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,489
Listen to me.

282
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,999
Don't come to the convenience store to help me during this time.

283
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,589
You have a lot of schoolwork and you're also training with the basketball team.

284
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,730
Your body can't handle it.

285
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,180
Did you hear me?

286
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,940
Got it.

287
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,879
Okay, okay. Our Datu has worked hard during this time.

288
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,059

With your support, it'll be hard for our band to not become popular.

309
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:41,039
You're our band's soul.

310
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,639
You know how to highlight my strengths.

311
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,829
No. You're really too modest.

312
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,370
Huang Jun.

313
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,630
Time for breakfast.

314
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,820
Yes, right.

315
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,759
Like this. Adjust it like we did just now.

316
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,360
It's amazing.

317
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,970
Thanks, Taotao.

318
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,710
Yummy.

319
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,139
You guys continue eating.

320
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,460
I'm leaving.

321
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,380
Why not eat together?

322
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,559
No, thanks.

323
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,779
It's all right. Let's eat together.

324
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,340
Sit down.

325
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,730
Hurry up.

326
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,189
Thank you then.

327
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,400
You're welcome. Here.

328
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,420
Chopsticks.

329
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,290
- I've used them.
- It's okay.

330
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,879
Da Huang.

331
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,519
Did you forget that you promised me yesterday to eat breakfast with me?

332
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,639
I haven't eaten yet either.

333
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,599
But I just bought two sets. I didn't buy any for others.

334
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,760
You can have mine.

335
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,040
We can share one set.

336
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,399
Come on.

337
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,840
Take it.

338
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,660
If you want to eat, then buy your own!

339
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,260
Le Tao!

340
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,519
Mind your words later.

341
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,310
Don't make her angry.

342
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,469
Cheng Lang. Huang Jun.

343
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,190
Over here! Over here!

344
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,039
Over here! Over here!

345
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,499
If you guys fought, then you guys should talk things through.

346
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:35,550
Having a cold war is bad.

347
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,610
I don't want to talk to him.

348
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,759
Taotao.

349
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,309
Why didn't you tell me you came to the library?

350
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,970
Who are you?

351
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,459
I know

352
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:56,159
that forgetting to have breakfast with you is my fault.

353
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,350
But you can't pretend you don't know me.

354
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,040
Your words make me feel wronged.

355
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,940
You're the soul of the band.

356
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,840
Leave your sweet words to your little lead singer.

357
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,350
I'm sleepy. I'm going back to the dorm to sleep.

358
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,280
Taotao! Taotao!

359
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,430
Go after her!

360
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,369
If I chase her, I'll just be adding oil to the fire.
<i>(T/N: Make it worse.)</i>

361
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,370
Sit down.

362
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,229
Don't blame me for not warning you.

363
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,939
Taotao is really mad this time.

364
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:30,759
Not the type where you can just say a few sweet words to make her happy.

365
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,189
Since you have a girlfriend,

366
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,919
why are you still messing with other girls?

367
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,760
Do you know what being faithful is?

368
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,559
How can you say that? Lower your voice!

369
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,679
What do you mean messing around?

370
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,559
You're talking as if I'm a lewd demon.

371
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,189
There's nothing between me and Xu Menglu.

372
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,440
Taotao is just too jealous.

373
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,579
Stop writing. Say something reasonable for me.

374
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:50,179
All I know is that Le Tao is not the type of girl who makes trouble for no reason.

375
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:51,589
See?

376
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:53,759
Don't be ignorant of your blessings.

377
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,399
If she's so angry that she breaks up with you,

378
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,639
let's see who you can cry to.

379
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,759
I... Let me tell you.

380
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,159
You guys better not irritate me.

381
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,150
Taotao loves me.

382
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,400
She won't break up with me.

383
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,590
What's this?

384
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,720
- Shiyi. Here.
- Shiyi.

385
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,510
Lu Shiyi, take a seat.

386
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,400
- Shen Duo?
- Senior Shen?

387
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,519
Take these books and study them.

388
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,310
I think they can help you.

389
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,039
Thank you, Senior Shen.

390
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,880
One important thing.

391
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,879
Will you tell your situation

392
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,690
to your family and friends?

393
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,110
I've never felt dizzy because of blood before.

394
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,129
Why would I have hemophobia?

395
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:48,879
Hemophobia

396
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,309
in essence is a type of mental illness

397
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,410
which belongs to a kind of phobia.

398
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,639
However, if you keep concealing it,

399
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,590
I mean, if something wrong happens,

400
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,179
I won't know how to tell them.

401
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:06,519
Later when everyone's not as busy, I'll find a time to tell them.

402
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,999
By the way, there's a specialist in the hospital where I intern at,

403
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,759
but he's been doing academic exchanges abroad these days.

404
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,039
After he returns,

405
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,679
I'll introduce you to him.

406
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,519
The most important thing for you right now

407
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,229
is to relax.

408
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,399
Bear in mind that

409
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,640
being nervous is not good for your illness.

410
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,359
So how is it? Back to the subject.

411
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,560
I have something serious to tell you.

412
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,129
I'll sit over there and tell you.

413
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:38,550
Okay.

414
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,699
What's going on between them?

415
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:57,590
When did Shiyi become so close to Senior Shen Duo?

416
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,309
Senior Shen Duo has coveted Lu Shiyi for a long time.

417
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,160
Everybody knows that.

418
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,919
But is Lu Shiyi also interested?

419
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:08,519
What?

420
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,759
Are you saying that Datu is interested in Senior Shen?

421
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,040
I didn't say that.

422
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,759
What I'm saying is, if they're not interested in each other,

423
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,709
would they have a date privately?

424
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,560
No way.

425
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,550
Right?

426
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,939
If you say that Datu likes Cheng Lang, that I'll believe.

427
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,009
But liking Senior Shen...

428
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:26,309
What does this have to do with me?

429
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,760
Don't say it too definitively.

430
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,679
Didn't you also say that you've never seen Lu Shiyi

431
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,309
be alone with other girls before, right?

432
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:37,999
Besides, Senior Shen Duo is the campus belle of the Department of Medicine.

433
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,109
Even if he's stubborn,

434
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:42,760
he knows how to appreciate beauty.

435
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:51,729
I heard that the last time Shiyi was sick and went to the hospital, Senior Shen Duo took good care of him and was very gentle.

436
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:53,540
Really?

437
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,120
I think... it'll be soon.

438
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,970
It'll be soon?
<i>(T/N: For them to become a couple.)</i>

439
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,110
I see.

440
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,230
<i>[Male Dormitory Building No. 29]</i>

441
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,209
What are you doing? Acting so stealthily.

442
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:47,500
If you're my bro, then do me a favor.

443
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,460
What's the matter?

444
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,459
I quarreled with Le Tao.

445
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:55,069
She won't forgive me no matter how I coax her.

446
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,250
You... Help me.

447
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,399
You made your girlfriend angry.

448
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,709
What does that have to do with me?

449
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,709
You...

450
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,470
Is this how you treat me as your brother?

451
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,919
To think that I didn't forget to plan for you even when I quarreled with my girlfriend.

452
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,710
What do you mean?

453
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,730
I even tested Xia Xiaoju when we were in the library.

454
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,749
I said that you might like Senior Shen Duo more.

455
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:23,090
What did you say?

456
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,329
I... I imitated your handwriting

457
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:26,799
and wrote a letter to Cheng Lang.

458
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,209
I asked him to meet Friday evening at 6:00 p.m.

459
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:32,519
So when I asked you to help me mail the letter, you actually switched it?

460
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,230
No.

461
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,860
I-I didn't read it.

462
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,729
How could you do that?

463
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,919
Her expression changed right away.

464
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,239
She was most likely jealous.

465
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,799
You're with her every day, but she doesn't notice your merits.

466
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,759
You just need to make her realize

467
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,249
that you actually have many girls around you. She'll definitely become anxious.

468
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:56,829
It's playing cat and mouse.

469
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,679
You think I don't know how to play cat and mouse?

470
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,139
I'm telling you now, Huang Jun. I'll rip off that lousy mouth of yours one day!

471
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:04,370
Let's see how you can keep running your mouth!

472
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,660
With you being like this, you won't win her over even if I give you many years.

473
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,879
Shut up! I can see that you're itching for a beating again.

474
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,190
No.

475
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,300
What is this? So bloody!

476
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,369
I already told you I don't want Cheng Lang to know that Mango Pudding is me!

477
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:25,089
You... You doing this will make the both of us feel awkward when we see each other in the future!

478
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:28,429
But you have to take that first step to let Cheng Lang know you like him.

479
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:30,469
I just want to help you.

480
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,869
But not in this way!

481
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:35,180
I must hurry and get the letter back.

482
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,720
He must have already received the letter.

483
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,489
Xiaoju, don't be angry.

484
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:43,069
I just want to help you.

485
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,249
You're killing me!

486
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:48,060
I didn't, Xiaoju.

487
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,080
Xiaoju, just in time. I was looking for you.

488
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,460
- No, no. I'm in a hurry.

I also have something urgent to do with you. Come on.

Nothing serious? Then why did you drag me here?

I'm really in a hurry!

498
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,320
Well... In the library,

499
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,999
Shen Duo had something to tell me

500
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:23,329
so I didn't sit with you. Are you angry?

501
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,709
You really misunderstood me.

502
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,559
I only formed a band with Xu Menglu.

503
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,039
It's just normal socializing between us.

504
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,469
- Normal socializing?
- Yes.

505
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,510
You even bought her a guitar and practiced songs alone together.

506

You guys were giving each other flirtatious glances. You're telling me this is normal?

What kind of abnormal do you want?

508
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,459
Holding hands, kissing, and hugging?

509
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:38,830
Okay, fine. I understand.

510
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,140
I'm not angry. I'm not angry, okay?

511
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,179
I'm really in a hurry. I have to go.

512
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,759
Wait. What is so urgent?

513
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,799
How about I help you?

514

- You!

This matter... Even if I tell you, I can't explain it clearly.

519

No. I major in medicine.

I have a rehearsal tomorrow. Do you want to come and watch?

651
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,000
No.

652
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,300
Okay.

653
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,200
Anyway, A'Wen and Xiao Wei asked for a leave.

654
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,800
I'll just quietly rehearse with Xu Menglu.

655
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,600
Xiaoju, does wearing that really work?

656
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,800
Can it be cured?

657
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,000
Yes. The books that I've read said

658
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,200
that having more contact and overcoming the fear

659
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,600
is the most direct way to cure it.

660
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,900
Right?

661
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,200
Then he must see real blood!

662
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,500
You...

663
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,100
Even Taotao consider it ugly.

664
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,900
This is too ugly!

665
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,100
See real blood?

666
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,400
Turn around. Hurry!

667
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Don't you want to be a doctor?

668
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,700
Look.

669
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,000
Guess who I am.

670
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,100
You came?

671
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
What's the matter?

672
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,000
I haven't played the piano with you in a long time.

673
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,400
Could you play a tune with me?

674
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Then if I make a mistake, don't be angry at me.

675
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,400
What's wrong?

676
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,300
My tutor recommended me to study in Europe.

677
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,800
You... agreed?

678
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,300
When will you leave?

679
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,800
When the visa is available.

680
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,800
Have you already applied for a visa?

681
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Why didn't you tell me?

682
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,700
I've always supported you in pursuing your dream.

683
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,600
I also know you'll study abroad sooner or later.

684
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:35,600
But why didn't you... Why didn't you tell me in advance?

685
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,900
I'm your girlfriend.

686
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,100
You should have discussed it with me.

687
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
♫ <i>There you are, running wildly through the highlands</i> ♫

688
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,700
♫ <i>Another you is sighing silently</i> ♫

689
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,800

690

♫ <i>I'm glad you're not willing to give up like this</i> ♫

692
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,700
♫ <i>It hurts to see the stubbornness in your eyes</i> ♫

693
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:51,200
♫ <i>I'm a bit tired and need to rest</i> ♫

694
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:58,400
♫ <i>The marks we leave in life</i> ♫

695
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:06,000
♫ <i>How I wish to travel everywhere with you</i> ♫

696

700
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:58,400
