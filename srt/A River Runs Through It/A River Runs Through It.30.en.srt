so I asked Cheng Lang to help delete the post for me.

165
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,740
Let me summarize the key points for you now.

166
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,789
First, I wasn't the one who made the post.

167
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:14,180
Second, I didn't intend to let everyone know

168
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,710
we are a pretend couple, so you would be put in a hard place.

169
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:19,400
Third, I didn't disrespect your thoughts.

170
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,850
I just want to give both of us a chance,

171
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,110
but if you refuse to accept...

172
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,530
Okay.

173
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,190
I'll give up.

174
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,730
Sorry.

175
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,910
I'm sorry. I wronged you.

176
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,680
I'm sorry. I did wrong you.

177
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,330
Don't...

178
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:35,240
♫ <i>Warm just like a sunny day</i> ♫

179
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,709
♫ <i>I greatly want to let time stop</i> ♫

180
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:40,280
I'm not as good as Cheng Lang,

181
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,569
♫ <i>I discover only at this moment</i> ♫

182
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:45,139
but I'm also not that bad.

183
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:50,880
♫ <i>Those two worlds are walking farther away</i> ♫

184
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,499
♫ <i>The only thing left is my longing</i> ♫

185
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:57,039
♫ <i>Who also once yearned to exchange using the souls?</i> ♫

186
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,510
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,110
I shouldn't have been so impulsive.

188
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,860
♫ <i>Carrying the bags to wander about in the opposite direction</i> ♫

189
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,980
What's the use in saying sorry to me?

190
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,989
I was so angry that I couldn't sleep last night.

191
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:12,249
How are you going to make it up for me?

192
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,230
What do you want?

193
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,710
I'm afraid what I say you won't agree to.

194
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,319
As long as you don't make an outrageous request, I'll agree.

195
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,120
Really?

196
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,340
Really!

197
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,390
♫ <i>I go off wandering with a facade of happiness</i> ♫

198
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,810
Go on a date with me.

199
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,949
♫ <i>The snow outside the window accompanies my thoughts</i> ♫

200
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,179
I fell into your trap again.

201
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:42,240
Xia Xiaoju, don't go back on your word!

202
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,700
Class is finally over!

203
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,100
Bye bye!

204
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,300
Look at how happy you are!

205
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,670
What shall we eat for lunch today?

206
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,660
<i>[Datu]</i>

207
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,770
Is Shiyi reminding you again about the date?

208
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,820
He reminds me over 800 times a day.

209
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,779
I think Shiyi is quite a nice person.

210
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:20,229
Maybe after several dates,

211
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,550
you'll find something different about him.

212
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,589
It's so embarrassing for me to go on a date with him. I'm thinking...

213
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,899
Don't worry. You definitely won't be embarrassed on our date.

214
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,180
Have you been following us all this way?

215
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,060
I told you many times

216
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,279
not to think this poorly of me.

217
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,110
Do I really look like a pervert?

218
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,179
Look, it's currently 12:00 p.m.

219
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,739
Who isn't going to eat at the canteen? Right?

220
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:48,340
I just happened to run into you two as I was headed to the canteen,

221
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,570
but since we happened to meet,

222
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,160
I'll treat you two to lunch.

223
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,260
Let's go.

224
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,660
- Let's go.
- No, I'm not going.

225
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,009
Let's go.

226
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,110
Taotao, you...

227
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,680
Taotao, why didn't you tell me you were going out to eat?

228
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,639
He just told me he was waiting for me online,

229
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,660
so I've to head back to the dorms.

230
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,690
No wonder you seem strange recently.

231
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,029
You often send messages secretly and giggle alone.

232
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:18,759
Say it! Who is that guy?

233
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,029
When will you introduce him to us?

234
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,730
It's a secret!

235
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,059
I'm leaving. Enjoy your lunch, bye bye!

236
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,650
Don't stand here.

237
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,339
Let's go eat.

238
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,840
Let's go.

239
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,150
- Let's eat quickly and go.
- Okay.

240
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,010
Shiyi, Xiaoju, here!

241
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,510
Let's go.

242
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,910
Here, Lin You, eat some more.

243
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,450
I can't eat any more. I've gained a lot of weight.

244
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,489
Fat? Who said so? You aren't fat at all.

245
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:03,950
You're too skinny. Eat some more.

246
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,110
Really?

247
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,720
All right.

248
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,680
Xiaoju, you aren't fat as well.

249
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Eat some more.

250
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,390
Take a bite.

251
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,860
Eat it.

252
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,680
Good girl.

253
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,170
By the way, Xiaoju, when are you planning to have our date?

254
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,220
I know. Can't you stop pushing me about it?

255
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,500
Where are you guys going on a date?

256
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,910
I haven't decided yet.

257
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,600
We haven't been on a date for a long time either.

258
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,060
Do you want to go? I'm free tonight.

259
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,739
- Where do you want to go?
- What about the night fair?

260
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,180
I heard it has been quite lively down there the past few days.

261
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,441
Okay.

262
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,561
Xiaoju, want to go together?

263
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,019
I am planning to go with Xiaoju ourselves.

264
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:18,519
No problem.

265
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,490
Let's go together.

266
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,430
What? I didn't agree.

267
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,039
I promised to go on a date with you,

268
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,639
but I didn't promise to go on a date with you alone.

269
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,589
- You!
- Are you going?

270
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,290
Forget it.

271
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,259
Go. Why not? Let's go!

272
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,740
Darling, take a bite.

273
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,160
Good boy.

274
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,100
Xiaoju, the night fair was so much fun.

275
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,200
Let's go together next time.

276
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Okay.

277
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Lin You, do you think because I don't take pictures often,

278
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,600
I look a bit silly in some of these pictures?

279
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Not at all, I think you're quite cute.

280
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,800
Really? You are quite cute.

281
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,100
What are you doing?

282
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,800
If you don't go with me,

283
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,000
you'll interrupt Cheng Lang and Lin You.

284
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,400
Let's not be the third wheel.

285
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
Let's go.

286
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,200
Why must you...

287
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Choose a picture.

288
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,700
This one.

289
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,800
You have to take good care of it.

290
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,200
If any girl confesses to you in the future,

291
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,400
just show this photo to them.

292
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,000
I will definitely take good care of it.

293
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
I didn't expect you would like that.

294
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,000
No, I don't.

295
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Who asked you to buy it for me?

296
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,400
So why did you stare at it for so long?

297
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,000
It's pretty cute.

298
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
<i>Do you like it?</i>

299
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
<i>If you like it, I'll give it to you.</i>

300
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,600
Just pick one, only one.

301
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay, this way.

302
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,600
Shiyi, thank you.

303
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,200
Actually, I don't really like...

304
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,700
- I...
- If a girl says she doesn't like something, it means she likes it.

305
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,800
Can't you be honest with me?

306
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,200
Besides,

307
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,200
isn't it natural to give my girlfriend gifts on a date?

308
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,300
Can't you stop mentioning the word "girlfriend?"

309
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,400
Besides, we're not a real couple.

310
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
You can say it louder.

311
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,800
Xiaoju, walk a bit faster.

312
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,100
We're coming. Let's go!

313
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,900
<i>[Building 25, Girls' Dormitory]</i>

314
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,400
Xiaoju, did Shiyi buy that for you?

315
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,000
What's wrong?

316
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,600
Why are you not happy after going out to have fun?

317
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,500
Did you fight with him again?

318
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,800
Do you remember the nickname I made for Cheng Lang in the past?

319
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Cheng Lang...

320
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
<i>Does Cheng Lang like this?</i>

321
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,180
<i>Silly dog.</i>

322
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,300
<i>It's Da Bai, not a silly dog.</i>

323
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,400
I remember. It's Da Bai. It looks exactly like that.

324
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,600
What's wrong?

325
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,800
I feel it was such a long time ago.

326
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,000
Yes, it really was a long time ago.

327
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,800
But people have to look forward.

328
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,200
No one has to be with someone.

329
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,000
Xiaoju, you're the same.

330
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,100
You have to try accepting other people.

331
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,000
- I think Shiyi...
- I know I should try accepting other people.

332
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,400
I can for anyone, but not Datu.

333
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,700
Why not?

334
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
He is my best friend.

335
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,000
When he bought this dog for me today,

336
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,400
as I held it in my arms,

337
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
I didn't know what I was doing.

338
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,800
You feel guilty.

339
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,700
Do you feel uncomfortable?

340
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,700
I feel guilt towards all three of them.

341
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,800
They're all my best friends,

342
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,500
but I took advantage of Datu

343
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,200
to deceive Cheng Lang and Lin You.

344
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,400
I...

345
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,800
Anyway, I can't continue pretending to be a couple with Datu.

346
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,600
Do you think I'll act out a breakup with you

347
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,000
in front of Lin You?

348
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,100
Just help with this one time. Okay?

349
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,600
No.

350
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm begging you.

351
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,200
I feel like I'm a liar recently.

352
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
And I'm lying to my best friends.

353
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,900
I really can't continue acting anymore.

354
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,800
Let's make it real then.

355
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,500
Then you won't feel like you're lying to them.

356
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,400
Lu Shiyi, I'm seriously discussing this with you.

357
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,300
I'm serious, too.

358
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Suit yourself!

359
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Anyway, I am going to explain it to Lin You.

360
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,800
Okay, I'll go with you to tell Lin You

361
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,200
CL is Cheng Lang.

362
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,400
Okay! I'll go now!

363
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,000
Go on. Why did you stop?

364
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
The computer room is right there.

365
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,800
You rascal!

366
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,100
Go ahead and yell at me. I'm a rascal in this aspect.

367
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
Why are you leaving?

368
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
Don't walk so quickly!

369
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,400
I still have something to say to you.

370
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,600
What do you think of my performance on the date yesterday?

371
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,300
Just so-so.

372
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,800
Not romantic at all, but very annoying.

373
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,000
So what kind of romance do you want?

374
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,900
Other couples go to the cinema for dates,

375
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,400
but we, as a couple, have not.

376
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Why don't you go to the cinema with me today?

377
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,600
Do you really think I would go with you?

378
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,130
Yes.

379
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,800
In your dreams!

380
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
If you don't want to go today, we can go tomorrow.

381
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
From now on, I'll buy two movie tickets every day.

382
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
There will be a day you would want to watch a movie with me.

383
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,700
Do you havea lot of money to spend?

384
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,200
Not at all.

385
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,400
I can't even pay for my meal.

386
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
I'm starving.

387
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,700
But it's okay.

388
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,300
My priority is to make my girlfriend happy.

389
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,400
Okay. Watching a movie, right?

390
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,600
I'll go. I want to watch the scariest movie at midnight.

391
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,000
No problem.

392
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You were the one to say it. Remember what you said.

393
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,200
I'll buy the movie tickets later.

394
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,800
<i>[Xi Nan Theatre]</i>

395
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,500
<i>[Playing Today: Texas Chainsaw Massacre]</i>

396
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,800
Why are the movies all so bloody?

397
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,000
Excuse me, is this the only movie playing at midnight tonight?

398
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,600
Yes, only this one.

399
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
Thank you.

400
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,800
Two tickets, please.

401
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,800
By the way, I also want a couple package.

402
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,700
Okay, please wait a second.

403
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,800
Xiaoling, can I borrow this book to read?

404
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,000
You have good taste!

405
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,900
That one is really good.

406
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,800
Gui Xiaoling, in the four years of college,

407
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,400
you have read volumes of books.

408
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,600
I'm flattered.

409
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,900
I just have a fulfilling spiritual world.

410
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,800
Save it.

411
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,500
Aren't you going to watch a movie at midnight with Shiyi?

412
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,400
Why are you still here?

413
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,800
Let him watch it alone.

414
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,000
I won't go anyway.

415
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,400
Has Lu Shiyi's hemophobia been cured?

416
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,000
This week's midnight films

417
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,400
are all super scary and bloody.

418
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Will he have a relapse?

419
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,189
Are this week's films very bloody?

420
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,100
Super bloody!

421
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,500
I just went to see it with my fellow-townsman.

422
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,600
He was so scared he vomited.

423
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,580
I'm going out.

424
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,300
Where are you going?

425
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,740
<i>[Xi Nan Theatre]</i>

426
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,300
Miss, please wait!

427
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Where's your ticket?

428
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,180
Hello, I'm looking for someone.

429
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,000
Who are you looking for?

430
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,800
My... My boyfriend.

431
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
He's over 180 cm tall, with a centre parting,

432
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,000
wears blue-and-white sportswear, and looks...

433
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,400
quite handsome.

434
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,200
Sorry, I haven't seen such a man.

435
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,800
Please let me in to find him.

436
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,600
Sorry, I can't help you. Please get out.

437
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,400
- Please go out, Miss.
- Don't.

438
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,300
If you don't let me in, I'll cry.

439
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,600
Xia Xiaoju!

440
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,990
Datu, you!

441
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,400
Why aren't you late today?

442
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
The tickets I bought start in five minutes.

443
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,500
Luckily, you didn't go in.

444
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,800
Listen, let's not watch this.

445
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,200
- Let's go.
- No., no, no.

446
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,800
Wait, why must we leave?

447
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
- But...
- My hemophobia is cured.

448
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,500
Let's go, the film is about to start.
<i>[Projection Hall]</i>

449
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,800
- Let's not watch it! Let's go.
- Listen,

450
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
we got the whole theater booked.

451
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,600
There are only the two of us.

452
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,400
I've bought popcorn and coke.

453
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,500
<i>[Projection Hall]</i>

454
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,309
- What's up?
- I'm just worried about you.

455
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,279
Do you have any problems watching such a film?

456
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,080
It's all right.

457
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,279
Datu, why don't we stop watching?

458
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,469
What if you have a relapse from watching it?

459
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,530
I won't know what to do then.

460
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,829
I should be fine.

461
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,330
Are you sure?

462
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,639
Look, I'm fine.

463
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,440
Hurry and watch.

464
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,879
My god, Datu.

465
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,519
Are you sure you're okay?

466
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,020
Datu?

467
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,160
Datu!

468
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,040
I said we shouldn't have come to watch this.

469
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,109
Oh gosh! He's too heavy.

470
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,069
- Datu.
- Xia Xiaoju!

471
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,810
Were you scared?

472
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:12,739
I was so worried about you. How could you pretend to faint and lie to me?

473
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,070
You care a lot about me.

474
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,469
You're my brother.

475
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,109
Of course, I care about you.

476
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,559
If someone has hemophobia,

477
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,780
anyone else would care about it as well.

478
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,490
Are you still laughing? I was worried about you over nothing.

479
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,429
I know I was wrong.

480
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,759
I'm sorry. I swear I'll never make jokes about this again.

481
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,830
We're already here. Let's at least finish the movie.

482
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,130
Sit.

483
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,069
I'm sorry.

484
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,570
Let me apologize to you.

485
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,750
- It's all mine.
- All yours.

486
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,829
This is yours, too.

487
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,479
I won't eat or drink. How about that?

488
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,460
- Keep holding it then.
- Okay, no problem.

489
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,069
It tastes really good.

490
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,680
<i>I know it's wrong to force you,</i>

491
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,900
<i>but I really can't</i>

492
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,960
<i>let you go now.</i>

493
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:36,709
<i>It's almost time for lunch.</i>

494
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,094
Let's eat together.

495
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:40,759
I still have another tour group this afternoon.

496
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,519
I won't go eat. I have to get going.

497
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,229
That won't do. How can you not eat anything?

498
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:46,759
You've already missed several meals before.

499
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,010
Be careful that you'll have a stomachache.

500
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,949
- Don't worry. I'm quite healthy.
- No way.

501
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,040
Xia Xiaoju! Xiaoju!

502
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,829
Here you are.

503
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,470
Your favorite soy-braised pork and ribs.

504
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,279
So considerate!

505
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,610
Take it.

506
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,966
You got food for Xiaoju?

507
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,159
Every time she goes with a tour group, she never has time to eat.

508
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,639
I had no other way, but to pack food for her.

509
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,630
After all I'm her boyfriend.

510
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,680
Brother, well done!

511
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,229
I've something to do within my faculty.

512
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,559
I have to go.

513
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,469
I'll pick you up when you're off work tonight.

514
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,679
Don't you have a class?

515
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,480
How do you have the time to pick me up?

516
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,060
How could I forget?

517
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,439
I'll take a taxi back. You don't need to pick me up.

518
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:41,589
All right. When you return, take care of yourself.

519
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,189
Remember to eat.

520
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,679
Call me when you're free.

521
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,000
- I'll get going then. Bye bye.
- Bye.

522
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,229
Who would believe you two are a pretend couple?

523
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,830
What's wrong?

524
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,829
Shiyi tends to be a casual guy,

525
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,559
but he specifically packed food for you

526
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,519
and look after you carefully

527
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,349
while you normally are so careless

528
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,709
that you forget your own classes,

529
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,230
but you remember the Medical Faculty's timetable.

530
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,749
I don't believe the two of you don't like each other.

531
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,159
It's because he always forces me to go to his class with him.

532
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,429
Don't try to explain.

533
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,519
Explaining means you are hiding something.

534
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,430
Why don't you two just become a real couple?

535
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,589
How can we be a real couple? We're friends.

536
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,709
Really?

537
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,829
Why do I think Shiyi treats this seriously and has fallen quite deeply?

538
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,090
Aren't you the same?

539
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,940
You don't just take Shiyi as a friend, do you?

540
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,060
Let's go. Why are you talking so much?

541
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,700
<i>[Jiangzhou University]</i>

542
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,330
Thank you, Sir.

543
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,130
Why are you back so late?

544
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,960
Why are you here? Don't you have a class?

545
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,949
It was canceled. Our professor had something come up last minute, so it was moved to the day after tomorrow.

546
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,629
You didn't answer my calls,

547
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,940
so I could wait for you here.

548
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,900
You must be exhausted.

549
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,759
Here, let me treat you to some midnight snacks.

550
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,799
And then we'll head back to the dorms so you can get some rest.

551
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,670
What do you want to eat?

552
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,850
What's wrong?

553
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,170
Datu, let's...

554
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,880
end it here.

555
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,629
What are you doing?

556
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,151
You want me to act out a breakup with you again?

557
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:05,449
Xia Xiaoju, you know how frequently you ask me to break up?

558
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,490
If you keep doing this, I'll tell Lin You.

559
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,810
Just go tell her CL is Cheng Lang.

560
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,050
I'm not afraid.

561
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,230
I said that just to frighten you

562
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,690
or else I can't find any better reason

563
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,330
for you to continue to be with me.

564
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,909
What happened today?

565
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,429
Wasn't everything good just a few days ago?

566
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,300
Why do you suddenly feel we can't go on like this?

567
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,150
I don't want to keep using you.

568
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,760
Are you worried I'll fall too deeply

569
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,050
and then get hurt?

570
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,699
I'm not afraid. What are you afraid of?

571
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,020
Are you afraid you'll like me?

572
