Xiaoju...

00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,490
Why are you crying?

5
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,660
No reason. My eyes are just sore.

6
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,860
What's wrong?

7
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,810
My goodness.

8
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,250
These clothes have been here for almost two weeks.

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,100
Never mind. I'll go and return them for you.

10
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,030
I'll return them to her.

11
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,560
Xiaoju, long time no see!

12
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,340
That... Is Lin You here?

13
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,230
She's not here. She's out on a date with her boyfriend.

14
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,470
Do you need her for something?

15
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,829
Then please help me return this to her.

16
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,500
Okay, no problem.

17
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,780
- Thank you, bye.

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,580
Tell me, what happened?

22
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,340
They're together now.

23
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,110
My heart hurts.

24
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,780
It's better to know about it early on

25
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,510
so you can give up on the idea sooner.

26
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,290
I know that they're a good match.

27
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,610
I shouldn't have fantasized that I had a chance.

I should... I should wish them happiness.

He doesn't like me.

Whether in the past or present, he doesn't like me.

It has been an unrequited love.

33
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,010
He never liked me.

34
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,630
It's okay. Everything will pass.

35
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,970
There will be a nice guy waiting for you in the future.

43
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,890
My favorite novelist published a new book.

44
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,660
Can you lend me some money?

45
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,659
Big Huang just established a band and applied for a rehearsal room.

46
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,720
There are many things to buy.

47
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,270
I've been short on money as well lately.

48
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,759
Why is that when others date, it's the boyfriend that spends money,

49
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,389
but when it comes to you, you're the one who spends money?

50
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,599
What you're thinking of are the old-fashioned and superstitious ways.

51
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,879
Now boys and girls are equal.

52
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,420
Who said boys must pay in the relationship?

53
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,409
Moreover, I also really like rock music.

54
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:21,219
Since he established a band, of course, I'd help him!

55
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:23,770
Okay, fine. As long as you like it.

56
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,850
Xiaoju, have you gotten your paycheck lately?

57
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,829
Can you lend me some money?

58
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,900
Does it look like I've gotten my paycheck?

59
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,180
I only have a bit more than 10 yuan.

60
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,599
Why is everyone so poor at the end of the month?

61
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,249
Everyone's here today.

62
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:47,470
Xiaoju, your dad is waiting for you downstairs.

63
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,540
Hurry and go!

64
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,820
Dad!

65
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,540
Why are you here?

66
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,780
Why didn't you call me in advance?

67
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,279
You haven't been home for weeks.

68
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,149
Your mom is worried so she told me to come and visit you,

69
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,340
and to give you some money as well.

70
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,439
I've recently found a part-time job so I have some money.

71
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,740
You really don't need to worry about me.

72
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,419
No wonder you're so thin and tan.

73
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,399
You can't go out and work anymore. You're a student so you need to study.

74
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,440
Dad, a-actually...

75
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,999
I know our family's having a hard time right now.

76
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,839
Anyway, I have money right now.

77
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,999
You really don't need to give me any.

78
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,540
Not only that, my job won't affect my studies.

79
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,409
Xiaoju, you've grown up and became more sensible,

80
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:42,620
but you must accept the money.

81
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,200
Listen to me. I've already found a way to resolve the issue at home.

82
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,660
No more work, got it?

83
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,370
Why do you need a dad?

84
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,710
A dad ought to make money for the family!

85
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,609
Cheng Lang also works a part-time job,

86
00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:59,339
and it hasn't affected his studies.

87
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,069
As for Cheng Lang, it's not that I'm not on your side,

88
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,149
but Cheng Lang is very good in his studies. He's a genius!

89
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,239
Our Xiaoju is sometimes a bit dull.

90
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,570
You just favor Cheng Lang.

91
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,939
Okay, I'm going to leave now.

92
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:13,570
Go back inside.

93
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,490
Okay.

94
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,450
Dad, take care.

95
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,080
Go back.

96
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,439
- Dad!
- Why did you run?

97
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,669
What's wrong?

98
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,589
I'll send you off at the bus stop.

99
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,959
I thought something happened.

100
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,880
Could someone my age get lost?

101
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,149
Having not seen me in so long,

102
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,669
don't you miss me?

103
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,440
Didn't you also say that I'm your sweet little cotton-padded jacket?

104
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,610
Dad, did I really become very tan?

105
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,109
If you fell into a coal heap,

106
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,860
I may not be able to find you.

107
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,109
How can you say that about your biological daughter?

108
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,349
I can't be that tan.

109
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,199
- Look, look! I'm really not that tan!
- All right, okay.

110
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,349
Although you might be as dark as coal,

111
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,079
you're as dark as Justice Bao.
<i>(T/N: He is portrayed as having really dark skin with a moon on his forehead, and is a symbol of justice.)</i>

112
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,030
Dad!

113
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,879
Xiaoju, I'm joking.

114
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,399
You're my daughter.

115
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,709
Whether you're white

116
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,399
or dark, fat or thin, you're pretty.

117
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,879
But if you really got thinner,

118
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,469
our hearts will ache for you,

119
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,639
fearing you're not eating well, okay?

120
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,909
Dad, don't worry.

121
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,960
I eat quite a lot.

122
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,660
Dad, have you eaten yet?

123
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,840
Do you want me to advance your paycheck?

124
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,229
I'm so sorry, Manager Zhao.

125
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,669
That... Xia Xiaoju, you've only been here a couple of days.

126
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,440
Do you think it's proper for you to request such a thing?

127
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,589
I... Manager Zhao,

128
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,959
I really do have something urgent.

129
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,079
Otherwise, I wouldn't be asking for it now.

130
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,860
If you need it urgently, you can borrow it from your friends, right?

131
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,439
Also from your relatives or your mom.

132
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,279
We have rules here at the store.

133
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,709
Look, you have something urgent today and took an advance,

134
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,349
then they'll copy you tomorrow by asking for an advance.

135
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,349
If you all run away, what do I do?

136
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,919
How can I run away? I won't run away, I definitely won't!

137
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,100
Manager, you're really good at making jokes.

138
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,199
Well... Look, let's not talk about the advance first.

139
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,639
Over there is a new batch of goods.

140
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,399
Hurry and sort them out, then put them on the shelf.

141
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,999
I've something that I need to do so I'll be out for a bit,

142
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,399
but don't worry.

143
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,879
When it's time to get paid,

144
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,890
I will definitely pay you your wages.

145
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,349
- Fighting!
- Fighting.

146
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,080
Manager, see you.

147
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,789
Listen, I put in a lot of effort

148
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,789
to apply for this rehearsal room.

149
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,439
This is also where China's greatest rock band rehearsal room will be created.

150
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,340
Do you see this? We're here!

151
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,450
You two will witness such a critical moment.

152
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,000
I really envy you guys who came to know me at such a young age.

153
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,549
That's not right.

154
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,589
135, that's right.

155
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,469
How... How can we practice here?

156
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,149
We can't practice here!

157
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,060
I'm going to ask the university's management office.

158
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,460
Big Huang, we've waited a long time in order to get this rehearsal room.

159
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,469
If you were to re-apply, it depends on whether the university approves it.

160
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,250
Even if it's approved, how long would we have to wait?

161
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,340
What else can we do? We can't practice here!

162
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,149
This room only looks shabby right now.

163
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,149
After we clean it up a bit and move all the instruments,

164
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,229
it'll look desirable.

165
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,610
That's right.

166
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,590
Clean it up?

167
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,760
Just the three of us?

168
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,439
Where are your bassist and drummer? Ask them to help.

169
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,690
You mustn't tell them!

170
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,310
If they find out that it's such a shabby room,

171
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,300
I'll lose my face.

172
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,080
Come on, let's clean it up together.

173
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,759
I was invited to visit

174
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,029
the greatest band's rehearsal room.

175
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,230
Not to clean.

176
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,640
I still have something to do, so I'm leaving. Bye bye.

177
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,470
Stop right there! Stop!

178
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,229
You're not loyal enough.

179
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,909
I usually help you whenever you ask me.

180
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,230
How am I not loyal enough?

181
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,589
I really have something urgent this time.

182
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,150
Did you forget?

183
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,910
The convenience store.

184
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,110
- That's right.
- Okay, okay. I understand.

185
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,149
Go, go. Just go.

186
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,199
Wait for me.

187
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,839
I'll finish soon and return to help you clean.

188
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,029
Okay, I'll wait for you.

189
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,319
I'm leaving. Wait for me.

190
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,909
You only know how to help Xia Xiaoju.

191
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,460
Putting girls before friends.

192
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,540
Leave it!

193
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,109
Don't move! Don't move!

194
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,280
Be careful or else you'll fall.

195
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,850
What're you doing?

196
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,520
Leave such laborious work to men like me.

197
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,950
How can I let my girlfriend take such a risk.

198
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,920
Let me do it.

199
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,370
Do you sell pistachios here?

200
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,300
You're here.

201
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,069
Xia Xiaoju, if I was your boss, I would've fired you a long time ago.

202
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,360
With such a long face, you don't even know to smile when you see a customer.

203
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,039
You're scaring the customers away.

204
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,279
If you're the boss,

205
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,230
I wouldn't work for you because you're Exploiter Zhou.
<i>(T/N: Fictional landlord who imitated a chicken's wake up call to get his workers to wake up earlier for work.)</i>

206
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,829
My surname is Lu.

207
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,279
If I really am, then I should be Exploiter Lu.

208
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,829
Don't slack off. Hurry and get to work, Worker Xia.

209
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,559
Aren't I already working right now?

210
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,420
When did I slack off?

211
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,330
I'm so hungry.

212
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,010
Are you hungry?

213
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,429
What are you doing? Why are you opening it here?

214
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,230
There are people over there.

215
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,220
What? It's not like I'm not going to pay for it!

216
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,469
You're even eating it now.

217
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,689
Try one. It's really good.

218
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,679
No, thanks.

219
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,279
It feels like I'm a thief eating in the store.

220
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,559
Why don't you stop eating it, too?

221
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,109
It's not good.

222
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,399
Look, what if you're seen by them?

223
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,300
So what?

224
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,420
Is there a rule that you can't eat in the store?

225
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,350
I've already paid for it.

226
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,610
I can eat it wherever and whenever I want.

227
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,069
Okay, you eat it.

228
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,430
Do you really not want to try one? This is really good.

229
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,480
No, thanks.

230
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,040
I'll block it for you like this. This way, others won't see you eating.

231
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,039
Is it yummy?

232
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,709
Turn around.

233
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,710
If you eat it this way, others definitely won't see you.

234
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,210
Take it.

235
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,279
These biscuits are really yummy.

236
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,130
I want to take some back to campus later.

237
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,260
Then you continue eating. I'll help you with work.

238
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,070
Okay.

239
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,540
Where do I put these?

240
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,560
Behind you.

241
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,070
There.

242
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,300
Yummy!

243
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,420
<i>[Yangyang Convenience Store]</i>

244
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,680
Datu, thank you for helping me today.

245
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,039
Just saying that, it is not enough.

246
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,429
How will you thank me?

247
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,250
Will you promise yourself to me?

248
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,349
Once I get paid, I'll buy anything you want.

249
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,460
I have no money right now.

250
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,530
Then I have a way so you won't have to spend your money. Do you want to hear it?

251
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,309
What is it?

252
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,429
The college basketball league competition is coming up soon.

253
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,649
How about you help me train passing the basketball starting tomorrow?

254
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,919
Then it's settled.

255
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,680
If I can't pass it well, you can't blame me.

256
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,349
Okay. I promise not to beat or scold you.

257
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,150
Then I promise to come on time tomorrow.

258
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,169
These are too heavy so I'm not going to bring them back.

259
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,829
Keep them to eat and replenish yourself.

260
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,039
Otherwise, you won't have strength to pass the balls tomorrow.

261
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,519
No need. Keep them for yourself.

262
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,069
Just take them.

263
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,620
I really don't need it. You—

264
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,130
I'm leaving now. Bye bye!

265
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,070
Bye.

266
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,109

T-Tonight I need to read and review lessons.

Lin You! Lin You!

277
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,130
What will I do when I see them both later tonight?

278
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,790
Xiaoju, come here.

279
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,720
Xiaoju, this is my boyfriend Yuan Ancheng.

280
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,850
Nice to meet you, Xiaoju.

281
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,970
Nice to meet you.

282
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,880
You are Lin You's boyfriend?

283
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,370
That's right.

284
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,829
- Sorry that I was late.
<i>- I'm so hungry!</i>

285
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,109
It's okay. We also just arrived.

286
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,780
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Let's go.

287
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,370
Xia Xiaoju? Lin You?

288
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,300
What a coincidence!

289
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,999
Where are you going?

290
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,200
We're just going to dinner with the basketball team.

291
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,639
You guys go ahead and order first.

292
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,469
- Okay, let's go!
- We'll be going first.

293

- See you.
- Bye.

294

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,110
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

296

Cheng Lang.

297
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,949
He's Cheng Lang.

298
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,300
I told you last time that he helped me a lot with my group work.

299
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,189
Since that's the case, let's eat together.

300
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,880
It's on me.

301
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,720
No, thanks. We still have something to do later.

302
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,949
You guys don't need to be so polite.

303
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,589
You guys helped Lin You a lot.

304
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,970
I must treat you guys to dinner.

305
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,990
Mr. Yuan, all of your dishes have been served.

306
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,630
Thanks.

307
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:17,420
Lin You, when did you get a boyfriend?

308
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,440
We've known each other for so long, and yet we didn't even know.

309
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,320
Ancheng and I met when we were young.

310
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,850
I chose Jiangzhou University for him.

311
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,919
Before, he was in piano competitions abroad.

312
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,340
This time, he won a gold medal and just returned to China two days ago.

313
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,600
He wanted to treat Xiaoju to dinner so we chose this place.

314
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,829
Did you know? Cheng Lang is also my childhood friend.

315
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,430
He's always a straight A student and extremely smart

316
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,559
that he didn't take one of the exams and still got into Jiangzhou University's first-tier major.

317
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,639
Really? That's quite impressive.

318
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,589
The only thing I like since young was playing the piano,

319
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,679
just like Lin You who only likes dancing.

320
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,580
Her love for dancing is also because of me, right?

321
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,829
She said the happiest thing for her

322
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,330
is when she's dancing to my accompaniment.

323
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,229
By the way, what songs do you usually play in competitions abroad?

324
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,759
I... I know Chopin.

325
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,949
This time I played the Grieg concerto,

326
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,870
accompanied by a Temirkanov-directed Baltimore orchestra.

327
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,709
- T-Te... What ir?
- Temirkanov.

328
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,109
He's a famous Russian conductor

329
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,999
who became the Music Director of St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra since 1988.

330
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:26,999
That's right.

331
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,229
This is his first year as Music Director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.

332
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:32,039
I'm not really familiar with it.

333
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,759
The conductor that you mentioned, does he move the baton like this?

334
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,250
Did you burn yourself?

335
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,040
Thanks.

336
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,480
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- Lin You.

337
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,240
I'm sorry, I was too careless. Did it burn you?

338
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,440
It didn't. It wasn't too hot.

339
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,030
It's not a big deal. You guys continue eating.

340
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,410
Cheng Lang, when Lin You's family had a hard time a while back,

341
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,030
she said that you helped her a lot.

342
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,469
Here's to you.

343
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,580
Thanks for helping her.

344
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,790
It's something I should be doing.

345
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,519
Lin You is also our friend.

346
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,430
Here.

347
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,159
Here. Let me give you another toast for coming back and winning a medal.

348
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,850
Congratulations.

349
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,400
All right, thank you.

350
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,349
Don't just drink, eat some food, too.

351
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,879
That's right.

352
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,829
Cheng Lang, eat some.

353
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,309
- Come, let's continue.
- Me too. Let's all drink together.

354
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:17,469
- Okay.
- Stop drinking and eat something.

355
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,349
It's okay. Let go of yourself and just drink.

356
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,580
I'll carry you back if you're drunk.

357
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,410
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

358
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,510
It's not like you didn't know he collapses after one drink.

359
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,360
Why didn't you stop him?

360
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,879
He wasn't in a good mood. If he wants to drink, just let him drink. Isn't that right?

361
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,229
What happened between Lin You and him?

362
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,759
Weren't they together at the library yesterday?

363
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,810
I thought they were together already.

364
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,759
Let me tell you, Xiaoju.

365
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:06,309
I was with Lin You that day for our group work.

366
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:10,090
We aren't together.

367
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,850
She rejected me.

368
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,660
What are you doing?

369
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:23,949
Shiyi, that Yuan Ancheng and Lin You are a good match.

370
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,559
They're a match made in heaven.

371
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,559
The stuff they talked about, those piano concerto

372
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,800
and classical music... I couldn't even get a word in.

373
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,519
You just happen to not know about these things.

374
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,559
Everyone has something he or she doesn't know, right?

375
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,779
But the things that you do know is as many as there are stars. You can't even count them all, you know?

376
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,229
- The stars in the sky?
- That's right!

377
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,229
There are no stars in the sky.

378
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,109
Let's go, idiot.

379
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,829
Shiyi, let me ask you.

380
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,279
What do you think of me?

381
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,810
What? What do you mean what I think of you?

382
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,429
Am I good?

383
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,639
Good, you're good. Of course, you're good.

384
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,800
You're handsome and excellent. Right?

385
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,160
Then... Then do you like me?

386
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,510
Of course, I like you. Let's go, let's go!

387
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,250
Then why doesn't Lin You like me?

388
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,540
- She...
- Cheng Lang.

389
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,450
Xiaoju, do you like me?

390
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,829
I...

391
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,879
You hesitated, Xiaoju!

392
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,360
- She hesitated. She doesn't like me.
- It's enough that I like you. Let's go, let's go!

393
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,950
- I'll sleep with you tonight.
- No, you can't. You're too stinky today.

394
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,640
Xiaoju! Xiaoju!

395
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,309
Come here quickly!

396
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,949
Stop calling and give me a hand. Hurry!

397
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,159
How much did he drink?

398
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,879
Unbelievable!
<i>(T/N: Literally "the sun rose from the west" to indicate the impossible happened.)</i>

399
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,189
Hold onto him. Carry him to the bed first.

400
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,399
I'll go and get some hot water. Hurry.

401
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,799
- Okay.
- Be careful!

402
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,380
How much did you drink?

403
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,630
Sorry! I'm sorry!

404
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,189
Lie down.

405
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,590
Here.

406
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,890
He's bleeding, Shiyi!

407
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,399
Does it hurt, Cheng Lang?

408
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,390
Hurry up! Band-Aid, hurry!

409
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,940
Here's the Band-Aid.

410
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,879
How much did he drink?

411
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,450
Tell me, what can you actually do?

412
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,230
I didn't do it on purpose.

413
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,039
It's not like you don't have girls chasing after you.

414
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,210
You have so many girls liking you.

415
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,919
Can't you let go knowing she already has a boyfriend?

416
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,709
Why are you so idiotic?

417
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,519
Isn't someone also the same?

418
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,720
Also stupid.
