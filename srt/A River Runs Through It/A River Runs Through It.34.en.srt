<i>[Episode 34: Farewell, my youth, Part II]</i>

3
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,329
You're quite cute.

4
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:34,400
You are cute as well.

5
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,959
What? Do they make your mouth water?

6
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,799
It's your wallet that is going to bleed.

7
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,159
Let me tell you.

8
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,380
I've been communicating with this one for quite a while.

9
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,720
But I didn't bring enough cash with me though?

10
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,309
Then this matter is a bit tricky.

11
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,909
Do you want me to go ask someone in the kitchen

12
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,869
if they need someone to wash the dishes?

13
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,719
I don't think washing dishes will be enough.

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,219
We would have to peel three baskets of oysters,

15
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,110
like we did during our high school graduation trip.

16
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,319
Why was I so silly back then?

17
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,550
You're still quite silly now.

18
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,110
Go ahead! Which one do you want?

19
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,880
Cheng Lang, my bag!

20
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,829
- Stop! Stop!
- Make way!

21
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,430
Stop!

22
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,439
Stop! Stop!

23
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,599
Give my bag back!

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Stop!

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,320
Xiaoju, are you okay?

26
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,560
Is there anything important in your bag?

27
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,389
Wait for me here. Hurry and call 911!

28
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,879
Cheng Lang, you don't have to chase after him! Cheng Lang!

29
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,030
- Come back!
- Are you okay?

30
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,120
Stop!

31
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,480
Put down the bag!

32
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,110
Miss, have some water.

33
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,389
It's okay. Police have gone to help.

34
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,390
Your friend will be okay.

35
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Xiaoju.

36
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,549
Are you okay?

37
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,669
Cheng Lang, are you hurt?

38
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,670
I'm fine.

39
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,719
Didn't I tell you not to go after him?

40
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,069
Why didn't you listen?

41
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,789
Can't you see that I'm all right?

42
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,229
Some villagers helped me just now

43
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,650
to catch those guys.

44
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,819
All right. It's fine. Why are you crying?

45
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:33,620
Come on. It's okay. Don't cry.

46
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,550
You're all grown up now. Why are you still crying?

47
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,519
Are you still using this after all this time?

48
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,349
I've used it for so long that I'm used to it,

49
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,350
so I never changed it.

50
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,270
I remember that

51
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,159
I bought this with my very first earning from my part-time job.

52
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,100
<i>Taotao, look at this.</i>

53
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,599
<i>Isn't it cute? Doesn't it suit Cheng Lang?</i>

54
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,230
How did you know I would've used it?

55
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,919
Because I think it looks silly.

56
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,269
It would... would suit you very well.

57
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,389
Silly?

58
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,390
Me?

59
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,999
It really suits you.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,479
That's probably because I have known you for so long,

61
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,620
so like you,

62
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,000
I also have become silly.

63
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,069
Here. Take a look.

64
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,230
Are you missing anything?

65
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,380
Did Shiyi give you that?

66
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,110
Xiaoju.

67
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,539
I think there are some things you still aren't clear about.

68
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,549
After I helped get your bag back,

69
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,919
the first thing you checked was not your phone

70
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,949
or your wallet,

71
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,130
but the hairpin he gave you.

72
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,670
Doesn't that make it clear?

73
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,790
You like Shiyi.

74
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,919
But I realized it too late.

75
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,640
There are some things that as long as you become clear,

76
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,730
it will never be late.

77
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,549
He's going abroad soon.

78
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,640
Xiaoju,

79
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,349
Shiyi studying abroad will not change anything.

80
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,999
You should know what kind of person Lu Shiyi is.

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,269
Once he makes up his mind,

82
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,509
even if he runs up against a wall,

83
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,720
he still won't give up.

84
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,389
As long as you can be strong,

85
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,550
I feel that distance won't be a problem.

86
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,920
I'll go back now to tell him that

87
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,080
I like him.

88
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,160
Cheng Lang, thank you.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,999
This time,

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,170
Lu Shiyi will absolutely be thrilled.

91
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,769
Xia Xiaoju. You must be happy.

92
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,470
Cheng Lang.

93
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,320
You must be happy, too.

94
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,309
Why... Why are you going to study abroad all of a sudden?

95
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,550
Does Xia Xiaoju know?

96
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,140
Don't tell her.

97
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,080
Come on.

98
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,110
Okay.

99
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,619
Take care.

100
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,390
Take care. I'm off.

101
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,880
Have a good trip!

102
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,989
Why do I feel like I forgot something?

103
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:27,450
- It's chili sauce.
- I'm back.

104
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,410
You're home.

105
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,949
Come take a look at this list and see if it has everything.

106
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,279
Tell me if you want anything else to eat. I'll go buy it for you.

107
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,709
I forgot to write chili sauce, so it's not on the list.

108
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,739
What's all of this, Mom?
<i>[Important Travel Documents: Passport, Student ID, Report card... Daily necessities: hairdryer, hairbrush, shoes, pens...]</i>

109
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:46,029
Coffee, chips, instant noodles,

110
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,280
sausage, pickles, and sunflower seeds.

111
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,349
Mom, I'm going abroad to study,

112
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,809
I'm not trying to open a small grocery store.

113
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,999
You don't understand.

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
Other people have said that you can't buy any of this abroad.

115
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,519
If you want to buy it then, you won't be able to.

116
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,110
I still think there's a lot missing.

117
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,420
I need to think some more...

118
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,179
Why don't... you leave a week later?

119
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:11,369
So you can say goodbye

120
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:12,539
to Xia Xiaoju and Cheng Lang.

121
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:17,229
I also want my classmate to bring a laptop for you.

122
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,809
That's enough.

123
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,369
It's better for him to go early so he has more time to settle down.

124
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:23,839
The new semester is going to start soon.

125
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,439
Stop making more trouble for him, okay?

126
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,179
How is this making trouble?

127
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,430
Is buying something called making trouble?

128
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,319
Seriously, he's going so far away.

129
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,979
I can't bear for him to go so far.

130
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:35,799
I don't see how you can't bear to part with him.

131
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,879
Yesterday, you were telling everyone

132
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,399
that your son is going to study abroad.

133
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,879
Was I the only one showing off?

134
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,839
Didn't you call your friends as well?

135
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,759
You called your former female classmate twice.

136
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,350
Do you think I don't know?

137
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,470
<i>Is Tour Guide Xia all right?</i>

138
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,419
<i>Yes. She didn't come to work today. </i>

139
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:14,750
<i>Do you know where she is now?</i>

140
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,369
<i>I think she went out to a seafood booth with a friend.</i>

141
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,710
<i>- Thank you.
- Your welcome.</i>

142
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,390
<i>It's fine. Why are you crying? Don't cry.</i>

143
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,080
<i>You are all grown up now. Why are you still crying?</i>

144
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,969
<i>Are you still using this after all this time?</i>

145
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,319
<i>I've used it for so long</i>

146
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,549
<i>that I'm used to it so I never changed it.</i>

147
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,589
<i>I bought this with my very first earning from my part-time job.</i>

148
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,879
<i>I thought it looked really silly.</i>

149
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,910
<i>It suited you really well. </i>

150
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,279
<i>Do you like it?</i>

151
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
<i>I'll give it to you if you do.</i>

152
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,400
So that's what the dog meant.

153
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,590
I'm really a fool.

154
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,540
Everyone, can I have your attention?

155
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,109
Look at the direction I am pointing at.

156
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,900
There are rockeries and lakes.

157
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,640
You can take pictures by the lake.

158
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,890
But please be careful.

159
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,779
We'll gather here in 30 minutes. Is it okay?

160
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:45,240
<i>Yes!</i>

161
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,810
What's that Datu so busy doing right now?

162
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,850
He hasn't replied to any of my messages.

163
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,640
Let's see when you'll reply!

164
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,930
Hello, Mom.

165
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,930

321
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,100
what else can I do except for drinking now?

322
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,800
What were you doing earlier then?

323
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,700
You're right.

324
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,600
I deserve it.

325
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,100
I didn't cherish him when he was around.

326
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,400
Now even the Heavens are punishing me.

327
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,200
Could there be a misunderstanding?

328
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,000
No.

329
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,200
Do you think it's a TV drama?

330
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,600
What misunderstanding could there be?

331
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
But it's not something Lu Shiyi would do.

332
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,900
It's true that he left without saying goodbye.

333
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,600
And it's also true that Shen Duo picked up the phone in his room.

334
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Those photos where they are affectionate

335
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,900
are all true!

336
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,900
He just told me a few days ago that

337
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,600
he was willing to stay here with me.

338
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,300
I never thought that once he has gone abroad he...

339
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,800
he found himself a girlfriend.

340
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,000
Fine. Since you want to drink,

341
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,200
I'll drink with you.

342
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,600
Cheers.

343
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,000
I want to ask you,

344
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
do you still want to turn things around?

345
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
I think based on Lu Shiyi's feeling towards you,

346
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,700
if you tell him right now how you feel,

347
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,000
perhaps you have a chance.

348
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,700
Xiaoju.

349
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,800
I really hope you can be a bit braver.

350
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
Taotao.

351
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,800
I... I didn't imagine that

352
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,400
amongst all of us, you would be the best at taking what has come and letting go.

353
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,000
I want to be as brave as you.

354
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,400
But...

355
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,800
I really have disappointed Shiyi too many times.

356
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,400
Since he decided to leave,

357
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
I'll let him go.

358
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
All right.

359
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,639
Lean on me.

360
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,309
Lean on me. Everything will be fine.

361
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,300
Everything will be fine.

362
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,500
Why are you standing here? Go and take photos!

363
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,800
Why does it seem that time has passed so quickly? We are graduating from college now.

364
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,000
That's right.

365
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Time really does fly.

366
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,700
We're about to leave college, an ivory tower

367
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,400
and enter society.

368
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,700
Are you that happy?

369
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,000
It's not about being happy,

370
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,400
but people should keep looking forward, right?

371
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
Don't wear such a long face.

372
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,800
You can only take graduation photos once in your life.

373
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,100
If they are not good, you will regret it later.

374
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,800
All right, smile for me.

375
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,500
Smile.

376
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,700
Here you are!

377
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,800
Let's go to take pictures.

378
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,300
Let's go. Go.

379
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,200
<i>We have said goodbye many times before.</i>

380
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,000
<i>But after this summer,</i>

381
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,600
<i>we might never see each other again.</i>

382
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,800
<i>I once thought that after graduating we would happily live</i>

383
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,000
<i>in the same city.</i>

384
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,400
<i>I never thought</i>

385
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,800
<i>that we would part ways with no farewell in reality.</i>

386
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
<i>In the upstream of time,</i>

387
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,300
<i>we used to be daring and energetic youth.</i>

388
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,500
<i>What we experienced during four years,</i>

389
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,400
<i>happiness and tears have forever been ingrained within our memories.</i>

390
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,500
<i>In one of the corners of our youth, our steps were once so close,</i>

391
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,600
<i>but never overlapped.</i>

392
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
<i>I once was at a loss between a messy, vague care for him,</i>

393
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,800
<i>or a clear, resolute rejection could be better.</i>

394
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
<i>But I didn't know that</i>

395
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,300
<i>my lack of love was the biggest harm.</i>

396
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,200
<i>I once complained about</i>

397
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,400
<i>the happiness that I fought for</i>

398
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,500
<i>could be easily obtained by someone else.</i>

399
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,400
<i>But she didn't want it.</i>

400
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,600
<i>I also lamented that</i>

401
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,700
<i>we were too silly to see the happiness we had at that time.</i>

402
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,300
<i>Only when we look back,</i>

403
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,600
<i>those days of loving and being loved,</i>

404
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,200
<i>those who love me and those I love,</i>

405
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,400
<i>were once so deeply engraved in our lives</i>

406
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,000
<i>and it was enough.</i>

407
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
♫ <i>Between the lines of that year (My longing becomes the summer)</i> ♫
