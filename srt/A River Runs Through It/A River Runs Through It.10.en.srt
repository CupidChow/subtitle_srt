<i>[A River Runs Through It]</i>

<i>[Episode 10: Friends mean "I" am alone, but "We" are not alone.]</i>

3
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,580
What are you doing?

4
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,359
How dare you connect wires secretly?

5
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,549
Do you know how dangerous that is?

6
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,679
What if there's a fire?

7
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,869
Do you think this is your home? This is a dorm.

8
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,359
Do you have any sense of community?

9
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,949
- Yes, we do!
- Yes!

10
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,020
Uncle, I think you are right to scold them.

11
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,570
How about this? I'll help you supervise them.

12
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,849
If everyone is like you, I wouldn't have to worry.

13
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,829
Any prohibited electrical appliances

14
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,269
or connected wires found in the dorm again,

15
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,699
I won't let you go easily with a warning.

16
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:23,880
- No, we won't.
- We will never do it again!

17
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,669
- I'll take these things away.
- Uncle, wait!

18
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,629
You can take away everything, but please let us keep the DVD.

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,959
No way!

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,439
This is our school's regulation.

21
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,749
Yes, you're right.

22
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,159
- We know we were wrong!
- Uncle!

23
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,239
Uncle!

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,219
Please do us a favor, Uncle!

25
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:38,109
Do you smoke, Uncle?

26
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,570
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

27
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,510
Uncle, go slowly!

28
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,110
All of you go away!

29
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,189
I don't even have a temper anymore.

30
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,630
How could we, such smart people, get caught just for connecting wires?

31
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,029
It's unscientific!

32
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,319
You're talking nonsense!

33
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,459
Last night in this building, only your room was lit up.

34
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,160
Who else would have been caught?

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,549
But it was really hard to buy the DVD.

36
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,450
Cheng Lang, can't you say something good for your brothers?

37
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,649
Aren't we still brothers?

38
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:05,749
That's right!

39
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,009
You didn't think of me when watching the DVD,

40
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:10,360
but now you are thinking of me?

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,999
The DVD was confiscated!

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,240
We have become indifferent to one another.

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,999
Are you blaming me for neglecting you?

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,480
All right. Go away!

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,800
Let's go out for a walk.

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,469
Literature Club.
<i>[School Advertisement Board]</i>

47
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,859
Chinese opera club.

48
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,600
Xiaoju, have you decided on what clubs to join?

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,690
Not yet.

50
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,539
Xiaoju, is this the Lu Shiyi we know?

51
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,389
<i>[Notice of Punishment]</i>

52
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,590
"Lu Shiyi, a freshman from the Department of Medicine,

53
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,109
and Huang Jun, a freshman from the Department of Veterinary Medicine,

54
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,290
- privately connected wires to watch DVDs in the dorms."
- Watch DVDs?

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
Taotao, the Lu Shiyi you mentioned

56
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,370
is exactly the one we know.

57
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,519
Datu, aren't you very smart?

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,519
Why were you caught?

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,799
At least, I'm smarter than you.

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,829
You are much smarter. Didn't you get caught right away?

61
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,549
Which side are you on, Cheng Lang?

62
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,039
What DVD were you watching in your dorm?

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,949
That engrossed?

64
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,660
- You didn't even notice the housemaster–
- Shut up!

65
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,130
Forget about this matter!

66
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,390
Uncle is so ungrateful! He even put up a notice.

67
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,200
Why don't we go look at which clubs are recruiting?

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,449
Let's go.

69
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,220
- So smart.
- Let's go!

70
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,270
Come have a look.

71
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,109
Come take a look! Our club is recurring!

72
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,069
<i>[Wing of Wind Roller Skating Club]</i>

73
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,669
- Amazing!
- That's right!

74
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,550
Our Painting and Calligraphy Club has many activities.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,160
- So many people.
- That's right.

76
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,349
Taotao, that suits you well,

77
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,100
that big head.

78
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,040
You're the one with the big head!

79
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,669
The Track and Field Club is also recruiting members.

80
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,849
Shall I sign up for it?

81
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:14,789
I think you should!

82
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,439
You're sure to make it.

83
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,829
You?

84
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,789
You are just an amateur runner.

85
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,879
Don't hold the team back.

86
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,159
Did you forget how you shamelessly begged me

87
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,690
to take part in the competition?

88
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,069
It's because I had no choice.

89
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,969
Don't you know about having to pick the best out of a mediocre bunch?

90
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:35,319
Your mouth is really...

91
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,060
I really want to sew your mouth up!

92
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,810
There's a Tailor's Club over there. Do you want to join?

93
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,269
Sew it if you have the ability to. Sew it!

94
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:42,229
- Just do it.
- Come on, you two.

95
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,039
As seniors in the kindergarten,

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,230
be mature, Lu Shiyi.

97
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,829
By the way, Xiaoju,

98
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,759
mostly boys participate in Track and Field.

99
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,109
Are you sure you want to join?

100
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,999
What about you guys?

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
I will if you guys join.

102
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,299
Classmate, are you interested in joining?

103
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,220
Basketball Club.

104
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,319
Do yant to join the Basketball Club with me?

105
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,919
I've two specialized courses and I have to work.

106
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,059
Where do I have the time to play basketball?

107
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,939
Then you have to exercise more, right?

108
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:08,239
Just treat it as accompanying me.

109
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,269
Let me think.

110
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,999
I also want to join!

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,980
All right.

112
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,939
You?

113
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,540
Looking at your short stature, do you still want to play basketball?

114
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,130
Come on. They won't recruit girls.

115
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,479
- You!
- Classmate, who said we didn't recruit girls?

116
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,850
Who said short girls can't play basketball?

117
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,610
I don't think you're very tall either.

118
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,479
Besides, I haven't seen if you can actually play.

119
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,949
Who are you?

120
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,879
Does this have to do with you?

121
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,109
I'm Shen Duo, the coach assistant for the Basketball Club.

122
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,880
Is that all?

123
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,829
I thought you were some kind of big shot.

124
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,430
How can a coach assistant be so arrogant?

125
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,060
If she's here, I don't really want to join.

126
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,930
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

127
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,430
Oh, God!

128
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,830
Let's go.

129
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,900
How did you make it?

130
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,949
- I got lucky.
- You got lucky, didn't you?

131
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,039
- Wasn't that cool?
- Yes!

132
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,670
That was really easy for me.

133
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,039
Amazing! You're really something!

134
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,510
He's pretty good.

135
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,479
Help me inquire about him.

136
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,539
You must persuade him into joining us.

137
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,640
I'm on it.

138
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,439
Which clubs have you signed up for?

139
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,389
I signed up for the Student Union.

140
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,450
I signed up for the Literature Club.

141
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,200
Are you sure you didn't sign up for the Romance Literature Club?

142
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,919
Xiaoju, how about you?

143
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,599
I originally was going to sign up for Track and Field,

144
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,269
but there are too many boys in it.

145
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,950
Cheng Lang advised me not to join.

146
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,569
Xiaoju, do you still remember Article Three in the Youth Story?

147
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:23,879
Of course. It says if a boy likes you,

148
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,640
he doesn't want you to be close to other men.

149
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,439
I think it's pretty much true.

150
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,760
What is almost true?

151
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,640
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

152
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,909
Taotao, can you accompany me

153
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,879
to where Cheng Lang works tomorrow at noon?

154
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,009
- I want to invite him.
- Your birthday.

155
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:50,179
I understand. No problem.

156
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,770
What are you talking about?

157
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,929
I also want to take the CPA exam.

158
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:01,370
Did you start preparing this early?

159
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,279
After all, the test is rather difficult, so I am starting early.

160
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,050
- Let me have a look.
- Okay.

161
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,789
Oh, my God!

162
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,959
Do you have to take this test to be an accountant?

163
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,079
As far as I know,

164
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,909
the national pass rate is very low.

165
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,300
There're six subjects,

166
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:26,019
including auditing, accounting, economic law, tax law and...

167
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,810
I can't remember.

168
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,960
I announce that I give up.

169
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,590
I won't take it!

170
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,889
I'm Professor Wu, the professor for Fundamentals of Accounting.

171
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,549
Every year, before I start teaching,

172
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,719
I like to give a few words of advice to the freshman in the major.

173
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:50,399
In this field, you must be meticulous.

174
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,759
You can't make accounting errors.

175
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,789
More importantly, you must be cautious.

176
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,709
You must never manipulate accounts for a boss or company.

177
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,839
You can not afford the consequences of doing so.

178
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,790
Once the situation has been uncovered and you are discovered,

179
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,350
you'll be liable for it.

180
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,029
All right. Let's begin class.

181
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,910
Everyone open your textbooks to page one.

182
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,940
Our course will be mainly focusing on an introduction to Computer Science.

183
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,839
Look at this one.

184
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,999
I'll share my classmate's.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,790
Thanks.

186
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,370
There's quite a lot of people that are here in our class today.

187
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,590
I believe many of you are from other majors here sitting in.

188
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,759
Every year when freshmen come,

189
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,439
we always have so many students here like today,

190
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,219
But as time goes by, there are fewer and fewer people.

191
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:02,130
Though Computer Science is a popular major,

192
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:08,180
but it is not easy to truly master.

193
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,979
First, I'll talk about how the computer was invented.

194
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:16,409
The first electronic computer was invented in 1946

195
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,960
at the University of Pennsylvania in USA.

196
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,940
Does anyone know who designed it?

197
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,730
Professor, it's Von Neumann.

198
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,900
Right. This student answered it correctly.

199
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,419
It's Von Neumann.

200
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,280
He was a famous computer scientist in the 20th century.

201
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,280
You're in my way, Senior.

202
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,760
Don't call me Senior. Call me Shen Duo.

203
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,490
What do you want?

204
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,080
Do you want me to join the Basketball Club again?

205
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,669
I told him

206
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,520
that I think you aren't qualified to train me.

207
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,370
It's not a matter of if I can do so. It's about whether you can or not.

208
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,909
The college basketball league is about to start.

209
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,939
Don't you want to compete with the best players in this city?

210
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:15,180
Don't keep hesitating.

211
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,710
Only by joining our club you can play in the league.

212
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,710
We really need you.

213
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,380
I'll take two more for my brothers.

214
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,740
No problem.

215
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,140
I'll fill out the form first, thanks.

216
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,320
See you on the basketball court!

217
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,459
Senior Shen, are you recruiting him for our club

218
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,660
or finding yourself a boyfriend?

219
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,650
Both. Can't I?

220

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,300
Surprise!

223
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,610
Hi.

224
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,759
Why are you here?

225
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,750
We came to see you.

226
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,420
Your work place is so nice.

227
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,149
Remember to give me a discount when I come to buy tapes later.

228
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,250
Not only a discount but I also give you a poster.

229
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,010
Okay.

230
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,910
Some new goods just came in. I haven't finished sorting them yet.

231
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,120
Both of you can go look around. If there's anything you like, just tell me.

232
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,519
Okay, go on and do your work.

233
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,170
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.

234
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,850
Xiaoju, you'll need to grasp the chance well.

235
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,510
Cheng Lang, let Xiaoju help you.

236
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,129
You're probably too busy if you do it yourself.

237
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,840
I am going to look for my idol's tapes.

238
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,860
What do you need help with? Let me help.

239
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,800
I don't need help with anything specific.

240
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,810
Look around and tell me if there's anything you like.

241
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,520
I'll give it to you for free.

242
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,080
It's okay, I...

243
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,150
Go on. Choose one.

Welcome. Hello, what can I help you with?

246
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:30,789
Can you help me find Jacky Cheung's album 'Jacky's Love Songs Collection?'

247
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:32,130
Okay.

248
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,330
I know where it is. Let me go get it.

249

This one?

250
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,400

253
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,279
We go to the same university.

254
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,220
Can we get to know each other?

255
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,450
This is my name and phone number.

256
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,900
Can you give me yours?

257
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,790
Sorry, it's not really convenient for me.

258
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,910
Take this back.

259
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,560
Bye.

260
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,080
Please come again.

261

Cheng Lang, it seems like there are many girls that are trying to hit on you.

262
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,550
There are not that many.

263
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,230
That means there are.

264
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,200
Nothing.

265
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:01,690
Cheng Lang, are you free tonight?

266
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,650
Tonight I'm going back to stay with my mom.

267
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,849
What's wrong? Is there something urgent?

268
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:09,790
I want to...

269
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,670
Nothing.

270
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,640

No, why? Wait!

- I saw it first.
- First come, first served!

"What first come, first served?" Do you understand what a gentleman is?

Do you understand, "A person of great moral stature doesn't take what others love?"

- You!
- What about it?

I don't want it!

Hurry and confess your feelings to Cheng Lang.

329
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,729
There are two more conditions in the magazine that I haven't reached yet.

330

And...

331
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,799
He said he's going home.

What a good chance this was!

333

If you can celebrate your birthday with him,

334
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,380
this matter might come true!

335
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,660

My dad.

339
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,679
He said he'd take my mom and me to travel.

340
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,309
He also said that it was rare that our family rarely fine time to travel together.

341
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,039
He said it was very urgent,

342
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,770
and I must go back tonight.

343
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,780
I told him, "I can't!"

344
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,429
"I have no time. I must celebrate Xiaoju's birthday with her."

No, you should hurry back!

Why do you have to be with me?

347

Xiaoju.

You can be with me any time, but it's rare for your parents to have time.

492
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Don't worry. Huang Jun that kid is quite smart.

493
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Now they may have already arrived at the campus on the motorcycle.

494
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,200
Xiaoju,

495
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,400
I'm sorry.

496
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,800
It's because of me that your birthday turned out like this.

497
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,400
It's okay.

498
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,300
I'm really happy that you remembered my birthday,

499
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:48,300
and this birthday is unforgettable, isn't it?

500
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,100
Isn't it?

501
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,700
All right, it's not safe here.

502
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,760
Let's hurry and go back to campus.

503
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,040
Let's go.

504
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,000
<i>[No.25 Girls' Dorm]</i>

505
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,600
Xiaoju, you're back.

506
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,200
Your mom's here. I took her to your room.

507
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,900
My mom?

508
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,500
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.

509
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,200
Xiaoju, you're back.

510
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,400
How has it been?

511
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,500
Are you used to living here at school?

512
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Have you been busy recently with your studies?

513
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,200
Today's your birthday.

514
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,400
I thought you'd come back home.

515
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,200
I cooked your favorite longevity noodles,

516
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
and red-dyed eggs,

517
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,400
but you didn't come home.

518
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,800
As a college student,

519
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,000
why are you still acting like a child? Having a temper

520
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,800
and leaving without a word?

521
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,600
Come have a look.

522
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,000
I brought some food for you.

523
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,900
Look. It's all your favorites.

524
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,800
And this,

525
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,800
look.

526
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,400
All your favorites.

527
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,200
What's wrong? Are you still angry at me?

528
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,200
I just said those things when I was angry.

529
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
I don't hate you at all.

530
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
It's you who dislikes me.

531
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,800
Nonsense!

532
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,400
How can I dislike you?

533
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,800
You're my daughter. You are my own child.

534
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,700
Eighteen years ago, who did I give birth to?

535
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,400
Your brother Jiashu is young,

536
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,900
so I normally care more about him.

537
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,800
But I have neglected you.

538
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,900
It's my fault.

539
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,200
I'll change from now on.

540
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,800
Mom, has Jiashu's head recovered?

541
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Last time I really didn't mean to push him.

542
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,200
I know.

543
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,100
He has recovered. He's okay.

544
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,700
Don't worry.`

545
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,200
All right, today's your birthday.

546
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,100
Have you had some cake?

547
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,000
Do you still want to eat these?

548
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,500
Happy birthday!

549
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,800
Happy 18th birthday!

550
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,400
Mom!

551
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,900
You silly girl.

552
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,200
You're my daughter.

553
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,500
How can I dislike you?

554
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,200
Mom, I'm sorry.

555
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,500
It's fine.

556
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,840
You don't need to apologize.
