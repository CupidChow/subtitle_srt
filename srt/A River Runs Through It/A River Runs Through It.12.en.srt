No, he is very unreliable.

Cheng Lang asked him to tell me something last time.

118
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,899
He completely forgot about it,

120

He must have forgotten because he was busy.

What about letting Shiyi ask Cheng Lang?

122

What I'm doing is none of your business.

167
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:02,070
Look.
<i>[To: Cheng Lang]</i>

168
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,930
How can you throw away other people's things?

169
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,029
Do you know who this belongs to? It's mine.

170
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:10,129
I can throw it away if I want to. It's not yours.

171
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,130
You can't do anything about it.

172
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,939
Mind your own business.

173
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,440
What is wrong with you?

174
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,269
That person is so frightening!

175
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,789
I was wondering why there wasn't any news from Cheng Lang's these couple of days.

176
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:25,740
She must have thrown it all away.

177
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,490
It took me a couple of nights to fold everything.

178
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,389
Detestable!

179
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,470
I should have ripped out all her hair just now!

180
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,590
<i>Why don't you try a different way to confess?</i>

181
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,389
<i>Never mind.</i>

182
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,029
I'll try after the sports league is over.

183
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,099
I don't want to distract him.

184
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,600
You always think of him.

185
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,570
If he didn't win first place, he would be letting you down.

186
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,739
My stars...

187
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,760
<i>It's all right.</i>

188
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,620
<i>Let's think of some other way.</i>

189
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,150
If she really confessed to me,

190
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,790
should I say yes or no?

191
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,950
Xia Xiaoju. Xia Xiaoju.

192
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,980
You really buried your thoughts so deep.

193
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,129
What are you doing this early?

194
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,160
Why aren't you sleeping?

195
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,300
I am meeting with Huang Jun.

196
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,270
You are meeting with Huang Jun?

197
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,150
Why?

198
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,349
I decided to take the initiative

199
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,149
and make him my boyfriend.

200
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,620
It will stop making my nights filled with dreams.

201
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,769
He is close with other girls. Aren't you jealous?

202
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,359
I believe that I can become the one for him.

203
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,199
I'm going to go. Bye bye.

204
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:40,060
Go back to sleep.

205
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,180
Come back soon!

206
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,860
I really admire her courage.

207
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,360
Do you envy her?

208
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,859
This is what youth is all about.

209
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,979
You should also go out and date.

210
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,460
Older Sister, you really scared me!

211
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,029
Why are you sitting this early in the morning and not sleeping?

212
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,829
Why aren't you dating?

213
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,589
I've had enough of the bitterness of love.

214
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,010
I don't want to go through it again.

215
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,629
Don't read this anymore.

216
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,500
You're obsessed. Hurry and get out of bed.

217
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,960
Let's go down to the canteen and get something to eat.

218
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,099
Bring me two steamed buns.

219
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,300
Bring me four.

220
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,519
My stomach hurts. My stomach hurts.

221
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,540
I have to go back to sleep.

222
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,759
It's so beautiful.

223
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,499
Where are we going?

224
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,059
I'm going to take you somewhere fun.

225
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,099
It has the most amazing views.

226
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,130
You will love it.

227
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,909
Don't think that we are just like Wah Dee and Jo Jo

228
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,430
in the movie of 'A Moment of Romance?'

229
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,850
Wah Dee, I really like you!

230
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,149
You only like Wah Dee?

231
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:57,330
I'm also handsome.

232
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,670
Hold me tightly. I'm going to speed up.

233
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,540
Watch out.

234
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,739
Are you okay?

235
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:21,500
Let me help you.

236
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,120
I got it. I got it

237
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,979
Are you okay?

238
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:27,910
Are you hurt anywhere?

239
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,470
Your leg.

240
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:40,030
<i>[Jiangzhou Hospital - Outpatient Clinic]</i>

241
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,829
I don't think we should go in empty-handed.

242
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,469
Why don't we go buy some fruits?

243
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,299
He originally wasn't hurt that bad.

244
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,949
He wanted to be hospitalized for the convenience of dating.

245
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,469
It's already good enough that I have come here to see him and bring him clothes.

246
00:15:58,469 --> 00:15:59,619
Buy him fruits?

247
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,620
Go yourself if you want to!

248
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,829
Bad tempered!

249
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,100
Don't worry about him. Let's go.

250
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,280
Let's take a look over there.

251
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,610
This leaf looks all right.

252
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,150
I'm too short to reach.

253
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,130
Don't jump like that. Here. Look at me.

254
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,899
You have to use your waist strength.

255
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,259
What was your jump?

256
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,850
You even stomped your foot before you jumped.

257
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,350
Are you performing magic?
<i>(T/N: A Chinese magic curse that is equivalent to the Western saying of "Abracadabra.")</i>

258
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,030
- I'll try it myself.
- Have a try.

259
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,489
I can't reach it.

260
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,019
All right, all right. Don't keep jumping.

261
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,289
If you injured your ligament, you would be a second Huang Jun.

262
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,749
Here. This is for you.

263
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:23,950
It's prettier than mine.

264
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,510
Are you satisfied?

265
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,550
Yes.

266
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,070
Let's go.

267
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,499
Where is my guitar? And where's my stereo?

268
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,469
Say something.

269
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,350
I thought I told you to bring them to me. What's the matter?

270
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,709
I think you look like a guitar!

271
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,749
Tell me.

272
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,999
Why did hurt yourself when the league is coming up very soon?

273
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:17,900
Who will take the guard position?

274
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,709
I am asking you. Wh-Wh-Who will take the guard position?

275
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,749
Let me speak. It hurts!

276
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,850
- You...
- It hurts.

277
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,860
Huang Jun.

278
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,850
- You're here.
- Taotao.

279
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,629
Why did you need to buy fruits?

280
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,419
- Give it to me.
- Shiyi bought it.

281
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,300
I just did the legwork.

282
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,159
I knew Shiyi treats me well!

283
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,960
- You stay back from me.
- I'm okay.

284
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,750
- Are you feeling better now?
- It hurts! It hurts! Don't move it!

285
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,419
Is it that bad?

286
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,659
Yes.

287
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,359
The doctor said I have to be hospitalized for a few more days.

288
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,899
Here, look here.

289
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,860
Come here.

290
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,380
It's okay. It's okay. I'll be fine in a few days.

291
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,229
I'm okay. Don't worry.

292
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,139
He's fine. Don't worry.

293
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,379
Thanks to Le Tao's care;

294
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:05,430
otherwise, I could have lost this leg.

295
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,509
Y-Y-You guys must be thirsty.

296
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,750
Let me get you some water.

297
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,989
Wait for me.

298
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,589
I will also go.

299
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,419
Le Tao, hot water, please.

300
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,860
Okay.

301
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,320
Hot water, please?

302
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,810
Hurry. Hurry. Give me the bananas.

303
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,259
Look at you.

304
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,379
Your face is going crooked from all that smiling.

305
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,989
Tell me about it.

306
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,480
How far along are you?

307
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,469
What nonsense are you talking about?

308
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,949
We're just normal classmates now.

309
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,019
Normal classmates?

310
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,509
Look at what you're doing.

311
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,059
You're acting like his girlfriend, okay?

312
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,469
No.

313
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,829
We never confessed to

314
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,379
each other,

315
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,749
so you can't say we are boyfriend and girlfriend.

316
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,229
At best,

317
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,630
we're a little closer than normal friends.

318
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,929
Qiu Le Tao. Listen to me.

319
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,469
This is the highest state in love.

320
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,899
And it is also the best part of love.

321
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:36,399
At this time, even if you two touch your fingers together gently,

322
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:38,419
you both will blush,

323
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,460
and your heartbeat will get faster.

324
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,130
It's like that?

325
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,909
Don't tell me you not confessing to Cheng Lang yet,

326
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:49,779
was to maintain this highest state?

327
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,019
Don't laugh at me.

328
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,110
You know I clearly don't have the courage to.

329
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,550
I am so done with you.

330
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,659

<i>Fighting JU!</i>

491
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,409
<i>- Cheng Lang was double-teamed again.</i>
- Here, here.

492
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:02,559
<i>But No. 11 Lu Shiyi is very clever.</i>

493
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,540
<i>He is directly asking for the ball.</i>

494
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,709
<i>When JUT is double-teaming Cheng Lang,</i>

495
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,869
<i>- the other players have an easy chance to score.</i>
- We scored!

496
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,279
<i>How about this defense?</i>

497
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,349
<i>Well played!</i>

498
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,799
<i>Liu Yang goes for a steal.</i>

499
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,350
<i>Fast break.</i>

500
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,419
Hurry up. Fast break.

501
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,259
<i>Lu Shiyi played dribble breakthroughs for a while,</i>

502
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,330
<i>helping JU continuously narrow the gap.</i>

503
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,629
<i>When the core guard Cheng Lang was restrained,</i>

504
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,509
<i>luckily No. 11 Lu Shiyi came forward.</i>

505
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,539
<i>All right. The third round has ended.</i>

506
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,029
<i>The score is thirty five to forty three.</i>

507
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,190
<i>JU is 8 points adrift of JUT now.</i>

508
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,479
<i>If JU wants to turn the tables in the next round,</i>

509
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:52,919
<i>their two key players, Cheng Lang and Lu Shiyi, have to think of something.</i>

510
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,539
What defense did you do?

511
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,669
Such a tall guy stood there for a while. Why didn't you drive him out?

512
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:59,379
Position three and four, remember to switch.

513
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:00,949
Don't just stand there.

514
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,829
Switch.

515
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,509
Cheng Lang has no chance to score.

516
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,779
Their number eighteen keeps teaming him.

517
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,769
Now you two have to pick and roll for Shiyi.

518
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,469
Make chances for him to score a basket.

519
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,499
- I think he could make several jump shots.
- Okay.

520
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:13,949
We can make a couple baskets.

521
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,379
We'll change the way we train. We change according to the situation.

522
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,709
Let them be unprepared so we can finish the game.

523
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:22,979
That's the only way. It's just that person from JUT is so annoying.

524
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,509
He keeps marking Cheng Lang.

525
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,229
Cheng Lang can't even throw the ball.

526
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,179
There's no way to play to our strengths.

527
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,069
Given this, I'm sure they have made a plan to specifically deal with me and Shiyi.

528
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:34,099
If we keep doing what we're doing, it's hard for us to even score in the last ten minutes.

529
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,539
How about this?

530
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,019
Qiu Yu can body his way in.

531
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,409
He's a lot more explosive than I am, especially in speed.

532
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:40,899
He could be a temporary partner for Shiyi.

533
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,179
We have a better chance of scoring this way.

534
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,529
What do you think?

535
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:46,019
Qiu Yu, how's your leg?

536
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,920
It's all right. I'll block him.

537
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,299
Okay. You can have a rest.

538
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,379
It's up to you, Qiu Yu.

539
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,469
- Okay.
- Okay.

540
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,789
Qiu Yu, fighting!

541
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:56,450
Xiaoju.

542
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,849
Lin You, what took you so long? The game is almost over.

543
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:01,489
Come here. Sit.

544
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,240
- Sit down.
- I was delayed on the way here.

545
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,930
What is going on now?

546
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,090
Our opponent is really strong.

547
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,989
But we're not bad either.

548
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,309
<i>All right, after the break,</i>

549
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,520
<i>the two sides come to the crucial fourth round.</i>

550
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,419
Where is Cheng Lang?

551
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:19,099
I don't know. He was just here.

552
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,750
Is he not going to play this round?

553
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,020
It's tactic adjustment.

554
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,299
Didn't you notice that big guy on the other side has been defending against Cheng Lang?

555
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:29,769
Cheng Lang is good at long shots, not from the inside.

556
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:31,659
If the big guy keeps teaming him,

557
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,419
he won't have any scoring opportunities.

558
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,170
He has no advantage.

559
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,579
That's why the coach had to make a switch at the last minute.

560
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,550
It's a tactic.

561
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,930
There's this much strategy in here?

562
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,029
Huang Jun, you know a lot about this.

563
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,570
If I were there, we would have won a long time ago.

564
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,979
<i>Without Cheng Lang, the pressure of scoring fell on Lu Shiyi.</i>

565
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,619
<i>With only one pillar there,</i>

566
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,830
<i>it's hard for other members of the JU team to back him up.</i>

567
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,050
Changing the players isn't working.

568
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,340
<i>They can only depend on Lu Shiyi.</i>

569
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,189
<i>Under pressure, Lu Shiyi should have a turnover.</i>

570
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:09,099
<i>- Such an unnecessary turnover at this time could be fatal.</i>
- Defense!

571
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:11,139
<i>Let's see how Lu Shiyi is going to make this up.</i>

572
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,480
<i>Lu Shiyi got the speed advantage.</i>

573
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,910
<i>He jumped before the other side shoots.</i>

574
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,709
<i>- He blocked JUT's shot with one hand.</i>
- Hurry and block!

575
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,389
<i>We only see this kind of defense in the professional basketball league.</i>

576
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,099
Datu, fighting!

577
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,820
You said you would win.

578
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,029
Fighting! Fighting!

579
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,580
JU, fighting!

580
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:44,910
Fighting!

581
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,410
Fighting!

582
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,620
<i>The block shot that Lu Shiyi made</i>

583
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,339
<i>seems to work the crowd in this gym all of a sudden.</i>

584
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,890
<i>JU sounds the horn of combat.</i>

585
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,819
<i>JU, fighting!</i>

586
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,839
<i>Of course, Lu Shiyi keeps pushing.</i>

587
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,229
<i>He continued to use his breaks</i>

588
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,050
<i>to help JU to narrow the score gap.</i>

589
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,990
<i>Lu Shiyi crossed over a defensive.</i>

590
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,469
<i>He ran into low post again.</i>

591
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,709
<i>Bank shot!</i>

592
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,179
<i>Down by eight points,</i>

593
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,370
<i>JU entered the fourth round.</i>

594
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,680
<i>Here is the match point with the help of Lu Shiyi.</i>

595
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,540
<i>It's fifty two to fifty three now.</i>

596
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,570
<i>Here comes the last minute of the game.</i>

597
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,419
<i>Lu Shiyi. A turnover in handling.</i>

598
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,619
<i>A steal by the other side.</i>

599
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,950
<i>Letting the opposing team take the ball at this point is very fatal.</i>

600
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,229
<i>The leading JUT is on defense.</i>

601
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,900
<i>Only 30 seconds left.</i>

602
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,100
Back up. Hurry up.

603
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,340
<i>JUT is trying to run the time out.</i>

604
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,180
It's almost over.

605
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,139
<i>To the three-point line.</i>

606
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,140
<i>Break from low post.</i>

607
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,099
<i>No. 11 Lu Shiyi showed us a block again.</i>

608
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,029
Shiyi, fighting!

609
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,850
<i>Fifteen seconds left.</i>

610
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,339
<i>Trailing by one point, JU has the last chance to win.</i>

611
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,900
<i>Let's see how their last offense plays out.</i>

612
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,450
<i>Lu Shiyi is taking the ball.</i>

613
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:40,180
♫ <i>Why have I again started, but not finished?</i> ♫

614
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:46,960
♫ <i>The ordinary I never admit, but suddenly I slightly acknowledge</i> ♫

615
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,710
♫ <i>Why do the tears cause what is before my eyes to blur?</i> ♫

616
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,950
♫ <i>Hearing the sound of my beating heart with the urge to turn around and go against the winds</i> ♫

617
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,460
<i>There's not much time.</i>

618
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,440
<i>Two seconds left.</i>

619
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,610
♫ <i>What is in the heart that causes a fierce wind to surge?</i> ♫

620
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,620
<i>Lu Shiyi chose to go into the crowd.</i>

621
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,969
<i>A crossover move. He crossed over the first defensive.</i>

622
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:17,330
<i>A nice spin move.</i>

623
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,680
<i>He jumped up on the free throw lane.</i>

624
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,320
<i>One-handed jam.</i>

625
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,900
<i>He will dunk the ball.</i>

626
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,270
<i>A beautiful knockout!</i>

627
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,659
<i>Congratulations to Jiangzhou University.</i>

628
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,269
<i>They took people's breath away in the very last second,</i>

629
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,819
<i>defeating the Jiangzhou University of Technology.</i>

630
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,509
<i>Who would have thought once trailing by eight points,</i>

631
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,379
<i>Jiangzhou University showed us their first lead at the last minute?</i>

632
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,749
<i>- The championship of Jiangzhou College Basketball League</i>
- We won!

633
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,709
<i>and the gorgeous moment of triumph</i>

634
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,790
<i>belong to Jiangzhou University!</i>

635
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,109
Hurry up! Do you still want to eat?

636
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,509
Qiu Yu passed the ball really well.

637
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,030
- I think Shiyi's dunk was so amazing!
- Yes.

638
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,069
Hello, Xiaoju.

639
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,339
You guys did great today.

640
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,520
Thank you. Thank you.

641
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,870
Shiyi did most of the work. Shiyi is great.

642
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,789
I'm g-going upstairs.

643
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,030
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

644
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,060
Don't turn around.

645
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,179
I-I'm afraid when you turned around,

646
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,620
I wouldn't have the courage to say it.

647
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:30,330
I-I-I like you.

648
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,760
I've always really liked you.

649
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,469
At first, I thought

650
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,899
I-I could just look at you silently from behind,

651
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,229
but I found I really can't do that.

652
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,139
From getting up to going to bed every day,

653
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,949
all I think about is you whenever I have the time.

654
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:49,600
I want to stay with you every day.

655
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,709
You...

656
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,450
I know this is very sudden for you.

657
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,280
B-But you don't have to answer right now.

658
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,000
I-I-I'm waiting for you

659
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,070
no matter how long it will take.

660
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,130
Cheng Lang.

661
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,340
Xiaoju, what are you doing here?

662
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,859
No, wait...

663
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,789
Why are you here?

664
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,379
I'm going to the locker room.

665
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,579
Are you okay?

666
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,660
I...

667
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:59,950
♫ <i>There you are, running wildly through the highlands</i> ♫

668
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:07,410
♫ <i>Another you is sighing silently</i> ♫

669
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:14,509
♫ <i>No one is able to understand you</i> ♫

670
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:22,110
♫ <i>Happiness is not transparent and pain is not thorough</i> ♫

671
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:30,270
♫ <i>I'm glad you're not willing to give up like this</i> ♫

672
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:38,370
♫ <i>It hurts to see the stubbornness in your eyes</i> ♫

673
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:43,850
♫ <i>I'm a bit tired and need to rest</i> ♫

674
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:51,050
♫ <i>The marks we leave in life</i> ♫

675
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:58,750
♫ <i>How I wish to travel everywhere with you</i> ♫

676
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:06,050
♫ <i>To find the meaning of my existence along the way</i> ♫

677
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:14,010
♫ <i>The hard journey of life lets the soul recuperate</i> ♫

678
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:22,560
♫ <i>Be brave and find yourself</i> ♫

679
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:36,570
♫ <i>The red, green, and black colors of the forest</i> ♫

680
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:51,030
♫ <i>The purity, joy, and freedom of oneself</i> ♫

681
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:59,690
♫ <i>I wish for you to see clearly</i> ♫

682
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:15,930
♫ <i>The true you within all the dust</i> ♫
