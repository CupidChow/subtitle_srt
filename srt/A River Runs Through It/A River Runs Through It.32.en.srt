00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,379
Why do you want to drink all of a sudden?

4
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:37,280
Can you even drink?

5
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,740
You can always carry me back.

6
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,490
Is everything okay with... you and Lin You?

7
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,770
We're fine.

8
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,800
I'm just thinking.

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,920
Sometimes, emotions are like playing doubles.

10
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,360
Both sides have to decide if it's good.

11
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,870
It doesn't count if it's only one person.

12
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,339
Yes. It's between two people.

13
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,450
If only one person puts all their heart in,

14
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,530
they're the only ones amused in the end.

15
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,780
The other person is completely indifferent.

16
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,860
And sometimes, she even thinks you're annoying.

17
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,500
You and Lin You have been dating for two years already.

18
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,769
To be honest, sometimes when you two got lovey-dovey,

19
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,240
I felt more disgusted compared to Huang Jun.

20
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,500
So you're not amusing yourself.

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,760
Lin You likes you.

22
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,270
Sometimes, I can't understand her.

23
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,450
I suggest you...

24
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,270
have a conversation with Yuan Ancheng.

25
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,340
He obviously is causing trouble by coming back now.

26
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,570
Tell him to go back to where he belongs.

27
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,620
If you really love Lin You,

28
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,450
be firm.

29
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,719
I know what to do.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,660
I believe in you.

31
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,780
I absolutely won't break up with Lin You.

34
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,710
<i>Cheng Lang, this is Yuan Ancheng.</i>

35
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,540
<i>Do you have time to meet with me tomorrow?</i>

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,370
About that matter,

37
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,710
that hug... It was only my own wishful thinking.

38
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,929
It had nothing to do with her.

39
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:30,060
She only protected me because my hand was injured.

40
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,620
I hope you don't blame her.

41
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,720
I just don't understand.

42
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,540
You chose to leave back then.

43
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,499
But why have you come back to harass her now?

44
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,420
What happened between us was a misunderstanding.

45
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,220
Compared to being with her...

46
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,860
I would rather she'll be happy.

47
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,679
You should never have left if you wanted the best for her.

48
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,380
Even more so, you shouldn't have come back now.

49
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,180
What? Do you want to make yourself out to be

50
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,220
as a saint who only wants good things for her?

51
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,070
If you have enough trust in her,

52
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,260
whether I returned or not and what we did,

53
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,389
wouldn't have made you that angry yesterday.

54
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,740
You're afraid.

55
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,349
Afraid that she'd give up on you and choose me.

56
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,060
Listen, Yuan Ancheng!

57
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,940
I've been with Lin You for almost three years.

58
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,539
You broke up with her like it was a joke. It was me...

59
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:20,060
It was me who helped her through that painful time.

60
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,280
Even if you've known her longer than me,

61
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,279
I did as much as you for her.

62
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,820
You keep saying how much you did for her,

63
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,380
but why are you trying to forcefully keep her by your side

64
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,640
and not let her go study abroad now?

65
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,359
I never stopped her from going abroad.

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,320
But I heard she has already given up her opportunity to study abroad.

67
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,390
You keep saying how much you did for her.

68
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,160
But do you know how much she has done to accommodate you?

69
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,129
How many things has she given up for you?

70
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,230
Including now!

71
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,900
That day...

72
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,240
I didn't mean to protect him.

73
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,530
It was because he had a tendon fracture.

74
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,200
So...

75
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,890
you knew a long time ago that he was back?

76
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,219
- Iㅡ
- The past couple of days, you were acting quite strange.

77
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,260
Was it because of him?

78
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,440
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,250
You told me you wanted to turn down the chance to go study abroad yesterday.

80
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,420
Actually, it wasn't because you were reluctant to leave me,

81
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,870
but because you're afraid, right?

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,080
You're afraid you'll change your mind when we are apart.

83
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,260
You're afraid to face Yuan Ancheng alone abroad.

84
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,920
Is that right?

Lin You.

86

Listen. I, Cheng Lang,

87
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,410
will never ask you to give up on anything for me.

88
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,450
And I don't want you to feel guilty.

89
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,790
I just want you to be happy.

90
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,750
No matter what the end result is,

91
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,940
I can accept it.

92
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,510

Do your best.

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,900
Senior Sister, are you not coming with us?

96
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,980
Not this time.

00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:11,480
Okay.

100
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,010
Let's go.

101
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,400
Lin You...

102
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,830
I'm not the person involved, so I'm not qualified to say anything.

103
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,859
But as a friend of both, you and Cheng Lang,

104
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:26,249
I must remind you.

105
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:28,959
There's no other Cheng Lang in the world.

106
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,959
So you know everything?

107
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,939
You were so upset when you broke up with Yuan Ancheng.

108
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:36,149
Who helped you out of your difficult position?

109
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,399
Now he came back.

110
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,559
No matter how guilty he felt about what he did

111
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,539
and how much he wants you back, how could you leave Cheng Lang like that?

112
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:45,510
Don't you know how much he loves you?

113
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,900
Of course, I know.

114
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,499
When Yuan Ancheng just came back,

115
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,050
I wanted to stay by Cheng Lang's side for all 24 hours

116
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,179
so Yuan Ancheng wouldn't get any chances.

117
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:02,170
But later, I realized...

118
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,510
I was afraid I'd change my mind.

119

I am unable to completely understand your dilemma.

122
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,399
But for this matter, I really hope you can think clearly about it.

123
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,340
I also wish I could be like you

124
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,520

I shouldn't have kept your secret.

134
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,250
But things regarding emotions,

135
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,200
you can lie to others.

136
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,340
But you can't lie to yourself.

137

I still don't want you to leave.

I'll take good care of myself.

The founder of Chinese Yellow Pages.

He saw the website I made and is very interested.

He wants to start a business with me.

I'm still considering it. I'll answer him tomorrow.

He seems to be alright,

Aren't you also worried about him?

Can you not think like that?

238
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,000
But you'll have to make a decision.

239
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,500
Cheng Lang went to discuss developing a website with someone in Pozhou.

253
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,800
Consider?

254
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,100

Then give me some time to discuss it with my family.

All right, go and discuss with them.

A company liked the online shopping website I made.

274
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,000
So I decided to accept Niu Yu's invitation and start a business with him.

286
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,900
Do you know what clothes you should take?

You can do anything for me,

but you can't accept my feelings for you.

301

I always treated you as my family, just like Shiyi.

302

You are like my sister and brother.

303
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,000
In the end,

304
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,000
you don't like me.

Besides, you don't like me.

308
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,600
I, Xia Xiaoju, can't keep hanging onto you, right?

309
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,000
To be honest, I am really grateful.

310

Without you and Shiyi,

311
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,600
I wouldn't be who I am today.

312
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
So no matter what happens,

313
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't want to lose my friendship with you and Shiyi.

314
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,500
You and Shiyi will always be the most important people in my life.

315
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,600
It's boiling. Hurry and eat.

316
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,100
Eat.

317
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Here. Add some shrimp.

318
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,500
Are you really going to study abroad?

What about Xiaoju?

320

No.

322
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,800
What's wrong with you two?

323
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,800
How long were you guys together, yet you have fought like that?

324
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,400
Do you still like her?

Then go and coax her.

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,200
You're a man. There's no shame in it.

328
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,400
Don't regret it after you lose her like I did.

329
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,200
If you leave without making up with her,

330
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
you two... are completely over.

331
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,000
Take it easy.

332
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,500
Look, there's sauce on your shirt.

333
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,800
My shirt.

334
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,700
Luckily, my roommate's girlfriend left an apron here.

335
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,600
She used it for laundry. Don't get it too dirty.

336
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,400
Here, your neck.

337
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,100
Hands.

338
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,600
Cheng Lang.

339
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,200
♫ <i>There you are, running wildly through the highlands</i> ♫

340
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:17,800
♫ <i>Another you is sighing silently</i> ♫

341
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:23,800
♫ <i>No one is able to understand you</i> ♫

342
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:31,800
♫ <i>Happiness is not transparent and pain is not thorough</i> ♫

343
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,400
♫ <i>I'm glad you're not willing to give up like this</i> ♫

344
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:47,000
♫ <i>It hurts to see the stubbornness in your eyes</i> ♫

345
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,300
♫ <i>I'm a bit tired and need to rest</i> ♫

346
00:28:53,300 --> 00:29:00,600
♫ <i>The marks we leave in life</i> ♫

347
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:08,200
♫ <i>How I wish to travel everywhere with you</i> ♫

348
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,400
♫ <i>To find the meaning of my existence along the way</i> ♫

349
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:23,400
♫ <i>The hard journey of life lets the soul recuperate</i> ♫

350
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:31,800
♫ <i>Be brave and find yourself</i> ♫

351
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:45,600
♫ <i>The red, green, and black colors of the forest</i> ♫

352
00:29:46,800 --> 00:30:01,600
♫ <i>The purity, joy, and freedom of oneself</i> ♫

353
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:09,200
♫ <i>I wish for you to see clearly</i> ♫

354
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:22,300
♫ <i>The true you within all the dust</i> ♫
