Sorry, I am not interested.

Xiaoju, look!

6
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,430
Taotao, this conch is so pretty!

7
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,368
And this one!

8
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:37,550
All of these are really pretty.

9
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,260
It really is true.

10
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,310
What should I do? I want them all.

11
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,340
I want to buy all of them!

12

No wonder people say a women equals 500 ducks.

Do you want a beating?

Do as you wish. As you wish.

16
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,360
Taotao! Does this look good?

17
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,410
- Is it pretty?
- It's very pretty!

18
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,580
Madam, how much is this?

19
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,680
Five yuan.

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,450
So expensive.

21
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,340
That hair clip looks really ugly,

22
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,130
but it does quite suit you.

Taotao, let's go.

25
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:16,440
I was telling the truth. Why did she get angry?

26
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,110
How about going there with us?

27
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,530
I will pass. I will just hang out here.

28
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,800
I will get going then.

29

You don't need to wait for me. Go where you want to go.

Though it's a bit ugly,

35
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,620
it really does suit her.

- Right.

Xiao Ju, have you thought of when you would tell Cheng Lang that you like him?

39
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,110
How could that happen?

40
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,980
Stop talking nonsense.

41
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,390
Besides, it's not possible for Cheng Lang to like me.

42
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,440
Why can't it be possible?

43
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,550
You just aren't confident enough in yourself.

I don't like Cheng Lang.

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,630
Can you two actually do that? It's almost dark.

49
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,290
When can the tent be ready?

50
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,830
Let me tell you. I've done this many times before.

51
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,970
Hurry and continue with what you are working on. You're wasting time.

52
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,810
You'd better hurry and finish.

We have to build a fire soon.

55
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,650
My side is finished.

56
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,860
Cheng Lang, we might need some more firewood.

57
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,320
Why don't you and Xiaoju go to the Baisha beach nearby to look for some more?

58
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,120
Xiaoju, let's go over there to look for some more firewood.

Xiaoju, the place you chose is really nice.

62
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,110
You must have put a lot of thought into it.

63
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,660
I just want everyone to have fun,

64
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,720
but I feel that I still haven't done a good job.

65
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,350
Idiot.

66
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,070
Are you still thinking about that matter?

67
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,320
Haven't you already perfectly solved it?

68
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,220
I suddenly find this trip to be exciting and beautiful.

69
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,250
It's essentially perfect.

70
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,040
How about we play a game together?

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,780
- All right.
- All right. Sounds good!

72
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,260
How about Truth or Dare?

73
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,550
I agree. I'll give everyone a card.

74
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,170
The one who gets the largest number has to do the Truth or Dare.

75
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,270
Cheng Lang. Taotao. Xiaoju.

Shiyi.

77
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,240
Three, two, one. Show your cards.

78
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,270
I definitely lost.

79
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,630
Mine is K.

80
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,640
Cheng Lang, Truth or Dare?

81
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,340
- I'll choose...
- Dare.

82
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,620
I know every single thing about him from when he wore open-crotch pants (for toddlers) to now.

83
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,060
There's nothing to ask.

84
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,480
- Dare!
- All right then.

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,200
Since Shiyi said Dare, Dare it is.

86
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,070
You guys chose dare.

87
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,510
How about this?

88
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,320
Let's pass for this round.

89
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,880
Cheng Lang and the person who is chosen in the next round will do a Dare together.

90
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,230
And the Dare is

91
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,210
Cheng Lang will carry the next person like a princess around the beach.

92
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,820
- That's good!
- Nice!

93
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,390
I have no problem with it.

94
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,640
Baobao, give me the cards.

95
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,800
Let me deal cards this round.

96
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,840
Xiaoju, this is yours.

97
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,550
Come on, let's give a toast.

98
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,900
Shiyi, yours.

99
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,790
Baobao. Baobao, yours.

100
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,220
What? Do you want to peek at my card?

101
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,600
I didn't peek at your card.

102
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,940
I'm getting something to eat.

103
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,980
Xia Xiaoju, are you trying to take advantage of Shiyi?

104
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,840
Are you asking for another beating?

105
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,830
It's you who talks too much!

106
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,100
I was kidding! I'll stop.

107
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,110
All right, my dear friends,

108
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,560
please show your cards.

109
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
K!

110
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,280
- Princess carry!
- Princess carry!

111
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,270
Fine!

112
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,470
- Princess carry!
- Princess carry!

113
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,300
Look carefully. One, two, three. Go!

114
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,600
- We're off!
- Don't go into the ocean.

115
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,616
- You're so heavy!
- No, you are!

116
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:36,660
I even lost some weight these past couple of days.

117
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,340
One, two, three.

118
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,480
Done.

119
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,830
Hurry. Let's continue.

120
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,830
- Let's continue.
- Continue.

121
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,830
Yours. This is yours.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,070
Three, two, one. Show your cards.

123
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,550
Xiaoju, Truth or Dare?

124
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Truth.

125
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,250
Let me ask.

126
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,130
Do you... have someone you like?

127
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,830
Who is he?

128
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,540
Who's he?

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
Yes.

130
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,910
I like Li Ming.
<i>(T/N: A singer and actor who's also known as Leon Lai).</i>

131
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,420
Celebrities don't count.

132
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,350
- Then...
- Remember. It must be the truth.

133
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,460
I like... Cheng Lang.

134
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,440
Don't misunderstand me.

135
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,510
I mean the Cheng Lang in the TV series "The Breaking Point."

136
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,690
I've already told you that you can't say a celebrity.

137
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,080
That's not a celebrity.

138
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,830
It's merely a role.

139
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,960
Is our Cheng Lang okay for you?

140
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,450
Stop messing around.

141
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,760
Baobao, stop joking.

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,220
Let me open it for you. Here.

143
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,320
No need.

144
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,220
Let's continue!

145
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,440
Three, two, one.

146
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,240
Show your cards!

147
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,690
Cheng Lang. You are really good!

148
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,340
Truth or Dare?

149
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,080
How about singing a song?

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,130
Lu Shiyi!

151
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,710
- Cheng Lang, sing!
- Cheng Lang, sing!

152
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,420
Cheng Lang, sing!

153
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,470
I really am tone deaf.

154
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,520
My singing sounds really bad.

155
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,030
Tone deaf? What's there to be afraid of?

156
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,110
I am also tone deaf.

157
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,420
Here, let me sing for you.

158
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,860
Good brother!

159
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,400

168
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,150
Why?

169
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,980
Do we die if we don't take the exam?

170
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,320
Even if I, Bao Xiangxiang,

171
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,520
can't go to any university. What's wrong with that?

172
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,400
I, Bao Xiangxiang, can still create a new future for myself!

173
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,200
♪ I still have a dream for tomorrow ♪

174
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,790
♪ My heart never stops beating ♪

175
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,860
♪ Beating along while chasing dreams ♪

176
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,780
- Good!
- Nice, Baobao!

177
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,660
What are you two blindly shouting about?

178
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,100
Let me tell you. I dislike people like the two of you the most!

179
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,280
Lu Shiyi, you only studied for three months,

180
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,380
but you got such good test results.

181
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,690
And you, Cheng Lang,

182
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,710
you missed one exam, but you still got a higher score than I did.

183
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,250
- Baobao.
- Baobao.

184
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,890
However, Shiyi,

185
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,030
you'll always be my very best brother!

186
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,110
And Cheng Lang,

187
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,740
you'll always be the one I admire most.

188
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,280
All of you will always be my best friends.

189
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,244
Come. Let's sing together.

190
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,000
- Okay.
- Good. Let's do that.

191
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:58,996
♫ <i>Looking up at the sky in a world with people coming and going</i> ♫

192
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,904
♫ <i>The time to shine is different because of our bravery</i> ♫

193
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:10,548
♫ <i>Every minute and second is on the road</i> ♫

194
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:13,632
♫ <i>Facing our hopes \</i> ♫

195
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:17,120
♫ <i>and hugging kindness</i> ♫

196

♫ <i>Our toys from youth were worn out</i> ♫

197
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,500
♫ <i>Life is like a dream inside a fragment</i> ♫

198
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,210
Soon, everyone will be going their separate ways.

199
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,200
We won't. We'll all still be in Jiangzhou.

200
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,500
Taotao, I'm leaving.

201
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,360
Where are you going?

202
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,870
- Baobao?
- Yes?

203
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,830
Could he be sleep talking?

204
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,650
Most likely.

205
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,540
It's almost dawn. How about we don't go to sleep?

206
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,670
Let's go see the sunrise on the mountain later.

207
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,230
It's so late now. Are you still not going to sleep? I'm so sleepy.

208
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,590
Me, too.

209
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,430
Are you really not going to look? Didn't you say you wanted to make me happy?

210
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,180
Didn't you say it yourself just now? You're already very happy.

211
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,064
How else do you want to be happy?

212
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:15,390
Baobao, get up. Let's go to sleep!

213
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,280
- Xiaoju.
- Baobao.

214
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,080
Let's go to sleep, too.

215
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,440
Are you really not going?

216
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Hurry and stand up!

217
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
You really won't go?

218
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,450
Hurry and go to sleep!

219
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,850
Hey!

220
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,930
Why are you guys being so pragmatic?

221
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,780
My bed!

222
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,700
Actually, I can accompany you.

223
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,960
Xiaoju, what are you doing? Hurry and come in.

224
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,180
Hurry, let's sleep.

225
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,100
Xiaoju?

226
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,590
Xiaoju, what's wrong?

227
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,000
My stomach hurts.

228
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,200
Your stomach hurt?

229
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,310
I may have caught a cold last night.

230
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,740
Come. I will take you to find a clinic.

231
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,500
No.

232
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,720
Aren't you going to watch the sunrise?

233
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,440
You're already like this. What sunrise is there to see?

234
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,830
Wait here for me. I'll get Shiyi's wallet.

235
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,020
Does it still hurt?

236
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Take these two pills.

237
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,450
It might be a bit bitter.

238
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,140
Drink slowly. It's a bit hot.

239
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,190
So cold?

240
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,030
It's quite windy by the sea at night.

241
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,220
You mustn't catch another cold.

242
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,340
I would've never guessed that you, young man, are quite good at taking care of others.

243
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,050
You treat your girlfriend quite well.

244
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,930
Well... Doctor, I'm very sorry

245
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,410
for waking you up so late at night. Sorry.

246
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,500
It's okay. It's fine. It'll be done in an hour.

247
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,370
It's still early.

248
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,150
You can still get some rest once we get back.

249
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,860
It's okay. I'm not sleepy.

250
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,680
I'm just worried that

251
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,090
the money we have left won't be enough to buy return tickets.

252
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:31,610
There will always be a way. Don't worry about it for now.

253
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,390
Sunrise!

254
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,540
Cheng Lang! You finally saw the sunrise you wanted to see!

255
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,790
- Have you found them yet?
- Not yet.

256
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,710
What should we do?

257
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,770
They disappeared and our money is also missing.

258
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,830
Where did they go?

259
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,750
Maybe they went to buy breakfast.

260
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,760
They're back!

261
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,460
- Cheng Lang!
- Xiaoju!

262
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,500
Is everyone already up?

263
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,730
What happened? Where did you go without telling anyone?

264
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,030
That's right. When I woke up, I found out you were gone.

265
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,680
I was so scared.

266
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,310
Last night, my stomach hurt.

267
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,710
Cheng Lang accompanied me to the clinic.

268
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,010
How do you feel now?

269
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,180
Are you all right?

270
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,760
I was given IV. I'm all right now.

271
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,210
But... I used all our money for buying return tickets.

272
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,520
It's fine.

273
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,020
We can always think of a way even without money.

274
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,230
Where's Baobao?

275
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,720
Why isn't he with you?

276
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,950
- Baobao?
- Baobao?

277
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,000
Baobao wasn't with us.

278
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,750
Where did Baobao go?

279
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:57,810
- Baobao!
- Baobao!

280
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,050
Bao Xiangxiang!

281
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,950
Baobao! Baobao!

282
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,520
- You check over there. I'll go this way!
- All right.

283
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,910
- Baobao!
- Baobao!

284
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,130
Baobao!

285
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,390
- Baobao!
- Baobao!

286
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,300

287
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,800
Shiyi! Xiaoju! Hurry, come here!

288
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,810
It's Baobao's letter!

289
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,140
<i>[Bao Xiangxiang]</i>

<i>I'm going to make a living in Shenzhen.</i>

301
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:09,120
<i>The reason why I didn't say goodbye in person</i>

302
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,450
<i>is that I'm afraid that the scene would be too sorrowful,</i>

303
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,800
<i>so I chose to write this letter</i>

304
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,970
<i>to say goodbye to you.</i>

305
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,780
<i>Time has gone by quickly.</i>

306
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,880
<i>Do you remember when we were in our sophomore year?</i>

307
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,830
<i>I was bullied.</i>

308
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,310
<i>Shiyi helped me without hesitation.</i>

309
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,920
<i>He supported me and fought for me.</i>

310
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,930
<i>Cheng Lang, every time I did horribly in an exam,</i>

311
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,840
<i>you'd show up in time and tutor me.</i>

312
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,090
<i>Le Tao, your friendship snacks helped</i>

313
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,400
<i>me so many hungry mornings.</i>

314
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,640
<i>And Xiaoju, your presence gave me the confidence</i>

315
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,250
<i>of not being in last place.</i>

316
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,280
<i>Thank you all.</i>

317
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:02,760
<i>You filled my time as a student with fondness that one is reluctant to part with.</i>

318
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,310
<i>In the future, we'll work hard in different cities</i>

319

<i>and walk our own paths.</i>

320

Everyone says that graduation is a farewell.

349
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,780
I didn't expect we would be separated from Baobao so soon.

350
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:59,160
That fatty left without saying anything.

351
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,960
When I see him next, I'm going to beat him.

352
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,810
It's all right, Shiyi.

353
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,350
We know that you can't bear for him to leave the most.

Who can't bear for him to leave?

355
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,630
I'm just worried that since he's so stupid,

356
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,020
he might be bullied over there.

357
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,260
Don't worry.

358
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,630
He'll be fine.

359
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,450
He wrote in the letter that his father had arranged everything for him.

360
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,160
Don't worry.

361

That's right.

362
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,600
It's not like we can't see him.

363
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,230
I believe that Baobao will be back soon.

364
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,320
Forget it. I'll stop thinking about it.

365
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,740
He's actually quite smart.

366
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,400
It'll be good if he doesn't bully other people.

That's right.

Maybe one day, Baobao will become a successful businessman,

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,830
we'd have to work for him.

391
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,300
It's so beautiful.

392
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
It's good that you like it.

393
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,880
Thank you.

394
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,200
I'm the one that should thank you.

395
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,380
Let's go.

396
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,780

Your admission letters have all arrived.

404

All of you three have been admitted to Jiangzhou University!

405
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,920
Really?

406
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,416
I thought she couldn't go there

407
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:20,880
because of the accounting major she chose.

408
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,640
I didn't expect that she also got admitted!

409
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,340
Your admission letter is here!

410
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,470

Xia Xiaoju.

00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,590
We two were admitted into the first tier, but we haven't said anything.

417
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,020
Look at how excited you are.

418
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,540
I'm in the second tier, and I'm proud!

419
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,170
Mom, I really made it. Look.

420
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,500
You finally made it!

421
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,660
Don't be too impulsive.

422
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,110
The kids came back, so don't be impulsive.

423

Dad.

Uncle.

425
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,080
Lu Shiyi. Your exam result this time is pretty good.

426
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,560
Dad, it's so good that you're not angry.

427
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,600
Not like that.

428
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,930
I'm not angry.

429
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,850
You secretly changed your application to college.

430
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,960
How can I not be angry?

431
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,016
- We already talked about it.
- Right.

432
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,880
Don't be impulsive!

433
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,590
Uncle Lu, don't be angry.

434
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,450
There's a reason why Shiyi changed his application. Explain it to him.

435
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,880
Right, Dad. Please let me explain.

436
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,600
Those majors I suggested to you,

437
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,880
you didn't even look at them, right?

438
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,680
You secretly changed your application without telling me.

439
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,420
Do you still have me, your dad, in your eyes?

440
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,620
- Father Lu!
- What are you doing?

441
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,930
What you arranged is not what I like.

442
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,380
Don't claim that it's for my own good and arrange my future for me.

443
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,040
Lu Shiyi, looking at the major you applied for,

444
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,680
in all these years I raised you, I never knew that you liked medicine!

445
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Do you think studying medicine is a game?

446
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,560
I didn't take medicine as a game.

447
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,690
I'll be responsible for the major I chose.

448
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,950
I won't be like you, giving up halfway.

449
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,040
I promise.

450
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,070
Lu Shiyi!

451
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,936
What did you say?

452
00:31:01,936 --> 00:31:03,700
- How could you talk like that?
- Say it again!

453
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,590
He's a child. Don't take him seriously.

454
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,988
Father Lu.

455
00:31:06,988 --> 00:31:07,880
- Uncle Lu.
- You bastard.

456
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,400
Look at how I'll teach you today!

457
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:15,300
Stop! Stand there!

458
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,400
Uncle Lu!

459
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,970
Stop!

460
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,160
Why is it that I was admitted, but you still want to beat me?

461
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,350
My heart doesn't feel well!

462
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,450
My foot twisted! Don't you care about me?
