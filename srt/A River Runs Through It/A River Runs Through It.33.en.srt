Thankfully, my roommate's girlfriend left an apron here.

7
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,100
She uses it when she washes clothes. Don't get it too dirty. Here.

The both of you scared me!

11
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought the smell from the hotpot was too much,

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so it brought the dorm manager over here

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,400
to inspect whether I was illegally using electricity.

14
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Still, you shouldn't eat hotpot in your dorm.

You guys continue eating. Go on.

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,000
It really looks great. Really!

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Shall I explain it to him?

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
Don't bother.

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,500

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Why not just go abroad for some peace and quiet.

113
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Did Xiaoju say something to make you feel sad?

114
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,900
I went to her, telling her I'm going abroad.

115
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,000
She didn't feel an ounce of reluctance. She... She even encouraged me!

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
You know? She congratulated me on going abroad.

117
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,000
Did I tell her I'm going abroad so she can congratulate me?

118
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Then how did you want her to respond?

119
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,300
That she can't bear to part from you.

120
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,300
That she wants you to give up the chance to study abroad for her. Like that?

121
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,800
Xiaoju, where did Huang Chan and Gui Xiaoling go?

122
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,000
They're not back yet. Did they tell you?

123
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,000
Xiaoju?

124
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,200
What did you say?

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,500
What's wrong with you lately?

126
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,400
You've been absent-minded.

127
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,700
What on earth happened?

128
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,000
Datu... is going abroad.

129
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,600
What? Abroad?

130
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
Then, what are your thoughts?

131
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Are you going to let him go?

132
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,600
Does it matter what I think?

133
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,800
Going abroad is an important matter related to his future.

134
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,200
I can't ask him to give up his bright future

135
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,700
for an uncertain relationship.

136
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,600
But... But aren't you reluctant to part with him?

137
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I really can't bear to part with him.

138
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,500
Xiaoju.

139
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,250
Do you like Shiyi?

140
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,740
I don't know.

141
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,150
When I face him,

142
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,709
although I don't have the same feelings as when I first met Cheng Lang,

143
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:57,999
or the nervousness,

144
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,589
but when I'm in front of him,

145
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,749
I don't have to worry if my face is pretty or not,

146
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:06,060
or if I'm dressed prettily.

147
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,469
Anyway, I just feel very happy.

148
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,249
I feel very comfortable when I'm with him.

149
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:16,450
And I'd unconsciously want to rely on him.

150
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,620
Anyway, I don't know if this feeling towards him

151
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,430
is love or reliance.

152
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,379
By the time you figure it out, he'd be long gone.

153
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:35,109
Cheng Lang is leaving. We're also about to graduate.

154
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,149
To be honest, I really can't bear to part with everyone.

155
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,909
I originally thought that Datu will always be by my side.

156
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,900
I never thought that

157
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,300
he'd leave, too.

158
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,199
Xiaoju, why would you think that?

159
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:57,879
Why do you think that he'd never leave you?

160
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,279
Did he say that he'd never leave you?

161
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,680
Or is it...

162
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,690
that you want him to always be with you?

163
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,029
<i>That's true.</i>

164
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,419
<i>Why am I so sure</i>

165
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,950
<i>that Shiyi will always be by my side?</i>

166
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,760
There you go. Okay now.

167
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,749
Come on, okay now. Stop crying. It's not like a separation of life and death.

168
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:31,739
Pozhou is very close. We'll meet again soon.

169
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,589
That's right. Pozhou is not far away.

170
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,969
- Remember to come visit me when you have time.
- Okay.

171
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:38,639
I'll be back to take graduation pictures when it's time to graduate.

172
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,639
We will meet soon.

173
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,669
We will pay you a visit when possible.

174
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,100
Sure.

175
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,489
Come on. Give me a hug.

176
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:47,279
Here, come on.

177
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,809
You rascal. Don't forget about us when you become rich and famous!

178
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:50,549
What do you mean?

179
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,109
When I really become a wandering singer, you have to help me out.

180
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:55,909
You're already signed to a record label, Superstar!

181
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,180
Okay, all right. That's enough.

182
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,909
Stop dawdling. Look at how the driver has become impatient.

183
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:01,339
- Shiyi, come on.
- Okay, I'll give you a hug.

184
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:02,759
Talk to Xiaoju.

185
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,489
- Don't lose your temper.
- I know. I know.

186
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,120
Safe travels.

187
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,980
Take care of yourself.

188
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,240
Don't make decisions that you will regret.

189
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,519
The same to you.

190
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,539
If there's something you can't tell Auntie,

191
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:25,940
remember to give us a call or come back to us.

192
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,809
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

193
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:30,650
- I'm leaving now. I'm leaving now.
- Go on.

194
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,029
I'm leaving, Superstar.

195
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,659
Immediately call me if anyone bullies you over there.

196
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:35,860
All you know is to fight.

197
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,360
- Safe travels! Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

198
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,330
Why did you take me to the sports ground?

199
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,570
Take a seat.

200
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,930
The breeze here at the sports ground is very comfortable.

201
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,390
Let's have a talk.

202
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,240
About what?

203
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,670
Say something.

204
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,430
Well... I was at fault that day.

205
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,840
I shouldn't have lost my temper with you.

206
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,299
But when you heard that I am going abroad,

207
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:32,709
you can't just congratulate me. Right?

208
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,319
What do you want me to say then?

209
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,739
Actually, I've been thinking about it these past few days.

210
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,030
I know what's on your mind.

211
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,179
You know nothing.

212
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:46,809
You're thinking that our relationship is uncertain right now.

213
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:49,530
You don't want to interfere with me going abroad to study.

214
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,589
I get it.

215
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:56,260
It's hard to get a chance to go abroad.

216
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,300
But, did you know?

217
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,789
When I first found out about it,

218
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,020
my first reaction wasn't being happy. I was worried

219
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,350
what would happen to us.

220
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,590
That's silly, isn't it?

221
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,590
What do you mean "us?"

222
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,010
But to me, you're the most important.

223
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,839
I believe in myself.

224
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,999
With my capabilities, even if I don't study abroad,

225
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,310
I can still become a very, very excellent doctor,

226
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,909
so don't be bothered by those nonsense.

227
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,379
Forget about them.

228
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:38,959
Don't be concerned about my future or my career, either.

229
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,000
Just think about me.

230
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,390
Do you want me to go abroad?

231
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,990
Carefully think about it before you reply.

232
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,200
If I go abroad,

233
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,180
it'll really be impossible for the both of us.

234
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,780
Say something.

235
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,859
You... Just talk properly.

236
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,440
Why are you getting so close to me?

237
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,130
Are you shy?

238
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,429
Not at all.

239
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:23,479
It's... just that there are many people here. It's not good if they see us.

240
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,109
What are you doing?

241
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,659
And you say you're not shy! You're blushing so hard.

242
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,049
It's hot today. The sun is burning.

243
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:38,000
Hot? Burning?

244
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,829
Then what about your heartbeat?

245
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,409
Your heartbeat is beating so fast. Is it also because of the sun?

246
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,699
Stop being so stubborn, okay? Is it so hard to admit that you like me?

247
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,449
It's not like that.

248
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,819
Ask your parents about you going abroad. Why are you asking me?

249
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,980
I... I'm leaving.

250
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,600
Xia Xiaoju!

251
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,009
You like me! Just admit it!

252
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:11,540
You don't want me to go abroad!

253
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,660
Can you stop following me?

254
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,270
I want to sing you one last song.

255
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,310
I originally wanted to surprise you,

256
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,740
but I realized that you hated me so much.

257
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,229
I'm afraid my surprise will frighten you.

258
00:18:58,229 --> 00:18:59,970
So that's why...

259
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,030
I'd rather tell you about it frankly.

260
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,349
You don't have to do these meaningless things.

261
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,189
It's not possible between us anymore.

262
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,559
I know.

263
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,709
I'm not trying to make up with you.

264
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,910
It's just that I feel I've

265
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,700
let you down.

266
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,820
So that's why

267
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
I want to do one last thing for you.

268
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,499
You don't need to. You don't need to do anything.

269
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,440
I'll wait for you.

270
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,709
I'll wait for you in the rehearsing room.

271
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,580
You don't have to come, but I'll still finish singing the song.

272
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,110
Take it as...

273
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,370
my own farewell.

274
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,140
I'll wait for you!

Okay, I'll tell him.

Huang Jun.

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,880
I actually hate you a lot,

347
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,050
but I don't know why.

348
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,780
Whenever I think of you,

349
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,080
I think of those joyful moments.

350
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,880
Besides, I hate becoming enemies after breaking up.

351
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,470
So, thank you, Huang Jun.

352
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,190
Thank you for accompanying me in those moments.

Do you have Xiaoju's colleagues' numbers from the travel agency?

I don't.

381
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:53,139
I just saw on the news that there are mudslides in Pozhou.

382
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:54,829
Many tourists are stuck there and they can't leave.

- I'll make a trip to Pozhou.

00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,179
<i>Sorry.</i>

387
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:10,100
- Why is Xiaoju's phone off?
<i>- The subscriber's phone you dialed is currently turned off.</i>

388
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,799
Everyone, hurry inside!

389

Hurry up, hurry up.

390
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,070
The people at the front, please wait a moment.

391
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,559
All right. Everyone, please listen to me.

392
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,919
I'm terrible sorry, everyone.

393
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,999
Due to the bad weather,

394
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,399
we've cancelled the trip.

395
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,310
You may go upstairs now to get changed.

396
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,229
You're free to do whatever you want after getting changed.

397
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,679
As it's pouring outside,

398
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,799
I'd suggest to wait for it to stop before going out. All right?

399
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,210
- All right. Go ahead.
- Fine. Let's go to our room.

400
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,010
Be sure to get changed. Don't catch a cold!

Cheng Lang! Why are you here?

403
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,879
You idiot!

404
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,360
People are calling you, yet you don't pick up.

405
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,559
The news said that there are mudslides in the tourist area today.

406
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Your parents are worried!

407
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,709
My phone is dead.

408
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,980
I knew it!

409
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,069
Sorry, Cheng Lang. I made you worry.

410
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,710
Did my parents tell you to come find me?

411
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,240
Hurry and call your parents.

412
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,040
Okay.

413
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,030
Hello, Mom.

414
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,170
My phone is dead.

415
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,399
Okay, okay.

416
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,710
Cheng Lang has already found me.

417
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,399
It's okay. Don't worry.

418
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,579
All right. I'll talk to you later. Okay.

419
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,469
You!

420
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,309
You came to Pozhou but didn't even contact me.

421
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,089
I wanted to reach out to you after I finish working here.

422
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:43,469
I just heard that it's free activities this afternoon.

423
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,999
How about I treat you to a meal?

424
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,189
To show my hospitality as the host.

425
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,999
You've just arrived here earlier than me by a week!

426
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,519
How does that make you the host?

427
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,919
Regardless, I'm still considered half of a host.

428
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,069
I'll treat you to a feast!

429
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,759
There's a famous seafood stall nearby.

430
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,679
- For real?
- Of course!

431
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,309
I haven't had seafood in so long!

432
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,069
I have to eat lots today!

433
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,229
You should prepare enough money.

434
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,470
No problem.

435
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,249
Your clothes are wet. Hurry and get changed or else you'll catch a cold.

436
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:10,949
All right, then wait for me here.

437
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,000
Okay.

438
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,670
