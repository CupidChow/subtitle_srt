<i>[Episode 5: Our smallness and greatness, part 1]</i>

3
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,969
I'm so nervous.

4
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:27,439
All these years of studying are just for this day.

5
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,229
If I fail the exam, all these years of efforts will just be wasted.

6
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,479
Don't be nervous. You should think of it this way.

7
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,589
We'll be free after the exam.

8
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,759
We don't need to study every day.

9
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,079
We can sleep until whenever we want.

10
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,509
We can go wherever we want.

11
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,549
Just thinking about it makes me look forward to it!

12
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,189
Stop looking forward to it.

13
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,679
Hurry and check if you brought all the things you need.

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,229
I brought them all.

15
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,850
You've checked so many times on the way.

16
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,869
<i>We're going towards our fixed directions and arrive at the crossroads of our life.</i>

17
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,930
<i>No one knows exactly what lies ahead, waiting for us.</i>

18

<i>You're on vacation starting tomorrow.
[Grade 3, Class 8]</i>

19
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,079
On the eighth of the lunar year you'll have to be back for classes.

20
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,729
During the Spring Festival, don't follow your parents when they go and visit people for New Year's.

21
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:32,269
Don't go wild and just play during your winter vacation.

22
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,879
We have so much homework to do.

23
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,879
When will we have the time to go wild and play around?

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,489
This is only the English homework.

25
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:41,130
The other subjects will be here soon.

26
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,339
Teacher, we only have about ten days of vacation,

27
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:48,389
but with this amount of homework, it'll take half a year!

28
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,519
Mr. Zhang, why don't we just not go on vacation.

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,849
Let's just continue with classes.

30
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,370
Who said that?

31
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,739
Let me tell you. I'll wait for you at school. You better come here during your winter vacation.

32
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,899
- No, no, Teacher. I-I'm just j-joking.
- Just joking?

33
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:04,899
On the first day of school, I'll focus on checking on your homework.

34
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:06,269
Okay?

35
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,799
There's another assignment.

36
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,749
During the Spring Festival, think about

37
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,909
what kind of university you want to attend,

38
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,959
and what kind of major you want to study.

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,749
You need to set a goal for yourself.

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,999
Only by having a goal will you have motivation.

41
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,079
- Do you understand?
- Yes, we do!

42
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,799
Okay, good. That's all for today.

43
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,880
- Class is over!
- Stand up!

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,630
Teacher, goodbye!

45
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,600
Goodbye, students!

46
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,779
Attending an university? Choosing a major?

47
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:41,269
We're not like Cheng Lang, who can casually choose between Tsinghua and Peking University.

48
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,629
What about me?

49
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,669
What are you doing looking at our Cheng Lang that way?

50
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,290
- Is it his fault that he's excellent?
- Right, what about me?

51
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,749
Are you going to choose Tsinghua or Peking University?

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,409
He'll choose Jiangzhou University, computer science major. Right?

53
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,970
Yes, computer science major, okay?

54
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,010
- Shiyi, what about you?
- Jiangzhou University...

55
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,979
Of course, I'll choose the coolest major.

56
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,610
Who said that they'll choose the coolest major?

57
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,369
Lu Shiyi, you secretly took your classmates to attend the sports competition last time.

58
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:11,682
I haven't even punished you for it yet.

59
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,829
And you guys. You guys, too!

60
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,479
Uncle Han, are you off work?

61
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,470
- Did you just come back?
- Yes.

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,859
What day is it today? Why does your family's hair salon have so many customers?

63
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:30,930
Okay, go back to work first.

64
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,599
I just brought these back.

65
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,100
Mom?

66
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,639
When did you come back?

67
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,639
- Guess.
- I miss you so much.

68
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,779
You almost strangled me.

69
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:43,420
Mom?

70
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,739
Every time Auntie Li comes back, my family's hair salon will be booming with business for a few days.

71
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:48,269
Why?

72
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,319
Auntie Li is the fashion leader in our neighborhood.

73
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,399
- Mom, we're back from school.
- Are you back?
- I'll set your hair in a bit.

74
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,499
Did you buy me the game console?

75
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:56,760
You only ask about the game console. Why don't you ask about me?

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,339
I asked about you just now. Did you buy it, Mom?

77
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,509
- It's on the table.
- Really?

78
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,110
Thank you, Mom!

79
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,739
Cheng Lang, we have a new game console now.

80
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,820
- We have a PS now.
- Really?

81
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,269
Let's go.

82
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,949
I'll drop my stuff off first, and then I'll go and find you in a bit.

83
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,329
- Then hurry.
- Okay.

84
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,630
- I'll go back first then, Mom.
- Slow down!

85
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,979
Isn't it just a game console? Does he need to be this happy?

86
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,899
- Do these hairstyles look nice?
- Yes.

87
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,169
I brought these for your mom.

88
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:24,879
These are the most popular hair styles.

89
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,439
Help your mom hang these on the walls in a bit.

90
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,069
Thanks, Auntie Li.

91
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,570
- Mom, I'm going back to my room first.
- Okay.

92
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,389
Xiaoju.

93
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,069
Mom.

94
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,159
Come. This is Auntie Li.

95
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,719
She came back from Guangzhou and brought so many delicious foods for us.

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,069
Hurry and thank Auntie Li.

97
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,169
Thank you, Auntie Li.

98
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:42,509
Your daughter?

99
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,300
She's pretty.

100
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,759
- Then... Mom, I'm going back first.
- Okay.

101
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,389
- Auntie Li.
- Take these with you.

102
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,199
Take these with you.

103
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,960
- Don't drop them.
- So much stuff.

104
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,829
Goodbye, Auntie.

105
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,069
Mom, I'm leaving now.

106
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,319
Do your homework, okay?

107
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,109
I know.

108
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,110
Be careful and don't drop it.

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,259
Xiaohong, you bring so many things every time you come back.

110
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,719
How should we thank you?

111
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,159
Isn't it what I should be doing?

112
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,699
When I'm not here, you help me take care of Old Lu and Shiyi.

113
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,970
How can the specialties I bring be compared to that?

114
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,389
Xiaohong, you won't leave immediately this time, right?

115
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,759
No, I won't. Shiyi is going to take his college entrance exam soon.

116
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,399
If I leave at this time, I'm not a qualified mom.

117
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,509
I'll stay at home and take care of them.

118
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,171
You made the right decision.

119
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:27,489
The college entrance exam is the most important thing for our kids.

120
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:32,339
- As parents, who doesn't want their kids to get into a good university?
- You're right! You're right!

121
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:35,489
- For them to have a promising future and be capable, right?
- You're right!

122
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:37,889
What are you worried about? Your child studies so well.

123
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,389
He'll have a promising future no matter what major.

124
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,239
Cheng Lang wants to major in computer science at Jiangzhou University.

125
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,233
He said it will be popular in the future and that everyone needs to learn it.

126
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,349
- Is this major good?
- It's good!

127
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,329
It's easy to find a job with this studies.

128
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:52,069
It is especially popular right now.

129
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,549
By the way,

130
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,349
what does Shiyi want to major in?

131
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,070
I asked him several times, but he wouldn't tell me.

132
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,949
You guys said so much just now,

133
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,879
it seems like there is more to it.

134
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,509
Isn't it good enough to just get into an university?

135
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,849
It's not like that. The major he chooses is directly related to his future job.

136
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:12,649
You need to know that many students who have bad grades and who chose an unpopular major

137
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,950
end up getting admitted to top universities.

138
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,771
You scared me to death, Dad.

139
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:31,549
Why didn't you knock before you came in?

140
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,250
You have the guilty conscience of a thief.

141
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,789
Where did your mom go again? Didn't she come back with you?

142
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,199
She is downstairs.

143
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,879
She is chatting with the aunties at the hair salon.

144
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,349
How does she have so much to talk about with other people?

145
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,789
How long has it been since she was away?

146
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,350
She hasn't even said ten sentences to me and just went out.

147
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,829
Go and call your mom back home.

148
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,929
If you want to find her, you go and call her yourself.

149
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,259
Why are you asking me to go?

150
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:55,479
- You...
- Hurry and go.

151
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,499
By the way, when I got off work today, I bumped into your homeroom teacher.

152
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:10,719
Did you claim in class that you'll choose whichever major is the coolest?

153
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:11,949
Did you say such a thing?

154
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,640
Yes, I did say such a thing.

155
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,069
Is there any problem, Dad?

156
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,739
What do you mean by "cool?"

157
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:19,720
Can "cool" put food on the table?

158
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,439
I won't count on you anymore.

159
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,169
I've prepared a few majors that will become popular in the future for you to choose from.

160
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:28,049
Don't! Don't! Don't do that, Dad!

161
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,650
I definitely won't like the majors that you chose.

162
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,149
Just go do what you need to, Dad.

163
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,439
How do you know you definitely won't like them?

164
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,759
I will definitely choose the majors according to your character and hobby.

165
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,759
I have to be the one to decide my own future.

166
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,199
You decide on your own future?

167
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,769
Then it'll be completely ruined by your own hands!

168
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,569
How will it be completely ruined by my own hands?

169
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,109
What do you mean?

170
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,549
Can you listen to me?

171
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,440
How am I not listening to you, Dad?

172
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,809
- How can you be—
- Why are you arguing again?

173
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,560
Look at him, Mom.

174
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:56,609
He always scolds me.

175
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:57,879
- I just came back.
- Look at your son.

176
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,939
He's already this old, yet he lives muddleheaded every day.

177
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,229
See?

178
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,900
Don't always make your dad angry.

179
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,959
He knows what to do. Don't always interfere.

180
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,510
That's right.

181
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,229
I'll tell you about an old saying. How did it go?

182
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,349
"A kind mother will ruin the son."

183
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,399
Do you know? If you argue with our son again,

184
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,770
I'll go and live at Sister Ding's house.

185
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,740
Your arguing is giving me a headache!

186
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,350
Thank you, Mom.

187
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,540
They're turning in circles.

188
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,860
Why did you... You...

189
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,780
Is there something wrong with the controller that you gave me?

190
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,109
- Enough.
- Let them play a bit longer.

191
00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:52,229
They're already seniors and they're still playing games.

192
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,709
You'll lead Cheng Lang astray.

193
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,339
Okay, enough. The TV is going to break down from all the playing.

194
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,910
Stop watching. Hurry and go study.

195
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,199
Mom, it's finally the holidays.

196
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:06,149
Let me have some more rest.

197
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,469
Mom, I'm going to go study.

198
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,579
See? Look at Jiashu.

199
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:13,949
If your grades are good, I won't care if you watch TV every day.

200
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:16,749
Okay, listen to your mom. Go and study first.

201
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,909
After the college exam, you can watch and play all you want.

202
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,419
Go.

203
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,639
Hurry and go.

204
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,340
You only know how to scold me for not studying well.

205
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,000
And you, too. Why didn't you scold the kids for watching TV?

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,900
And you were watching TV with them.

207
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't be so blunt when talking to her in the future.

208
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,300
Xiaoju... I'm afraid she can't take it.

209
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,799
Let me tell you, Lu Shiyi's mom is back today.

210
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,300
She told me that nowadays, we need to first submit an application.

211
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
As long as you choose the right major,

212
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,600
you can go to a good university even if your score is low.

213
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,400
And you can find a good job in the future.

214
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,500
I'm feeling anxious.

215
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,100
- How do we apply?
- What?

216
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,800
S-Submit an application?

217
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,600
Yes.

218
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,400
We don't know how to fill it out.

219
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
- Th-This...
- You're right.

220
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,900
So that's why we need to find someone who knows how to guide us.

221
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
Who should we ask?

222
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:19,040
<i>[Show you the right way]</i>

223
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
It's going to be our turn soon.

224
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,200
Let's go and get prepared.

225
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,800
Let's go.

226
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
After buying this book,

227
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,400
our child has hope in the college entrance exam.

228
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Next!

229
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,400
- We're coming. We're coming. Hurry, hurry!
- Now our child has hope in the college entrance exam.

230
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,000
- Study hard.
- Study hard, okay?

231
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,200
Look at these.

232
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,800
It's so effective.

233
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,000
<i>[Savior of the College Entrance Exam]</i>

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,400
Savior of the college entrance exam?

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Mr. Kong.

236
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,700
Hurry and call him Mr. Kong.

237
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,500
H-Hello, Mr. Kong.

238
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,800
You're here to ask about the college entrance exam, right?

239
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
- Yes, yes.
- Yes.

240
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
Is she studying art or science?

241
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
Our daughter is studying science.

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,800
Studying science...

243
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,300
How are her grades?

244
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,200
Hurry and take out her report card.

245
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,600
Mr. Kong, have a look.

246
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,700
This is our daughter's report card.

247
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,400
Her score is not that good.

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Mr. Kong, we want you to teach us.

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We want to know what major our daughter should choose in order to get into a good university.

250
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,600
It's not difficult.

251
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
It's just a question of probabilities.

252
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,000
Do you know probability?

253
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,600
Don't apply for the popular majors.

254
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,000
There're too many people.

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
With this score, you practically won't get accepted.

256
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Choose an unpopular major.

257
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,200
The fewer the people who apply, the probability of getting accepted will naturally be higher.

258
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,600
Who doesn't know about this?

259
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Don't interrupt. Listen to Mr. Kong.

260
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,800
There are still some things that you don't know about.

261
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,100
Please tell us.

262
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,600
What does studying depend on?

263
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,800
It depends on your memory and understanding ability.

264
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,600
As long as you have these abilities,

265
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,000
you will be able to read through thousands of books and write fluently.

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,600
All questions will become easy.

267
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
Then how can we improve these abilities?

268
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,800
That's right.

Don't speak nonsense. What do you know?

273
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,400
Dad, dissuade my mom.

274

I originally wanted to recommend you this book.

But...

276
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,400
the kid is not willing to learn or buy it.

277
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,600
No, no, no.

278

Today, I'm destined to meet your daughter.

I'll tell you for free.

Mom, I don't want to drink this garlic juice.

284
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,100
Don't make it for me. It's too stinky.

285
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Mr. Kong said,

286
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,300
this can make you smart, is good for your brain,

287
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,800
and can also improve your immune system.

288
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
It'll only work if you drink it every day.

289

A spoonful of this.

290
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,200
- A spoonful of garlic.
- That Mr. Kong must be a fraud.

291
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,800
It's because I didn't buy his book,

292
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,000
so that's why he's pranking me on purpose.

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,400
Let me tell you,

295
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,600
your third aunt's colleague's daughter,

296

Here. Hurry, hurry.

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,200
Hurry and be a good girl.

300
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,000
Hurry up! Hurry.

301
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,200
Pinch your nose, and in one gulp, it'll be gone.

302
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
Hurry up!

303
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,800
Hurry up!

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
Now that's like it.

305
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
This child...

306
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,400
Does it really taste that horrible?

307
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,800
Drink one more cup, okay?

308
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,000
Drink one more cup. Drink one more cup.

309

This child.

312
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,600
When you first get the question, the first step is to make a coordinate system.

313
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,400
We then look at this inequation.

314
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,800
In this coordinate system,

315
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
the focus of the X-axis and the Y-axis...

316
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,000
This question looks like it's hard,

317
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
but it's easy to get points.

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,200
- Let's take a look at the first question.
- You can't catch it! You can't catch it!

319
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,800

320
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
Come here. Come here.

321
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,200
Your sister's brain originally is not smart,

322
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,600
yet you're still disturbing her studies. Isn't that right?

323
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,800
You have a point.

324
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Here are some candies.

325
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,400
I'll give you two.

326
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,300
- And one for each of you.
- Thank you, Brother.

327
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,000
- Thanks, Brother Shiyi.
- You're welcome. Go and play.

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'll play with you in the evening, okay?

329
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,200
At this time, look at this curve on the X-axis.

330
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,900
Xiaoju.

331
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,100
It's so difficult.

332
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,000
I feel like I might not get into an university.

333
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,600
Xia Xiaoju, did you eat garlic again?

334
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,500
Don't cover your mouth. I can smell it even if you cover it.

335
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,200
How is that possible? I rinsed my mouth.

336
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,600
Xiaoju, that Mr. Kong is most likely a fraud.

337
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,200
How can there be such a folk prescription?

338
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,400
I know.

339
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,600
But my mom is keeping her eye on me every day, insisting I drink the garlic juice.

340
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Don't sigh! Don't sigh!

341
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,900
Don't sigh. It stinks more when you sigh.

342
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,600
Be careful or else I won't be polite towards you.

343
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,200
Go away. I'm going to call Jiashu.

344
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,800
Xiaoju, let's hurry and finish this question.

345
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,000
Get away from me.

346
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,900
Stop playing around, okay?

347
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,100
Let's continue to take a look at this.

348
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,000
Dad, I'll hang this on the door frame, okay?

349

<i>[Safe and Luck]</i>

350
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,100
- Put this one higher. Higher.
- Okay.

351

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Be careful, children.

354
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
Cover your ears.

355
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Mom, let me help you.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,400
You're making egg dumplings?

357
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,200
It smells delicious.

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It looks really pretty.

360
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,400
Wanfang, you're becoming more and more skillful.

361
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
This perm looks really pretty.

362
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,600
Xiao Ding, help me do this one.

363
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,400
Auntie.

364
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,100
Xiaoju, you're here?

365
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,700
It's so cold. Why didn't you wear a coat before coming here?

366
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm helping my mom with the house cleaning. I'm even sweating.

367
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,800
Auntie, my mom asked me to send you these egg dumplings.

368
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,100
- You're so nice. Thank your mom for me.
- Okay.

369
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,200
Cheng Lang, hurry and come out. Xiaoju is here.

370
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,800
Cheng Lang. Does it smell good?

371
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,200
It smells delicious. Did you make it?

372
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,600
My mom made it. I'm just an errand girl.

373
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,000
But this meat filling was minced by me.

374
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,800
It looks delicious.

375
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,400
Thank you, Xiaoju.

376
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,300
No need to thank me.

377
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,900
I've prepared about ten questions for you.

378
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,200
Happy New Year! Bye bye!

<i>Okay, okay. Happy New Year!</i>

380
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,000
It's too high.

381
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,800
Lower! Lower!

382
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,200
The right side needs to go lower.

383
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,700
Like this?

384
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,600
- A bit lower.
- Lower?

385
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
- Like this?
- Lower.

386
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,800
Are you sure it's not crooked this way?

387
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm down here so I can see it more clearly.

388
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,900
Just listen to me.

389
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,400
Like this?

390
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
That's right! That's right!

391
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,200
Xia Xiaoju, stop right there!

392
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,600
A gentleman uses his words and never his fists.

393
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,500
If you're going to keep being like this,

394
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I won't give you egg dumplings.

395
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
- It hurts.
- You run quite fast, Speedy Legs.

396
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Since you like running and you're good at it,

397
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,000
why don't you apply to a sports college?

398
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,500
I'm sure you can make it.

399
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,800
You can apply to a sports school yourself.

What's with your attitude?

401
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,800
I'm helping you think of ways, okay?

402
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
It's the New Years. Can you stop making me mad?

403
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,500
Can you let me off?

404
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,800
Wait for me here.

405
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
Just wait for me.

406
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,800
Where are you going?

407
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800

Xia Xiaoju.

409
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
- What?
- This is for you.

410
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
What is written here?
<i>(T/N: List of universities and majors.)</i>

411
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
My dad wrote this for me.

412
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,300
You know it. A doctors' handwriting is hard to understand.

413
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,500
Your dad wrote this for you. You're not going to use this as a reference?

414
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,800
I don't need it.

415
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,200
I've already decided on what major I'm going to choose.

416
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,100
What are you going to major in?

417
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,500
So mysterious.

Xia Jiashu.

425
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,600
Do you know what this is? And you used it to make a paper airplane.

426

Xiaoju.

427
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,010
I-I just randomly took it from the desk.

428
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,639
Who let you touch my stuff?

429
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,230
Isn't it just a piece of paper?

430
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,510
Why are you so angry with your brother?

431
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,520
Mom. Lu Shiyi gave this to me as a reference to choose majors.

432
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,850
I knew about it. I saw it.

433
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,879
All of the ones written on there are popular majors.

434
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,039
Did you forget about what Mr. Kong said about the probability?

435
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,559
According to that probability,

436
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,990
from what I can see, you won't get in with those majors.

437
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,610
Just let him play with it, okay?

438
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,240
That's right. You definitely won't get accepted.

439
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,410
Mom, why are you always–

440
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,450
What?

441
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,639
Forget it! I'm not important anyways.

442
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
I'll go downstairs for a bit.

What does it have to do with you?

450
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,780
Why are you unhappy during the New Year?

451
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,759
Don't be upset. Let's go.

452
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,790
I'll take you to find Cheng Lang to play.

I don't want to go.

454

Okay.

455
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,130
I'll go there by myself then.

456
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,030
You can stay here by yourself.

Hey.

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,420
Don't be upset.

Let's go. Let's go.

460
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,589
Let me tell you,

461
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,309
if it wasn't because I'm happy today,

462
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,040
I wouldn't have brought you here.

463
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,090
Xiaoju is here as well?

464
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,060
Here.

465
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,949
Here.

466
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,030
- Cheers.
- Here.

467
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,930
You guys are actually drinking beer.

468
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,679
We'll be eighteen after New Year's.

469
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,900
Why can't we drink a bit?

470
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,949
Childish.

471
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,390
Do you think you're an adult just because you drank some beer?

472
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,709
Xiaoju, this is fruit-flavored beer.

473
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,510
Do you want to try it?

474
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,780
Yes.

475
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,150
Xia Xiaoju, can't you have a bit of a backbone?

476
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,650
No.

477
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,330
It's the New Year.

478
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,399

479
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,750
Is it cool or not?

480
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,960
Let me tell you,

481
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,039
this is the secret base where Cheng Lang and I played since we were young.

482
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,760
We built everything here.

483
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,789
- Is it cool?
- Yes.

484
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,130
I didn't imagine there's such a place.

485
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,230
Praise us!

486
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,350
I think you especially have a girlish heart.

487
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,310
You're the one that has a girlish heart.

488
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,900
Come here. Come here.

489
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,100
See?

490
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,810
You can see your house directly from here.

491
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,890
There, on the second floor, isn't that it?

492
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,460
What's wrong? Be happy.

493
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,559
Cheng Lang, this is so cute.

494
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,679
Do you like it?

495
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,919
Yes.

496
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,559
Then I'll give it to you when I'm done making it.

497
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,229
Really?

498
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,830
Thank you.

499
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,720
It's so cold!

500
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,330
- I'm cold, too.
- I'm very cold, too.

501
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,410
Look at the both of you.

502
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,360
You guys had to come here to drink beer on such a cold day.

503
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,189
Here, you can use the gloves to warm yourself.

504
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,690
Here.

505
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,130
Thank you.

506
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,430
Are you cold?

507
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,820
You won't be cold once you wear it.

508
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,830
It looks quite nice.

509
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,310
You two are quite gentlemanly.

510
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,349
Shiyi, Shiyi! Shiyi!

511
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,370
Okay, enough.

512
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,480
What's wrong?

513
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,879
It hurts! It hurts!

514
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,609
I was just playing around with you. It hurts!

515
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:11,039
Why did you hit me so hard?

516
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,180
I knew you didn't have good intentions.

517
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,545
Seriously! You eat so much every day and hit people so hard.

518
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:18,330
I won't bother with what you said.

519
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,330
Xiaoju, it seemed like you weren't in a good mood when you came up here just now.

520
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,609
What happened? It's the New Year. What made you upset?

521
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,279
It's because of my mom.

522
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,829
Xia Jiashu used the reference paper Lu Shiyi gave me to fold a paper airplane.

523
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,760
She actually thought that Xia Jiashu did nothing wrong.

524
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,810
Is that it?

525
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,589
That's it.

526
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,490
Just because of this?

527
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,660
I thought you were hit by your mom

528
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,480
based on how you looked just now! Seriously! It's no big deal.

529
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,709
Just be happy.

530
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,139
- You don't understand.
- What don't I understand?

531
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:53,839
In my mom's eyes, Xia Jiashu is better at everything than I am.

532
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,690
I must get into an university to prove myself to her.

533
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,469
Have you decided which university to apply for?

534
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,279
I want to apply for Jiangzhou University, Department of Medicine.

535
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,140
You? Do you want to become a doctor?

536
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,760
Me, what? What's wrong with that? I wanted to learn medicine since I was young.

537
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,969
Shiyi. Did your dad agree?

538
00:28:12,969 --> 00:28:15,399
Didn't he say he'll choose a major for you himself?

539
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,089
I don't care. I have to make my own decision this time.

540
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,709
Cheng Lang wants to apply for Jiangzhou University,

541
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,799
and so do you.

542
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,490
How about I apply there as well.

543
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,309
Wait, Xia Xiaoju. Why are you always following wherever Cheng Lang and I go?

544
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,700
You're really haunting us.

545
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,559
I don't want to see you every day and be classmates with you in college.

546
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,840
Does your family own Jiangzhou University? Why can't I apply?

547
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,709
- Apply for it then.
- I will!

548
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,930
If I can't get into a first major, can't I just choose a second major?

549
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,849
Okay, okay. I won't discourage you anymore.

550
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:51,659
Since you have decided for yourself, study hard.

551
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,380
What if you actually get accepted?

552
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,179
That's right, Xiaoju. I trust you.

553
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,200
Let's continue to be classmates in college.

554
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,559
Here.

555
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,110
Then it's a deal.

556
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:13,508
Someone is lighting fireworks.

557
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,350
Happy New Year!

558
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,920
- Happy New year!
- Happy New year!

559
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,970
After the college entrance exam, I must go and see the ocean!

560
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,709
We'll go with you!

561
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,110
No problem!

562
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,949
Happy New Year!

563
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:38,339
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

564
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,549
Xia Xiaoju, is that your dad?

565
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,710
Xiaoju, where did you go this late at night?

566
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,719
I was worried to death. This kid!

567
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:37,759
Dad, I...

568
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,980
Uncle Xia, Xiaoju went to watch fireworks with us just now.

569
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,969
Happy New Year, Uncle. We'll go back first. Let's go. Let's go.

570
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,120
- Goodbye, Uncle.
- I was worried to death.
- Bye, Uncle!

571
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,120
- Dad.
- It's cold. Throw it away.

572
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,000
You can't do this again in the future, okay?

573
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,759
You worried me to death.

574
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,300
Okay, let's go home.

575
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,630
Xiaoju, you're an adult now.

576
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,189
You can't run away from home just because you were scolded.

577
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,130
We were so worried about you.

578
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,250
I understand, Dad.

579

<i>When we were young,</i>

580
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,039

00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,750
<i>Do you like your mom or your dad more?</i>

582
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,740
<i>For other children, this was an especially difficult question.</i>

583
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,240
<i>But I think this question was not difficult at all.</i>

584

<i>[My target: Jiangzhou University]</i>

589
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,389
Xia Xiaoju. Jiangzhou University is a top university.

590
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,409
Teacher, I won't choose their first major.

591
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:41,270
I'll choose second one.

592
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,059
Look. Everything we do should be within our own capabilities.

593
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:48,529
To get into Jiangzhou University's second major

594
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:52,860
with your current grades is indeed a bit difficult.

595
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,870
Even you think I won't make it as well?

596
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,049
No, no. I didn't mean it like that.

597
00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:00,659
What I meant was, when we choose our goal,

598
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,620
we should try to choose goals that are safer.

599
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,609
But for me, there's not really anything that's safe.

600
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,069
You can't say it like that.

601
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:13,900
So that's why I want to try it.

602
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,569
Teacher, wasn't there an old saying that goes like,

603
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:19,070
"Put in the effort even if the outcome is bleak?"
<i>(T/N: Lit. treating a dead horse as if it's still alive.)</i>

604
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,579
Teacher, just let me give it a try.

605
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:24,860
I think I can definitely make it.

606
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:32,710
Fine then. You must think carefully about the second major then.

607
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,909
Okay.

608
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:36,689
- Thank you, Teacher. Teacher, goodbye!
- Okay.

609

642
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,389
Things like, "I'm not cut out for studying."

643
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:09,970
And, "I can't get into a college."

644
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,469
If I really thought that you can't get into a college,

645
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,260
why would I buy this for you?

646
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,329
I'm just afraid that in case you don't get accepted,

647
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:21,430
you'll feel upset.

648
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,099
I'm more upset that you guys don't trust me.

649
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,819
Okay. Okay. As long as you study hard,

650
00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:30,459
no matter whether you get accepted or not,

651
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:33,640
I won't blame you, okay?

652
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,699
Mom, I'll really study hard this time.

653
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:42,549
In the last two exams, my class ranking improved.

654
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:46,380
Really? That's great.

655
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,240
Then that means that Mr. Kong's secret recipe is quite useful.

656
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,999
But don't stay up too late these upcoming days.

657
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,469
You still need to take care of your body.

658
00:35:59,469 --> 00:36:00,739
Okay.

659
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:03,620
Okay, hurry and do your homework.

00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:47,560
Okay. Thanks, Brother Lang.

664
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,370
Let me.

665
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,850
Anything else you need help with?

666
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,049
Help me tear off these posters.

667
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:20,950
I'm afraid I'll be distracted.

668
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,669
It looks like you've really made up your mind.

669
00:37:25,669 --> 00:37:29,580
There are many good points about me.

670
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,369
One of them is that I live up to my words.

671
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:37,240
Since I've decided to study hard before the college entrance exam,

672
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,470
I absolutely won't touch these before the exam.

673
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,969
It'd be great if you thought like this early on!

674
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:47,839
The exam is less than three months away.

675
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,640
You need to make use of your time.

Let's fight together.

679
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,629
This seriousness of his...

680
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,999
Is he really studying?

681
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
What else do you think?

682
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,499
If he really studies this seriously, let me tell you,

683
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:45,719
he'll definitely be able to get accepted into the majors and universities I chose for him.

684
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:47,470
It'll absolutely be no problem.
