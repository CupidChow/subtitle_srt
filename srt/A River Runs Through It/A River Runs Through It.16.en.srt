Hey! Why did I sleep here?

4
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,430
Are you awake?

5
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,660
Tell me! Why did I sleep in your home?

6
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,760
Did you forget how you were drunk yesterday?

7
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,829
If your mom knew, she would definitely give you a beating.

8
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,700
That's why I brought you to sleep in my home.

9
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,999
Was I drunk yesterday?

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,860
You even held a concert in the street.

11
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,419
Then... did I say something I shouldn't have?

12
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:44,760
You told me a secret yesterday.

13
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,540
You said you like...

14
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,500
Be quiet! Don't let Uncle Lu hear!

15

I need to warn you that

16
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,879
if you know something you must never say it out loud!

17
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,180
You can't tell anyone.

18
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,620
I'm joking.

19
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,779
You didn't say anything.

20
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,460
I also don't know who you like.

21
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,799
My parents have gone to visit my grandma, so they're not home.

22
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,079
Otherwise, do you think I would dare to bring you here to sleep?

23
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,319
If my dad knew that I took you out for drinks and got you drunk,

24
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,139
he would've beat me to death.

25
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:23,060
Why didn't you say so earlier?

26
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,749
Also, why didn't you sleep in your parents' room?

27
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,110
Why did you insist on sleeping on the floor here?

28
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:29,829
I was afraid someone would be scared to death

29
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,600
if she woke up and noticed it wasn't her home in the middle of the night.

Am I that cowardly?

31
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,976
I suddenly remembered that Shen Duo asked me to attend the basketball's club training.

32
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:43,487
I have to go back after breakfast.

Do you want to come with me?

34
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,265
No, I'll go back in the afternoon.

35
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,319
It's rare for me to come home,

36
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,260
so I have to make sure to eat meals made by my mom.

37
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,519
I couldn't tell that you had such a good appetite.

38

Wait for me here. I'll go get you a new toothbrush.

39
00:03:57,288 --> 00:03:58,549
Go back home after brushing your teeth.

40
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,909
Otherwise, it would be over if your mom smells your mouth.

41
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,200
You really are quite thoughtful.

42

Wait!

43
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,079
If my mom finds out that I stayed out all night, she'll beat me to death!

44
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,270
What should I do?

45
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,100
Don't worry. I'll tell you what to do later.

46

I'm all sweaty. I'm going to take a shower.

49

Hurry and take the shower! Once you're done, come out for breakfast.

I can train with you first.

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,300
- None.
- Teacher!

164
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,200
- I have a question.
- Go ahead, Cheng Lang.

165
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,800
Can I team up with students from the Computer Department?

166
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,200
As long as you can find someone, of course, you can.

167
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,400
But you will get no credits.

168
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,900
Okay. Thank you, Teacher.

169
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,600
What's wrong, Lin You?

170
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,800
Cheng Lang.

171
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,800
Is your audio and video shop still recruiting?

172
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,000
I want to have another part-time job.

173
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,200
You're already teaching at the dance center,

174
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,800
yet you still want another part-time job?

175
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,600
You'll be too busy.

176
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,400
After my parents divorced,

177
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,700
we didn't get any alimony.

178
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,000
As my mom has no job, so...

179
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,400
If you need money, I can help you.

180
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,000
No! No, I am not looking to borrow your money.

181
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,600
I just want to support my mom and I, by myself.

182
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,200
Do you know?

183
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,900
Actually, my mom used to be an excellent piano teacher.

184
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,000
But after she married my dad,

185
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,100
she abandoned her career for our family.

186
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,900
Actually, I think Auntie can return to teach piano.

187
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,600
That way, Auntie can have something to do.

188
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
As time passes, she can become happier.

189
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,600
My mom's personality is too delicate.

190
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,400
She hasn't gone to work for so long either.

191
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm afraid she can't handle troublesome parents.

192
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,400
Lin You.

193
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,800
You are underestimating your mom.

194
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,200
I think she must be stronger than what you perceive

195
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
because she's a mother.

196
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,400
My dad passed away very early.

197
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,600
He loved my mom very much and asked her to do nothing

198
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
so you could imagine the life

199
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,200
my mom and me had after he passed away.

200
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,600
My mom didn't know how to do any housework,

201
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,200
and she's very careless.

202
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,800
I remember always eating her half-cooked meals when I was a child.

203
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Later, when she was in her thirties,

204
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,000
she became an apprentice at a barbershop to help pay for my education.

205
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,000
When I went to middle school,

206
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
we finally had our own barbershop.

207
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,200
Auntie really is amazing.

208
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,100
So I don't think you should underestimate your mom.

209
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,000
She must be stronger than what you perceive.

210
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,200
I understand.

211
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,800
I'll become someone like you,

212
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,600
amazing and filial, through my own hard work.

213
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,500
You will.

214
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,000
Thank you, Cheng Lang.

215
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,040
I have less than a hundred yuan left.

216
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,460
Why is it so hard to find a part-time job?

217
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,349
Xiaoju! Hurry and come with me!

218
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,840
- Come with me!
- What's wrong?

219
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,420
Huang Jun's band is looking for a lead singer.

220
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,440
Let's go to hand out leaflets with me! Let's go.

221
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,740
<i>[Jixian Band - Recruiting a Lead Singer]</i>

222
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,520
Classmate, the Jixian Band is recruiting a lead singer. Are you interested in getting to know more about it?

223
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,940
The Jixian Band is recruiting a lead singer. You can audition on the second floor over there.

224
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,410
- The Jixian Band is recruiting a lead singer, are you interested?
- No, thanks.

225
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,600
- No, thanks.
- Thank you.

226
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,069
Take a look. Thank you! Classmate, take a look.

227
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,740
The Jixian Band is recruiting a lead singer.

228
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,739
<i>Huang Jun, we should get started.</i>

229
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,400
Okay.

230
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,600
Let's start.

231
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,500
Her skills are quite good.

232
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,932
Why are you looking at him so smittenly?

233
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,429
He played guitar in the singer's competition last time.

234
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:09,040
You didn't see it, but he was so handsome when playing guitar.

235
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,480
- Can you sing?
- No.

236
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,540
Then I'm very sorry, but we are recruiting a lead singer.

237
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,240
Thanks for coming.

238
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,840
Taotao. Cheng Lang is paging me.

239
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,930
All right, you can go. I can handle it here alone.

240
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,260
- Then I am leaving.
- All right.

241
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,920
By the way, this is for you. It's your reward for helping out.

242
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,519
You don't need to do this. We're friends. Take it.

243
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,229
No, take it. It's from Huang Jun.

244
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,060
- I have one, too.
- Really?

245
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,270
Yes! Come on, take it.

246
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,679
Then thank him for me.

247
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,399
Hurry and go! Aren't you busy?

248
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,540

I am here specifically for you, Huang Jun!

I want to join your band, too!

I'm really sorry. Thank you.

- Can you sing?
- Yes, I can!

261
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,699
It's slightly a bit too classical.

262
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:01,065

Excuse me, wait a moment.

270
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,133
Why did you come out? Aren't you in the audition?

271
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:31,850
I stopped for a moment! Stop handing them out!

272
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,510
Why? I haven't finished yet.

273
00:21:33,511 --> 00:21:36,600
You've been handing them out the whole day already. My heart aches for you.

274
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,859
But they'll be wasted if I can't give them out today.

275
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,040
It's fine if they are wasted. Listen to me and go back to rest.

276
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,700
I'll treat you to midnight snacks after the interview is over.

277
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,430
But I still think...

278
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,580
Our Taotao worked hard today.

279
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,200
What's he doing? Treating music as child's play?

280
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,060
I have to go in now.

281
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,980
Then fighting!

282
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,340

Your guitar's third string is a bit off-key.

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,522
Could I help tune it for you?

287
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:18,020
It might benefit your performance.

288
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,340
Come on. Hand your guitar over.

289

Are you interested in joining our band now?

332
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,519
Cheng Lang.

333
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,799
Xiaoju.

334
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,239
Sorry for troubling you again.

335
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,820
It's fine.

336
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:06,189
Who are you choosing a present for this time?

337
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,932
I want to choose another gift for Lin You.

338
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,589
She really liked the hat you recommended.

339
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,840
So I wanted to trouble you for some advice again.

340
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,760
Alright.

341
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,140
What else do you think Lin You would like?

342
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,980
Let me have a look.

343
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:16,760
Do you think this is good?

344
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,532
Do you think it is sincere enough to send when I confess to her?

345
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,740
Are you going to confess to her?

346
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,059
I only told you and Shiyi about it.

347
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,799
Don't tell anyone else.

348
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,420
If she doesn't accept my confession, then I would be very embarrassed.

349
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,189
Do you think sending this would be sincere?

350
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,560
Is it a little bit cheap?

351
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,620
No.

352
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,487
When confessing, what's most important is your heart,

353
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:52,700
not the price of the gift.

354
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,532
I think it's quite good.

355
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,620
Lin You will definitely like it.

356
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,799
You're very reliable.

357
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,039
Shiyi has given me so many suggestions but none of them are feasible.

358
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,500
Anyway, he still asks me to invite him to eat.

359
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,599
Xiaoju, thank you.

360
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,360
This is the one.

361
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,519
Boss, please wrap this for me.

362
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,000
Okay.

363
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,200
Xiaoju, what's wrong?

364
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,559
Well... I've got a piece of grit in my eye.

365
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,620
Can you help me get it out?

366
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,199
It hurts.

367
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,659
- Do you feel better?
- Yes. Much better.

368
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:52,600
If the gift is wrapped, then let's leave quickly.

369
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,990
- Thank you, Boss.
- You're welcome.

370
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,320
Xiaoju, let's leave.

371
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,680
Do you think the color of the wrapping paper is good enough?

372
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,840
If you like it, Lin You definitely would too.

373
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:19,680
I think it's not bad.

374
00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:22,565
I'm going to head to the computer room then.

375
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:25,200
Lin You is waiting to do some group work with me.

376
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,360
Okay.

377
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,680
Thank you, Xiaoju.

378
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,820
You must succeed.

379
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,420
I treat you guys to meal later on.

380
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,369
<i>Hurry and go confess to him!</i>

381

382

<i>Fighting, Xia Xiaoju!</i>

383
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,460
<i>You can do it!</i>

Come on!

Can you walk faster?

405
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,440
I was going to head to the dorms to look for you.

406
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,069
Come with me.

407
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,059
I found a part-time job for you in a convenience store near campus.

408
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,339
Although the money isn't high,

409
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,069
the schedule is more flexible.

410
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,779
Also, the shopkeeper is A'Mu's relative. He's very reliable.

411
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,340
Let's go.

412
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,519
Let's go!

413
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,969
All right.

414
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:54,540
Run faster. Did you not eat or something?

415

Don't pull my hair!

416
