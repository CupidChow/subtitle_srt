You're not musically gifted. Honestly,

15
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:03,110
I suggest you use a soundtrack, okay?

16
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,979
Well, I'd have no sense of feeling if I listen to the soundtrack on stage.

17

I look cool playing the guitar.

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,000
Shiyi, you've been reading for so long. Take a break.

209
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,710
Take a break!

210
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,279
He was a troublemaker a while ago.

211
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,589
Why is he a bookworm now?

212
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,140
What a mystery this world is.

213
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,310
Lu Shiyi!

214
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,810
Odd.

215
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,880
What's it?

216
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,779
Xia Xiaoju. What... What are you doing?

217
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,840
What's this?

218
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,839
Well... No... Nothing.

219
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,140
No!

220
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,110
Don't go!

221
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,440
I... I lost my shoe!

222
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,260
What are you doing? I lost my shoe!

223
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,480
I've been calling you, and you didn't answer.

224
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,860
I thought you were deaf!

225
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,279
Datu!

226
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,379
Tell me if you've been using it. Yes?

227
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,060
Do you think my singing is awful?

228
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,920
Xia Xiaoju.

229
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,670
You're annoying.

230
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,200
Get away.

231
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,150
Wait for me.

232
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,200
Wait for me!

233
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,599
You're in bed quite early.

234
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,960
Go away. Leave me alone.

235
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,610
Le Tao.

236
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,350
Hello, Le Tao.

237
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,199
I just came back to my dorm room.

238
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,960
Really.

239
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,710
<i>Lu Shiyi, do you think my singing is awful?</i>

240
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,690
<i>Lu Shiyi, do you think my singing is awful?</i>

241
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,429
No. No. Absolutely not.

242
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,940
How could I like her?

243
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,680
Who do you like?

244
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,359
Wait.

245
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,160
Who do you like?

246
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,720
I like you.

247
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,950
Do you want to join me in the shower?

248
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,940
No.

249
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,050
Are you alone?

250
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,559
Because Qiu Le Tao picks the man she likes over me.

251
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,490
She drops me when she's in a relationship.

252
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,389
But I think I'm lucky today.

253
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:02,109
For what?

254
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:07,270
I met you when I was worried no one would eat with me.

255
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,800
I don't think I can stay with you longer.

256
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,919
It's too early for you to go to the video store.

257
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,390
Shiyi is sick.

258
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,310
I have to deliver the meal to him before I go there.

259
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,459
It's okay.

260
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:22,469
You go to work.

261
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,489
I'll deliver it to him later, okay?

262
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:26,790
Thank you.

263
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,610
Let's eat.

264
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,600
Yes.

265
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm coming in.

266
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,500
Look at the time. Why are you not up yet?

267
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,400
Why... Why are you here?

268
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Where is Cheng Lang?

269
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,200
Can't I come?

270
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,800
Cheng Lang must've told you I had a cold.

271
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
I...

272
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,300
Wait for me here. I'm going to wash up.

273
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,200
Your hair.

274
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,300
Cheng Lang.

275
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,700
Why are you here?

276
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,000
Where's Shiyi?

277
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,200
He went to clean up.

278
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,000
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

279
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,500
Did you brought a meal for him?

280
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,400
- Don't touch that!
- Shiyi.

281
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,700
What? Don't do that. I just marked it.

282
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,300
You can't read it.

283
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,100
Why are you so mad at me?

284
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm cleaning up your things.

285
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
Lu Shiyi.

286
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,600
Do you have a fever?

287
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,900
No.

288
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,200
Come on, your cheeks are so red.

289
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,700
Come. Go to the hospital. Come on.

290
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,800
No. I'm alive and kicking. Let me eat first.

291
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,000
All right. Eat and take pills when you finish.

292
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,200
Okay.

293
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,600
There's no water. I'll get some.

294
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,400
Go ahead.

295
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,000
Would you like a few bites? It's good.

296
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,300
No, I've eaten.

297
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,000
I already ate.

298
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,500
Well.

299
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,100
Done?

300
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,700
You have a good appetite.

301
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,200
Remember to take the medicine in thirty minutes.

302
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,800
According to the instructions.

303
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,300
Got it?

304
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,200
Oh my god. Look at you.

305
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,600
Can't you put the clothes you wore on one place?

306
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,100
Don't talk so much while you're working.

307
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,100
If it wasn't for your cold, I wouldn't clean up your things.

308
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
It's almost done.

309
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,800
I'm leaving.

310
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I'll see you off.

311
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
No need, just a short walk.

312
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,400
No, I have to.

313
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
Thank you.

314
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,400
Thank you.

315
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,200
<i>Xia Xiaoju is nice.</i>

316
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,600
<i>Just teach her.</i>

317
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,000
<i>I can't like Xia Xiaoju.</i>

318
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,600
No.

319
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,400
I have something to ask you.

320
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,900
Say.

321
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Where did you get this picture?

322
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,200
Are you going to explain it to me?

323
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,900
Explain what?

324
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,600
Do you like Qiu Le Tao?

325
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
What? Are you insane, Huang Jun?

326
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,400
Am I insane?

327
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Then why do you keep a photo of Qiu Le Tao?

328
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Are you blind?

329
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,600
Look. Is it just Qiu Le Tao in the picture? Who's this?

330
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
This is Xia Xiaoju.

331
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,500
You don't like Xia Xiaoju. You like Qiu Le Tao.

332
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,800
I like Xia Xiaoju now. Can't I?

333
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Take your Taotao.

334
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,400
Insane.

335
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Oh, false alarm.

336
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,800
It's a mistake.

337
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,400
You scared me.

338
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,600
You're fickle.

339
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,700
When are you going to tell Xia Xiaoju?

340
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,200
Listen, If you don't help me to keep it a secret, I'll tear your hair out.

341
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,000
Do you hear that?

342
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,100
I swear I won't...

343
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,000
I swear I won't tell others Lu Shiyi likes Xia Xiaoju.

344
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,500
Keep it down.

345
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,100
What are you looking at?

346
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,800
You won't stop?

347
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,900
I'm sorry.

348
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,200
- I swear...
- Be quiet.

349
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,400
I swear I won't tell others Lu Shiyi likes Xia Xiaoju.

350
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,200
Absolutely not.

351
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,500
I won't, Buddy.

352
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,600
Remember. You won't.

353
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,700
No.

Cheng Lang. I also entered the campus singing contest on Friday night.

359
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,800
Are you free to go and cheer for me?

360
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,400
Friday night?

361
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,800
Let me think.

362
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,400
Friday.

363
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,100
Do you have plans?

364
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,200
No, I'm just fooling you.

365
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,800
Even if I have to skip class, I'll go to cheer for you.

366
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,400
You've been preparing for this contest.

367
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,000
I believe you'll play awesome.

368
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
You'll succeed.

369

I'll succeed.

Xiaoju.

371
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:35,200
If I want to send a gift to a girl,

372
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,700
what do you think is appropriate?

373
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,800
If it were me,

374
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,800
I'd prefer something usual for girls.

375
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,600
Something usual?

376
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,200
Like silk scarves, headbands, hats...

377
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
Headbands.

378
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,300
Or hairpins.

379
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,800
Headbands, hairpins.

380
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,000
Silk scarves, hats.

381
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,200
Okay, I got it.

382
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,900
Thank you, Xiaoju.

383
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,600
Not at all.

384
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,400
Cheng Lang.

385
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,500
You're not going to send...

386
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,300
a gift to the girl you like.

387
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,700
Well. I'll buy drinks. Wait for me.

388
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
Taotao.

389
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,600
What's up?

390
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,700
Oh my god.

391
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,800
You know what, I'm so so so happy.

392
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,400
What's up?

393
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,800
Cheng Lang said he wanted to send a gift to a girl soon.

394
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,400
What's more, it's the girl he likes.

395
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,800
This means he's likely to give you a surprise at the contest.

396
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,800
That's great.

397
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,600
Oh my god!

- Pretty.

406
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,400
Oh, yeah. Xiaoju.

407
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,300
I brought you a dress.

408
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,400
I don't think your clothes are right.

409
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,200
I was supposed to buy a new one for you,

410
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
but I was delayed.

411
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,200
So I took one of mine.

412
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,300
I only wore it once.

413
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,400
I don't know if you like it.

414
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh my god!

415

Look, do you like it?

423
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
Do I look pretty?

424
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,000
Say, am I beautiful with makeup?

425
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,600
Ugly is still ugly even with makeup.

426
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,500
What the hell? Can't you tell me I look pretty?

427
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,800

What are you doing?

432
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,800
- What?
- It's my fresh lipstick.

433
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,400
What? What's it?

434
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,800
- He said I'm ugly.
- It's awful.

435
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,600
And he ruined my lipstick.

436
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,000
What's wrong with me to be honest?

437
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,700
I'll let him have it. Lu Shiyi.

438
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,100
- What?
- I'm telling the truth. Can't I tell the truth?

439
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,600
- You're talking shit.
- What shit am I talking about?

440

Shiyi, seriously! Why did you ruin her makeup?

487
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,600
It'll be your fault if her love confession fails!

- Why would it be my fault?
- Yes, your fault.

- Xiaoju, good luck!

Good luck!
