<i>[Episode 25: Knowing you're here, I'm reassured, Part I]</i>

3
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,240
Why are you so diligent today?

4
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,750
It's still so early. I thought it was the milkman.

5
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,360
Still early? It's already ten o'clock!

6
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,070
Uncle and Auntie are not here, right?

7
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,670
They're not here. Did you want to see them?

8
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,490
I just came by to ask,

9
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,930
you didn't tell Cheng Lang about that thing, right?

10
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,030
What didn't you tell me?

11
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,659
You...

12
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,100
Why are you here?

13
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,130
Yesterday, I came to borrow the computer from Shiyi to work on my program.

14
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,759
I didn't finish it before 2:00 a.m. so I just slept here.

15
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,880
Xiaoju, why do I feel like you've been acting weird lately?

16
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,710
What didn't you tell me?

17
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,310
Nothing.

18
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,729
Actually, she came here the other day to ask me...

19
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,430
It's like this!

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,160
- You know I'm changing my major, right?
- Right.

21
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,419
That department's professor said

22
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,600
that I need to submit a short essay.

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,339
I want to write a two-day tour plan around Jiangzhou.

24
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,550
It can't be written at home.

25
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,190
So I want to go to the sites and take a look.

26
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,870
Then what?

27
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,780
What does that have to do with me?

28
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,760
Then...

29
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,370
Then I came to borrow money and a camera from him.

30
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,649
I didn't expect him to spend money like it's water. He's totally broke.

31
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,259
So he said that he'll help me ask you.

32
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,369
I know that you're usually pretty frugal with your money,

33
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,880
so I didn't want to ask you.

34
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,000
Then I was just asking him whether he told you about it yet.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,820
Yes, that's right. Lend her some money.

36
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,620
You could have just directly told me.

37
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,900
Let me take a look.

38
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,219
I have a total of two hundred.

39
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,529
Is that enough?

40
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,100
No, no, there's no need. You really don't have to. You really don't have to.

41
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,330
We're all a family. Why are you being so polite?

42
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,699
Just take it! Why are you being so polite with him?

43
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,460
- Go, go.
- That's right.

44
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,160
- Just go now.
- When do you plan on going?

45
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,289
I want to take some photos

46
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,219
to put in my two-day tour plan.

47
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,830
That way, it will look more vivid.

48
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,059
So this afternoon, I want to go

49
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,929
and take pictures of the sunset at Liu Village.

50
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,530
But I don't want to tell my Mom about this.

51
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,610
So I'm going to ask Qiu Le Tao to help cover for me.

52
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,779
I can go with you.

53
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,529
No need, I know Liu Village very well.

54
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,929
I can go alone.

55
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,630
I'm leaving now. Bye bye!

56
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,500
Put them on slowly. No one is going to steal your shoes.

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,019
I'm in a hurry. I'm leaving now. Bye bye!

58
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,439
Lu Shiyi. What secrets do the two of you have?

59
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,649
Xiaoju is not here right now,

60
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,450
just tell me.

61
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,810
What secrets can the both of us have?

62
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,250
Listen,

63
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,830
I'll go back and tell my parents that your dad accompanied your mom to visit your grandmother.

64
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,499
You're afraid to sleep alone.

65
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,949
So I'll go and accompany you. All right?

66
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,009
Then what if during these few days,

67
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,779
your mom calls me and asks to talk to you? What should I do?

68
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,939
Then you can just tell her

69
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,569
that I'm using the restroom, showering, or sleeping.

70
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,560
Anyway, as long as it can deceive her, then it's fine.

71
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,379
I'm only going for two days anyway.

72
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,660
I don't think she'll call too many times.

73
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,880
Still from Huang Jun?

74
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,380
Do you want to call the paging center and listen to the message?

75
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,219
I don't want to hear it.

76
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,120
Let's go. We're here.

77
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,899
Hello, girls.

78
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,409
What are you looking for?

79
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,389
Boss, I want to ask how much did Huang Jun

80
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,450
owe you for the instrument he bought here last time?

81
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,030
You're the girl who came with him to buy the instrument last time, right?

82
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,539
That stinky brat kept defaulting on it.

83
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,470
I was considering stopping him at the school gate

84
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,670
to get my guitar back.

85
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,039
Let me see.

86
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,539
He still owes me... six hundred.

87
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,899
That much?

88
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,009
It's not that much.

89
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,969
I already gave him a 20% discount.

90
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,339
Originally, it was more expensive.

91
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,729
This instrument doesn't make much money for me in the first place.

92
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,169
I can help him pay some first.

93
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,689
But I only have—

94
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,590
Excuse me, Boss.

95
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,129
What are you doing?

96
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,939
Everyone chips in for the band fund.

97
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,009
I'm also a part of it.

98
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,379
I don't want to be pressed to repay the debt when school starts.

99
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,439
Everyone chips in, so everyone should pay for it.

100
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,449
Why must you pay for it alone?

101
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,379
That's because Huang Jun bought a guitar for Xu Menglu,

102
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,099
so that's why he owes the money.

103
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,539
He doesn't want the rest of the band to know about it.

104
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,099
Then that's more than enough reason for you to not help him!

105
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,379
He spent his money lavishly,

106
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,289
ran out of it and being pressed to repay his debt.

107
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,220
Why are you helping him?

108
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,689
Xiaoju, I've always been a part of the establishment of the band.

109
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,920
I don't want it to disband.

110
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,480
Boss, I just withdrew the money out of the bank.

111
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,499
Taotao, I'm going back to pack up some things first.

112
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,099
If my mom calls to ask you about it,

113
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,819
you mustn't let anything slip.

114
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,380
Don't worry, I'm not an idiot.

115
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,619
And you say you're not idiot.

116
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,680
You just helped Huang Jun pay that much money. Do you think you're not an idiot?

117
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,920
Just hurry and go back home!

118
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,550
- Then I'm going back now.
- Bye bye.

119
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,920
Bye.

I went to your house and found out you weren't there.

124
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,280
So I walked down this road.

125
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,910
You didn't answer my calls nor reply to my messages.

126
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,200
Don't you miss me?

Go away!

138
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,239
I know I was wrong, Taotao. I'm sorry.

139
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:26,109
I beg you to please forgive me this once, okay? Just this one time.

Taotao!

144
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,340
I'm going to buy band-aids.

145
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,380
I'll go with you!

146
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,290
Mom?

147
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,129
Mom?

148
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,009
I'm here. What is it?

149
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,320
Mom, that...

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,129
Qiu Le Tao's parents are not at home.

151
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,659
She wants me to stay with her for two days.

152
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,539
Xiaoju, I've inquired about it.

153
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,809
That tourism management major

154
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,659
is not doable. The tuition is very high,

155
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,739
and it'll be difficult to find a job in the future.

156
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,929
It's not as stable as this accounting major.

157
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,839
Since you're a girl, you should just stick with accounting.

158
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,539
All right, I understand, Mom.

159
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,339
I can't talk any longer.

160
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,340
I need to go pack up and head over there.

161
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,040
All right. All right.

162
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,510
Lu Shiyi.

163
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,520
Lu Shiyi.

164
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,740
I'll be right down.

165
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,520
Let's go.

166
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,929
Are you a pig?
<i>(T/N: Dumb)</i>

167
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,339
You're the pig.

168
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,709
The reason why I didn't go upstairs to get it

169
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,739
was because I was afraid your parents will find out I borrowed your camera.

170
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,890
If they tell my mom, it'll make her suspicious.

171
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,859
And you? You're carrying it out here so blatantly.

172
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,049
If you're not the pig, then who is?

173
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,569
You are.

174
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,810
Don't you see me carrying a bag?

175
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,130
Why are you carrying a bag?

176
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,449
It's too boring to stay at home every day.

177
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,419
I told my mom I'm going on a trip.

178
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,099
I don't think they saw you.

179
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,930
They don't know that I'm going on a trip with you.

180
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,249
There are so many eyes watching in this small community.

181
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,119
You go this way. I go that way.

182
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,100
I'll see you at the station.

183
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,300
Stop eating it!

184
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,449
What are you laughing at?

185
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,890
If you continue to laugh, I'll have Jiashu hit you!

186
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,669
Datu, how is it?

187
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:38,490
Isn't the air in the countryside better?

188
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,779
It's such a backcountry,

189
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,899
and it's not some tourist attraction.

190
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,000
What's so fun about this place?

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,899
All the fun is in my head.

192
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Come here! Come here!

193
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,179
This is so cute!

194
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,180
Give me the camera, Datu.

195
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,299
Where do you put in the roll of film?

196
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,569
You're so tacky.

197
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,899
This is a digital camera.

198
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,779
The pictures you take are saved directly in a memory card.

199
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,349
Once you connect it to a computer, you can see them directly.

200
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:27,570
Come here and I'll show you.

201
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,480
Wait a minute.

202
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,950
Smile.

203
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,520
Come here.

204
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,770
Look.

205
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,299
We can see it even without developing it?

206
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,820
It's high-tech. Isn't it awesome?

207
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,489
Not only that, if you press this, you can directly see the previous picture?

208
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,209
Do you know how to take pictures? My eyes are closed in this one.

209
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,339
And this one, too.

210
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,049
You made me look like a fool!

211
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,480
I just photographed what you truly look like.

212
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,210
I'll take them myself.

213
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,339
It'll be good if the screen could turn around.

214
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,489
Now you're even designing it.

215
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,450
What are you thinking? Do you know how to use it?

216
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,660
I think I know how now.

217
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,010
The place I chose is wonderful.

218
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,740
I'm such a master.

219
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,640
That's enough, right?

220
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,009
Please don't disturb my creation, okay?

221
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,100
All right, keep creating.

222
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,249
This one is good.

223
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,219
Shiyi, see?

224
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,920
Doesn't it look pretty?

225
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,860
Look at this. Why are you looking at me?

226
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,100
Why are you blushing?

227
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,010
It's hot here from the sun.

228
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,569
Isn't the sun about to set?

229
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,099
And yet you still feel hot?

230
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,349
When the sun sets,

231
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:14,170
have you thought about where we'll live tonight?

232
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,809
Can such a little thing stump me?

233
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,310
Follow me.

234
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,640
Where exactly are we going?

235
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,049
Just closely follow this older sister, and you'll be fine.

236
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,650
Why are you asking so many questions?

237
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,299
- Look!
- Xia Xiaoju, my legs are sore. Where is it?

238
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,420
It's straight ahead.

239
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,219
- This one?
- Yes.

240
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,720
Hurry!

241
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,129
Grandma, then we'll have to bother you for letting us stay for the night.

242
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,739
It's not a bother. It's not a bother.

243
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:45,539
Tiantian already told me.

244
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,040
It's just that there's only one empty room here.

245
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,419
I'm sorry, Grandma.

246
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,779
He came with me at the last moment.

247
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,539
So I forgot to tell Tiantian about it.

248
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,539
Xiaoju, if you don't mind that I snore at night,

249
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,339
you can sleep with me.

250
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,569
This boy can stay in the other room.

251
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,249
It's all right, Grandma. There's no need.

252
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,009
I can just sleep on this bamboo bed.

253
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,350
Just let her stay in that room.

254
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,299
It's okay. I can—

255
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,339
Don't argue with me.

256
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,129
It's cooler to sleep on a bamboo bed during the summer.

257
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,049
Grandma, could you please get me a blanket?

258
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,430
All right, okay. I'll go and get you some food first.

259
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,130
- Thank you, Grandma.
- Thank you, Grandma!

260
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,620
Datu, good night.

261
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,489
Tomorrow, I'll take you somewhere fun.

262
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,130
Isn't it still too early to sleep?

263
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,220
Do you have any other plans?

264
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,430
Come here.

265
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,169
Did you bring something delicious or fun?

266
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:56,419
This time, I came out in a hurry.

267
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,420
I didn't bring anything.

268
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,590
So mysterious!

269
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,840
<i>[A Guide to Advanced Mathematics]</i>

270
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,659
Lu Shiyi, are you the devil?

271
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,369
You came out to have fun, yet you still brought the Advanced Mathematics book?

272
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,609
Do you still want to change majors?

273
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,369
Of course, I do!

274
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,299
But we have to combine work and rest, right?

275
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,030
How about we just enjoy ourselves this time.

276
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,099
We'll talk more about Advanced Mathematics when we go back, okay?

277
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,569
I'm going now!

278
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,050
Come back here! You're really—

279
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,489
You hurt me!

280
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,810
If you want me to learn, then just teach me!

281
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,340
It hurts a lot.

282
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,080
Why are you just standing there? Weren't you going to teach me? Then teach me.

283
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,419
Oh, then... Then let's go to another place to learn.

284
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,570
We might bother Grandma from sleeping if we stay here.

285
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,100
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,269
You should be!

287
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:05,800
When can I escape from this sea of suffering?

288
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,170
Haven't these mosquitoes ever drank outsiders' blood?

289
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,299
What are you doing?

290
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,729
Your mind was wandering again.

291
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,059
I was clearly thinking, okay?

292
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,780
- You disturbed my studying.
- Give it to me.

293
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,420
Let me see the results of your thinking.

294
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,220
Is this the result of your thinking?

295
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,129
Did you even seriously listen to what I was teaching you?

296
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,299
This question is the same as the last one.

297
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,249
You still did it wrong.

298
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,849
You are really such a blockhead!

299
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,939
Oh my god, so stupid.

300
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,330
Why is your temper so bad?

301
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,369
Say that again.

302
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,370
Cheng Lang's temper is better.

303
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,230
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,640
I was wrong to hit you.

305
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,960
I apologize.

306
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,249
Listen carefully, okay?

307
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,559
I'll teach you this question again.

308
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,969
Listen carefully.

309
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,100
Look. This question is like this.

310
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,579
X is equal to two.

311
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,280
Right?

312
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,539
What?

313
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,520
I'm getting goosebumps and shivering.

314
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,100
Look at this question!

315
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,779
Listen, if you get this question wrong again tonight,

316
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,849
don't even think about getting some sleep!

317
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,700
Look at the question!

318
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,920
Look at the question. What have I told you?

319
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,179
According to this, we can tell that X is equal to zero.

320
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,129
Y is equal to two Z, and then you can substitute.

321
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,250
Got it? Calculate!

322
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,699
Calculate! Look at the question, don't look at me.

323
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,299
Are you a pig?

324
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,229
You are the pig.

325
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,059
Say it again.

326
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,080
I have a bad temper. So what?

327
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,799
You're too dumb! Really!

328
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,269
I've never seen such a dumb girl before.

329
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:14,329
You're too dumb!

330
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,330
Oh my god, Xia Xiaoju.

331
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,199
X equals... What?

332
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:21,329
X equals zero.

333
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,590
Y is equal to two Z, and then you substitute.

334
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,079
- Then how do you substitute?
- How do you substitute?

335
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,950
Just directly substitute!

336
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,600
You're up.

337
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,000
Grandma. Good morning, Grandma!

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,500
Morning.

339
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,400
Grandma, where's my friend?

340
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,000
He's in the kitchen right now.

341
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,400
- In the kitchen?
- Yes.

342
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,600
Then I'll have to go and take a look.

343
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
What are you doing?

344
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,700
Can't you tell? I'm cooking.

345
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,400
It smells good.

346
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,300
It smells good, doesn't it?

347
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,800
This is my secret recipe.

348
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,200
A secret garnishing recipe, I bet.

349
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,400
I'm hungry. Give me some.

350
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,500
I'm hungry. I'll just have a little bit.

351
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,100
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean, "What?"

352
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,200
I've been busy all morning.

353
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,600
You didn't even say anything nice.

354
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,300
Do you even know how to make scallion pancakes?

355
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,400
I bet you can only make a fire.

356
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,200
- Let me eat some.
- I'm not giving it to you.

357
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,400
Just a bite.

358
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,600
Why are you so stingy?

359
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,200
Just a little bit. Just a little bit!

360
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm not giving you any! I'm not giving you any!

361
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,300
What are you doing?

362
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
What are you doing?

363
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,700
I'm telling you. I'm angry that you made my face dirty.

364
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,500
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,100
Eat slowly. It's fresh out of the pan.

366
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Delicious?

367
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,000
This is delicious!

368
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,600
There's still some that you haven't wiped off yet.

369
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,300
Where?

370
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,400
Don't keep me from eating my pancake.

371
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,200
Tour Guide Xia, where are we going later to have fun?

372
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,000
Let me think.

373
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,300
Where shall we go later?

374
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,700

Oh my god, I'm so good at taking pictures!

390
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Look, Datu. It's beautiful.

391
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,800
It's quite good.

392
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,900
After these pictures are developed, I'll leave them with you.

393
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,200
Then I'll go to your place to write the essay. That way, my mom won't nag at me.

394
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,000
It's so annoying.

395
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,300
At that time, I can also help tutor you in Advanced Mathematics.

396
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,200
Can you not mention such annoying things?

397
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Can't you courageously face these annoying things?

398
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,500
Come on, let's go. Let's go back

399
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,400
and tell Grandma.

400
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,600
Let me grab my bike first.

401
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,900
Get on.

402
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,500
Ready?

403
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,400
Slow down. You're going to drop me!

404
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,900
Don't you know to hold onto my waist?

405
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,179
Datu, thank you.

406
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,089
If it weren't for you,

407
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,700
I still wouldn't know what major to study.

408
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
I didn't know you are reliable indeed.

409
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,200
I've always been reliable.

410
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,700
You just didn't see it.

411
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
Actually, I used to quite hate you.

412
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,600
Because you always insult me.

413
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,800
I didn't think that after knowing you,

414
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,800
the more I think that you're extremely reliable.

415
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,700
Every time when I have something that's on my mind or when something bothers me,

416
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,400
you'll immediately show up and help me.

417
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Knowing that you're by my side, I'll feel extremely at ease.

418
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,000
Datu, ride carefully.

419
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,400
Xia Xiaoju, be my tour guide when I travel in the future.

420
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,800
Okay.

421
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,300
But when you become a doctor,

422
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,600
will you have time?

423
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,800
If you accompany me, I'll make time.

424
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,000
You are so playful.

425
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,400
Sit tight!

426
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
I'm going to speed up.

427
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,600
No, wait!

<i>[A two-day trip plan around Jiangzhou]</i>

429
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,000
Done!

430
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,860
Doesn't it look more vivid like this?

431
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,800
Datu, I feel that you're very reliable.

432
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,000
Is it the first day you know that?

433
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Eat it while it's hot, Taotao.

434
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,100
So unnecessary.

435
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,600
It's true that it's more convenient to pick up.

436
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,200
But the spirit of barbecue is... eating it like this!

437
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,300
Understand?

438
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,700
You got it all off for Taotao.

439
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,600
Isn't it like eating a stir-fry dish?

440
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,200
The spirit of barbecue is the taste.

441
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,400
Understand?

442
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,700
- If I don't understand it, perhaps you do?
- Don't you understand?

443
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,700
Boss, another bottle of Fanta, please!

444
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,000
Okay.

445
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,200
I'm sorry, Fanta is sold out.

446
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,800
How about a Sprite or a Coke?

447
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,600
That won't do!

448
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,500
My girlfriend only loves to drink Fanta.

449
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,600
What's wrong Taotao?

450
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,400
Did he piss you off again lately?

451
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,700
No.

452
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,500
He's quite nice to me now.

453
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,000
Cheer up.

454
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,200
I guessed right, didn't I?

455
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,400
Sure enough, they already began eating.

456
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,800
Here, Xiaoju. It's your favorite pig trotters.

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,800
Why are you so late?

458
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,300
I thought if the rich man didn't come,

459
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,500
we'll have to pay ourselves.

460
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,200
What are you grabbing?

461
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,000
It smells so delicious.

462
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Pig trotters.

463
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,700
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Right away.

464
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,800
- Here.
- Thanks.

465
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,900
You're welcome.

466
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,000
Delicious!

467
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,400
Come on.

468
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,100
Let's get down to business.

469
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,600
Taotao and Huang Jun, you are a team.

470
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Xiaoju and Shiyi, you are a team.

471
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,400
Everyone, go back and take a look at the important information that's inside.

472
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,800
It's best if you can memorize it.

473
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,600
Rest assured.

474
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,800
I'll be sure to memorize it thoroughly.

475
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,300
You should probably forget about it.

476
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,800
I'll be the main speaker tomorrow.

477
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,400
With your brain, you better save it to learn Advanced Mathematics instead.

478
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
You too.

479
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,000
I'll prepare for it tonight. You get some rest.

480
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,900
Okay.

481
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,700
I'll be relying on everyone tomorrow. Here.

482
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,400
I wish us all success!

483
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,300
Here's to success!

484
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,800

What's the matter?

494
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,000
It's just... look at them.

495
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,600
And them.

496
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,100
They're all so formally dressed.

497
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,000
Us dressed like this... Will it work?

498

There's no need to be nervous. Just do your best.

We took all of the medals.

507
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,700
I don't want these. These two are the same.

508
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,000
Amazing.

All right, that's enough.

Here, Shiyi.

Lin You, here's yours.

We each take half of it.

520
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,000
I've only made half of one out of three programs.

521
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,300
I can't take that much.

But the ideas are all yours.

523
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,800
Especially the music player, it was you who insisted on doing it.

524
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,900
Although it's not considered perfect right now,

525
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,100
the judges said the future market is huge.

526
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,300
It's all your credit.

527
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,000
What kind of credit is that?

528
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,600
Everyone, does Lin You have credits?

529
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,200
- She does!
- Of course, she does!

530
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,600
See? Take it.

531

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
I want to show you something.

539
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,600

- Grandma!
- Hey, Xiaoju.
- Grandma.

Shiyi.

545
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,000
What do you want to eat. This Big Sister will treat you!

546
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,400
Why are you suddenly treating me to food?

547
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,100
Because today I have money.

548
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,500
- And...
- And what?

549
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,400
To thank you for helping me during this summer vacation and for your selfless dedication.

550
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,900
I have nothing to offer but to buy you snacks.

551
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,600
So that's what it was.

552
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,200
Then I truly put in a lot of hard work this summer vacation.

553
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,500
Then I must eat enough to cover the efforts I put in.

554
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,800
I want that one, that one, this one, and this one. And everything in this row.

555
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,200
And I want everything from these two rows.

556
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,300
And... And these two. I want two of each kind.

557
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,300
And I also want this, Grandma.

558
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,600
I only have five hundred yuan.

559
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,300
I also have to buy things for my dad and Xia Jiashu.

560
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,800
I'm just joking.

561
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,800
Just pay for it.

562
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,900
- Goodbye, Grandma.
- Bye!

563
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,600
I'm not that stingy either! You...

564
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,800
If there's anything else that you want, get some more!

565
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'll pay you, Grandma.

566
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,600
Mom.

567
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,000
Mom, take a look at what I bought...

00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,700
Mom.

569
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,600
Mom.

570
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,400
As your mom, I don't want to say anything else.

571
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,000
I just want to tell you.

572
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,700
Look at your second aunt's daughter who studied accounting.

573
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,500
She's now sitting in an office all day.

574
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,200
She even found a manager in a company to be her husband.

575
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,500
How nourishing her life is!

576
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,800
And that classmate of yours—

577
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,200
Mom, I can also raise examples.

578
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Our Jiangzhou University's Tourism Department

579
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,300
had a senior who opened a travel agency a few years ago.

580
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,500
She also made her fortune.

581
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,000
How can a travel agency make a fortune?

582
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,500
Sure it can.

583
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,800
People's standard of living is becoming higher and higher.

584
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,000
More and more people like to travel.

585
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,200
Travel agencies would be more and more profitable.

586
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,000
That's not the kind of money you can make.

587
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
With your melon brain, yet you want to open a travel agency?
<i>(T/N: Brainless)</i>

588
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Just stay in the accounting major.

589
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,800
Find a good job and marry a good husband in the future.

590
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,600
That way, I'll be at ease as your mom!

591
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,400
What's so good about studying to be a tour guide? It's so tiring!

592
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,500
It's not suitable for you.

593
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,700
Listen to me and study accounting.

594
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,400
Mom, I really found the major that I would like to study this time.

595
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,600
I will persevere in it. Not only that, but I'll definitely be successful.

596
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,500
No way.

597
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,200
You have to listen to me.

598
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,500
Who pays for your tuition? It's your parents!

599
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,200
The tourist management major costs too much.

600
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,400
I can't afford it.

601
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,200
You can only study accounting now.

602
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
It's just two thousand more.

603
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,800
How are you not able to afford it?

604
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
You're just overbearing!

605
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You just want us to follow your order.

606
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,400
You never listen to our aspirations.

607
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
"Just two thousand?"

608
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,500
Do you know how hard it is to earn two thousand?

609
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,200
Of course, you wouldn't know.

610
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,600
If you knew, then you wouldn't lie to me.

611
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,000
Saying that you stayed at Qiu Le Tao's house.

612
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,600
In the end, you sneaked out to play.

613
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,200
You even bought so many snacks.

614
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,000
You only know how to spend money.

615
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,300
When I went out last time, I only spent fifty yuan.

616
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,500
And I bought these with the money I earned by myself.

617
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,000
They have nothing to do with you.

618
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,800
You have no idea how much effort I put in just for changing my major.

619
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,400
All you care about is what you think.

620
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,800
You don't care about whether I'm happy or not!

621
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,200
You...

622
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,400
You're going to piss me off.

623
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,800
Mom, I think Elder Sister is serious about it this time.

624
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,000
She studied until midnight a few days ago.

625
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,600
Mom, where are you going?

626
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,400
Stay at home and keep watch over your sister.

627
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,200
Don't go anywhere.
