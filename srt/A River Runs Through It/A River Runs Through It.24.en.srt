There's still one more lap. She's right there.

24

<i>What do you want to prove?</i>

25
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:46,499
<i>Didn't you decide to give up?</i>

29
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,439
<i>You just can't accept it, right?</i>

30
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,569
<i>But what else can I do besides not accepting it?</i>

31
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,770
- Xiaoju! Are you okay?
- Did she fall?

32
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,740
- How did you fall?
- Is she all right?

33
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:12,787
- How do you feel?
- How are you?

34
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:14,466
Don't touch her!

35
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:15,465
Does it hurt?

36
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,776
How can't it hurt? She's crying!

37
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:18,243
- Is your arm fine?
- Don't do that!

38
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:20,087
Did you hurt your knees?

39
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,354
Are you all right?

40
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,922
Try standing up.

41
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,040
Slowly.

42
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,220
Slowly. Are you alright?

43
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,932
- No...
- Does it hurt?

44
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,054
Huang Chan, where is the school doctor?

45
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:33,443
School doctor? Over there!

46
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:37,354
Doctor!

47
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,688
I'll take her to the infirmary.

48
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:40,710
Okay. I'll go with you.

49
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:42,480
Cheng Lang! You can't leave!

50
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,660
The race isn't over yet!

51
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,479
- Shiyi! Take care of her!
- Shiyi is with her!

52
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,676
We'll go to find you at the infirmary when the race is over!

53
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:53,965
Focus on the race! I'll stay with her.

54
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,465
- What are you doing?
- Shiyi can look after her.

55
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:57,399
Xiaoju is injured! Xiaoju...

56
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,732
I need to tell you something!

57
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,421
What's the matter? Wait...

58
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:02,580
I need to tell you something!

59
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,500
Endure it for a bit. We're almost there.

60
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,210
Doctor!

61
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,900
Doctor!

62
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,860
Does it hurt?

63
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,860
Doctor!

64
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:28,700
Xiaoju, don't cry. I'll go to find a doctor.

65
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,160
Doctor!

66
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,680
Doctor!

67
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,620
Doctor!

68
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,700
A student has been hurt! Can someone come and take a look?

69
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,077
No one is here.

70
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:55,900
They probably all went to the sports field to be on standby.

71
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,740
Does it really hurt?

72
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,610
Are you still saying it doesn't hurt?

73
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,880
If it doesn't, why do you keep crying?

74
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,540
I thought what happened was so embarrassing.

75
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,930
Isn't it because you like Cheng Lang, but he likes Lin You?

76
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,060
Do you have to be so upset?

77
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,277
I... I know all of it now.

78
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:34,487
That's not embarrassing.

79
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:37,340
Who doesn't do something stupid when they're young?

80
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,919
But you don't have to worry.

81
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,660
I won't tell anybody about it.

82
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,260
But I think how you are right now is very embarrassing.

83
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,100
I also think that I am quite embarrassing.

84
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,487
I really want a mirror so you can look at right now.

85
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:04,332
Don't you know how ugly you are when you're crying?

86
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,269
Oh god, you're so ugly.

87
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,069
What guy will like how you are right now?

88
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,100
Don't cry, okay?

89
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,669
Okay, don't cry.

90
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,310
No matter how ugly and embarrassed you're,

91
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,269
I won't dislike you.

92
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,349
Besides, dating is not the only part of life.

93
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,660
From now on, you should come along with me to do serious things.

94
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,099
Look at me.

95
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,260
I don't have someone I like, so I won't be trouble like you.

96
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,980
So it's a promise?

97
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,000
Pinkie promise.

98
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,940
Thank you, Datu.

99
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,520
I'll find something to help bandage your leg with.

100
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:11,921
Don't cry.

101
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:14,900
You're so ugly when you cry! Don't cry anymore!

102
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,999
What do you want to tell me?

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,859
Why do you drag me all the way to the practice room?

104
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,619
The race is almost over. Let's think about where we should go together.

105
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,300
I'm not in the mood to go out. I need to go see Xiaoju!

106
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,009
Shiyi is with Xiaoju.

107
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,399
She just fell. It's nothing big.

108
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,109
You don't understand.

109
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,209
I know!

110
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:41,821
- Was it because Xiaoju lost to Lin You?
- You...

111
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,589
Don't worry.

112
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,054
Only Shiyi and I know about the complex relationship

113
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:48,519
between Xiaoju, Cheng Lang, and Lin You. No one else knows.

114
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,259
Let's go and hang out!

115
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,759
You can go first. I'll go in later.

116
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,909
Let's go together!

117
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,911
No. I have to think over it. Go in first.

118
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,580
I'm leaving then?

119
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,880
I'm here!

120
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,954
Why did you come just now?

121
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,310
They bullied me. Come and help me.

122
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:09,580
Did you bully her?

123
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,866
Make your choice!

124
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:14,320
Three.

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,079
Six.

126
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,349
- Come on!
- Eight.

127
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,980
Ten.

128
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,700
Do you dislike me?

129
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,187
Don't worry.

130
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:35,199
I don't like you, either.

131
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,340
If so, then stay away from us.

132
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,109
Qiu Le Tao.

133
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,254
Just because you are his girlfriend doesn't mean you can interfere with him making friends.

134
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:46,809
I don't want to interfere with him making friends.

135
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:49,640
But if I wanted to,

136
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,469
you couldn't stop me.

137
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,149
Don't think so highly of yourself.

138
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,340
Do you really think that because you won't agree Huang Jun won't go to the concert with me?

139
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,060
Has he told you we went to see the movie 'Loved Letter' together?

140
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,140
He already rejected you, yet you still have the face to mention it?

141
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,940
Rejected me?

142
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,900
Was that what he told you?

143
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,500
"An innocent girl like you is more suited to watch the movie Loved Letters."

144
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:21,460
Huang Jun said that to me.

145
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,140
<i>Eight.</i>

146
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:32,800
<i>Ten.</i>

147
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:35,699
<i>Two.</i>

148
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:37,220
<i>Pass.</i>

149
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,920
- Double two!
- Fourfold seven! You want that?

150
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,340
<i>- Double five.
- Double six.</i>

151
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,621
<i>Double two.</i>

152
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,200
<i>Pass.</i>

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,354
I'm preparing to give you a final blow.

154
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,279
Go ahead! Can you?

155
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,019
If not? Then I...

156
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,920
- We're over!
- Oh my.

157
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,560
What are you doing?

158
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,640
I want to break up with you.

159
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:09,420
What... What did I do?

160
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,554
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

161
00:12:12,554 --> 00:12:14,021
Pull me up slowly.

162
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:15,620
Slowly...

163
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,733
- Endure it for a bit.
- Be gentle.

164
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,320
Keep it away from the water for a couple days.

165
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,776
Shiyi! Xiaoju.

166
00:12:37,777 --> 00:12:40,655
Xiaoju, are you all right?

167
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:42,520
What did the doctor say?

168
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,020
The skin was a bit torn. I'm fine.

169
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,399
Lin You, how did you do?

170
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,776
I came in second.

171
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:55,999
I didn't think you could get a prize for running.

172
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,540
If you hadn't fallen down, you definitely would've gotten first.

173
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,040
Congratulations.

174
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,143
Shiyi, did you bind up Xiaoju's wound just now?

175
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:11,909
Yes.

176
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,240
You didn't faint at the sight of blood now!

177
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,879
That's right!

178
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,054
I didn't have any reaction, right?

179
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:23,199
You don't need to change your major now. That's great!

180
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,500
I thought I would have to suspend my education next semester.

181
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,065
Now, I've made up my mind.

182
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:31,339
I'll tell the professor that I won't change majors.

183
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:34,443
I'll overcome my fear of blood even if I have to suspend my education for a year.

184
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:36,640
Because I have someone who supports me.

185
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,709
So Xiaoju gets all the credit? Did I do nothing?

186
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,865
Come on! You all have helped me, all right?

187
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,909
Hurry and go back. I can stay with Xia Xiaoju.

188
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:51,976
When the doctor comes back and sees so many people here, he would get angry.

189
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:53,709
- All right. Xiaoju, we'll get going then.
- Bye!

190
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,643
We're off, Xiaoju.

191
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:57,460
Bye.

192
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,549
Xiaoju.

193
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,520
Do you remember what I told you before the race?

194
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,221
<i>You're just you.</i>

195
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,600
<i>You don't need to prove anything.</i>

196
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,176
- I didn't want to prove anything.
- Nonsense.

197
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:30,229
Was the promise we made all for nothing?

198
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,280
Didn't you join the 400 meter race to prove you weren't inferior to Lin You?

199
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,240
For me, you are not inferior to anyone.

200
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,789
How do you feel after running?

201
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,840
Do you feel better?

202
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,879
So you do know the true reason why I joined the Sports Meet.

203
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,180
Cheng Lang, thank you for always encouraging me.

204
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,880
From now on, I'm going to be a completely new Lin You.

205
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,519
I'm sure you can do it.

206
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,109
- Do you have that much faith in me?
- Of course.

207
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,759
Because I know you are like me.

208
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,840
Once we put our minds on something, we won't turn back.

209
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
You really speak highly of me.

210
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:20,300
Why do I still feel like I haven't vented enough?

211
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,865
If so, I'll accompany you so you can vent till you're happy.

212
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:27,419
What about that?

213
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:30,332
- Is that what you said?
- Yes.

214
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,399
Then let's... run to the canteen to go eat.

215
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,229
I'll run first and then you run.

216
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,879
Let's see who'll be the first there.

217
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,909
No problem. I'll listen to you.

218
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,539
When I count to three, you can start to run.

219
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:47,900
Three, two, one. Run!

220
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,420
I'm coming!

221
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,380
Step on this.

222
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,866
Don't try to tiptoe.

223
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:29,620
Don't move.

224
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,609
Step aside.

225
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,840
Help me hold this.

226
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,120
Be careful not to hurt your hand.

227
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,710
<i>[August 1, 1999- 139 cm]</i>

228
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:49,260
You've grown five centimeters in a year.

229

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,640
<i>with many kinds of trees.</i>

234
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:11,319
Don't block the TV.

235
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,539
- Get out of the way.
- Sister.

236
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:17,400
Turns out you can also fail an exam in college?

237
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,499
I heard from our parents that once you get into college it'll get easier.

238
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:23,260
So you still have to take exams in college.

239
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,369
Xia Jiashu. Are you looking for a beating?

240
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,821
Anyway, Mom is not home. Be careful that I might hit you.

241
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:32,632
I didn't know. Can't I ask?

242
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:34,280
Step aside.

243

<i>[Best wishes as happiness comes to the door. Many fortunes to come your way. Smooth sailing for luckiness' arrival]</i>

244
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,999
Brother Shiyi, are you looking for my sister?

245
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,210
Yes. She has been staying at home since the break started.

246
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,643
I came to see her. She's about to get moldy.

247
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:49,369
<i>She's almost moldy.</i>

248
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,600
<i>- I'm going to play football.
- Go on.</i>

249
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,579
Come with me. I'll treat you to barbecue.

250
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:09,700
I'm not going. I don't want to eat.

251
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,979
You just failed an accelerated math class.

252
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:16,232
I'll help tutor you to pass the make-up exam next semester.

253
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:17,820
Don't touch me.

254
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,620

<i>this was done in order to make it more convenient.</i>

258
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,460
It seems like you are not sad because you failed the course?

259
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,429
I feel annoyed.

260
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,579
Each of you got a scholarship. Only I failed a course.

261
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:52,499
Besides, you all have your dreams.

262
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,954
You want to learn medicine and Cheng Lang wants to study computers.

263
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:58,899
Only I... I don't like my major at all.

264
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:01,140
Then what do you like?

265
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,680
I don't know.

266
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,629
Let's go. Stop thinking about it.

267
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,821
You could think about it for a hundred years at home and still not figure it out.

268
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:14,460
Let's go!

269
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:16,943
Here are the napkins.

270
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:19,140
- Thank you, Boss.
- You're welcome.

271
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:26,943
Xia Xiaoju.

272
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:30,543
Since you dislike accounting so much, have you thought of changing your major?

273
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:32,410
Change my major?

274
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,880
Every year our school has a few spots for students to change their major.

275
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,499
It'd be good if I could change.

276
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:41,939
But I don't know which major I should change into.

277
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,820
I don't even know what I like.

278
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,354
Which major can you change into?

279
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,480
Let me think about it.

280
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,310
Xiaoju. Shiyi. Are we still friends?

281
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,330
If you were eating barbecue, why didn't you call me?

282
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,340
Am I still in your heart?

283
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,676
I'm afraid I would become poor from you eating too much.

284
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:03,700
Why are you so stingy?

285
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,754
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

286
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:09,632
Go to order yourself. Go!

287
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:11,360
All right.

288
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,369
Boss, can I have 20 kehabs?

289
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:17,143
Okay. I have some baked here, let me warm some up for you.

290
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:18,630
Eat it.

291
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,320
All right.

292
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:27,900
It's on me today.

293
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,854
By the way, are you free on the 25th of next month?

294
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:45,454
I want to ask if you can help me with a favor.

295
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,830
25th of next month?

296
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,649
There's a programming competition,

297
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,532
and I want to attend the competition with a couple of plans.

298
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,929
Could you help submit them for me?

299
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,887
Don't worry. You just need to attend the match, and I'll prepare for the rest.

300
00:20:57,888 --> 00:20:59,843
I'll tell you the details later.

301
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:04,460
Shiyi, I might need to go to your house and use your computer.

302
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,799
No wonder you are treating us,

303
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,779
turns out you needed our help.

304
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,580
Well...

305
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,200
How are you going to thank us?

306
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:16,120
How do you want me to thank you?

307
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:19,709
We've stayed at home for the whole vacation.

308
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,429
Why don't... you treat us to a trip?

309
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,620
Okay. Where do you want to go?

310
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,720
Xiaoju, where do you want to go?

311
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,432
In this weather, we can go to the summer resort in Lu Mountain.

312
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:40,399
Lu Mountain has a short summer and a long winter.

313
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,739
If it's 35 degrees in Jiangzhou,

314
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:44,599
it should be about 20 degrees in Lushan.

315
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,649
Or we can go boating on Qiandao Lake.

316
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:49,009
The temperature there is also lower than Jiangzhou's.

317
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,510
We can camp and drift there.

318
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:52,239
It's a good place for everyone to travel to.

319
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,709
How about we go to Kunming?

320
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,832
It's like spring all year round in Kunming, and the scenery there is very nice.

321
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:59,349
But it's on a plateau and has strong ultraviolet radiation.

322
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,687
If we want to go there, we have to prepare sunscreen.

323
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,265
Xia Xiaoju.

324
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:06,709
With how dumb you are, how come you remember all of this so clearly?

325
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,221
Get out.

326
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:10,219
It seems there are so many places we can go.

327
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,354
I'm afraid we'll need to head back to the university shortly after the competition.

328
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:14,769
We can only do a short trip.

329
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,740
How about this? Xiaoju, you could make us a guide.

330
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,465
Are you kidding? That competition hasn't even started yet.

331
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:25,880
Let's decide when it's over. Let's eat.

332
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,200
All right then.

333
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,280
Your kebabs are ready.

334
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,459
Thank you, Boss Cheng.

335
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,476
I will thank you guys in advance.

336
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:37,420
No need to be polite.

337
00:22:48,877 --> 00:22:50,979
I'll get going then.

338
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:52,699
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

339
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:54,420
I'm off.

340
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:58,540
Well, I'll also get going then.

341
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:06,540
Xia Xiaoju.

342
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,009
What?

343
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:13,399
I think you can change to major in tourism management.

344
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,587
What for?

345
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:17,299
You could be a tour guide, open a travel agency,

346
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:20,821
and plan travel routes. I think you are quite good at that.

347
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:22,319
Also, you really like it.

348
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,139
Weren't you watching travel programs when I came to your house?

349
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:30,089
Do you remember our high school graduation trip?

350
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:33,420
You planned everything and it was really fun for everyone.

351
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,729
You're right. I can change into tourism management.

352
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,849
I thought about it, too. I really love traveling.

353
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:41,329
I've never thought to be a tour guide!

354
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:44,209
If-If I become a tour guide, does that mean I can travel to many places?

355
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:46,540
Calm down first.

356
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,939
Think about whether you really like it or not.

357
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:51,600
If you decide to change your major,

358
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,489
then we'll talk to our professor about the requirements for the major.

359
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:58,820
Will you come with me when I make up my mind?

360
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,720
No problem.

361
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:03,740
I'm off.

362
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:08,360
- Granny.
- Xiaoju.

363
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:11,480
Yes, try to keep it flat.

364
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,420
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Old Xia.

365
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,190
Why is your salary so low this month?

366
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,900
Old Chen hasn't fully recovered yet,

367
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,570
so I gave him another thousand yuan.

368
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:29,919
<i>Then with all the other expenses,</i>

369
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,187
<i>only this much is left.</i>

370
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:34,043
School is starting soon.

371
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:35,643
We'll have to pay the school fees for our children.

372
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:37,432
How is this much money enough?

373
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:38,876
Don't worry.

374
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:42,189
The project I have on hand is almost finished.

375
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,010
Later when the accounts are settled, it will definitely be enough.

376
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,887
<i>I won't keep talking. I've to get to work.</i>

377
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:48,176
All right.

378
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:50,449
Take care of yourself.

379
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:54,100
All of us are relying on you.

380
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,540
Okay, that's all then.

381
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:04,700
Mom.

382
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,643
I want to tell you something.

383
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:11,039
What's it?

384
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,899
After much deliberation, I finally know what my interest is.

385
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:17,529
I want to learn tourism management.

386
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,619
Then I can travel all over the country when I become a tour guide.

387
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,865
I don't want to learn accounting.

388
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:24,639
Why do you want to change your major all of the sudden?

389
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,429
Are you making excuses for not being able to learn accounting well?

390
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,421
No. I really like tourism management.

391
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:32,954
And I really want to become a tour guide.

392
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:34,829
Is being a tour guide good?

393
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,469
Staying outside to be weathered all day?

394
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,776
As a girl, could you endure that?

395
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:41,332
Being an accountant is nice.

396
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:45,879
You can stay in the office with aircon. The pay is also really high.

397
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,579
What're you thinking?

398
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,939
I really don't like accounting.

399
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:51,976
You dislike it so you aren't going to learn it anymore?

400
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:54,539
I don't like housework,

401
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:57,009
but I still have to do it every day.

402
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:59,249
Fine. I don't want to keep talking about this anymore.

403
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:02,709
If you have this much energy, you should first improve your grades.

404
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,440
Well, really!

405
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:17,780
- Lin You.
- Cheng Lang?

406
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,310
Why do you come to the university when we are on break?

407
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,880
I wanted to ask if you could do me a favor.

408
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,109
Tell me. I'll definitely help if I can.

409
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,887
You can definitely do this favor.

410
00:26:26,888 --> 00:26:29,609
Jiangcheng Technology is holding a programming competition.

411
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:32,865
I saw how much reward money there is, so I want to give it a try.

412
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:35,332
But there's a requirement that says the competition must be done in groups.

413
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,589
At least two people per group.

414
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,343
So I wanted to ask if you could join me.

415
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:41,521
No problem.

416
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:43,289
Really?

417
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:46,543
Then let's go to the computer room to discuss what programs we should design.

418
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:49,599
Okay, but I have to change my clothes first.

419
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,287
I also have to call my mom to tell her I'll be home later.

420
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,180
Okay. I'll wait for you.

421
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,180
You have worked hard today, Lin You.

422
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,576
You had to come work on the programs with me right after your dance practice.

423
00:27:09,576 --> 00:27:11,400
It's nothing.

424
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,900
He's gone.

425
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,960
Follow me. Be careful.

426
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,039
I forgot that the computer room isn't available during the break.

427
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,420
We should go to an internet cafe instead.

428
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,559
How could we go there? The environment there is not good.

429
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,500
As you're a girl, it's better to be here.

430
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,300
But we can't get in.

431
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,279
Why do you have the computer room... key?

432
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,510
I saw the key lying on the table one day, so I secretly made a copy.

433
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,799
That way I could use the Internet during summer break for free.

434
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,200
Should you be doing this?

435
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,340
Don't tell anybody else.

436
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:16,820
This way, please.

437
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:24,259
Don't turn on the light.

438
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:26,569
We'll be done for if we get caught.

439
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:30,240
- You're right.
- Let's be quiet.

440
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,480
Look.

441
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,849
Why are you so well prepared?

442
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,700
We might stay here for a long time.

443
00:28:50,244 --> 00:28:52,220
Drink this one first.

444
00:28:58,511 --> 00:29:00,840
Cheng Lang?

445
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,600
- Why didn't you turn on the light?
- I forgot.

446
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,810
Remember to turn off the main switch when you leave.

447
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,800
Okay, I see.

448
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,840
He has left.

449
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:22,029
Did he know we're here a long time ago?

450
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,500
Yes.

451
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,699
I was just kidding.

452
00:29:25,699 --> 00:29:27,454
I always came here last semester.

453
00:29:27,454 --> 00:29:29,919
The professors here know me very well.

454
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,243
They gave me the key.

455
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:33,460
We can come here as we want later on.

456
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,740
What? You actually lied to me?

457
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,432
You scared me.

458
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:40,754
Well, I'll apologize to you.

459
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:44,580
Here. Take this as compensation.

460
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,021
These are all mine today.

461
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:52,080
A liar doesn't deserve to eat.

462
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:03,821
Did you know that

463
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:07,129
you have to score above 80 in the make-up exam?

464
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:09,810
After, you have to hand in an essay to a professor in the major.

465
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,654
After that, there's an interview.

466
00:30:11,654 --> 00:30:14,160
Most importantly, my parents don't approve.

467
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:18,020
I really think I will have to go on A Journey to the West.
<i>(T/N: A journey with numerous difficulties.)</i>

468
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,969
How so?

469
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:23,969
Our university's requirements for changing majors are already quite lenient.

470
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:28,043
As long as you can pass the exam and write a short essay,

471
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:29,799
you won't have any problem changing your major.

472
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,443
As for your parents, you should try discussing it with them again.

473
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:34,799
You are making me bald.

474
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,621
<i>- Shiyi! Xiaoju!</i>
- My mom is too stubborn. Forget it.

475
00:30:38,622 --> 00:30:40,643
Are you taking a walk?

476
00:30:40,644 --> 00:30:42,054
Why are you here?

477
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:45,010
I asked Lin You to attend the programming competition with me.

478
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,143
Why are you guys here?

479
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:48,943
We're here to ask about changing majors.

480
00:30:48,943 --> 00:30:50,787
Change majors?

481
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:52,132
Do you still have hemophobia?

482
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,688
It's not me. Xia Xiaoju wants to change majors.

483
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:56,154
She wants to learn tourism management.

484
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,999
I came here to ask about the requirements.

485
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,632
We're heading back right now.

486
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:01,321
Xiaoju, you want to change majors?

487
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:05,054
Yes. I've just made the decision today.

488
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:06,976
Why don't we walk and talk?

489
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:08,510
All right. We can head back together.

490
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,940
Let's go.

491
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,480
You're making me bald.

492
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,500
The bus is coming. Hurry!

493
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,800
There are too many people. Why don't we wait for the next bus?

494
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,100
Why wait? Let's go. I'm starving.

495
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,800
Don't push!

496
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,000
Slow down! It's fine. Get in one by one.

497
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,500
Don't push! Be careful!

498
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Walk slowly. Be careful.

499
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,100
I didn't think the bus would be so crowded at seven.

500
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,400
We should go back earlier tomorrow.

501
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,800
You're the team leader so you can decide.

502
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,200
What are you looking at?

503
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,900
Nothing.

504
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,200
Do you need to reply?

505
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,400
No need.

506
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,200
It's all the romantic stuff Huang Jun has been texting to Taotao.

507
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,600
Taotao turned off her phone, so he can't contact her.

508
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,300
That's why he keeps sending messages to me.

509
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,900
Huang Jun, that brat.

510
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
He told me before the vacation that

511
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,500
Taotao will crazily go looking for him

512
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,400
when he went back to his hometown.

513
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,300
Look at how anxious he is now.

514
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,800
He deserves it.

515
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,200
It's because he invited that girl to watch a movie together,

516
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,000
but he also lied to Taotao.

517
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,200
To think that Taotao trusted him that much.

518
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,000
Even if Xu Menglu leaves the band, nothing can change.

519
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
How is Taotao?

520
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
She looks fine when she's with me.

521
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,200
But she really likes Huang Jun,

522
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,600
she must feel horrible.

523
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,000
What about you?

524
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,200
It's nothing.

525
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,200
- I'll get going then.
- Let me accompany you.

526
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,800
You don't have to. I'm used to walking down this street.

527
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,500
Let me accompany you home.

528
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,100
If I don't safely accompany you home, I will stay up all night worried.

529
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,500
Lin You! How about I accompany you home?

530
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,700
Don't you want to change majors?

531
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,400
You have to study math tonight.

532
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,600
Of course, I want to change.

533
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,500
All right. Let's go back to study then.

534
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,500
Lin You. Cheng Lang. Take care.

535
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,000
- All right. We'll get going then.
- Bye.

536
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,600
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

537
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,600
Shall I wake you up tomorrow morning?

538
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,100
Let's go. Don't keep looking.

539
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,800
Cheng Lang likes Lin You.

540
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Lin You also has a good opinion of Cheng Lang.

541
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,100
Why do you interfere between them and make yourself unhappy?

542
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,500
I can't stop myself.

543
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,800
Every time I see Chen Lang, I can't help, but want to treat him nicely.

544
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,200
When I see them together,

545
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,700
I can't help but be envious and compete with her.

546
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,200
What if... What if he likes me one day?

547
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
It's better for you to give up on that idea.

548
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,100
It's impossible. He just treats you as his friend.

549
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,400
Nothing else could happen.

550
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,400
So you should spend less time with Cheng Lang.

551
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,600
You should come and study math with me.

552
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,100
Let's go.

553
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,200
- I'm home.
- Hurry and go.

554
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Well... See you tomorrow.

555
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,000
See you.

556
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,200
You'd better go back early too. Take care.

557
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Hurry and head up.

558
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,200
<i>[Jiangzhou, two-day travel plan.]</i>

559
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,800
Sister, what are you doing so seriously?

560
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,600
None of your business.

561
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,300
Do you have a guy you like?

562
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Did Lu Shiyi tell you something?

563
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,800
- Brother Shiyi?
- Right.

564
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,200
He didn't tell me anything.

565
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,600
Does he know a secret of yours?

566
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,200
Don't talk nonsense.

567
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,800
How can I have a secret?

568
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,700
Get out, brat!

569
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,400
Hurry! Hurry!

570
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,200
Get out! If you won't, I will hit you.

571
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,500
Did Lu Shiyi tell anyone my secret?

572
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,800
No, I have to look for him.

573
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,000
- Stop knocking!
- Open the door!

574
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,600
- Who is it?
- It's me! Hurry up!

575
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,200
Why are you so diligent today?

576
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,600
It's so early that I thought it was the milkman.

577
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Early? It's already 10 o'clock.

578
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,000
Are your parents out?

579
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,500
Yes. Are you here looking for them?

580
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,400
No. I want to ask you something.

581
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,200
Have you told Cheng Lang that matter?

582
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
What matter?

583
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,100
