If you have such good taste, then you do it.

What shape do you think Lin You will like?

174

If you want to confess, then the heart shape.

Okay, let's make a heart.

176

I have to thank Xiaoju for introducing Lin You to me.

181

If she hadn't stained Lin You's clothes,

182

I wouldn't know her.

How could I?

185
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,809
What does my matchmaker want to eat tonight?

186
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,009
It's my treat.

187

Just so-so.

193
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,419
I think it looks very fresh. It's way better than Shiyi's.

Luckily I had your help today,

195
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,550
or our decorations would be too tacky, right?

196

You mean I shouldn't have come.

197

No, you should.

Of course, you should,

- What kind of phone do you want to buy?
- A flip phone.

I asked him about the Y2K bug for you.

Cheng Lang said it's a program bug

226
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:45,280
in the processing of the date shown on a computer.

It's the first time Da Huang's band is attending a New Year's Party.

He doesn't even pay attention in class.

Do you think he will seriously read your notes?

He failed the make-up exam.

246

If he fails a few more exams, he'll have to repeat a grade.

247

He knows it, too, so he'll focus on studying,

248
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:49,059
but recently he's too tired.

249

That's why he slept in class and didn't pay attention.

He wants to enjoy fireworks tomorrow on the mountain top,

The most important thing for me is to accompany you.

328
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,579
Hurry and go rehearse. I'll have a good sleep after the IV infusion.

329
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:27,429
I still have to watch your performance tonight.

330
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:29,429
Don't force yourself.

331
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:31,330
What about this?

332
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,519
Get some rest.

333
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,200
After the IV infusion is done and you're fully recovered,

334
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,389
I'll sing solo for you, okay?

335
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:41,949
Okay? One more bite, here.

336
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,979
Put it here. I can eat on my own.

337
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,220
I'll put it here then.

338
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,520
I'm off then.

339
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,639
Hurry and go.

340
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:59,100
Hurry and go.

341
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,750
I'm off.

342
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,620
You scared me!

343
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,759
Even the school is on break for the New Year,

344
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,279
yet you don't take a break?

345
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:57,829
Didn't you envy Jiaotong University for having their website before?

346
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:00,639
These days I've been building

347
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,819
our own university forum.

348
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,059
It's almost done.

349
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,060
So amazing!

350
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,990
By the way,

351
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,910
guess what I bought.

352
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,720
A new CD.

353
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,679
Joe Hisaishi's new album issued in China.

354
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,349
Symphonies included are all live concert versions.

355
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,380
That amazing?

356
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,079
- What do you think? Right, close your eyes.
- It sounds nice!

357
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,309
When you close your eyes,

358
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:35,340
you'll feel you're at the concert.

359
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,870
Wait, listen with both ears.

360
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,470
Okay.

361
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,660
Don't you feel it's... very...

362
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,630
Excuse me, could you please tell me where the bathroom is?

363
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,040
You'll see it if you keep walking straight down the corridor.

364
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,520
Thank you.

365
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,979
I heard there are many handsome juniors at the New Year's Party.

366
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,939
Can we eat first before going to the party?

367
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:36,629
Okay.

368
00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:39,349
Shall we visit Le Tao first?

369
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:41,129
Is the IV infusion done?

370
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,369
There's no need. Huang Jun's by her side.

371
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:45,650
Is Le Tao ill?

372
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,420
Yes, because of Huang Jun, she had a fever.

373
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:50,279
Don't worry.

374
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,179
Huang Jun will take her here.

375
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:56,330
Huang Jun, that rascal, every day he...

376
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,480
Xia Xiaoju!

377
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,740
Chang Le!

378
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,919
Xiaoju, if I guessed right,

379
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,029
you're going to the New Year's Party.

380
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:15,699
- Yes.
- Can we go together?

381
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:17,830
Okay, let's go.

382
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,879
Are they your friends?

383
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:24,919
That's right, let me introduce him.

384
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,929
He's our class monitor and a top student.

385
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:28,919
Our whole class admires him.

386
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,340
It's not that exaggerated.

387
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,150
Hello, I'm Chang Le, Xiaoju's classmate.

388
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,929
Hello, I'm Gui Xiaoling.

389
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:37,309
Hello, I'm Huang Chan.

390
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,910
Hello.

391
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,570
He's my good friend Lu Shiyi.

392
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,259
Do you have any other plans after the party?

393
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,849
She's coming with me to a party in my hometown.

394
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:56,759
Yes, I almost forgot if you didn't mention it.

395
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:58,369
Xia Xiaoju promised

396
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,009
to watch fireworks for the New Year on the mountaintop with us.

397
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,639
Yes. Tonight, to celebrate the millennium, Jiangzhou is setting off fireworks all over the city.

398
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,309
It'll be very pretty.

399
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:10,069
Watch fireworks on the mountaintop?

400
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,999
It sounds so amazing.

401
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:15,529
It's not crowded and has a nice view.

402
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:18,970
- Shall we go together?
- Inconvenient.

403
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,829
What's so inconvenient?

404
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:24,550
The mountaintop is so big, that there would be enough room for me.

405
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,200
What are you doing?

406
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,130
Have a good talk with him.

407
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,220
Don't always have him pester us.

408
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:39,699
Why do you say it so rudely?

409
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,019
He just wants to join us for some fun. What do you mean pester?

410
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:45,819
Tonight Cheng Lang is confessing to Lin You.

411
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:48,119
It's really inconvenient to have a stranger there.

412
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:50,200
Think about it.

413
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,210
Isn't it inconvenient?

414
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,799
- Okay, I'll tell him then.
- Hurry and go.

415
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,960
Chang Le, I'm sorry.

416
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,609
Our friends and I already agreed to do something tonight.

417
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:08,429
So it really is a bit inconvenient,

418
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:11,249
but there're many places where you can enjoy fireworks on the mountaintop.

419
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:13,209
It's okay. You can go on with your things.

420
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:16,359
I can go alone if I want.

421
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,770
Okay, take care of yourself.

422
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,159
Don't worry.

423
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,280
Le Tao?

424
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,950
Taotao!

425
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,960
Why is she alone?

426
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,440
Taotao!

427
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,180
Taotao.

428
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,689
- What's wrong, Taotao?
- Le Tao, are you okay?

429
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:42,750
I'm fine.

430
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,700
Where's Huang Jun? Isn't he with you?

431
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,709
I'm fine.

432
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:51,019
Did he make you angry? Why are you crying?

433
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,629
- Don't cry, Le Tao.
- Taotao.

434
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:59,619
- Don't cry, Taotao.
- Taotao.

435
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:01,369
What exactly happened? There's no use for crying.

436
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:03,279
Can it solve anything?

437
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,039
If it's really Huang Jun's fault,

438
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,010
I'll go throw his motorcycle down right now.

439
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,279
What happened? Tell us.

440
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,530
In the hospital,

441
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,240
I saw...

442
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,750
<i>Can you stay with me?</i>

443
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,570
<i>I can perform as soon as the IV infusion is done.</i>

444
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,529
Bastard!

445
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,709
No wonder why he was acting strange at the hospital.

446
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,779
He clearly didn't answer my calls,

447
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:49,220
why would he have come to the hospital so quickly?

448
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,159
So he was going to see that girl.

449
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,590
Is he still in the hospital?

450
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,390
He left.

451
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,999
He must be in the Art Building. Let's go, you two follow me.

452
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:01,859
- Let's see what he has to say.
- Don't go.

453
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:04,010
Let him perform first.

454
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,349
Why are you still protecting him?

455
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,420
I'm not protecting him,

456
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:19,340
I just don't want things to end badly.

457
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,990
It's better for us to have an amicable parting.

458
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,190
I've decided to break up with him.

459
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,679
It's okay.

460
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,099
We support whatever decision you make.

461
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,520
It's better to part with such scum earlier than later.

462
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,879
Besides, it's not like Taotao doesn't have people who want to pursue her, right?

463
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,720
You'll meet a man ten thousand times better than him.

464
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,759
Don't cry.

465
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,500
Let's go back.

466
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,000
- I'll go back to the dorm.
- We'll go, too.

467
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,529
Seeing Huang Jun and Xu Menglu on the stage makes me sick.

468
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:10,039
- I won't go to the party.
- Neither will I.

469
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,659
You seem very familiar with Xiaoju.

470
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,720
She's my student. What's up?

471
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,179
Have you known each other for long?

472
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,909
None of your business.

473
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,050
You don't have a really good attitude.

474
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,229
You guys go back first.

475
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,370
I will go give them a heads up.

476
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,200
What's wrong with Le Tao?

477
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,039
Chang Le, you should head back first.

478
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,529
I've to talk with Shiyi.

479
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:46,839
Go then.

480
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,520
I know.

481
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,850
Xiaoju, I'll wish you a Happy New Year in advance.

482
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:54,319
- See you next year.
- See you next year.

483
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,920
Bye.

484
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,179
When you head back tonight, you must give Huang Jun a beating.

485
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,319
How can he have a foot in both camps?

486
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,909
Qiu Le Tao treats him so well.

487
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,830
Doesn't he have a conscience?

488
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,150
Because of Xu Menglu again?

489
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,519
Who else can it be?

490
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,949
So shameless, why must she knowingly seduce Huang Jun if she knows he has a girlfriend?

491
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,519
If Qiu Le Tao didn't agree,

492
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,279
I'd expose their affair and true natures on the stage

493
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,149
while they're performing to the whole campus.

494
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,689
All right, don't be angry, I'll help you give him a lesson.

495
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:29,599
- Calm down.
- Xiaoju, Shiyi, did you see Lin You?

496
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,519
- Isn't she with you?
- No.

497
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,859
I can't contact her now.

498
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:36,799
Has she already gone to the Arts Building?

499
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,519
I've been there but I can't find her.

500
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,280
Her classmates also don't know where she is.

501
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,800
- Did you quarrel?
- Not at all.

502
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,359
Xiaoju, how about this? Could you help look for her?

503
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,059
Shiyi and I'll look for her as well. If you find her, then give me a call.

504
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,850
- Okay.
- Let's go.

505
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,279
Xiaoju, remember to call me!

506
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,780
- Bye.
- Okay.

507
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,459
- Xiaoju.
- Fanyi.

508
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:05,379
Is Lin You in her room?

509
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:06,769
No, what's wrong?

510
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:09,589
- Do you know where she is?
- She left pretty early.

511
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:13,260
She might be in the computer room with Cheng Lang.

512
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,149
- Okay, please call me if she comes back.
- I'll do so.

513
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:18,539
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

514
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:20,040
Bye.

515
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,610
Classmate, has Lin You been here?

516
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,610
No, I haven't seen her.

517
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,770
Thanks.

518
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,469
Hello?

519
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,599
<i>Hi, Auntie.</i>

520
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,559
Is Lin You home now?

521
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,119
She hasn't come back yet.

522
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,500
<i>Can I ask who you are?</i>

523
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,019
I'm her classmate.

524
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:45,970
If she's not there, then you can forget about it. Thank you, Auntie.

525
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,009
Hello, Datu, where are you now?

526
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:56,709
<i>I'm by the lake with Cheng Lang.</i>

527
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,319
Wait for me, I'll be right there.

528
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,560
