Happy new year!

What are you doing? Get up! Get up!

5
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,799
Everyone, hurry and take a look!

6
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,399
Xia Xiaoju's shoes are worn out.

7
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,119
How can there be such a barbaric girl?

8
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,039
Everyone, hurry and take a look!

9
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,020
Xia Xiaoju's shoes are worn out.

10
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:40,039
What are you doing?

11
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,249
Why are you so annoying?

12
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,279
How am I annoying?

13
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:43,609
- I'm just telling the truth.
- Let go of me!

14
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,399
Everyone, hurry and look! Xia Xiaoju's shoes are worn...

Shiyi! Baobao!

16

It's almost time for class. Hurry, let's go.

17
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,460
Let's go to the classroom. Quickly!

18
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,180
- Hurry up!
- I'm off to class.

19
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,540
You're wounded. It's not good if you stand for too long.

Hurry, let's go. The bell rung. Hurry up. Hurry up.

Xiaoju.

25
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:37,880
It's been a week since you came to our school.

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,750
Have you adapted to it?

27
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,620
I-I feel it's been all right.

28
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,290
Here's the thing.

29
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,590
Well, have you ever thought

30
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,960
of returning to your former school?

31
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,860
Mr. Zhang,

32
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,149
did I do something wrong?

33
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,960
No, no.

34
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,110
Don't be nervous.

35
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,879
I looked at your scores for the recent exams

36
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,550
and talked with your teachers for various subjects to understand your situation.

37
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,219
In all, your scores are not ideal.

38
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:19,269
You can feel that, right?

39
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:21,949
But I know you're hard-working.

40
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:23,699
If you were a sophomore right now,

41
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,670
I would have definitely encouraged you to work harder.

42
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,519
But you're a senior now.

43
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,649
I'm very afraid you can't catch up with our pace in reviewing.

44
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:37,549
Teachers also won't slow down their review pace just for you.

45
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:38,580
Look,

46
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,453
how about you go and discuss this with your parents?

47
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,580
It's best for you to return to your former school.

48
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,230
This may be better for your college entrance exam.

49
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,449
<i>The reason why I told you this is not to discourage you.</i>

50
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,190
<i>I just want to find a learning method better suited for you.</i>

51
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,490
<i>We all hope you can get a good score on the college entrance exam.</i>

53
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,729
How about giving me your shoes?

54
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,330
I'll see if I can repair it for you.

55
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,080
No need, but thanks.

56
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,569
Let me have a look.

57
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,449
These are the shoes I wear when I play basketball.

58
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,340
Wear these for now.

59
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,520
Thank you.

60
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,260
Can you even repair shoes?

61
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,250
I can't.

62
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,550
I just want to see if there's a way for you to wear this till you get home.

63
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,890
Why are you laughing?

64
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,020
Your shoe is so big.

65
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,940
It seems like a small boat when I wear it.

66
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,970
Are you mad at Shiyi?

67
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,970
Actually, Lu Shiyi is not a bad person.

68
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,890
He just has a naughty personality.

69
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,390
Even though he says really mean things,

70
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,919
he absolutely wouldn't do anything bad to you.

71
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,470
Don't worry.

72
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,009
It doesn't matter.

73
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,190
After all,

74
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,010
very soon, it wouldn't matter to me.

75
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,240
Xiaoju.

76
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,610
Why is there tape inside your shoe?

77
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,099
Tell me! Did you do this to my shoe?

78
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:18,140
Didn't I fix it all up for you?

79
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,640
Is this fixed? Is this fixed?

80
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,169
I'm going to teach you a lesson today!

81
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,199
Help me!

82
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,239
- Sister wants to hit me!
- Do you want to run?

83
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,819
- Sister is going to hit me!
- You dare run?

84
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,920
Come here!

85
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,220
- Do you know how embarrassed I was?
- Save me! Sister is hitting me!

86
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,980
- I only have one pair of white tennis shoes and you broke them!
- Save me!

87
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,050
Xiaoju, have you gone crazy?

88
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,059
- What happened?
- Sister hit me. It hurts really bad!

89
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:46,549
What are you doing? How could you hit your younger brother?

90
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,449
You didn't even ask about what he did.

91
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:51,350
No matter what he did, you can't hit him.

92
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,049
As his sister, you should give way to your brother.

93
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:56,329
Why should I always give way to him?

94
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,849
I've been giving way to him since I was young.

95
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,049
You also blamed me when he made a mistake.

96
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,519
You always favor him!

97
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,919
You don't care about my feelings.

98
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,919
In order to send him to the best primary school in the city,

99
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,751
without asking me, we moved houses.

100
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,569
You made me also transfer to another school!

101
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,049
Have you asked if I had adjusted?

102
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,620
Have you asked if I was happy about it?

103
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,639
You...

104
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,730
Why are you, this child, so insensible?

105
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,799
Old Xia,

106
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,489
you've only been here for a few days

107
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,609
yet you are doing a two-man's job yourself.

108
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,849
What tonics have you been eating

109
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,399
to have so much strength?

110
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,519
I sent my son to Jiangzhou No.1 Primary School this year.

111
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,919
And my daughter is also going to Jiangzhou No.1 Senior High.

112
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,569
That is even more useful than any tonics.

113
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,199
These two schools are the best in the city.

114
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,799
You must have spent a lot of money.

115
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,420
Old Xia, are you really willing?

116
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,190
Money is something I can earn back after spending.

117
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,499
The important thing is my son hasn't fallen short.

118
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,359
His grades are one of the best in the school.

119
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,399
Really?

120
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,540
That child will have a promising future.

121
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,169
I have already decided

122
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,519
that as long as the kid works hard,

123
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,249
I'll pay for however far he wants to study.

124
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,639
If he wants a Ph.D.,

125
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,369
I'll pay for him to get one.

126
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,240
If he wants to go abroad to study,

127
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,969
I'll pay for that.

128
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,809
You really are a good father.

129
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,189
We're Chinese...

130
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,820
- I also worked hard.
- We do this for our children.

131
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,129
- Right?
- You're right.

132
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,100
Why do you never care about how I feel?

133
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,080
Almost done.

134
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,340
Xiaoju?

135
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,080
Xiaoju!

136
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,780
Xiaoju!

137
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,979
Wait a moment.

138
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,370
Xiaoju!

139
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,190
Why are you running?

140
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,689
Here. Your favorite soda.

141
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,269
Kid, tell me.

142
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:55,490
Why did you run just now?

143
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,000
Dad.

144
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,460
Why did you make me transfer schools?

145
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,680
Was it because Jiashu transferred schools and we moved houses

146
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,809
that you also let me go to another school?

147
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,289
Xiaoju, why would you think like that?

148
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:19,399
I just feel that I have to give way to Jiashu for everything.

149
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,980
As Jiashu grew older,

150
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,090
I couldn't even eat chicken legs.

151
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,200
Everything is done with Jiashu as priority.

152
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,150
Dad, I think I'm redundant.

153
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,509
Kid, you mustn't think like that.

154
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,029
Both, you and Jiashu, are flesh that came from your mom and me.

155
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:45,390
Both of you are the same.

156
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,849
Of course, your brother had a poor health ever since he was little,

157
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,760
so we perhaps gave him additional attention.

158
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,050
Blame your mom and me.

159
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,830
We neglected how you felt.

160
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,979
But moving here absolutely wasn't just for Jiashu.

161
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:09,030
We hope Jiashu and you both can have a promising future.

162
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,399
Don't be like us.

163
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,520
We suffered because we didn't receive much education.

164
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,490
Kid...

165
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,539
For you and your brother,

166
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:29,190
we can endure any hardships happily.

167

Here.

168
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,730
Is it good?

169
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,149
Dad. Your face is dirty.

170
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:02,919
Don't touch it. It's too dirty.

171
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,540
Who wouldn't get dirty when working?

172
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,709
Mr. Zhang, although I can't catch up with the pace of learning here,

173
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:19,070
I want to stay.

174
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,609
Because there's someone who has faith in me.

175
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,129
I can't disappoint him.

176
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,759
So I'll work even harder and harder.

177
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,709
I'll let you and everyone see my progress.

178
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,519
I want to prove that I can stay.

179
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,359
Teacher, please check my score in the monthly exam.

180
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,419
Goodbye, Teacher. Goodbye, Teacher.

181
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,049
Did you hear that?

182
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,870
This kid is pretty ambitious.

183
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,250

184
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,629

00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:57,430
Lu Shiyi.

186
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,229
Did you come to help pick up balls for me?

187
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:05,430
It was my fault previously for blowing up and hurting your butt.

188
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,399
Didn't I warn you to never mention that?

189
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,979
I apologized to you.

190
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:12,559
If you are still angry,

191
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,539
then you can use firecrackers on me as well.

192
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:17,530
Anyway, I only hope for you to stop picking faults on me.

193
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,810
She's not to be pushed around with.

194
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,600

Let's play basketball.

205
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,999
What's wrong?

206
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,479
My dad said if I rank last in the monthly exams again,

207
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,960
he'll break my legs.

208
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,179
Your dad is just trying to scare you.

209
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,120
What about it? Can he really break your legs?

210
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,029
Besides, maybe you won't rank last in the exam this time.

211
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,249
But all the previous painful history has taught us,

212
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,340
I'll rank last undoubtedly.

213
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,049
That's because Xia Xiaoju wasn't here.

214
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,369
She?

215
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,289
Just her English score is much higher than my total score.

216
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,369
She is only able to keep up appearances in English.

217
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,801
As far as I know,

218
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:19,410
her math, physics, and chemistry are even worse than yours.

219
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,340
I'll show you by studying.

220
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,019
Xiaoju. Why don't we go get something to eat?

221
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,149
No.

222
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,369
I just talked big to Teacher Zhang that I would show him the score I get in the monthly exams.

223
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,539
But right now, I feel really unconfident.

224
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:44,789
I'm afraid I'll rank last.

225
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:47,999
You should go. I want to study some more.

226
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,959
Don't worry.

227
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,200
You're not the worst student in our class.

228

229

- I'll surpass you!
- I'll surpass you!

232
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,550
Baobao, from today on, I'll help you study.

233
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,539
I'll let your score be much higher than hers.

234
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:17,019
I'll show her the excellence of Jiangzhou No.1 Senior High.

235
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,399
How could you be like this?

236
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,639
I care about my classmates and want to help them raise their grades. What about it?

237
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,609
If you have the ability, find a military adviser for yourself.

238
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,439
You? A military adviser?

239
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,149
- Taotao, how are his grades?
- Average at best.

240
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:31,530
But it's enough to teach Bao Xiangxiang.

241
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,809
Then, Taotao, can you teach me as well?

242
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:42,999
Xiaoju. It's not that I don't want to help you.

243
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:44,489
I can study on my own,

244
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,129
but I don't know what to do

245
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,680
if I have to teach someone else.

246
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,719
Okay, it's fine. I will find some other classmate.

247
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,959
Other people don't even have enough time to study themselves.

248
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,859
Who has the time to care about you?

249
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:02,179
Baobao. You definitely won't suffer a beating this time!

250
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:02,979

251
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:06,479
Xia Xiaoju. How about I help you study?

252
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,279
Do you want to help her?

253
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,850
Is that not allowed?

254
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,559
All right.

255
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,413
You can easily get a score on a mechanics problem.

256
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:27,030
When we get a mechanics question, what should we do first?
<i>[He Ji Cafe]</i>

257
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,661
Read the question?

258
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,649
Make a free body diagram.

259
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,439
Let's look at this question.

260
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,549
First, it emphasized the ball is a smooth ball.

261
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,680
So we don't need to consider its...

262
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,529
friction.

263
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,377
In this case, friction isn't considered.

264
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:47,849
Let's look at the other forces.

265
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,489
First, this ball is influenced by gravity.

266
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,679
And it's also influenced by an obliquely upward force, right?

267
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,269
And we give it an F force.

268
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:57,080
Can you understand this part?

269
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,159
- No–
- Hey!

270
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640

271
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,160
Can you even learn this?

272
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,249
You two are so childish.

273
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,679
It was you who provoked me first.

274
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,280
Baobao.

275
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,559

Don't be influenced by them. Let's continue.

278
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,280
In this place...

279
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,489
What's the answer to this question? I just taught you.

280
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,319
It's A.

281
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,760
What did you say?

282
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,740
It's B?

283
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,650
It's C?

284
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,979
It's D. That's right! I choose D!

285
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:36,649
D. What D?

286
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,409
The answer is A! Choose A!

287
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,959
Then I was right by choosing A.

288
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,569
What do you mean you were right? You choose all four choices, ABCD!

289
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:45,269
How could it be right? Are you a pig?

290
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:47,170
You are such an idiot.

291
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,479
Here. Read this question.

292
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,269
I've taught you this question eight hundred times already.

293
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,029
Come on, tell me what to choose. Can you?

294
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:02,769
I can?

295
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,380
I can?

296
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,600
You know yourself if you can or not, why are you asking me?

297
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,320
Teacher Lu, if you are half as gentle as Teacher Cheng,

298
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,079
I'll definitely learn much better than now

299
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,919
I definitely won't make you lose face.

300
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,409
How am I not gentle?

301
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,820
Enough crap, hurry and answer the question.

302
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,820
Hurry up.

303
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,799
The magnitude of this acceleration A is 20 meters per second squared.

304
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,959
Am I right?

305
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,919
Yes.

306
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,880
I told you. You are smart.

307
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,350
You just need a bit of guidance to understand.

308
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,130
Xia Xiaoju, fighting.

309
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,919
I've told you so many times already!

310
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,011
Use your left hand to judge force. Use your right hand to judge electricity.

311
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:17,540
Why can't you remember such an easy thing, brother?

312
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,879
If I could remember this, I wouldn't always rank last.

313
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,960
Learn this by heart, okay?

314
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:24,760
I'll be checking when I get back later.

315
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,230
Memorize!

316
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,040
Such an idiot.

317
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,679

The transfer student is dozing off. Baobao.

320
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,919
I knew it.

321
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,199
You want to suffer another beating by your dad?

322
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,319
If you don't want your bottoms to blossom, then sit up and study!

323
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,219
Look! Memorize!

324
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:09,079
My bottoms blossoming will happen later.

325
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,199
Right now, I need to sleep.

326
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,980
I will just care about the present for now.

327
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,849
Get up.

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,179
Xia Xiaoju. What are you doing?

489
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,240
What are you doing?

490
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,240
What's under your foot?

491
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,320
Lift up your foot.

492
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,999
What's this?

493
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,310
Lift up your foot.

494
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,940
Lift it up!

495
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,870
You dare cheat?

496
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,080
Teacher, I...

497
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,310
Teacher, I wrote it. It has nothing to do with her.

498
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,759
Lu Shiyi?

499
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:19,759
Okay. Don't you two dare thinking of running away today!

500
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,070
I said I wrote it. It has nothing to do with her.

501
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,400
- Shut up!
- All right.

502
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,210
Have I told you how serious the consequences are for cheating?

503
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,999
- Teacher, I didn't cheat.
- You didn't cheat?

504
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:34,570
I saw it with my own eyes.

505
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,130
I'll tell your parents later!

506
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,079
It's all right. Stop crying. Stop crying.

507
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,779
- Hurry and go have some dinner.
- Sister, stop crying.

508
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:53,889
- Mom, I really didn't cheat.
- I know. I know.

509
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:55,809
I'll go to the school tomorrow

510
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:58,890
and explain it to your teacher. Will that be good?

511
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,510
Do you trust me?

512
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,169
If I don't believe you, who will? You are my daughter.

513
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:04,479
I understand you quite well.

514
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,750
But my teachers don't believe me.

515
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,380
So let your mom take you to school to talk with the teachers.

516
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,370
It's okay. Your mom made your favorite braised chicken wings.

517
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:16,719
You've been working hard for a month. You have to nourish yourself.

518
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,889
I won't eat.

519
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,319
If I do bad on the exam,

520
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,320
I will be sent back to my former school.

521
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,610
Now she has become anxious.

522
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,929
Kid, the reason why we transferred school for you

523
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:32,270
was to motivate your enthusiasm for learning.

524
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,929
If it's not like that now

525
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,609
and it conversely puts pressure on you,

526
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,409
we'd rather let you go back.

527
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,590
See? Your mom also said so.

528
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,129
Xiaoju, see?

529
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,460
Have a look.

530
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,000
Your mom bought you these.

531
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,849
Did my mom buy these for me?

532
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,319
Don't tell me it fell from the sky?

533
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,449
You're already in your senior year now.

534
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,449
I still have to buy you such a new school uniform.

535
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,649
It's so expensive and a waste of money.

536
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,079
And the shoes.

537
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,039
You bought the tennis shoes with your brother.

538
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,540
His tennis shoes are fine.

539
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,169
Look at yours. Look how worn out they have become.

540
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,720
Some people know you're a student.

541
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,369
Those that don't know would think you work on a construction site.

542
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,519
As a girl, all you know is to cry.

543
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,030
Do you think that's an achievement?

544
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,800
All right, hurry and go eat.

545
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,519
Okay.

546
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,239
Dad, I really didn't cheat.

547
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,140
We believe you.

548
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,890
Okay, try the clothes and come out to eat.

549
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,720
Jiashu, let's go. Let your sister change clothes.

550
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,660
Hurry up, we'll wait for you to eat.

551
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,290
It's right here.

552
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,139
Teacher Zhang.

553
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:07,969
Xia Xiaoju didn't cheat.

554
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,100
Bao Xiangxiang and I wanted to cheat in the exam.

555
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,449
Xia Xiaoju found out,and she wanted to stop us.

556
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,740
You dare cheat on the monthly exam?

557
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,649
Mr. Zhang, I'm sorry.

558
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,720
I shouldn't have cheated.

559
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,380
Your scores will be zero this time.

560
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,437
Also, write me a self-reflection!

561
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:31,902
3,000 words! It must be profound!

562
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:37,169
I didn't think that you are quite popular at your school.

563
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,039
You.

564
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,110
If your dad knows about it,

565
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,360
see how he'll sort you out at home.

566
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,459
- Xiaoju's mom.
- Mr. Zhang.

567
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:54,170
Hello.

568
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,579
You go back to class.

569
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:57,120
Both of you.

570
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,910
Hello, Auntie.

571
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,460
Hello, Teacher.

572
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,170
Xiaoju, you can also head to class as well.

573
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,780
Shiyi. Lu Shiyi.

574
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,927
Thank you for testifying for me.

575
00:39:15,928 --> 00:39:18,720
Who let you meddle in other people's business?

576
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,279
Well, it was wrong for you to cheat.

577
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,649
I'm too lazy to talk nonsense with you.

578
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,260
Let's go, Baobao.

579
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,169
Don't mind that.

580
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,687
He is just that kind of person.

581
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:36,802
It'll get better after spending more time with him.

582
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,689
Maybe you were right in what you said.

583
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,369
Actually, he is not that bad of a person.

584
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,070
Let's go to class.

585
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:54,080
Uncle Lin, I'm back.

586
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,140
Xiaoju, is school over?

587
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,079
Yes, Sister.

588
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,179
You're getting prettier every time.

589
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:01,279
Sister!

590
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,590
Why haven't you gone home to eat yet?

591
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,759
I want to play some more.

592
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,580
Hurry and go back!

593
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,100
Have you had enough fun with the new game card?

594
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,889
You brought it, right?

595
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,689
Did they make up?

596
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,989
Lu Shiyi, at that time we made a deal.

597
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:15,519
We'll tutor each one respectively.

598
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,529
The one who wins can get the game card.

599
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,889
Accept your loss. Don't go back on your word.

600
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,620
Give it over.

601
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,620
If I knew earlier, I wouldn't have made this bet with you.

602
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,209
Did you guys actually do all of this for that thing?

603
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,510
You gone too far!

604
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,450
What went too far? What are you even saying?

605
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,779
- I saw it.
- I did, too.

606
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:37,109
- So what?
- Lu Shiyi!

607
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,420
You actually dare cheat?

608
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,409
I am done for!

609
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,929
See how I'll strip your skin off!

610
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,039
Dad, Dad.

611
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,409
Tell me exactly what happened.

612
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,609
You're even hiding now?

613
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:51,649
Are you going to say it?

614
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,129
Uncle Lu!

615
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,129
Uncle, fighting!

616
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,840
Stop right there!

617
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Dad!

618
