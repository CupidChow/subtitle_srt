I have two pharmacology classes with Professor Li tomorrow morning.

I can't be late or else I will fail the class.

- Thank you Boss.
- Take care.

47
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,290
Take the flashlight.

This lousy bike doesn't even have a bell.

57
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,200

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,330
I'm not fat.

Datu.

74

76
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,039
There are holes in the road. Can you try to stay focused?

77
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,100
I was focused.

78
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,000
I couldn't see the road clearly with how you held the flashlight.

79

It's a long story.

87
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,719
My phone is almost out of power.

88
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,339
I'll tell you about it tomorrow during class.

89

<i>Where exactly are you now?</i>

90
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,319

91
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,919
<i>It's not safe for a girl like you to be out at night alone.</i>

92
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,039
No need for that.

93
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,829
I'm with my friend now.

94
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,020

It's really dead.

97
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,660
I didn't think he would care so much about you.

98
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,690
Well, it's because I'm a girl that everyone likes.

99
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,479
Classmate, you must have a misunderstanding about yourself.

100
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,260
Are you getting on the bike or not?

101
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,930
If you keep standing here, we won't be able to get back to the dorms at 10:30 p.m.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,069
You won't ride into a ditch again, right?

103
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,759
Are you going or not?

104
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Let's go.

105
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,070
Ride well.

106
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,099
Don't ride on the stones.

107
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:05,759
There are so many stones here.

108
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,959
If you keep riding like this, the bike will fall apart.

109
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,139
If you keep saying so, the bike will really fall apart.

110
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,730
Sit tight.

111
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,199
We are finally back before the dorms close.

112
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,670
Comrade Datu, you have worked hard.

113
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,990
Any rewards?

114
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,509
What reward?

115
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,320
Hurry and ride. I'm exhuasted.

00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,779
- Okay, I'll get going then.
- Okay.

126
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:11,880
You should also get some rest.

- Bye bye.

128

What? I'm exhausted from riding you all the way here.

133
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:41,009
Yet he is a gentleman for standing here and waiting a bit for you?

134
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:43,399
He is gentle and considerate,

135
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,959
but you scold and be mean to me.

136
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,880
Ask yourself, how are you a gentleman?

137
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,149
Are you just leaving like that?

138
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:53,350
Ride slowly.

139
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,770
Lu Shiyi! Lu Shiyi!

Why are you back so late?

141
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,489
No reason. I had some stuff I had to do.

Why are you here so late?

I haven't seen you for six months after I got the internship.

145
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,080
It's rare for us to meet. Do you have to make such a long face?

146
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,710
I'm at least a girl, right?

147
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,590
What's up then?

148
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,909
We'll have a graduation party on Sunday.
<i>[Entrance Ticket]</i>

149

I want to invite you to go there with me.

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,399
I'm leaving here since I'm graduating soon.

151
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,400
I don't know if we'll have the time to meet each other in the future.

152
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,170
You won't say no to such a small request, right?

153
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,709
I don't want to refuse you,

154

but I think I have something to do that day.

I can't go there, so...

156
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,450
How about this? I'll give you the ticket.

157
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,700
If you really don't have time, then you can forget it.

Anyway, I hope you can come.

Lu Shiyi.

161
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,960
You like Xia Xiaoju, right?

162
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,330
And I also know you haven't confessed to her.

163
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,890
Then you should come to the graduation party.

164
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,050
Otherwise, what if I tell her your secret?

165
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,470
Get some rest.

166
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,110
I said I didn't look at her.

167
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,740
Okay, fine. I won't explain to you, okay?

168
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,369
Break up... Let's break up!

169
00:10:57,369 --> 00:10:59,099
Don't try to scare me with this.

170
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:02,000
If I break up with you, can't I find a girlfriend?

171
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,319
Is Xu Menglu insane?

172
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,490
Qiu Le Tao walked in front of me, how could I not look at her?

173
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,469
Xu Menglu became jealous because of this.

174
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,199
Is she insane?

175
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,340
You deserve it.

176
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,050
I deserve it.

177
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,050
Le Tao walked in front of me, so I looked at her.

178
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,170
I still can't forget her.

179
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,979
Do you still like Le Tao?

180
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:37,710
I always liked her, even if we broke up.

181
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,030
What about Xu Menglu?

182
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,180
Let me tell you, brother. Reality is not like a novel.

183
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,349
You can only like one.

184
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,459
If I let you choose now, who will you choose, Le Tao or Xu Menglu?

185
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,530
Say something!

186
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,780
Okay, you deserve it.

187
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,310
Who are you texting?

188
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,509
- It's a secret.
- Secret?

189
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,620
Is it Huang Jun?

190
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,199
How can that be?

191
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,610
Huang Jun is only just a small part of my youth. I'm way over him now.

192
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,839
There's nothing between us now.

193
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,789
A small part of my youth?

194
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,519
You said that quite well. It's quite unrestrained.

195
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,489
I want to write it into my novel.

196
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:51,409
Writer Gui, your novel is quite popular on the campus network.

197
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,079
Don't forget to give me copyright payment.

198
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,169
If this novel can really be published, I definitely won't forget you.

199
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,139
Did you hear that the Medical School Department is holding a graduation party?

200
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:05,100
At their graduation party, in addition to having their own activities,

201
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,109
the other departments and clubs are also invited to perform there.

202
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,369
Why don't we get a ticket and have some fun?

203
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:13,650
Why does such a fun event

204
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,739
not happen in our department?

205
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:19,519
Think about how someone has to spend five years in medical school.

206
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,339
They finally graduated with difficulty.

207
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,319
How could other departments compare to the feeling of having to study for another year?

208
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,510
I can quite understand.

209
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,399
That's right, Xiaoju. We are graduating soon.

210
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,249
Shiyi still has to study for another year, right?

211
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:37,439
Should we prepare a gift to encourage him?

212
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,510
Do you think he is someone who lacks presents?

213
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,000
<i>[Jiangzhou University]</i>

214
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,920
Chang Le?

215
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,109
Isn't he the most handsome guy in Xia Xiaoju's department?

216
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,910
Why are you searching for him?

217
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,660
Get lost!

218
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,249
You finally realized that Chang Le treats Xia Xiaoju differently?

219
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:15,231
I already realized he looked at her in a different way a long time ago.

220
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,079
You're so dull.

221
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier if you knew?

222
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,100
It's not too late to tell you now.

223
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,319
Think about it. Xia Xiaoju will graduate soon.

224
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:27,669
After graduating, she'll start working.

225
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,449
But you're different. Those in the Medical Department have to study for five years.

226
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:33,349
Then you have to study for your master's and doctorate.

227
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,909
One of you will work in the society,

228
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,439
and the other one will study in a university.

229
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,199
There will be less and less time for you to meet.

230
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,669
Besides, Xia Xiaoju has a good personality.

231
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,519
And she is pretty.

232
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,900
Maybe someone else will pursue her and succeed.

233
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,650
I know.

234
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,590
You're afraid that if Xia Xiaoju doesn't like you

235
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,530
and if you confess, you can't be friends anymore.

236
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,880
Brother, I thought of a good solution for you.

237
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,109
<i>Invite Xia Xiaoju to watch a movie this week.</i>

238
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,589
<i>You should arrive late.</i>

239
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,809
<i>Go into the cinema after the movie begins.</i>

240
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,549
<i>At that time, the cinema will be dark.</i>

241
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,229
<i>It'll be hard to find your seats.</i>

242
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,310
<i>Then you can hold Xia Xiaoju's hand.</i>

243
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,460
<i> You can keep holding her hand like that.</i>

244
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,710
<i>Of course, if she takes her hand out of yours,</i>

245
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,079
that's fine.

246
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,840
Simply said, you don't have a chance.

247
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,320
But if she doesn't let go,

248
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,399
it means you have a chance.

249
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,959
You just have to take the initiative.

250
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,240
How is that?

251
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,980
Just so-so.

252
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,149
You have to try.

253
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,669
Don't you even dare try?

254
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,130
Then you can just wait for her to become Chang Le's girlfriend.

255
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,400
Don't talk nonsense.

256
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,440
You kicked me.

257
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,199
<i>Why are you looking at me like that?</i>

258
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,279
<i>Don't tell me you like me?</i>

259
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,480
<i>What if... it really was you?</i>

260
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,469
<i>Why didn't you pull me?</i>

261
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,609
<i>Pull you?</i>

262
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:53,849
<i>Are you excrement? Why would I pull you?
(T/N: Pull and excrete are the same word but used in a different context.)</i>

263
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:56,540
<i>I'd like a pig rather than you.</i>

264
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,029
<i>It can't be.</i>

265
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,420
<i>I must be thinking too much.</i>

266
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,109
How prepared are you for the exam this time?

267
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,130
- Lin You.
- Lin You.

268
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,869
- Xiaoju, Le Tao.
- Your class is finished?

269
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,369
Are you going to dance?

270
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,058
I am going to see Cheng Lang first.

271
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:27,919
There was a big bug in the campus network yesterday.

272
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,189
He stayed up all night to fix it.

273
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,320
I want to buy breakfast for him.

274
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,179
You haven't seen your boyfriend for one night, yet you already miss him?

275
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,949
You've been together for so long.

276
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,039
You're still so lovey-dovey.

277
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,460
Who said an old couple can't be lovey-dovey?

278
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,519
Of course, you can.

279
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,810
We'll head to class then.

280
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,189
Okay, hurry and go then.

281
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,000
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

282
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,871
By the way, can you ask the teacher for an excuse note for me?

283
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,560
You still can't let him go?

284
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,679
They've been together for two years.

285
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,429
I've already let him go.

286
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,739
I just feel a bit uncomfortable.

287
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:11,110
But it's okay, let's go.

288
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,159
You should find a boyfriend.

289
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,740
This is the best way to let someone go.

290
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,999
What are you talking about?

291
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,459
Class is starting soon. Let's hurry and go.

292
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:21,489
You...

293
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:24,080
Why don't you ever listen to what I say?

294
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,109
Cheng Lang, I'm off to play basketball.

295
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,910
Okay.

296
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,910
Lin You, you are here.

297
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,430
Lin You.

298
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,429
I brought you breakfast.

299
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,260
Have you fixed the bug?

300
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,010
It can be accessed normally now.

301
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,209
Why aren't you at the dance studio for class today?

302
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,069
I asked for half an hour's leave.

303
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,679
I brought you two things.

304
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,039
One is breakfast.

305
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,310
Guess what the other thing is.

306
00:18:54,310 --> 00:19:00,719
Let me think. The other is a girlfriend, who cares about me and loves me, right?

307
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,200
These love letters were sent to my classroom.

308
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,559
They didn't even do any research beforehand.

309
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,770
Did they think that because you are often in the computer room

310
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,591
you are majoring in computers?

311
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,340
Is that true?

312
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,949
Are you reading it?

313
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,495
Do you want to pursue something with them?

314
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:28,879
How can these be comparable to the breakfast my girlfriend brought?

315
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,480
Let me look at what you brought.

316
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:34,863
You made the desk a mess again.

317
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,429
Eggs, soybean milk and...

318
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,760
Cheng Lang, come here and look.

319
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,069
What's wrong?

320
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,279
These are the materials I asked my classmates abroad to organize.

321
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
It contains rankings of the Computer Science Department
<i>[World University Rankings]</i>

322
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,459
and exam requirements for universities around the world.

323
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:57,949
With your current situation,

324
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,030
I think you can succeed if you apply.

325
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,469
Lin You. Although the internet bubble in the country is quite serious now,

326
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,679
I still believe its future is promising.

327
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,989
And if I'm going to study abroad, what about you?

328
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,150
What if I go with you?

329
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,759
What do you mean?

330
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,280
I'll tell you after the medical school graduation party tonight.

Do you have an entrance ticket for the medical school graduation party?

334
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,040
Can you go with me?

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,329
Why are you still here?

337
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:07,860
Aren't we going to have lunch? Let's go.

338
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:11,100
I'll go later.

339
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,200
Why are you here?

340
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
I...

341
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,639
Do you have time this Sunday?

342
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,679
I want to invite you to watch the newly-released movie, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'

343
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,650
I heard it's quite good.

344
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,039
I just agreed to go to the medical school graduation party with Chang Le.

345
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,589
You can watch it alone.

346
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,630
Tell me if it was good or not later.

347
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,799
It's a graduation party for medical school.

348
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,799
You're in the Tourism Department, why are you even going?

349
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,590
My friend invited me, it would be ungracious to refuse their kindness.

350
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,900
Xiaoju, you can take Le Tao and the others with you.

351
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,469
Okay.

352
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,849
They wanted to go there as well.

353
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,349
I'm sorry. I don't have any more tickets.

354
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:08,340
Or I would surely take you with us this time.

355
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,170
I don't have so much spare time.

356
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,900
Lu Shiyi, where are you going?

357
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,840
Xiaoju, give these to Le Tao and the others.

358
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,400
Thank you.

Let me tell you, do you know who will attend this graduation party?

361
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:35,049
I don't care. What does it have to do with me?

362
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:38,809
I heard my friend say that Chang Le will go on stage to sing,

363
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:41,109
and he is confessing to Xiaoju.

364
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,610
What?

365
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,200
No wonder he asked Xia Xiaoju to go with him.

366
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,919
Turns out that was what he was planning.

367
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,709
You have to hurry, or else someone else will steal your chance.

Does he want to steal?

370
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,710
He has to see who he is stealing from.

- Yes.

Why are you here so early?

00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,690
The party hasn't begun yet.

379
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,780
I'm here to see if Huang Jun needs any help.

- I'll go with you.
- Okay.

I'll take you to find my classmates. They're decorating.

382

It's okay. I'll just find a place to sit.

383
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,369
Okay.

384
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:25,901
Look over here. It's decorated quite nicely, right?

385

Yes. The atmosphere is good.

386
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,219
Did you hear that the most handsome guy in the Tourism Department is taking the chance

387
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:48,349
to sing a love song for a girl?

388
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,050
It will definitely be very lively.

389
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,720
I didn't hear that.

390
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,900
If a boy is willing to sing a love song to me on this stage,

391
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,130
I would agree immediately to be his girlfriend.

392
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,710
What if the girl doesn't like him?

393
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,130
Or if someone takes the chance before him?

394
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,759
What do you mean?

395
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,440
Nothing.

396

It turns out you had another motive.

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,460
I thought you came here for me.

398
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,179
I'm sorry. I should have made myself clear in the beginning.

399
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,160
It's too late.

400

Wait a second.

401
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,229
Hurry and tell the host to change the song.

402
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,250
Change it to 'Beyond's Like You.'

403
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,679
Changing songs now?

404
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,939
Wait, you want to sing this for Qiu Le Tao?

405
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:11,589
Won't Sister Menglu be angry?

406
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,319
Don't keep talking nonsense. Just change it.

I really have something important to tell you.

414
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,750
Say it. What is it?

415
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,640
I can only tell you.

416
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,580
Just give me two minutes.

417
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,969
Xiaoju, you can walk around here with Chang Le.

418

I'll be back soon.

419

Don't worry.

420

Let's go.

421

What are you doing?

422
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,420
I'm going to study abroad soon.

423
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,030
I don't want to lose too much face today, okay?

424
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,460
Say it. What is it?

425
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,229
Our band is performing later.

426
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,999
We're fourth. Come and watch.

427
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,179
Okay. Wish your performance all the best.

428
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:56,799
Is that why you called me out here?

429
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,770
Wait. There's something else.

430
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,460
Say it.

431
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,119
Shiyi likes Xiaoju, but he's too embarrassed to tell her.

432
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,730
Why don't we be the matchmakers

433
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,430
and work with each other to get them together?

434
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,829
Does Shiyi like Xiaoju?

435
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,309
Yes.

436
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,999
Since we were freshmen.

437
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,110
But he is too embarrassed to tell her.

438
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,190
What about we help him?

439
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,319
Forget it. It's someone else's private matter.

440
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,140
I don't want to get involved.

441
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,949
Hello, wait a second.

442
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,580
I'll find a quiet place to talk to you.

I miss you, too.

444

I've received the things you sent me.

445
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,330
I really like them.

446
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,290

This will be the last party for the undergraduate in college.

Just dance. Relax a bit.

470
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,280
Good.

471
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,480
Can you focus more?

472
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,010
Where are you going?

473
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,009
Great. You're dancing very well.

474
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:20,479
Really?

475
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,519
Why are you lying to her?

476
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:24,089
How could you praise her?

477
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,879
She dances like a stupid penguin.

478
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,759
You are so hypocritical, do you know?

479
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,909
- So hypocritical.
- Can you even talk?

480
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:32,280
You dance like a penguin.

481
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,880
I...

482
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,830
Senior Sister, please take care of him.

483
00:30:39,028 --> 00:30:40,919
You can't expect good words from a scoundrel.

484
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,209
- Say that again.
- I can say that twice.

485

Xia Xiaoju!

486
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,900
By saying you look like a penguin, I mean you're cute!

487
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,969
Are you still talking?

488
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:53,279
Girls like gentle and polite boys.

489
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,180
If you diss her like this, how could she like you?

490
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,949
Don't be angry.

491
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,060
He really can't talk.

492
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,879
A cheerful song has just ended.

493
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,809
Next, let's appreciate

494
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:24,229
a love song performed by the most handsome guy in the Tourism Department, Chang Le.

495
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,800
Everyone please give him a round of applause.

496
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,229
Are you performing?

497
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,669
I can't sing well. Don't laugh at me.

498
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:35,629
Come over here. Listen to me sing.

499
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:37,240
Okay.

500
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,280
He is going to confess.

501
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,189
Thank you, everyone.

502
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,429
I'm very happy and honored

503
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:55,060
to participate in the medical school graduation party.

504
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,799
I'm Chang Le from the Tourism Department.

505
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,550
I have brought for everyone a love song.

506
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,860
Is he Chang Le?

507
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,560
My happiest moment at Jiangzhou University

508
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,429
is when I was in my sophomore year...

509
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,279
- Where are you going?
- where I met...

510
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,980
- Let me go.
- I won't.

511
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,809
Enough! Don't follow me!

512
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,600
Le Tao, Le Tao.

513
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,330
You don't need to care about who called me.

514
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,530
Le Tao, Le Tao.

515
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,559
Enough! Who do you think you are?

516
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,810
What right do you have to interfere with my business?

517
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,410
- Okay, okay.
- Don't ever show up in front of me again!

518
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,230
I feel disgusted every time I see you!

519
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,710
Taotao! Taotao!

520
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,730
- What are you laughing at?
- Okay, enough.

521
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,908
And you! Why are you singing a love song?

522
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:42,980
Get lost!

523
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,300
You...

524
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,940
He left?

525
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,579
Where are you going? We still need to perform.

526
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:55,643
Yes, we have to perform.

527
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:57,429
I'm not performing anymore.

528
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,430
Taotao.

529
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:10,599
He was the one who cheated on me, but now he keeps trying to stand in front of me.

530
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:12,520
He is a playboy.

531
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,849
Qiu Le Tao, let me tell you, just ignore him.

532
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,800
You're right, I'm not angry.

533
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,370
I'm not angry.

534
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:27,030
I can't ruin my day because of mouse feces.

535
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,659
I'm fine. You can go back.

536
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:35,010
Are you not going back?

537
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,469
I won't go back. I want to go home now.

538
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:40,010
I'm fine, you can go back.

539
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,450
Don't let Chang Le stay there alone.

540
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,050
Be good.

541
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,460
Bye bye.

542
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,830
Xiaoju.

543
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,259
Xiaoju. How's Le Tao?

544
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:18,979
Go back and tell Huang Jun to go farther he is from Le Tao, the better it is.

545
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:21,729
He is already with Xu Menglu now. Why does he keep trying to see Qiu Le Tao?

546
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:23,090
What does he want to do?

547
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,460
I'll tell him,

548
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,040
but he might not listen to me.

549
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,610
Is your foot okay?

550
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,820
I'm fine.

551
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,749
<i>If she takes her hand out of yours, it simply means you don't have a chance.</i>

552
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,329
Xiaoxue. How's your application to study abroad?

553
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,269
My application was refused.

554
00:34:56,269 --> 00:35:00,159
If I knew earlier, I would have worked harder on dancing.

555
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,049
Why do you want to go abroad so much?

556
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:04,050
Don't tell me you don't want to go abroad.

557
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,460
Who doesn't want to go abroad in our dance major?

558
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:12,659
You can also apply to study abroad as a dance major?

559
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:13,460
Yes.

560
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,661
Our Dance Department has exchange students with foreign universities every year.

561
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:19,469
There can be two exchange students every year.

562
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,279
Does Lin You have a chance?

563
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,159
Her? Our teacher like her the best.

564
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,260
She is the best dancer among us.

565
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,090
She can surely pass.

566
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,870
But Talented Cheng, would you be willing?

567
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,660
I...

568
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,930
What are you talking so happily about?

569
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,000
Hello, Senior Sister.

570
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,480
We're talking about your boyfriend, Talented Cheng.

571
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:44,629
Senior Sister, we're going next. Hurry and get changed.

572
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:47,150
Okay, you guys also hurry.

573
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,720
Lin You.

574
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,630
Do you have a chance to go abroad?

575
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:58,270
Yes, but I need to know how my boyfriend thinks first.

576
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,379
Focus on your performance then.

577
00:35:59,379 --> 00:36:01,570
Let's talk about it after.

578
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:09,290
In the future, you aren't allowed to flirt with other girls.

579
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,420
I... When did I do that?

580
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,409
Lu Shiyi, this is your last chance.

581
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,349
- What are you doing?
- Where are you going?

582
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:39,200
It's none of your business.

583
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,470
Aren't you afraid that I'll tell everyone that you like Xia Xiaoju?

584
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,897
That's what I'm going to do.

585
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,120
You... You really won't consider me?

586
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,630
Thank you for liking me.

587
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,600
You are a very good girl.

588
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,899
But you know that if you like someone, you like them.

589
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:18,999
If you don't, then you don't.

590
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:22,980
It can't be forced. Thank you.

591
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,420
Go and tell Xia Xiaoju you like her.

592
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,810
Where's Huang Jun?

593
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,949
Is your friend okay?

594
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,149
She's fine.

595
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,449
That's good then. You should also be happy.

596
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:55,120
I'm sure your friend doesn't want you to be upset for her.

597
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,610
You're right.

598
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:04,290
I shouldn't ruin my mood because of some mouse feces.

599
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,359
I'm sorry.

600
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,429
I didn't listen to you sing just now.

601
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,429
It's okay.

602
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:14,710
I've told them to move my performance for later.

603
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,850
Because this song was for you.

604
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,019
Xia Xiaoju, come with me.

605
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:38,190
- What are you doing? Let me go!
- Xiaoju.

606
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,190
Xiaoju!
