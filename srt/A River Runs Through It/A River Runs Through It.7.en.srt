Won't you even let them go and relax a bit?

163
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,700
Moreover, they have Shiyi and Cheng Lang.

164
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,100
What are you worrying about?

165
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,800
Indeed.

166
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,200
Wanfang.

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,800
You didn't want to let Cheng Lang

168
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,600
to repeat a year of school?

169
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,100
I already asked Cheng Lang.

170
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,200
He said that even though he didn't get admitted into the computer science major,

171
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,800
he can still get into one of Jiangzhou University's top majors.

172
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,000
So we didn't consider repeating a year.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,700
Jiangzhou University is not bad,

174
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,900
and it's close to our home, right?

175
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes.

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Cheng Lang said that, too.

177
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
But in my heart,

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,800
I always feel sorry for him.

179
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,000
I keep thinking that if I had gone with him that day,

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
then it would have been me who helped that person,

181
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,700
and he wouldn't have missed the exam.

182
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,800
But now, he can't even get into the major that he wants.

183
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,100
Then won't you say that I feel...

184
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,800
It's okay. It's okay.

185
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,600
Don't keep blaming yourself.

186
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Cheng Lang did well on his exams.

187
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,000
It's all over now.

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Why are you still thinking about it?

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,600
Cheng Lang didn't worry you all these years.

190
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,800
Don't worry. That kid will have a promising future.

191
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,300
That's right. That's right.

192
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,800
What? Do you want me to use my dirty hands to wipe your tears?

193
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,200
Stop playing around. Stop playing around.

194
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,700
- Come here. Come here.
- Stop playing around. Stop playing around.

195
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,800
Stop playing around.

196
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,500
It's okay now. Don't be sad.

197
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,300
By the way, how are Old Lu and Shiyi?

198
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,600
The exams are over now.

199
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
Is the war between them over, too?

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,400
Thinking on it, it's strange.

201
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,000
This time, those two are strangely harmonious.

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,700
Old Lu told him to apply for Tsinghua University's architecture major,

203
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,950
and he agreed.

204
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,349
Seriously. I don't know why,

205
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,560
but I'm still really worried.

206
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,000
<i>- What?
- What are you looking at for you to be so excited?</i>

207
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,449
Look, look at this sentence.

208
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:10,950
Here.

209
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,850
Right?

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,549
<i>When you fall in love with someone,</i>

211
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,299
<i>your whole heart will be attracted to him.</i>

212
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,929
<i>You'll be captivated by him..</i>

213
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,489
<i>You'll care for him.</i>

214
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:26,910
<i>You'll also blush, and your heart will beat faster for him.</i>

215
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,839
<i>You'll think about him when you don't see him,</i>

216
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,419
<i>but when you see him,</i>

217
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:35,850
<i>you'll feel too shy to face him.</i>

218
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,290
One card.

219
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,759
What are you doing?

220
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,460
Like a fool.

221
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,459
Taotao, I'm going to the restroom.

222
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,050
Wait, I'll go with you.

223
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,090
Xiaoju.

224
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,899
Is there something that you didn't tell me?

225
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:21,439
What do you mean?

226
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,879
Are you sure?

227
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,879
You clearly behaved very strangely just now.

228
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,899
Wh-Wh-What do you mean strange?

229
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm going to the restroom.

230
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,859
You two have a promising son.

231
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,800
There's no hope for my Xiaoju.

232
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,179
How about one of your boys get engaged to my daughter?

233
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:49,389
- This way I can get some luck from it, too.
- I say we can.

234
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,589
I like a lively and cute girl like Xiaoju.

235
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:56,949
Forget it. If Xiaoju ends up with your Shiyi, then even your house's roof would be torn off.

236
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:58,369
She's more suitable to be with my Cheng Lang.

237
00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:00,599
What do you know? It's called being quarrelsome lovers.

238
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:04,180
I tell you. In my eyes, Xiaoju and my Cheng Lang are a perfect match and the most suitable.

239
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,849
- It's a deal then.
- Don't steal her from me.

240
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:07,640
You don't steal her from me!

241
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,589
Now, it seems like having a daughter is something to be proud of.

242
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,499
Just wait to enjoy your happiness. Life as a mother-in-law is great.
<i>(T/N: For the daughter's husband)</i>

243
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:18,549
Not like us,

244
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,029
life as a mother-in-law.
<i>(T/N: Because of the son's wife)</i>

245
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,229
You're blessed.

246
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,880
It's really great.

247
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,200
<i>[Yunhai]</i>

248
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,309
<i>Hello, everyone. We're arriving at Yunhai Station.</i>

249
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,299
<i>Tourists getting off at Yunhai Station,</i>

250
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:43,349
<i>please remember to have your tickets and don't forget your belongings.</i>

251
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,050
<i>You can get off at both ends of the car.</i>

252
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,110
Cheng Lang, we've arrived.

253
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,229
Really?

254
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,229
Okay then. I'll go and grab our luggage.

255
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,439
We've arrived.

256
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,179
I'll grab the luggage.

257
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:00,489
I'll help you.

258
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:01,489
It's okay. I can do it myself.

259
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,510
It's okay. I can do it.

260
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,880
Be careful.

261
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,909
Shiyi. Shiyi. Wake up. Wake up.

262
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,610
We arrived at the station.

263
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,020
Did we arrive?

264
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,520
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

265
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,009
What's wrong with you, Xia Xiaoju?

266
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,810
Why is your face so red?

267
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,070
Are you having a fever?

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,219
N-No. I just feel very hot.

269
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,059
T-Taotao, I already helped you grab your backpack.

270
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:49,010
You can just get off the train.

271
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,509
Come on, let's go. Follow them.

272
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:53,210
My bag.

273
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,520
Two rooms. 140 yuan in all.

274
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,920
Okay.

275
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,550
- What's wrong?
- Where's my bag?

276
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,900
Taotao, where's my bag?

277
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,030
What can you actually do?

278
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,939
It's all right. Don't be too anxious. Search for it carefully. It can't be lost.

279
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:20,559
Right, right. It's okay. We'll find it together.

280
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,999
Taotao, hurry and check to see if it's in your bag.

281
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,149
Y-Y-You guys also check to see if it's in your bags.

282
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,469
Carefully think,

283
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,999
when was the last time you had the bag and where was it?

284
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,589
It was there when I got on the train.

285
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,419
It was also there when I was reading the magazine.

286
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,120
When I got off...

287
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,249
<i>I'll grab the luggage.</i>

288
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,760
<i>- I'll help you.
- It's okay. I can do it myself.</i>

289
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,960
<i>It's okay. I can do it.</i>

290
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,630
Stupid.

291
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,209
- How is it?
- There's not even a bank around here.

292
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:20,390
We can't withdraw money even if we want to.

293
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,879
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

294
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,660
I told you we can't just give her all of our money.

295
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,419
Luckily, I still have some with me, but there's not much left.

296
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,399
Xiaoju, it's not a big problem. Don't blame yourself too much.

297
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,549
That's right. That's right.

298
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,639
If you weren't our tour guide today, we would've gotten lost.

299
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:40,549
I came up with many travel strategies,

300
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,099
but now, instead of having fun,

301
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,219
we don't even have enough money to buy our return tickets.

302
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:47,899
This problem is quite serious.

303
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,359
You guys don't have to worry about the return tickets.

304
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,759
We can buy it with the money I have left.

305
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,149
Then... Should we be going back now?

306
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,750
Baobao, wipe off your sweat first.

307
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,929
Xia Xiaoju, don't forget the reason why we came here.

308
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,959
Since we're already out here, then let's have fun today before going back.

309
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,620
How can we have fun if we don't have money?

310
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,180
There's a way to have fun without money.

311
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,359
I have an idea. Follow me.

312
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,759
Fine, we'll follow you.

313
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,840
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

314
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,340
Okay, let's go.

315
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,309
Xia Xiaoju, what kind of place are you taking us to?

316
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,529
- It's so desolate here.
- Stop complaining. Hurry up and walk!

317
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:07,069
It's only desolate for now.

318
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,489
Once we climb over this mountain,

319
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:11,349
we'll be able to see an amazing view.

320
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,639
Really?

321
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,729
It's true!

322
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:16,729
Behind this mountain lies a really famous landscape.

323
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,709
But if we go through the main entrance, it'll be quite far.

324
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:22,189
So we can only take this route to get around it.

325
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,429
That's fine.

326
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,239
We can hike and see the beautiful scenery.

327
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,479
That's right.

328
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:29,279
- Let's go.
- Then, let's go. I can't wait!

329
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,699
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

330
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:32,089
- Get up!
- Let's go. Let's go.

331
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:33,279
I can't go anymore. I can't go anymore.

332
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,869
Let me take a break.

333
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:37,279
- Let's go!
- Let me take a break.

334
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,229
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Let's go.

335
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:40,830
Bao Xiangxiang!

336
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,730
You want a beating, don't you?

337
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,309
- Hurry! Hurry and get up!
- I...

338
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,259
- Hurry and get up!
- Let me take a break.

339
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,800
They already left.

340
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,300
Hurry up.

341
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,190
What is this mountain actually?

342
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,939
It's so beautiful.

343
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:01,829
Since you're so interested, then let me give you an introduction.

344
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,760
This mountain is called Mount Green.
<i>(T/N: "Qing" means green.)</i>

345
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,039
The name you just made up is too lame.

346
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,779
Then according to your logic,

347
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,479
since this lake is green,

348
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,579
is it called Green Lake?

349
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:14,799
Shiyi, I really admire you.

350
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,480
Do you even know about this?

351
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,109
What do the both of you know?

352
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,379
Although the altitude of Mount Green is not high, it is surrounded by clouds and mist all year round.

353
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,589
Due to this, it is called the "Drunken Mist of Mount Green."

354
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,300
That's where the "cloud" of Yunhai County comes from.

355
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,519
Xiaoju, you're really impressive.

356
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,109
I think you can be a host of the outdoor locations on Zhengda Variety Show.

357
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,189
Of course!

358
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,159
I didn't watch Zhengda Variety Show all these years for nothing.

359
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,449
How is it? Isn't the mountainous scenery very beautiful?

360
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:38,000
Not at all.

361
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,590
Are you okay?

362
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,650
Give me your bag.

363
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,419
I told you to give me your bag. Why did you give me your hand?

364
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,419
Xiaoju, are you okay?

365
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:37,020
I'm good.

366
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,039
It's just slippery, so I fell down.

367
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,469
Are you hurt?

368
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,870
No.

369
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,030
Wait for me. Wait for me.

370
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,469
Xia Xiaoju, where are you taking me?

371
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,570
What is it?

372
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,810
The sea.

373
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,100
- It's the sea!
- It's the sea!

374
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,870
Hurry, hurry! Hurry, let's go!

375
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,660
It's the sea!

376
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,550
It's the sea!

377
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,260
It's the sea!

378
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,550
It's my first time seeing the ocean!

379
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,949
What do you think? Are you satisfied?

380
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,759
Xia Xiaoju knows that you like the ocean,

381
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,539
so she specifically organized it for you.

382
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:46,899
- Xiaoju—
- What are you doing just standing there? Let's go!

383
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,280
Come on!

384
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,520
Taotao, look! Look at them.

385
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,549
Lu Shiyi, come down here.

386
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,780
- I'm not interested.
- Let's go!

387
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,049
- What are you doing?
- Taotao, come on.

388
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:21,089
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

389
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,679
- Come on.
- My shoes, my shoes!

390
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,909
Lu Shiyi, there are times when even you are afraid?

391
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:30,599
I can't swim.

392
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,329
Xiaoju, Shiyi is really afraid of the water.

393
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:35,829
Why doesn't he try to learn?

394
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,999
He went to play near a lake and almost drowned when he was young, so he has Aquaphobia.

395
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,910
- Lu Shiyi, you...
- Come!

396
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,189
Are you ready?

397
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,190
Come on.

398
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,960
Stand closer.

399
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,410
One, two, three.

400
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,919
Okay, come here.

401
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,589
Cheng, come here and take a picture of us.

402
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,290
Here, hurry up.

403
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,530
Be happier.

404
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,680
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

405
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,069
How do you like it here, Cheng Lang?

406
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,589
It's comfortable.

407
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,349
It's perfect!

408
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,349
Not only is it perfect,

409
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,949
it's ultra perfect, okay?

410
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,039
I don't want to leave.

411
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,330
Then you can just sleep here tonight, Baobao.

412
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,679
I hope time would pass by slowly today.

413
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,820
It's really amazing here.

414
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,469
There are many here.

415
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,830
Xiaoju, hurry and look. There are many shells here!

416
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,990
This one also looks nice.

417
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,940
I really want to stay here one more day.

418
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,730
Xiaoju, what are you looking at?

419
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,599
Look. There are some restaurants over there.

420
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,689
I have an idea that will allow us to stay here one more day.

421
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,189
- Boss.
- Boss.

422
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,349
I beg you.

423
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,079
- We're very good workers.
- It's true. It's true!

424
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:19,360
We're very fast at cleaning tables, sweeping the floor, and washing dishes.

425
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,840
If you don't believe me, I can show you.

426
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,529
- I beg you.
- Boss.
- Okay, fine. Stop, stop talking.

427
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,039
- I beg you!
- I've had enough of you guys

428
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,429
that my head is starting to hurt.

429
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,759
How about this?

430
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,919
There are a few baskets of oysters that you can help me peel.

431
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,799
Once you're done, I'll give you 50 yuan.

432
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,559
50 yuan per person?

433
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,379
What are you thinking? 50 yuan in total.

434
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:38,320
It's one person's work.

435
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,229
Do a good job.

436
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,399
Thank you, Boss!

437
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,230
You're welcome.

438
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,200
50 yuan is not enough for us to stay in a hotel.

439
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,959
It's enough, Baobao. Look!

440
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:53,360
50 yuan is enough for us to rent two tents.

441
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,200
You're smart!

442
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,630
Then the sooner we finish, the sooner we can go and have fun.

443
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,559
- Sure!
- Sure!

444
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,879
Everyone, have some energy.

445
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,230
- Everyone, fighting!
- Fighting! Fighting!

446
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,690
What's wrong?

447
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,380
It's nothing, Taotao.

448
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,679
You only know how to show off your abilities.

449
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,880
Can you be more careful?

450
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,949
That's right. Let me see.

451
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,390
It's nothing. It's nothing. It's only a small cut.

452
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,329
Even if you're working hard, safety comes first.

453
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:18,759
Do you understand?

454
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,999
I understand.

455
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,399
I was thinking that if we finish it sooner,

456
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,630
then we can hurry and go have fun.

457
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,309
When you said that we'd sleep in tents near the sea,

458
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,010
I was quite excited.

459
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,879
Have you never slept in a tent before?

460
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,109
No.

461
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,679
And it's by the sea.

462
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,480
So I'm really looking forward to it.

463
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,760
What's there to look forward to?

464
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,229
We still have a lot of work to do.

465
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,679
Hurry and come back here to work.

466
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,759
Coming.

467
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,130
Boss Lu has given the order.

468
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,430
Do it lightly.

469
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,799
Don't cut your hands.

470
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,840
I got it. I got it.

471
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,410
Xiaoju.

472
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,160
- What?
- There's something strange with you today.

473
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,439
No, same as usual.

474
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,679
No.

475
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,039
I felt that there was already something wrong with you when we were on the train.

476
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,420
There's nothing wrong with me.

477
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,680
Do you like Cheng Lang?

478
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,480
Lower your voice!

479
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,279
What are you talking about? I...

480
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,780
Why would I like him?

481
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,950
Okay, fine.

482
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,300
Here is your pay.

483
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,850
70 yuan?

484
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,610
B-Boss, did you give us too much?

485
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,970
Just take it if the boss gives you too much.

486
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,589
I didn't give you too much.

487
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,940
Didn't you lose your money?

488
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,399
I believe that this 50 yuan is not enough for you guys to spend.

489
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,970
So I gave you an extra 20 yuan.

490
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,159
You haven't had dinner, right?

491
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,189
I've prepared a few servings of fried rice.

492
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,870
Consider it as my treat. Hurry and go eat.

493
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,939
- Thank you, Boss!
- Thank you, Boss!

494
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:11,090
You're welcome. Go eat!

495
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,760
Let's go.

496
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,590

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,709
Hello! Hello!

501
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,440
Congratulations, Sister Ding.

502
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,980
Your son has a promising fortune.

503
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,949
- A letter of Admission?
- Jiangzhou University.

504
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,709
Hurry! Hurry and open it!
<i>[To: Cheng Lang]

506
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,740

- That's great!

507
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,709
Let me see how the letter of admission from Jiangzhou University looks like.

508
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,659
Also, congratulations to both of you, too.

509
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,230
- Is there even one for us?
- Yes.

510
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,870
Xia Xiaoju?
<i>[To: Xia Xiaoju]

511
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,519
My Xia Xiaoju got accepted!

512
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,949
Good things keep coming.

513
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,069
Okay then. I'll leave you guys to it.

514
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,159
I still have things to do so I'll be going now.

515
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,309
- Okay.
- Thank you, Xiao Yang.

516
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,710
You're welcome!

That's excellent!

520

Even though it's a second major,

521
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,559
it's still Jiangzhou University.

Oh no, something's wrong.

528
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,759
What's going on?

529
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Is there something wrong with your Shiyi's Letter of Admission?

530
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,360
The issue is big.
