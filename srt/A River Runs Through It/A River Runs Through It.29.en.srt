Well, she's sleeping right now.

Maybe I can write your story into my novel.

- Hi, Classmate, your hat looks nice.
- Thank you.

79
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,500
- Where did you buy it?
- I bought it at an amusement park.

80
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,159
It's so sunny.

81
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,959
It is. Do you want to borrow it?

No, thanks.

Th-Thank you.

85
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,460
Don't you have anything to say to me?

86
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,619
Datu, can you let me think more about it?

87
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,180
Fine.

88
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,960
I won't rush you and give you some time.

89
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,789
But I just want to let you know that

90
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,380
if I keep being timid and afraid to confess my love to you,

91
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,740
I'll never be able to get together with you.

92
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,280
I'll try my best to let you accept me.

93
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,109
Go to class first.

94
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:25,900
- How about I walk you there?
- No need.

95
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,380
What happened?

96
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,379
Le Tao.

97
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,580
Who bought so many snacks and flowers to woo you?

98
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,909
Why doesn't anyone buy me these things?

99
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,439
Besides only hanging out with us and attending classes every day, all you do is stay in your dorm

100
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,959
reading and writing novels.

101
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,819
How can others woo you?

102
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,759
- Well...
- Stop being envious.

103
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,639
They're not mine.

104
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,059
Chang Le left the flowers at the dorm manager's downstairs

105
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,259
to give to Xiaoju.

106
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,260
And Shiyi asked me to bring these snacks upstairs to share with everyone.

107
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,459
For us?

108
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,960
Let me see what he bought.

109
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,620
But why would Lu Shiyi suddenly buy us snacks?

110
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,519
Gui Xiaoling.

111
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,839
You've read so many love stories before,

112
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,940
and you can't even guess why?

113
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,709
I knew a long time ago that he likes our Xiaoju.

114
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,109
I didn't think he'd be this "patient."
<i>(Said with sarcasm)</i>

115
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,439
He just has to wait until someone else woos Xiaoju before he makes his move.

116
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,039
Buying us these snacks is probably him trying to bribe us

117
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,909
to put in some good words for him.

118
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,439
But we don't know what Xiaoju's thinking.

119
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,200
So should we help him or not?

120
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,900
I think Lu Shiyi is not bad.

121
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,559
It's just putting in some good words for him.

122
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,669
It's not like we're forcing Xiaoju to like him.

123
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,380
Anyway, I'm willing to help by putting in some good words for him.

124
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,400
Le Tao, what do you think?

125
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,809
Let's eat first, we'll talk about it later.

126
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:05,399
You're right. Let's eat first then talk about it later.

127
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,639
I'll eat a snow cookie.
<i>(T/N: Arare rice crackers made of glutinous rice.) </i>

128
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,980
Sisters, I'm back!

129
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,180
Xiaoju, hurry and come here to eat some snacks.

130
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,399
Who bought them?

131
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,199
So many!

132
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,789
- QQ Candy!
- I like this one!

133
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,980
It's Lu Shiyi.

134
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,400
What about the flowers?

135
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Look at it yourself.

136
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,400
<i>[Meeting you is the most beautiful accident. - Chang Le]</i>

137
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,400
I think Lu Shiyi is quite a good person.

138
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,000
- He's generous.
- That's right!

139
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
And he looks quite handsome.

140
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
Lu Shiyi made it onto the list of the handsome guys last time.

141
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
I saw it! I saw it!

142
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,800
Even he can get on the list!

143
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you blind?

144
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,600
Xiaoju, although Lu Shiyi always goes against you,

145
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,300
you have to admit he's quite handsome.

146
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,400
If it wasn't because he always has the same stiff expression towards other girls,

147
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
he might even be more popular than Cheng Lang.

148
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,000
What about him having a stiff expression?

149
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,300
At least he's generous and loyal to friends.

150
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,800
He's much better than those who are more promiscuous.

151
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
- Xiaoju, am I right?
- Is that right, Xiaoju?

152
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,100
That's right, Xiaoju!

153
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,600
Oh my goodness.

154
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,800
Have some moral integrity, all right?

155
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,400
You only had a few of the snacks and you already praised him that much?

156
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Xiaoju.

157
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,400
Now that there are Chang Le

158
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,600
and Lu Shiyi.

159
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600

160
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Who will you choose?

161
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,400
Which one will you choose?

162
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,000
Neither of them!

163
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,800
I don't want to have a relationship without an ending before my graduation.

164
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
I also don't want to break up after graduation,

165
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
so don't ask me about it again.

166
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,400
I'm about to be annoyed to death!

167
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,600
Xia Xiaoju, what you said just now really creates hatred.

168
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,800
The campus' two male gods are chasing after you.

169
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,400
And you're feeling annoyed?

170
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,800
My dear girls.

171
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,600
There are so many things to do! Hurry and get back to work. Get back to work!

172
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,700
Hurry and get back to work.

173
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,400
Get back to work.

174
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,200
<i>Chang Le, thank you for liking me,</i>

175
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,600
<i>but I don't have any thoughts of getting into a relationship at the moment.</i>

176
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,100
<i>It's better for us to stay as classmates.</i>

177
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,000
<i>Datu, I didn't refuse you explicitly that day</i>

178
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,600
<i>because I was afraid</i>

179
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,400
<i>that I'd lose you as a friend.</i>

180
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,000
<i>I hope that we can be good friends forever.</i>

181
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,800
<i>Please don't misunderstand,</i>

182
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,400
<i>and please don't do these kinds of nonsense again.</i>

183
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,900
<i>Girls like guys who are elegant, gentle, and polite.</i>

184
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,600
<i>How can she like you when you're hostile towards her?</i>

185
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,000
Elegant, gentle, and caring.

186
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,500
Am I to become Cheng Lang?

187
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,500
Lin You.

188
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,399
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
I still want to stay here

190
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,200
to improve the algorithm of the shopping platform.

191
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,100
Although the internet will develop slowly domestically these next few years,

192
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,200
I think that online shopping will become a big trend,

193
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,800
so I want to work it out first.

194
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
If you want to go abroad...

195
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,000
Me persuading you to go abroad wasn't because I wanted to go abroad.

196
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,639
It's because I really think that the internet structure abroad

197
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,879
is more beneficial towards advancing your future career.

198
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,700
Don't be mad.

199
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,700
I'm more wronged than Dou'E.
<i>(T/N: A play about a girl who was unjustly executed by a rejected suitor and corrupt official.)</i>

200
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,400
That's not what I mean.

201
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,800
How did I wrong you?

202
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,400
What I meant was that I wanted to consider it from your point of view.

203
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Think about it. Studying abroad can be really beneficial for your dancing career.

204
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
I really support it.

205
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,600
You... really support me studying abroad?

206
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,200
Of course!

207
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Think about it. You finally have something that you want to do.

208
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,300
I won't keep you with me selfishly.

209
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,500
I also think that you're really an internet genius.

210
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,800
I also believe that you can change the future of the internet.

211
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,000
Why do I feel like after hearing your words,

212
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,000
you want me to date a computer?

213
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,600
I think it's not a bad idea.

214
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Maybe it could be a business opportunity.

215
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,800
Is everything in your eyes money?

216
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,800
<i>You'll be fine if you wear this to your interview.</i>

217
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,400
Xiaoju! Le Tao.

218
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,300
Look at me! What do you think of this?

219
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,600
She has an interview tomorrow.

220
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
It looks pretty good.

221
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,200
<i>I don't think that chasing after you is a boring thing.</i>

222
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,000
<i>Also, are you planning to avoid me forever?</i>

223
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,400
<i>If you have anything to say in the future, say it face to face.</i>

224
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,800
<i>[CL, I like you.]</i>

225
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,400
Xiaoju...

226
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,400
This is...

227
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
No, Taotao. Don't misunderstand this.

228
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
I've really already given up on Cheng Lang.

229
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
The reason why I'm writing this

230
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
is to get Datu to give up.

231
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,500
He knows that I liked Cheng Lang.

232
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,800
To be honest,

233
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,400
I think Shiyi is a nice person.

234
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,000
Do you really have no feelings for him?

235
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,600
I also think he's a nice person.

236
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,000
But whenever I think about us becoming lovers,

237
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I just... I just... I become extremely awkward.

238
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,700
I analyzed it rationally.

239
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,800
The most basic reason is that I really don't like him.

240
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,600
We can be only friends, not lovers.

241
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,200
So I don't want to give him any hope.

242
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,600
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Datu.</i>

243
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,200
Do you still have the tape I recorded for you?

244
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,600
Yes! It has always been in my drawer.

245
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
<i>I suddenly want to listen to it.</i> Can you bring it over here?

246
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
<i>I'm at the library's self study room.</i>

247
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,000
Okay, wait for me. I'll be right there.

248
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,400
Why did you suddenly want to listen to the tape?

249
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,700
<i>[CL, I like you.]</i>

250
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,050
Shiyi.

251
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,800
Shiyi.

252
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,000
I... suddenly feel thirsty. Can you buy me a bottle of water?

253
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,900
Fine.

254
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,100
Aren't you being too cruel to Shiyi by doing this?

255
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,200
In order to get him to give up on me, this is the only way.

256
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,100
CL, I like you?

257
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,700
Xiaoju, who's CL?

258
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,600
CL is... that...

259
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,300
CL...

260
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,300
It should be the initials of a boy, right?

261
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,000
Is it someone we all know?

262
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,600
I-I just wrote it aimlessly.

263
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,900
CL is me.

264
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,200
My English name is Cooper.

265
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,500
Full name is Cooper Lu. The initials are CL.

266
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,000
Is it cool?

267
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,700
Cool. Cool.

268
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
You guys...

269
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,700
We're together.

270
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,419
Xiaoju, is that true?

271
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,019
When was this? Why haven't you told me?

272
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:22,499
We just got together.

273
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,940
She's too shy to tell you. Right?

274
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,520
That's right. We just got together.

275
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,120
We didn't have time to tell you guys yet.

276
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,000
Then... Lin You, we shouldn't stay here and be third wheels.

277
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,359
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

278
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,829
Since when were they together?

279
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,530
How long have they been together? They kept it a tight secret for so long.

280
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,339
What are you doing?

281
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,940
Give it to me.

282
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,000
What do you want with it?

283
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,939
Didn't you write this so I could see it?

284
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,939
But it's all right.

285
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,200
From now on, I am CL.

286
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,640
You...

287
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,520
<i>Didn't you write this so I could see it?</i>

288
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,589
<i>But it's all right.</i>

289
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,760
<i>From now on, I am CL.</i>

290
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,620
Stop! Stop.

291
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,500
What should I do?

292
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,119
Things are becoming more and more complicated,

293
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,419
you know?

294
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,519
Luckily, Shiyi responded very fast.

295
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,639
If Lin You really found out who CL is,

296
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,679
then that would be truly troublesome.

297
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,259
But the point now is that

298
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,339
Lin You thinks I'm going out with Datu.

299
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,879
She will definitely tell Cheng Lang.

300
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,120
By then, everyone will think that we're dating. Then...

301
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,420
I...

302
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,039
You're now in a dilemma.
<i>(T/N: Lit. riding a tiger and finding it hard to dismount.)</i>

303
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,069
The only thing you can do right now is to pretend to be dating him.

304
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,039
Act as lovers in front of Lin You and Cheng Lang.

305
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,480
- Act as lovers?
- Yes.

306
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,999
How?

307
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,179
Just act like how other couples date.

308
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,899
Haven't you seen it?

309
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,759
You guys must act realistically.

310
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,500
You can't let them find flaws.

311
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,420
<i>Datu, do you want to eat some chips?</i>

312
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,000
<i>You should be feeding me chips like this.</i>

313
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,400
No! I can't act like that!

314
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,559
It's too disgusting!

315
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,799
Think it over again.

316
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,519
Try to imagine some beautiful scenes.

317
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,159
- Beautiful!
- Beautiful?

318
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,220
Try to think of it.

319
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,780
<i>The male lead in this movie is really touching.</i>

320
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,460
<i>How can he be so pitiful?</i>

321
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,010
<i>I don't allow you to cry for other men.</i>

322
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,270
<i>You can only cry for me in the future.</i>

323
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,919
<i>No. I won't let you cry.</i>

324
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,380
<i>I want you to be happy every day.</i>

325
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,500
It's not beautiful at all!

326
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,980
No, no! I really can't act it out!

327
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,960
I'll go and tell him tomorrow. I'm not going to act it out.

328
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,320
<i>[Male Dormitory Building No. 29]</i>

329
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,040
Come in.

330
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,059
Why did you come find me this early in the morning?

331
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,739
Lin You will be practicing in the dance studio this afternoon.

332
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,879
Let's act in front of her again at that time.

333
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,079
Let's act like we're fighting. The kind as if we're going to break up, okay?

334
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,399
How can a couple break up just after being together?

335
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,469
I refuse.

336
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,159
Datu, take it as me begging you, all right?

337
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,959
I've thought about it for a whole night last night.

338
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,079
I don't think it's suitable for us to pretend to be lovers no matter how I think about it.

339
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,379
I agree.

340
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,519
Right?

341
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,900
- Since you don't think it's suitable either—
- I think it's better if we officially date.

342
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,799
Datu! I'm already annoyed enough as is!

343
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,230
Let's act it out one last time. One last time, all right?

344
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,709
Just give it up.

345
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,339
I definitely won't act like I'm breaking up with you.

346
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,260
If you want to act, then we'll act like real lovers.

347
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,589
You're not willing to cooperate, is that it? Then I'll act it out myself!

348
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,159
At that time, I'll tell them it's boring to be with you

349
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,949
so I'm dumping you unilaterally.

350
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,759
If you dare say that you dumped me,

351
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,280
then I'll tell Lin You that CL is Cheng Lang.

352
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,580
You!

353
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,620
I'm your boyfriend right now.

354
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,480
There's nothing else to talk about except love between the two of us.

355
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,520
Unreasonable!

356
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,460
<i>[Gym]</i>

357
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,999
Shiyi.

358
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,379
Didn't you say that your girlfriend would come today and watch you play ball?

359
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,839
Why hasn't she come?

360
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,159
Don't listen to him brag.

361
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,779
I've played with him for four years but I've never seen him have a girlfriend.

362
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,300
We just got together, okay?

363
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,270
Fine.

364
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,359
Then tell me who your girlfriend is.

365
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,220
So mysterious.

366
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,680
That's my girlfriend.

367
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,420
- Really?
- Wait, no...

368
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,299
Xia Xiaoju! Come over here!

369
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:32,240
Watch me play basketball and cheer me on.

370
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,819
Did you call me over here just to cheer you on?

371
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,439
Are you that bored? I'm busy!

372
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:39,920
How can you be busy?

373
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,760
Xia Xiaoju!

374
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,980
Shiyi...Your girlfriend... is quite capricious.

375
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,719
Nonsense.

376
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,400
Xia Xiaoju! Slow down.

377
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,109
Xia Xiaoju!

378
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,060
You didn't give me any face just now!

379
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,090
They'll make fun of me behind my back with you being like this.

380
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,320
You didn't have good intentions so why are you blaming me for not giving you face?

381
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,429
What do you mean I didn't have good intentions?

382
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,679
Do you dare to say that you didn't tell your friends I'm your girlfriend?

383
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,399
Didn't you tell me to act?

384
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,799
So I thought to practice in front of them first.

385
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,120
In case we expose ourselves in front of Lin You and Cheng Lang. Right?

386
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,660
We only need to act in front Lin You and Cheng Lang in the future.

387
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,709
We don't need to in front of others.

388
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,709
No, I like to act.

389
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,829
If you want me to stop acting,

390
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,429
then you just need to agree to officially be my girlfriend.

391
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,019
You're pestering me unreasonably!

392
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,230
- Where are you going?
- Library.

393
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,900
Then I'll... I'll go with you!

394
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,829
When other girls go to the library,

395
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,679
they have their boyfriends accompany them, tutor them, and help them with homework.

396
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,219
I'll accompany you, all right?

397
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,419
- I'll go and change my clothes.
- I refuse! I don't need it!

398
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,720
Xia Xiaoju.

399
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,439
If you don't cooperate with me,

400
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,999
it'll be very easy for us to let it slip in front of Lin You and Cheng Lang.

401
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,559
Think about it carefully.

402
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,599
If we let it slip, then so be it.

403
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,099
I don't want to act it out anymore anyways.

404
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,659
- How could you be like this?
- What did I do?

405
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,099
- Didn't you say it yourself?
- Xiaoju!

406
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,600
Shiyi!

407
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,800
Lin You, I want to tell you something!

408
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,100
Wait!

409
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,859
Actually...

410
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,640
Didn't you want to go to the library? Let's go.

411
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,240
I almost forgot about it. All right, let's go.

412
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,279
- Then we're leaving now. Bye bye!
- Bye bye.

413
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,900
- Didn't you say you had something to tell me? What's the matter with Xia Xiaoju?
- Do you want a beating?

414
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,000
We both think that...

415
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,800
Cheng Lang really, really likes you.

416
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,439
Of course, I do. No need to say it out.

417
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,679
We have to leave now.

418
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,759
- Don't pinch me! You pinch me again and I'll tell them!
- I'll pinch you!

419
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,399
- The way they date is really special.
- If you pinch me again—

420
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,100
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

421
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,839
These two idiots are always like this.

422
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,580
I've grown accustomed to it.

423
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,120
Let's go.
