Cheng Lang, what exactly is going on?

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why would Lin You suddenly disappear?

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,200
I was in the computer lab with her this afternoon.

6
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,000
Then she let me listen to the CD she had just bought.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I fell asleep while listening to it.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,400
And then... And then when I woke up, she was gone!

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
She must be mad at me.

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
What was there to be angry about?

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
You must be overthinking it.

12
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,400
You wouldn't understand it even if I explained it to you.

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
Xiaoju, let me ask you.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
If you share your favorite thing with me,

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,400
and I fall asleep, would you be angry?

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,700
I'd...

17
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,799
I'd probably feel sad.

18
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,400
See? She'd be sad.

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Isn't that worse than being mad?

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,300
What does it matter if she's mad or sad?

21
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,000
She'll go to class tomorrow.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,300
You can go to class tomorrow and tell her.

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,600
Explain it to her. Won't that solve it?

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,800
But what we're discussing now isn't... It's not about this problem.

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,700
We prepared so many surprises for her up on the mountain.

26

We all agreed to celebrate New Year's Eve together.

Now, wouldn't our efforts all be in vain?

- Didn't I use to always celebrate New Year's Eve with you?

31

- Now that you have Lin You, you don't need me to celebrate it with you anymore. Is that what you mean?
- I-I...

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,600
- That's not what I mean.
- Then what do you mean?

Did you had a performance tonight?

Yes, didn't I leave you a note?

Did you know?

148
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,400
I do!

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,600
Cheng Lang cares so much about Lin You.

150
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,600
He's so worried just because he fell asleep

while listening to the song.

152
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,800
He's afraid Lin You would be angry.

153
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
He would never care about me the same way.

154

Do you know?

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,400
I've known Cheng Lang for such a long time.

156
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,700
He's typically a confident person when doing things.

157
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,600
It's really my first time seeing him so flustered.

158
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,000
That's because he has face paralysis, so he can't make expressions.

159

Why do you always have such a venomous mouth?

It's because you're such a crybaby.

163
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,500
I just transferred there and didn't know anyone.

164
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,100
You're the only one who bullied me.

165
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
Of course, I'd cry.

166
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
That...

167
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,800
That was because when we first met,

168
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
you burned my bottom.

169
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Anyone in my place would... Who wouldn't... Right?

170
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,400
Anyway... Anyway, Cheng Lang was the first one

171
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
in the class who treated me nicely.

172
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,800
Not only did he tutor me on my homework,

173
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,400
he also protected me when I was in danger.

174
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,900
Is that why you like him?

175
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,900
Then... a few months ago,

176
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,400
I also helped you with your Advanced Mathematics.

177
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,400
I also helped you change majors, right?

178
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,800
You can come to me if you are in danger.

179
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,600
I can protect you, too.

180
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,500
Why must you go to him?

181
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,000
Because I thought he liked me, too.

182
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,500
In the past, Taotao and I read it in a magazine.

183
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,800
There was a list saying what would a boy do

184
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,400
if he has a crush on a girl.

185
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,200
He was a perfect match.

186
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,800
So I liked him and thought he liked me, too.

187
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,200
I wanted to be like Taotao and bravely confess to him.

188
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:11,400
But later on, I found out that he doesn't like me.

189
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,700
Then stop liking him.

190
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,400
I wish I could.

191
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,300
Since the day I found out he liked Lin You,

192
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,000
I kept telling myself, "Let it go."

193
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,000
After such a long time,

194
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,500
I still wasn't able to do it.

195
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,400
I decided that today is the last time I'll cry.

196
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,200
Then I'll completely move on from Cheng Lang.

197
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,400
I even helped him decorate the place so beautifully yesterday.

198
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
I told him that

199
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,800
he must succeed.

200
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,300
I really wished for them to be together.

201
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,200
Come with me.

We're not in a hurry.

220
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,300
Hold on tightly or else we won't be able to make it.

221
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,400

I'll lend you my shoulder for free tonight.

Stop crying.

230

It's so beautiful!

231
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
We didn't make it.

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,800
Sorry.

233
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,600
I should have ridden faster.

Isn't today your first time leading tourists? You can't be late.

I'm running late! Let's go.

- Let's hurry and go. Let's go together.

Chang Le?

281
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,159
I was just looking for you.

282
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,759
I want to talk to you about the graduation party.

283

Can we do that tomorrow?

284
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,429
I was just assigned a tourist group.

285
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,940
We'll leave in one hour.

286
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,069
Okay, tomorrow then.

287
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,999
The main point is that it's my first time leading a tour.

288
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,429
I don't know if I could do it well.

289
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,589
Don't worry.

290
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,870
You'll definitely do well.

291
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,309
All right. I'll get going now. I'm in a hurry.

292
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,679
Hey, wait a moment.

293
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,799
I'll take you there.

294
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,250
It's faster than going on foot.

295
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,879
I'd feel bad about it.

296
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,120
What is there to feel bad about?

297
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,519
We're classmates. We should help each other.

298
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,920
Come on.

299
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,560
Hurry or else you won't make it in time.

300
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,270
All right then.

301
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,189
- Are you ready?
- Yes. Thank you.

302
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,690
It's okay.

303
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,480
How's the injury from last time?

304
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,759
Nearly recovered.

305
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:39,230
I should be able to practice like normal again.

306
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,189
So tiresome.

307
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,229
There's nothing we can do about it.

308
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,310
Senior Sister, Senior Brother is looking for you.

309
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,349
I thought you were busy.

310
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,759
The new function of the school's website just went live.

311
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,559
So I will be very free for the next few days.

312
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,349
So that's why I had the time to especially come here and accompany you.

313
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,039
Really?

314
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,229
That's great!

315
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,729
I won't have to drag Xiaoju to have meals with me every day.

316
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:11,709
All right then.

317
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,309
Carry on with your practice.

318
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,520
- I'll treat you to a feast later.
- Then I'm going back to practice.

319
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,760
- Go ahead.
- See you tonight.

320
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,159
Just drop me off here.

321
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,760
We've arrived.

322
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,469
I'm going now.

323
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,460
Sure.

324
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,990
I'll pick you up for dinner tonight. Be good.

325
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:03,440
What are you looking at?

326
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,000
Nothing.

327
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,419
- Brother Hu!
- Here you are.

328
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:13,609
Here's the tourist list.

329
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:14,799
Two tourists haven't arrived yet.

330
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,279
Wait for them here.

331
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,580
- Two people haven't arrived yet?
- That's right.

332
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,080
Okay.

333
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,919
Hello, everyone.

334
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm your tour guide, Xia Xiaoju.

335
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,309
How is it?

336
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,600
Two people haven't arrived yet.

337
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,829
<i>[Lu Shiyi]</i>

338
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,950
Lu Shiyi?

339
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,399
How can someone have the same name as Datu?

340
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,910
It can't be him, right?

341
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,539
It really is you!

342
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:49,829
Why did you sign up for this tour?

343
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,159
It's your first time leading a tour today.

344
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,980
I'm here to take a look.

345
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,809
For what? To see if I'd screw this up?

346
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:57,340
That's right.

347
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,589
Did you sign up for this tour, too?

348
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,559
No.

349
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,590
I just brought Xiaoju here.

350
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,459
Xiaoju, is there anything else I can help you with?

351
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:09,829
I think that should be all.

352
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,279
Chang Le, thank you for just now.

353
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,829
It's nothing. Why are you being so polite about it?

354
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,180
We're friends.

355
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,039
Qian Hongling hasn't arrived yet.

356
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,370
I'll ask around.

357
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,399
Excuse me.

358
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:29,639
I want to ask everyone here.

359
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,819
Does anyone know Qian Hongling?

360
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:33,579
- No idea.
- I don't know her.

361
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:35,799
Miss, is this the tourist bus to World Studios?

362
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,559
That's right. Are you Qian Hongling?

363
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,500
- I am.
- Great!

364
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,760
- Allow me, Auntie.
- I'll do it.

365
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,410
Xia Xiaoju, is that a tourist?

366
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,380
Let's go, Auntie. Be careful.

367
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,350
Mind your step. You can sit there.

368
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,879
Let's go, let's go! Hurry, hurry up!

369
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:01,080
I'm getting on then. Chang Le, thank you.

370
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,759
- Everybody's here.
- Wait a moment. Let me lock my bike.

371
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,949
I'll go with you.

372
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,279
No, there's no need.

373
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,999
Maybe next time. There are no more seats.

374
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,349
Thank you for bringing Xiaoju here.

375
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,850
Bye bye.

376
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,800
What's wrong?

377
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,639
Offering unsolicited hospitality,

378
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,839
he must be harboring evil intentions.

379
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,309
What nonsense are you talking about?

380
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,949
He's being kind hearted.

381
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,450
Kind hearted?

382
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,470
I'm the kind hearted one, all right?

383
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,829
Oh, that's right. In order to make my tour unique,

384
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:38,999
I have an idea.

385
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,760
Be sure to play along in a bit.

386
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,879
What idea?

387
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
You'll find out later.

388
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,040
It's starting! It's starting!

389
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,430
Say your lines! Hurry up!

390
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,000
Chengcheng.
<i>(T/N: From The Bund, a famous Hong Kong movie)</i>

391
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,159
When I first arrived in Shanghai,

392
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,520
you once told me that...

393
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,759
You told me that we could go to France together.

394
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,820
Xu Wenqiang, you're too selfish!

395
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,950
When I asked you to come with me to France,

396
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,779
you said you wanted to get revenge. Now that you have,

397
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,279
- you want—
- Chengcheng.

398
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,829
Can you please give me another chance?

399
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,000
That's not fair.

400
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,679
When there are two options in front of you,

401
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,229
you can't choose both.

402
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,559
Just one chance. Just once.

403
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,830
No way. You don't deserve it.

404
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,110
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

405
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,950
Thank you, everyone! Thank you, everyone!

406
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,759
Listen up, everyone.

407
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,589
I've already introduced the scenic spots to you.

408
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,309
The rest is free time for everyone.

409
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,019
You can walk around freely in this place.

410
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:12,279
We'll gather at the bus by 5:00 p.m.

411
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,879
- All right!
- Sure.

412
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,009
- You may enjoy your free time.
- All right.

413
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:17,309
Take care.

414
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,540
Everyone, be careful!

415
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,080
So tired.

416
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,370
You're not bad at acting.

417
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,419
Come on, let's go. Let's go and take a rest.

418
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:32,429
Go without me.

419
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,769
I'll go over there and buy some beverages. Wait for me over there.

420
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:36,260
Go.

421
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,309
Stop running.

422
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,830
There are sugar figurines over there! I want one!

423
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,340
- How is it?
- Boss, how much is this?
<i>[Sugar Figurines]</i>

424
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,940
Thirty minutes.

425
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,310
Here you are.

426
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,700
You're quite the gentleman!

427
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,720
I've always been a gentleman, Chengcheng.

428
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,679
Are you not done acting?

429
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,360
Who was it that was reluctant to act just now?

430
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,469
But thinking about it, your plan worked out very well.

431
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,709
Have tourists wearing costumes while visiting World Studios.

432
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,720
It's a much more immersive experience.

433
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
This is a pretty good idea.

434
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,360
- For real?
- Yes.

435
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,360
It's really rare to get a compliment from Datu.

436
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,190
I suddenly feel like I'm awesome.

437
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,159
Tired already?

438
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,919
You're so weak!

439
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,949
Even an elderly person is better than you!

440
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,469
In order for me to be familiar with the route,

441
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,559
I already walked all over the place twice yesterday.

442
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,919
Of course, I'm tired.

443
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,680
How could you say that?

444
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,160
You don't have to go all out.

445
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,159
No way.

446
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,039
Firstly, I must do it well.

447
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,469
To avoid any mistakes.

448
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,159
Secondly, I want to make money.

449
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,069
It's so hard to make money.

450
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,499
I want to start my own travel agency in the future.

451
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,950
I don't want to work for other people <i>(as an employee)</i>.

452
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,880
Little money-grubber.

453
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,160
Are you hungry? I'm starving!

454
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,279
It's still early, and you're already starving.

455
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,639
Didn't you have lunch before we departed?

456
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,829
I was in a hurry so I forgot to eat.

457
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,069
Then sit here and wait for me.

458
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,770
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

459
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,460
What a mess!

460
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,570
Flatbread! Selling flatbread!

461
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,189
- I'll have one, Boss.
- All right, Sir.

462
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,159
- Two yuan, right?
- Yes.

463
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,130
I'll leave the money here.

464
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,539
All right, thank you.

465
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:31,540
Here you go, enjoy!

466
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,550
Tour Guide!

467
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,949
How can I help you, Grandpa?

468
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,399
Where's the restroom?

469
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Restroom?

470
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,460
- Wait a second.
- Okay.

471
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,710
The restroom, right?

472
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,039
Come over here. The restroom... Do you see that path over there?

473
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,939
Follow this path, go straight, then turn left, and you'll get there.

474
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:20,940
- Thanks.
- No problem.

475
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,229
Excuse me, where's the cinema?

476
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:25,130
- The cinema?
- Right.

477
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,780
From here, turn left, then go straight, and you'll see it.

478
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,469
- Thank you! Thanks.
- Thanks!
- Goodbye.

479
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,270
Let's go.

480
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,100
You're up.

481
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,910
How did I fell asleep?

482
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,629
Did anyone come looking for me?

483
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,459
No one came looking for you, but you snored.

484
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,710
It was especially loud.

485
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,869
That's impossible!

486
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,499
I've never snored before.

487
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:46,600
- You've wronged me.
- I was just kidding.

488
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,269
Here. Hurry and eat it.

489
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:50,970
It'll be cold in a bit.

490
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,999
- And there is flatbread.
- Thank you!

491
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,869
Tasty!

492
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,770
Hurry and eat. It's about time to gather.

493
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,629
Hurry, hurry! Let's go! Let's go!

494
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,630
Let's go! Hurry up and go!

495
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,060
Did everyone have fun?

496
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,079
Yes!

497
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,419
Please be careful.

498
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:18,220
Watch your step.

499
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,850
That's not right.

500
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,709
Oh my goodness!

501
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,869
- Datu!
- What is it?

502
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,030
- There are two people missing!
- What?

503
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,960
Zhang Jie?

504
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,160
- Zhou Shimiao?
- Zhou Shimiao?

505
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,980
Zhang Jie?

506
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,320
- Zhang Jie?
- Zhou Shimiao?

507
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,260
<i>Zhang Jie?</i>

508
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,630
<i>Zhou Shimiao?</i>

509
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,980
Zhou Shimiao!

510
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,950
Zhang Jie?

511
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,530
Zhou Shimiao? Zhang Jie?

512
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,229
Zhou Shimiao! Zhang—

513
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:22,559
How is it?

514
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,660
Have you found them yet?

515
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,429
What should we do? We couldn't find them!

516
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:29,279
It's all right. Don't be too anxious.

517
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,189
How about we go back to the bus and take a look.

518
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,319
Maybe they're on the bus now.

519
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,820
Come on.

520
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,460
Hold on.

521
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,399
Hello, Brother Hu? Are they back yet?

522
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,440
Okay, all right then. We'll keep searching.

523
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,359
How is it?

524
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,669
Brother Hu said that the others are tired of waiting.

525
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,000
They rushed him to head back to Jiangzhou.

526
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,600
He wants us to stay here to continue searching for them.

527
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,429
What should I do? This...

528
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,869
It's okay. I'm here with you.

529
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,599
Why don't we take a look over there?

530
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,709
We haven't checked there.

531
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:05,910
Don't be too anxious. Let's go.

532
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,949
Zhou Shimiao?

533
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,280
- Zhou Shimiao?
- Zhang Jie?

534
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,150
- Zhou Shimiao!
- Zhou Shimiao!

535
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,040
- Zhang Jie?
- Zhou Shimiao?

536
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,320
- Zhang Jie!
- Zhang Jie!

537
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,520
- Zhou Shimiao!
- Zhou Shimiao!

538
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,759
- Zhou Shimiao.
- Zhang Jie.

539
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,060
Zhang Jie.

540
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,799
- Zhou Shimiao.
- Zhou Shimiao.

541
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,000
Zhang Jie!

542
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,799
Zhang Jie?

543
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,790
Datu, what should we do now?

544
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,149
We still haven't found them yet. This is my first time leading a tour.

545
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:52,270
How could I report to the company if they're missing?

546
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,119
Don't worry.

547
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,610
The travel agency has already called the police.

548
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,559
Even if we couldn't find them, the police will find them. Right?

549
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,709
Stop crying.

550
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,870
Have some water.

551
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,469
Hello, Brother Hu?

552
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,140
I still haven't—

553
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,040
What? Are they back?

554
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:25,519
Wait, what happened? What's going on?

555
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,189
Oh my goodness!

556
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,839
Can you believe it?

557
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,429
They went back on their own after getting lost.

558
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,000
They didn't even contact me to let me know!

559
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,959
I'm so angry! Seriously!

560
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,149
And then?

561
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,280
They called the company just now.

562
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,980
It's good that they're back.

563
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,559
All right, all right. Don't worry anymore.

564
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,119
By the way, the company said that the driver is already off work.

565
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,270
We'll have to think of a way to get back on our own.

566
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,810
It's not a big deal. No problem.

567
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,530
I'm sorry, Datu.

568
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,179
I caused you to run around with me looking for people.

569
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:14,460
Don't apologize.

570
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,290
It just so happens I've never seen World Studios at night.

571
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,390
It looks good.

572
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,420
As long as they're fine.

573
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,630
Look at how they've scared our Xiaoju.

574
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,909
You're originally dumb.

575
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,990
You'll be even dumber after this fright.

576
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,080
Datu,

577
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:47,700
I've realized you've become more and more mature after attending the university.

578
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,559
You've become more and more considerate.

579
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,170
- For real?
- Yes.

580
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,429
So have you.

581
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,520
You've changed a lot, too.

582
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,149
You've become more and more outstanding.

583
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,149
More confident than before.

584
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,920
You really know how to say sweet words now.

585
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,770
No wonder you have so many girls who like you.

586
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:15,560
What's the use of having so many girls liking me?

587
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,340
The one I like...

588
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,270
It's like she'll never turn around and look at me.

589
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,390
You have a crush on someone!

590
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,960
Who is it?

591
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,039
I swear.

592
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,360
I definitely won't reveal the secret.

593
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,299
