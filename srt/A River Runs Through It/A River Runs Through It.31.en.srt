4
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:25,890
Hello, Lin You.

5
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,629
Rather good.

6
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:31,490
Is he talking to his girlfriend?

7
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,990
I don't know.

8
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,410
My mom is doing quite well.

9
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,370
Nowadays, I don't want to interfere with young people's relationships.

10
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,309
Yeah, right. You're only saying it.

11
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,619
- Are you really not in a hurry?
- I'm not in a hurry.

12
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:46,619
He'll naturally bring her back to meet me if he wants to.

13
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,409
I'm in a hurry.

14
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,809
I'm curious as to what kind of girlfriend he has.

15
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,530
You may as well worry about Shiyi.

16
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,219
He's just a little boy! How would he know how to be in a relationship?

17
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,229
He has not even grown up yet!

18
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,000
Auntie Li, how do you know whether Shiyi has not grown up yet?

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,340
Does he have a girlfriend?

20
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,519
Did he tell you? Is she also from your university?

21
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,229
Xiaoju, send some corn to Cheng Lang's and Shiyi's family later.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,669
Mom, it's not like they don't sell it at the market.

23
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,499
Besides, why must we give them corn?

24
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:26,879
Those things aren't even worth much.

25
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,260
Even if they don't worth much, it's still the thought that counts.

26
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,979
Besides, these were grown by your grandparents.

27
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,859
There are no pesticide or fertilizer.

28
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,319
They can eat at ease.

29
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,220
Hurry and send them over.

30
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,960
Ask Shiyi yourself about this.

31
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,519
I'll go and ask him right now!

32
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,410
My stupid boy has grown up!

33
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,960
Are you back?

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,829
Shiyi!

35
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,160
- Mom.
- Shiyi.

36
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,360
Are you in a relationship?

37
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,360
Don't listen to other people talk nonsense.

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,449
Cheng Lang told me. Stop pretending.

39
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,800
Don't listen to his nonsense.

40
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,829
Cheng Lang never talks nonsense.

41
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,749
If he said you are, then it's more than likely you're in a relationship.

42
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:21,529
From which class? What is her name?

43
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:24,299
Is she pretty or not? Is she as tall as me?

44
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,750
What are you talking about?

45
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,959
Hurry and get out of the way. You're blocking me from watching TV.

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,110
If you won't tell me, I'll turn it off.

47
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,659
Give it to me. I'm not!

48
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,390
- Hurry up and tell me!
- What do you want me to say?

49
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,979
Who's there?

50
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,599
Uncle, Auntie.

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,990
Xiaoju, hurry and come in!

52
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,850
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

53
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,130
My mom asked me to bring you some corn. My grandparents grew them

54
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,759
with no pesticide. These are especially sweet.

55
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,290
- Okay, put it over there.
- Okay.

56
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,790
Mom.

57
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,670
She's my girlfriend,

58
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,430
but we already broke up.

59
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,950
That's great!

60
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,409
How can you have broken up?

61
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:36,069
I think that the both of you are quite a pair!

62
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,870
Is it true?

63
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,999
No...

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's fake.

65
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,349
I'm just joking with you, Mom.

66
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:47,250
She's not my girlfriend.

67
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,669
Yes, that's right. It's fake, Auntie.

68
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,849
It's fake.

69
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:55,390
Shiyi, is this something you can joke about?

70
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,499
I was just about to say.

71
00:04:57,499 --> 00:05:01,100
How could I not have realized it if you guys were together?

72
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,010
Auntie, then I'll just leave the things here and go now.

73
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,700
Look.

74
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,830
I'm leaving, Auntie!

75
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,149
It hurts.

76
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:32,590
Have you gone crazy? Playing this joke on me!

77
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,219
- Xiaoju.
- Huh?

78
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,020
Auntie.

79
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,960
<i>Perhaps you're afraid you'll start liking me?</i>

80
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,019
<i>During this time, I thought you finally took the first step towards me.</i>

81
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,670
<i>It seems like it was just my wishful thinking.</i>

82
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,600
<i>Why does my heart feel uncomfortable?</i>

83
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,389
<i>Xia Xiaoju, it was you who insisted on breaking up.</i>

84
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,319
<i>Now that Datu agreed,</i>

85
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,880
<i>isn't this a good thing?</i>

86
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,859
<i>He's bold enough to make that shot.</i>

87
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,599
<i>Besides Yao Ming, he's also...</i>

88
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,229
You're going to refuse until the end, is that it?

89
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,069
Fine, then don't expect any pocket money from now on.

90
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,909
Don't you know it costs a lot of money to be in a relationship?

91
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,110
Do whatever you like.

92
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,510
Will my tactic of retreating to advance work?

93
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,690
- Cheng Lang?
- Coming.

94
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,350
Take these.

95
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,109
This much? I can't eat them all by myself.

96
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,669
One is for you, and another for your girlfriend.

97
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,139
Thanks, Mom.

98
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,420
<i>[Guanghui Lane]</i>

99
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,979
What's wrong with you two today?

100
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,980
Why aren't you guys saying anything?

101
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,789
We just broke up.

102
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,610
It's a bit awkward for us to talk right now.

103
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,679
Are you kidding me?

104
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,449
I'm not kidding.

105
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,210
Ask her if you don't believe me.

106
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,080
Xiaoju?

107
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,920
Yes.

108
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,959
Forget it. You both always quarrel with each other every few days.

109
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,800
Maybe you'll make up tomorrow.

110
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,710
I'm not joking.

111
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,910
Me neither.

112
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,310
Rise.

113
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,600
Extend your fingers.

114
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,970
Lift your legs. Step back.

115
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,860
Okay, stop.

116
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,669
All right. We'll stop here for today.

117
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:15,069
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks, Senior.

118
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:16,610
You're welcome.

119
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,790
Senior, I heard you got the chance to study abroad as an art exchange student.

120
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,810
We all envy you.

121
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,050
I haven't decided if I'll go or not.

122
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,850
Are you not going?

123
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,950
Are you reluctant to part with Senior Brother?

124
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,680
Senior.

125
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,010
Speak of the devil.

126
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,799
Senior, what delicious food did you bring for her today?

127
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,709
Can we also have a taste?

128
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,149
I intended to bring you guys these anyways.

129
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,199
- Go ahead and take this.
- Thank you, Senior!

130
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,439
Then we'll disappear right away.

131
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,329
We won't disturb you guys. Bye bye!

132
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:55,199
Go ahead and give them food.

133
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,250
If they gain weight, then they'll practice an extra hour every day!

134
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,660
Then... are you going to eat or not?

135
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,350
Yes!

136
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,109
My mom made these pastries.

137
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,290
- Smells good?
- Yes.

138
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,709
As expected, the pastries that Auntie makes are the best.

139
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,319
My mom's dishes are more delicious.

140
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,540
- Next time, come and have dinner at my house.
- All right.

141
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,842
I've been eating the delicious food that Auntie made for me for so long,

142
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:29,129
I haven't even thanked her face to face.

143
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,619
Really? Will you really go home with me?

144
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:36,980
- You don't want me to?
- I do! Of course, I do!

145
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,669
Let me tell you. My mom can make many kinds of dishes.

146
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,669
It's especially delicious.

147
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,149
She'll be very happy if you come home with me.

148
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,150
Here.

149
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,900
Lin You?

150
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,070
What's wrong?

151
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:58,270
I was just thinking of what gift I should bring Auntie when I meet her for the first time.

152
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,559
You're so considerate. She'll be happy as long as you're there.

153
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,209
Here, try the green one.

154
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,810
Okay.

155
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,290
Where is your guitar?

156
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,959
You didn't even bring your guitar.

157
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,029
Let me tell you. A gig was offered to me and I accepted.

158
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:39,469
If you have something to do this week, postpone it.

159
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,879
We need to hurry and rehearse.

160
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,780
Hurry and go fetch your guitars!

161
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,060
I want to quit the band.

162
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,080
M-Me too.

163
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,130
What do you mean?

164
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,180
A company asked me to work as an intern.

165
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,709
I might not have the time to rehearse in the future.

166
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,785
The oral defense of my dissertation is coming up soon.

167
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,690
I won't have time to rehearse as well.

168
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,789
If you guys adjust your schedules and squeeze it in, there's always time.

169
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:15,359
Didn't we agree to continue playing even after graduation? To make a name for ourselves?

170
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:18,980
We've been playing for so many years. Who recognizes us?

171
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,999
This time, the bar that invited us to perform

172
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,340
has many musicians drinking there.

173
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,649
For us, this is a great opportunity! We must seize it!

174
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,109
It's too late.

175
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,879
I'm about to graduate.

176
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,639
I can't afford to gamble on it.

177
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,340
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,220
Are you guys really going to disband the band?

179
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,010
Since you broke up with Qiu Le Tao,

180
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,789
you won't accept or attend any performances.

181
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,349
Remember that graduation party?

182
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,640
After that mess you made?

183
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,039
Actually, it's not us who wanted to disband,

184
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,000
but yourself.

185
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,370
What they said was right.

186
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:28,440
After graduation, I'm just a wandering singer.

187
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,490
Tell me, what did I learn in my four years at the university?

188
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,669
I've learned nothing.

189
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,930
Le Tao broke up with me.

190
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,930
The band disbanded.

191
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,570
I didn't study my major well either.

192
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,120
I have nothing left.

193
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,930
Do you regret it?

194
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,759
How about this? If you're given another chance right now,

195
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,889
to choose between Le Tao and Xu Menglu, who would you choose?

196
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,590
Le Tao.

197
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,950
Of course, I'd choose Le Tao.

198
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,270
Cheers.

Huang Jun, what's your problem?

221
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:47,319
Why are you blocking me?

222
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
I want to talk to you.

223
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,570
Did you write to record companies?

224
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,480
You wrote to record companies many times to recommend my songs, is that right?

225
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,679
Maybe, I can't remember.

226
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,659
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- It's because they never replied to me at that time.

227
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:08,300
I was afraid it'd be a blow to you if I told you.

228
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,660
Now that I think about it, I was too kind at that time.

229
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,909
Taotao, I was wrong. Everything was all my fault. I had a lapse in judgement, Taotao.

230
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,069
Enough!

231
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,919
You've said these words too many times now.

232
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,090
There's no point in saying them again now.

233
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,279
Huang Jun, we've broken up a long time ago. Not only that, but we're about to graduate.

234
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,469
I hope the two of us will never meet again anywhere.

235
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,220
I really don't want to see you again.

236
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,330
Taotao.

237
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,730
Don't you need to rehearse with the Dance Troupe's freshmen this afternoon?

238

Why aren't you heading there yet?

239
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,850
The rehearsal is pretty much done.

240

I don't have to stay there all the time.

Besides, I'm going to study abroad soon.

00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,159
I have a meeting with Professor Liu this afternoon

246
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,999
to discuss the background data processing issue.

247

- But I'm afraid you'll be bored there by yourself.

Why do I find you suddenly especially clingy recently?

251
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,830
I want to always be with you.

252
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,610
Me too.

I'll go shopping with you tonight.

Go ahead.

Remember the time when I brought up breaking up with you?

292
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,000
It was the most disappointing and depressing time for me.

293
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,800
I felt like a loser, unable to give you happiness.

294
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,600
I didn't want to drag you down.

295
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,500
So when you said that you had a girlfriend abroad, it was all a lie?

296
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,000
I thought that was the best for you.

297
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,500
The best for me?

298
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,600
In your eyes, am I such a vain person

299
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,200
who can't share the joys and sorrows with you? Is that it?

300
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,700
I'd always wonder what I did wrong

301
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,600
to make you not like me anymore.

302
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,200
Don't cry.

303
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,800
Hello, Taotao.

304
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,500
Did you buy kebabs?

305
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,900
How do you know me so well?

306
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,700
I was just thinking about eating kebabs!

307
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay, wait for me.

308
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,200
I'll be back soon.

309
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,900
Bye bye.

310
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,800
I don't blame you for breaking up with me,

311
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,000
but in these two long years,

312
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,000
you only cared about your own feelings

313
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,400
instead of caring about my pain.

314
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,600
Even though you've thought it through now, it's too late.

315
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,800
I already have Cheng Lang.

316
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,800
I can't hurt him.

317
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,800
If I had told you all this earlier,

318
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
would you have forgiven me and been with me again?

319
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,200
But you didn't do that.

320
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,600
What are you thinking about?

321
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,400
You're not eating anything.

322
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,800
Are you still thinking about the matter with Shiyi?

323
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,300
Today... I saw Lin You.

324
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,600
Did Lin You find out that CL is Cheng Lang?

325
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,300
No, she hasn't.

326
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
She was with Yuan Ancheng.

327
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,100
Did Yuan Ancheng return?

328
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,000
You... Did you mistake him for someone else?

329
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,600
No, I didn't. It was Yuan Ancheng.

330
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,000
Then should you tell Cheng Lang about it?

331
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,400
Forget it. No, that won't do.

332
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,000
If you tell him, it'll seem like you're tattling against her.

333
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,100
That's right.

334
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,800
If I tell him now, won't it just make trouble for them?

335
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:10,200
Do you think there are still lingering feelings between Lin You and Yuan Ancheng?

336
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
That can't be, right?

337
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,000
Lin You will meet Auntie Ding at Cheng Lang's tomorrow.

338
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,200
Why did Yuan Ancheng come back at this time?

339
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,600
<i>I had a car accident abroad and ruptured my tendon.</i>

340
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,200
<i>I went to many hospitals, but they weren't able to treat it.</i>

341
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,600
What happened to your arm? Let me take a look.

342
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Nothing. It's just a bit sore after playing the piano for a long time.

343
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,300
Don't play it then. I'll help you rub it.

344
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,400
It's okay.

345
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,100
Let's go back to your dorm and grab the silk scar first.

346
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
Then head back home for dinner.

347
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,200
Let's go.

348
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I don't want to go abroad anymore.

349
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
What's wrong?

350
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,400
What happened?

351
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,000
I have to go to such a faraway place.

352
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,600
I don't want to leave you.

353
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,600
I'm afraid... there will be some kind of accident.

354
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,800
Don't worry. It's very safe over there.

355
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Besides, I have classmates over there.

356
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,400
I'll introduce them to you so you guys can look after each other.

357
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,400
Silly girl, I promise to visit you whenever I have time

358
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
and call you every night.

359
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Let's go.

360
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,300
Xiaoju.

361
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,000
Where's Lin You?

362
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Didn't you guys agree to come back together?

363
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,600
She said she wants to go home first to change and will come over later.

364
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
That way, I'll also have time to prepare.

365
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,400
Y-You guys are okay lately, right?

366
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,500
What's wrong? Why ask me this?

367
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
I was just asking.

368
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,200
We're fine.

369
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,400
You two must be fine.

370
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
What about you?

371
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,500
Have you made up with Shiyi yet?

372
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Xiaoju, I hope you two can be fine, too.

373
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,100
Shiyi is just a bit mean with his words,

374
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
but he likes you very much.

375
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Cherish him if you can.

376
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
I know.

377
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,410
I'll go home now.

378
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,500
Okay.

379
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,400
<i>Mom, I'm back!</i>

380
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,600
- Lang Lang, you're back?
- Yes.

381
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,900
It smells so good.

382
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,700
You've prepared so many dishes!

383
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,200
It's her first time coming to our house.

384
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,000
It must be carefully prepared.

385
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,600
What's more, I don't know what Lin You likes to eat.

386
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,400
So I thought to make more dishes. There's bound to be one that she likes.

387
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,800
My mom is so experienced and considerate.

388
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,200
You're so honey-lipped to make me happy.

389
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,500
When will Lin You come? Is she almost here?

390
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,800
She should be here soon.

391
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,500
Hurry and prepare the table.

392
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,000
I also need to hurry, clean up, and cook.

393
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Thanks, Auntie.

394
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,400
You came at the wrong time. Lin You isn't back yet.

395
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,600
I'm not here looking for Lin You today. I'm here for you.

396
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,000
Wh-What for?

397
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,400
I really hope to make up with Lin You,

398
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,200
so I want to get your approval first.

399
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,000
When I had an accident that year,

400
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I hurt her due to my inconsideration.

401
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Afterward, you opposed us getting back together.

402
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,200
I understand your feelings. You were doing it for Lin You's own good.

403
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,600
Ancheng, my marriage failed.

404
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,700
As a mother,

405
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't want Lin You to also experience hardships.

406
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,800
So when you called to say that your arm was injured,

407
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,000
and you can no longer play the piano,

408
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,800
I selfishly didn't want you two to be together.

409
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,900
Don't you blame me when I hid the fact that your arm was injured back then?

410
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,600
Lin You, you're back.

411
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,300
Did he really call you?

412
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,800
Mom, how could you do this?

413
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,400
How could you not tell me?

414
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,400
Is she still not answering?

415
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,600
Did she forget to take her phone?

416
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,200
Why don't I go out and take a look? Maybe she's almost here.

417
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Wait for me, Mom.

418
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Lin You! Lin You! Lin You!

419
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,600
Lin You, wait for me!

420
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Lin You!

421
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,000
Lin You, listen to me.

422
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,200
Listen, it's my fault.

423
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
It's all my fault.

424
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,600
I'm sorry.

425
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,000
It was me who misunderstood you.

426
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,200
No, you didn't.

427
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,800
The root of the mistake is in me.

428
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,700
I asked to break up first.

429
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,200
Even though I soon regretted it,

430
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,800
it is still me who is at fault.

431
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,600
I should thank your mom.

432
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,200
If it wasn't her who strongly opposed us getting back together back then,

433
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,600
I wouldn't have recalled the pain and accepted the new treatment,

434
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,400
- transferred to another major, or returned—
- Don't console me.

435
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,500
I know how hard these two years have been for you.

436
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,800
The piano is such an important matter for you,

437
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,200
yet you had no choice but to give it up.

438
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,800
I know this feeling.

439
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,200
It's all in the past.

440
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,800
Aren't I fine now?

441
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,500
But when you needed me the most, I knew nothing about it.

442
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,000
While you were alone abroad, you had no support.

443
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,200
If I had known about it earlier, earlier...

444
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,300
I'm sorry.

445
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,400
Except for saying sorry,

446
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,400
I really don't know what else to say to you.

447
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,400
You told me last time

448
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,000
that if I had changed my mind earlier,

449
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,400
and explained all this to you earlier,

450
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,600
you'd forgive me.

451
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,500
Now that we've cleared these misunderstandings,

452
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,400
can you give me another chance?

453
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,800
It's okay. It's all right.

454
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,400
I won't force an answer from you.

455
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,900
I'll always be with you and wait for you.

456
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,200
I'll wait for you for as long as you want.

457
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,500
- Bastard!
- Cheng Lang!

458
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,200
- I'm warning you, stay away from her!
- Cheng Lang!

459
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,000
Cheng Lang, let go of him!

460
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,700
Let go of him, Cheng Lang! Don't touch him!

461
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
His arm is wounded!

462
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,400
Is your arm fine?

463
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,000
It's fine.

464
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,350
Lin You...

465
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,800
What are you doing?

466
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,600
I...

467
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,000
What are you doing?

468
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,300
No, I'm not...

469
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,700
I...

470
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,200
Cheng Lang! Cheng Lang! Cheng Lang!

471
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,900
- Lin You! Lin You! Lin You.
- Cheng Lang! Cheng Lang!

472
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,500
He's angry right now.

473
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,900
Let him calm down first.

474
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,200
Come in.

475
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,200
What's wrong?

476
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,600
Did you see Cheng Lang today?

477
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,400
No, I didn't.

478
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,200
Lin You is going to his house for dinner today.

479
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,800
They should have already finished dinner and are probably out on a date.

480
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,400
Impossible.

481
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,800
I've been watching them all day.

482
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,000
Lin You didn't go to Cheng Lang's house for dinner.

483
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,600
Xia Xiaoju, is there something wrong with your brain?

484
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,200
They're already meeting each other's parents.

485
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,000
Why haven't you given up yet?

486
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,200
What do you mean by "not given up yet?" What are you thinking about?

487
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
I saw that Yuan Ancheng is back.

488
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,000
Who? Yuan Ancheng?

489
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yes.

490
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,300
Does Cheng Lang know about this?

491
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
I haven't told him so he probably doesn't know.

492
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,000
I happened to see them meet at a café a few days ago.

493
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Why didn't you tell him?

494
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,400
How can I tell him such a thing?

495
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,600
It won't do.

496
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
We must let Cheng Lang know,

497
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,800
or else this fool will still be kept in the dark.

498
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,500
It turns out you both already knew about it.

499
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,000
- Cheng Lang!
- Cheng Lang!

500
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:44,200
♫ <i>There you are, running wildly through the highlands</i> ♫

501
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:51,500
♫ <i>Another you is sighing silently</i> ♫

502
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,400
♫ <i>No one is able to understand you</i> ♫

503
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:05,000
♫ <i>Happiness is not transparent and pain is not thorough</i> ♫

504
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:14,200
♫ <i>I'm glad you're not willing to give up like this</i> ♫

505
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:21,400
♫ <i>It hurts to see the stubbornness in your eyes</i> ♫

506
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:27,000
♫ <i>I'm a bit tired and need to rest</i> ♫

507
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,200
♫ <i>The marks we leave in life</i> ♫

508
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:41,800
♫ <i>How I wish to travel everywhere with you</i> ♫

509
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:49,100
♫ <i>To find the meaning of my existence along the way</i> ♫

510
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:57,200
♫ <i>The hard journey of life lets the soul recuperate</i> ♫

511
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:05,500
♫ <i>Be brave and find yourself</i> ♫

512
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:20,200
♫ <i>The red, green, and black colors of the forest</i> ♫

513
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:34,000
♫ <i>The purity, joy, and freedom of oneself</i> ♫

514
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:42,800
♫ <i>I wish for you to see clearly</i> ♫

515
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:57,000
♫ <i>The true you within all the dust</i> ♫
