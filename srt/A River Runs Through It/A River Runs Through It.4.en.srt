<i>[Episode 4: Whose youth wasn't full of passion? Part 2]</i>

3
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,210
Xia Xiaoju, climb down slowly on your own.

4
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,740
I'll protect you from down here.

5
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,730
Be careful. Go slowly. There's no rush.

6
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,540
Sister!

7
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,690
I didn't die? I didn't die.

8
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,010
You won't die.

9
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,060
But if you don't get up now,

10
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,200
I'll die.

11
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,520
Jiashu, are you okay?

12
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,420
I'm fine.

13
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,310
Are you hurt?

14
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,720
Xia Xiaoju.

15
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,760
I saved your life. How are you going to thank me?

16
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,430
I didn't beg you to save me.

17
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,800
Sister, you can't be like that. Brother Shiyi is our savior.

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,930
That's right.

19
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,880
Xia Jiashu. I still have some accounts I need to settle with you. Do you know?

20
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,070
Come here.

21
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,190
I never expected that you knew how to bully a schoolchild.

22
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,170
It's our family's matter. It's none of your business.

23
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,620
Get out of my way!

24
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,150
Clearly, you have puppy love! Why won't you let me say it? You've puppy love!

25
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,740
Wait. Does your sister have puppy love?

26
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,840
Yes. She washed clothes for a male classmate.

27
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,660
Did you wash clothes for a male classmate? You...

28
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,220
Y-You aren't washing my school uniform, right?

29
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,930
I see. So you are dating Brother Shiyi?

30
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,000
- What?
- Stop with your nonsense! I did wash his clothes, but I'm not dating him.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,200
I won't wash clothes for you anymore. Let's go home!

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,040
Xia Xiaoju.

33
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,570
How about you reconsider the matter about the sports competition?

34
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,450
- I told you already–
- I just want you to think about it.

35
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,060
You don't need to make a decision right now.

36
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,430
How about this? If you made up your mind,

37
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,390
after school tomorrow, we'll wait for you to train together.

38
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:35,860
If you really are so unwilling... then forget it.

39
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,800
I'm off! Bye bye.

40
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,460
Every day, you never do any good thing.

41
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,270
Xiaoju. Jiashu.

42
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,260
Brother Cheng Lang.

43
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,270
- Cheng Lang.
- What happened to your clothes?

44
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,470
It accidentally got dirty when I was playing with Jiashu.

45
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,610
Did you buy that much stuff?

46
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,130
- Come! Jiashu, help your brother carry them.
- No need!

47
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,840
- That one is pretty heavy. I'll do it myself.
- It's okay.

48
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,990
He can carry a bottle of oil.

49
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,700
Brother Cheng Lang. You shouldn't look down on me.

50
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,340
Last year, I was our school's short distance run champion.

51
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,160
You're that amazing?

52
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,470
Then it seems like running fast is your family's gene passed down from your ancestors.

53
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,620
I envy you.

54
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,690
Just running fast is not like having a sharp and fast mind. There's nothing to be envious about.

55
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,390
Sister, you're the only one in the family with a brain that's rusting, all right?

56
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,040
You...

57
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,850
<i>[The community is a family. Love between everyone.]</i>

58
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,570
That... How is the preparation for the sports competition going?

59
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,580
Shiyi asked me about it again.

60
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,870
Is this competition really important to you guys?

61
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,350
Yes.

62
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,780
We haven't beaten No. 14 Senior High in a mixed relay race for years.

63
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,310
Shiyi is holding his energy to wipe away this humiliation before graduating.

64
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,780
This competition to us is related to our honor and dignity.

65
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,340
Then should I participate?

66
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,240
It's okay to forget about it.

67
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,650
I'm afraid it would influence your studies.

68
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:21,160
But I can imagine... training with you would be quite interesting.

69
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,260
Y-You think I'm interesting?

70
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,230
Give this to me.

71
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,540
- I'm going to head in first then.
- All right.

72
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,640
Thanks, Jiashu.

73
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,210
Mom, I'm back.

74
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,400
Shiyi, let's go play basketball.

75
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,210
I'm busy. We'll do it another day.

76
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,130
Why hasn't Xia Xiaoju come out yet?

77
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,820
Shiyi. Since you decided to beg her again,

78
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,140
you must have a good and sincere attitude when you see her later.

79
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,520
I brought water and meals for her.

80
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,000
What else do you want me to do?

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,800
But when you were doing those things, your attitude was all high and lofty.

82
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,110
However, there are times you're truly sincere.

83
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,200
- When?
- When you are being mean to her.

84
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,060
When was I ever mean to her?

85
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,680
Calling her Speedy Legs, having poor grades...

86
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,850
How could anyone like to hear what you said?

87
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,930
Let me tell you, it would be weird if she does agree.

88
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,630
- Can't you say any good words?
- How so?

89
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:47,210
For example, "Xia Xiaoju, you really are very pretty and graceful."

90
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,010
With the way she is? I can't say something that's against my conscience.

91
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,560
Besides, if those words come out of my mouth, do you think she would believe me?

92
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,040
She still has a bit of self-awareness, all right?

93
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,220
Forget it. It'll be best for you to call those at No. 14 Senior High, "Dad" then.

94
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,750
All right. All right.

95
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,500
I'll listen to you in everything, all right?

96
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,340
That's right.

97
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,890
But directly telling a girl,

98
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,960
"You really are very pretty and graceful."

99
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,320
I really can't say those words that act against my conscience.

100
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,810
It's really vulgar, right?

101
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,740
That way others would think I'm plotting something unlawful towards her.

102
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,730
That's right.

103
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,400
Another way.

104
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,790
How about you cry and pretend to be pitiful?

105
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,520
Usually, girls would be rather soft-hearted.

106
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,880
I'm a dignified man, I...

107
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,330
I'm flexible.

108
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,770
Shiyi, Baobao! What are you doing?

109
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,660
I've been looking all over for you. How come you aren't training?

110
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,630
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

111
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,970
All right. Don't talk. We're making preparations.

112
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,520
We're waiting for Xia Xiaoju.

113
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,220
We are thinking and working hard to beg her once more.

114
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,020
It's fake.

115
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,990
I think you should forget about it.

116
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,520
Time is very precious to her now.

117
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,590
Don't make it hard for her.

118
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,870
Besides, it seems she has already left.

119
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,920
- She left?
- She left?

120
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,930
Forget it. Let's go and practice.

121
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,660
Go.

122
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,880
Come over here!

123
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,290
Let's go!

124
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,880
Xia Xiaoju. Why are you here?

125
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,080
To train.

126
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,710
Don't you usually train at this time?

127
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,750
What? You found someone and don't need me anymore?

128
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,200
- No!
- No!

129
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,980
Why are you suddenly willing to come?

130
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,180
I...

131
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,700
That's not important! Let me tell you.

132
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,200
Now that Speedy Legs has joined us, it would be hard for us to loose.

133
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,910
Say that again? What Speedy Legs?

134
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,700
No, it's nothing.

135
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,970
Sorry, Warrior Ju.

136
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,390
Hero Ju, all right?

137
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,800
From now on, if you want me to go east, I definitely won't go west. If you ask me to hit a dog, I definitely won't hit a chicken. How about that?

138
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,450
Ok. Turn left.

139
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,400
What left? Let's hurry and start practicing!

140
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,180
Come on.

141
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,000
Shiyi, your clothes.

142
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,310
You actually cleaned them for me?

143
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,040
Or what then?

144
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,240
Don't tell me there's a situation between the two of you?

145
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,690
Baobao, go away!

146
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,930
Let's hurry and train.

147
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,260
Come back!

148
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,670
I said you're not allowed to take part in the sports competition.

149
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,930
Are you treating my words like the wind?

150
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,250
Practice kung fu?

151
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,020
You're doing the "Sing Spring Fist?"
<i>(T/N: Chinese martial arts)</i>

152
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,350
Ip Man?
<i>(T/N: Grandmaster of the martial art Wing Chun. One of his most famous student was Bruce Lee.)</i>

153
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,270
Say that again?

154
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,250
Come here then!

155
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,720
Shiyi, forget it.

156
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,700
What does it have to do with me?

157
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,250
I feel so wronged!

158
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,300
Baobao. Baobao.

159
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,610
Is Mr. Zhang still there?

160
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,390
He's gone! He's gone!

161
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,050
It's all your fault!

Lu Shiyi.

163
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,530
How did you reply when Mr. Zhang called you a troublemaker?

164
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,070
<i>Lu Shiyi, you are such a troublemaker!</i>

165
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,880
<i>If I'm a troublemaker,</i>

166
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,700
<i>what are they?</i>

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,140
- I...
- I...

168
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,440
- I suddenly can't remember.
- You!

169
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,690
You can't remember? Are you playing it that way?

170
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,940
Hurry! Baobao, come on! He says he can't remember.

171
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,100
You said we were trouble!

172
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,190
The teacher is coming! The teacher is coming!

173
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,200
Mr. Zhang, for this matter, it really is my fault.

174
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,900
I signed them up without discussing it with you first.

175
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,240
They're quite enthusiastic about this matter.

176
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,120
It won't take too much of their time.

177
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,350
Having high enthusiasm is no use.

178
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,320
The most important thing they should be doing now is reviewing.

179
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,220
You should solve this matter since you made the promise.

180
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,850
I...

181
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,250
Mr. Guo.

182
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,650
Come here.

183
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,050
How is the registration I talked with you about last time going?

184
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,700
I signed you up.

185
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,590
But you've also heard your homeroom teacher disagrees.

186
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,290
He's right.

187
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,540
Right now, studying is more important.

188
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,140
Don't keep thinking about the sports competition.

189
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,450
Don't make him angry anymore.

190
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,150
He's really doing this for your own good.

191
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,640
Go back to your classroom when you finish.

192
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,760
Mr. Guo, don't leave!

193
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,900
Mr. Guo! Mr. Guo!

194
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
Forget it, Shiyi.

195
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,830
What should we do next week then?

196
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,390
Let me ask you, do you want to avenge our humiliation?

197
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,610
Don't say that! Of course, we do!

198
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,050
Then there's only one way.

199
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,420
What exactly should we do?

200
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,460
Do it stealthily.

201
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,110

<i>We'll always cheer for you.</i>

Such a big occasion!

207
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,460
You haven't seen this before, right?

208
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,780
You don't say. There are a lot of people today.

209
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,780
That's for sure.

210
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,720
Obviously, there would be a lot of people in the sports competition for the whole city.

211
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,100
Let's go.

212

Let's go.

There are so many schools here.

221

Don't keep looking around.

223

Stay close to us. There are so many people here.

224
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,470
Shiyi. Did you see anyone from No. 14 Senior High?

225
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,170
No.

226
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,660
Lu Shiyi, look there.

227
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,860
They should be students with a special talent in sports.

228
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,420
Look at their long legs and muscles.

229
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,760
We won't be able to beat them, right?

230

You're Speedy Legs.

231
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,430
What's there to be afraid of?

232
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,660
Don't call me Speedy Legs!

233
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,750
I'm just a bit nervous.

234
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,870
What's there to be nervous about? They must be very good.

235
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,150
They had more time to train than us.

236
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,590
- Even though we are seniors...
- All right, that's enough.

237
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,830
The more you talk, the more nervous you make her.

238
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,710
Xia Xiaoju, don't just think about the race.

239
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,000
Think about the prizes.

240
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,410
Look over there. Do you see it?

241
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,000
Prizes include famous brand schoolbags and scented soap.

All of those are prizes.

You love looking for petty advantages.

Thinking of these, don't you feel very motivated?

245
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,470
You're the one who loves looking for petty advantages!

246
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,780
If you keep saying I like petty advantages, then I won't run.

00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,030
All right.

248
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,320
I am wrong, all right?

249
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,780
Even if you don't believe in yourself, you should believe in me.

With me here, what's there to be nervous about?

251

Why are you here?

For the race.

258
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,510
Lao Zhang agreed?

259
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,710
We came here in secret. What's wrong?

260
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,880
- Let me tell you if Mr. Zhang finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
- I know.

261
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,600
Mr. Guo, today's Sunday, so we don't have any classes.

262
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,870
As long as we get back before the evening self-study time, Mr. Zhang definitely won't find out. Don't worry.

263
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,630
- That's right.
- Or else how could we come.

264
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,710
Mr. Guo.

265
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,100
I really can't do anything about you guys.

266
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,760
Since you're here, then we must win. Are you confident?

267
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,890
- Of course!
- Yes, of course!

268
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,980
Hurry and get ready! Hurry and warm up!

269
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,150
- Mister, you've worked hard.
- Mister, you've worked hard.

270
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,700
Get ready! Warm up!

271
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,380
See you, Mr. Guo.

272
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,490

00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,060
Lu Shiyi.

274
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,070
You really have guts, don't you?

275
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,360
I heard that No. 1 Senior High doesn't allow seniors to take part in sports competitions.

276
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,810
I thought you were cowards.

277
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,680
Whose mouth is so stinky?

278
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,580
Do you smell that?

279
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,440
Don't be so pleased with yourself so early on.

280
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,200
I'm waiting to hear you call me "Dad."

281
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,340
Anyway, I am prepared to be a dad.

282
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,840
Then let's do our best to see who laughs at the end.

283
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,640
See you in the race.

284
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,960
Why do you have to call him Dad?

285
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,590
Nothing.

286
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,340
It's just a bet. The loser calls the winner, Dad.

287
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,560
Why didn't you tell me such an important thing earlier?

288
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,700
If I knew that earlier, I'd take part in the race without hesitation.

289
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,440
I wouldn't have to be conflicted for so long.

290
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,090
You're loyal, Xia Xiaoju.

291
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,640
But why did you keep losing to No. 14 Senior High before?

292
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,020
Can you not tear my old scars open?

293
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,510
It's fine if you couldn't outrun them.

294
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,350
It's fine. I'm here to help.

295
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,240
Call me Sister. Sister.

296
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,230
Here you are.

297
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,140
Go and b-buy some drinks for us. Take it.

298
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,330
You always boss me around. I won't go!

299
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,420
I wanted to find something for you to do to be distracted and less nervous.

300
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,220
Take it.

301
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,970
- Be quick.
- I know.

302
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,610
See? I told you that she loves looking for petty advantages.

303
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,910
- Let's continue practicing.
- You!

304
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,860
Why don't you look around when walking?

305
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,990
- Are you all right?
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

306
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,850
H-How about I wash it for you?

307
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,960
It's okay. I can just go back and wash it.

308
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,230
How could it be okay? It's very hard to wash off beverages with just water.

309
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,560
You must use soap at once.

310
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,670
I know the prize includes soaps.

311
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,630
Don't worry. I'll definitely win one to give you.

312
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,940
I'm really sorry.

313
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,120
It's okay. I'll go ask my teacher to change shirts.

314
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,190
It doesn't matter.

315
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,460
That girl is quite pretty.

316
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,060
I don't know your name.

317
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,380
What should I do?

318
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,910
I thought you got lost. Where were you?

319
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,690
Where are the drinks?

320
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,970

That... I have something I need to tell you.

322
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,800
Lingling ate something bad this morning and has a stomachache.

323
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,230
It's hard for her to stand straight right now.

324
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,780
During the race, her running speed will definitely be affected.

325
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,890
Th-Then what should we do?

326
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,040
What else can we do? We definitely can't count on her.

All right.

Don't tell me you're not feeling well?

331
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,330
It's fine. I'm just a bit nervous.

332
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,640
You don't need to be nervous.

333
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,600
Just do it as we normally do during training.

Why didn't you say anything about your foot being injured?

415
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,560
Originally I wanted to tell you,

416
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,200
but Lingling had a stomachache.

417
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,210

Are you a fool?

421
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,100
What's more important, your foot or the race?

422
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,750
It's all right, Shiyi.

423
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,010
Don't keep scolding Xiao Ju.

424
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,320
When you get back, remember to apply a cold compress.

425
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,580
Then apply a hot compress after 24 hours.

426
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,070
Don't forget to use the medicine the doctor prescribed.

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,540
Got it.

428
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,710
I didn't think you would be quite professional.

429
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:28,450
Oh, right! Do you know what school wears uniforms that are green and white?

430
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,200
Green and white?

431
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,840
It should be No. 2 Senior High.

432
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,130
Why are you asking that?

433
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,530
I stained a girl's school uniform today.

434
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,640
I promised to give her a soap.

435
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,320
But I forgot to ask her what school she was from.

436
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,710
If we are talking about stupidity, I am only convinced by you. Really, Xia Xiaoju.

440
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,940
She was feeling uncomfortable, so she went home.

441
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,660
Just these?

442
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,940
Where's the soap?

443
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,250
Why isn't the prize a soap?

444
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,750
Obviously, the schoolbag is better, right?

445
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,920
It's not that. I promised to give that girl a soap.

446
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,680
There are different prizes for the different competitions.

447
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,400
Soap is the prize in the high jump event.

448
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,160
I promised her a bar of soap.

449
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,490
Xiaoju, don't worry.

450
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,860

00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,730
I'm Xia Xiaoju.

484
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,700
Ju means tangerine.

485
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,310
What a coincidence! I'm Lin You.

486
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,830
You means grapefruit.

487
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,480
Tangerine and grapefruit.

488
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,900
We really have a connection.

489
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,320
Xia Xiaoju.

490
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,510
We won again.

491
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,630
Really?

492
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,700
They're so poor,

493
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,300
so they just gave me a pen.

494
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,210
It's fine. You win the honor.

495
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,010
That's right. Let me make some introductions.

496
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,380
She's my new friend, Lin You.

497
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,560
Hello.

498
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,960
They're my classmates.

499
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,720
He's Cheng Lang. He's Lu Shiyi.

500
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,920
- He's...
- Bao Xiangxiang.

501
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,680
He won the soap.

502
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,820
Thank you.

503
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,520
You're welcome.

504
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,230
I have a race, so I can't keep talking.

505
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,420
Let's meet another time.

506
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,230
Ok. Fighting! Bye.

507
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,910
- Fighting!
- Fighting! Bye.

508
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,520
- Go slowly. Bye.
- Bye.

509
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,600
Bye.

510
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,330
Xia Xiaoju, how's your foot? Does it still hurt?

511
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,660
It's much better.

512
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,330
Shiyi. Isn't it time to watch a good show?

513
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,210
Look at you.

514
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,000
Come and look!

515
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,110
What are these?

516
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,720
The gold color is so beautiful!

517
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,580
Are you jealous? Jealous?

518
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,460
The competition results have come out.

519
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,430
You lost.

520
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,660
Call me "Dad" then.

521
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,390
Yes. Call me, "Dad."

522
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,730
Dear friends from No. 14 Senior High.

523
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,710
What are you dawdling for? Hurry up!

524
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,470
What? Are you going back on your word?

525
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,580
How about we just forget it?

526
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,420
How about this?

527
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,200
We will end the bet here.

528
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,000
But from now on, you are not to find trouble with anyone from No. 1 Senior High.

529
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,730
All right. It's a deal.

530
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,540
If we get a chance, let's go to the arcade to play Street Fighter.

531
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,240
No problem.

532
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,460
Thanks.

533
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,760
Let's go. Hope to see you again.

534
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,610
Cheng Lang. Why did you just let them go?

535
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,800
I have been looking forward for a while to hear them call us "Dad."

536
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,730
Stupid.

537
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,840
We wanted to win to prove ourselves.

538
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,750
It wasn't just for the bet.

539
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,540
Besides, if we really let Hua Zi and the others call us Dad,

540
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,680
then the conflict between our two schools would only get worse.

541
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,840
All right.

542
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,570
Since the sports competition is also over, why don't we find a place to have a big meal since we're so happy today?

543
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,020
- I agree!
- Agree.

544
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,730
Let's go.

545
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,160
Wait.

546
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,840
I realized one problem.

547
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,130
I realized we have a quite predestined affinity among us.

548
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,260
- Why?
- Look.

549
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,670
Tangerine. Orange.

550
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,090
Qiu Le Tao. Tao sounds like peach.

551
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,460
And that pretty girl just now, Lin You with grapefruit.

552
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,850
With my name sounding like a steamed bun.

553
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,030
Our names all mean food.

554
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,360
That's true!

555
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,030
Except for Lu Shiyi.

556
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,120
There's always been one thing I don't quite understand.

557
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,430
Why is your name Lu Shiyi?

558
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,840
It's hard to write and read.

559
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,910
When I say you're stupid, you really are stupid?

560
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,850
Lu Shiyi of course means I was born on October 1st.

561
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,840
That's what it meant?

562
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,400
Or what?

563
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,090
My cousin was also born on October 1st.

564
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,280
But his name is Jianguo
<i>(T/N: Meaning "help to construct China" in a jokingly manner).</i>

565
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,370
How about we call you Lu Jianguo or Lu Guoqing from now on?
<i>(T/N: Guoqing meaning National Day)</i>

566
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,160
- Xia Xiaoju.
- Wait! We can't call you that.

567
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,510
Shi and Yi when put together from the word Tu, which means unrefined.

568
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,660
Should we call him Datu from now on? How about that?
<i>(T/N: Meaning big unrefined)</i>

569
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,660
That's good! That's good!

570
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,230
Xia Xiaoju. Does your foot not hurt anymore?

571
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,120
If you continue talking nonsense, I'll plant you here. Do you believe me?

572
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Ok, I won't say it anymore.

573
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,970
Xiaoju. You went too far with what you said.

574
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,920
That's right.

575
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,120
Is what I say right, Datu?

576
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,430
- No.
- Slow down. I'll support you.

577
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,150
Datu!

578
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,040
Be careful the two of you!

579
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,360
All right. That's enough.

580
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,120
- Xiaoju!
- You're so heavy.

581
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,540
Xiaoju!

582
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,820
- Taotao.
- Xiaoju!

583
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,640
Why took you so long?

584
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,130
Our races are over now.

585
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,710
Who's here to watch you compete?

586
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,370
Let me tell you, we defeated No. 14 Senior High.

587
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,940
No! Our homeroom teacher knows that you guys secretly went to participate in the sports competition.

588
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,080
He's waiting at the gate right now!

589
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,140
I'm here to inform you. Hurry and run!

590
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,850
- What? What should we do?
- Let's go!

591
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:52,430
- My shoe.
- Shoe? Shoe!

592
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:12,540
♫ <i>There you are, running wildly through the highlands</i> ♫

593
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:19,980
♫ <i>Another you is sighing silently</i> ♫

597
