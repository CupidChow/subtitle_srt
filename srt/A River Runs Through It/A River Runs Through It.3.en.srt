4
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,110
Ready.

5
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,350
Go!

6
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,539
They've gone too far.

7
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,049
Xiaoju. You ran too fast.

8
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,499
You're like a "Fei Mao Tui."
<i>(T/N: Fast mailing system in ancient China. Here, it describes a person who runs very fast.)</i>

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,120
You even ran faster than the boys.

10
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,160
"Fei Mao Tui?"

11
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,889
What do you mean, "Fei Mao Tui?"

12
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:08,170
Are you really complimenting me?

13
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,469
Wait, don't mind what it means on the surface.

14
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,930
Just understand the meaning, okay?

15
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,759
What's wrong?

16
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,120
Are you still mad about the bet they made on you?

17
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,289
No.

18
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,680
What right do I have to be angry at them?

19
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,080
If it was me, I'd be angry.

20
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,759
But think about it.

21
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,559
Cheng Lang taught you earnestly.

22
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,689
Your grades have improved. Right?

23
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:44,309
So in their bet, you're the one who actually gained from it.

24
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,040
Right?

25
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,599
You kind of have a point.

26
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,949
Right? Stop being upset.

27
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:51,670
Be happier, okay?

28
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,540
I'm exhausted.

29
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,469
I don't know if staying is a good thing or a bad thing.

30
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,389
Hurry! Hurry!

31
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,959
Hurry up.

32
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,139
You're getting slower again.

33
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:08,390
Hurry. Hurry.

34
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,169
Mr. Guo, are you busy?

35
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,870
What's up?

36
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,729
Hurry. Hurry.

37
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:19,759
Mr. Guo.

38
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,979
Do you still remember that in last year's 4x100 meter mixed relay,

39
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,630
we lost to No. 14 Senior High School?

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,959
Only by one point.

41
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,599
We were only one point away. Were you satisfied with that?

42
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,729
- Of course not.
- Right?

43
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:34,210
But what can we do about it?

44
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,879
Now you're seniors.

45
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,380
This is the most stressful time of your studies.

46
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,059
I can't delay your studies either.

47
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,309
Or else Mr. Zhang will blame it on me.

48
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,109
I can't bear that responsibility.

49
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,989
Don't worry about that, Teacher.

50
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,519
We'll use our free time to train.

51
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,180
It absolutely won't get in the way of our classes.

52
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,949
You just need to help us sign up for it.

53
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,620
Leave the rest to me.

54
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,899
It's not like that won't work,

55
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:05,759
but the 4x100 meters mixed relay is our weakness.

56
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,029
We really can't beat No. 14 Senior High.

57
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:10,340
Then we must think of a way.

58
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,169
Xia Xiaoju.

59
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,530
14.8 seconds on the 100 meters.

60
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,699
It can't be her.

61
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,400
Why not?

62
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,210
I have a grudge against her.

63
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,230
Look at you.

64
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,449
Boys are supposed to go easy on girls.

65
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,729
Not to mention, in the face of collective honor,

66
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,189
personal grudges are nothing.

67
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,059
Of course I know this, Mr. Guo.

68
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:33,919
But in a relay race, the problem is about teamwork.

69
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,769
We both can't stand each other.

70
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,489
Then how can we work together?

71
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:39,569
Anyway, you're in charge of registering.

72
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,219
I'll pick the candidates.

73
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,489
Thank you, Teacher.

74
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:44,169
Continue. Bye bye!

75
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:45,329
Wait. What are you thanking me for?

76
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:47,590
Did I say yes?

77
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,040
<i>[World Military Affairs]</i>

78
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,390
Shiyi. This... This is my favorite.

79
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,679
How's the search for candidates going?

80
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,179
I've been to every building.

81
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:07,809
My clothes are soaking wet.

82
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:11,010
- My legs are almost broken.
- Get to the point.

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,940
There is no one who meets your requirements.

84
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,829
Didn't you ask Zhao Qiang to help you?

85
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,910
He didn't find one, either.

86
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,639
Shiyi, why not forget about it?

87
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,899
No.

88
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,359
We can't lose to No.14 Senior High this time.

89
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:35,430
Have you forgotten? After No. 14 Senior High won from us last year, they forced us to call them d—

90
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,509
—to call them something that's humiliating.

91
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,959
Then what should we do?

92
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,530
We can't even find anyone right now.

93
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,279
<i>In the face of collective honor, personal grudges are nothing.</i>

94
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,490
Is she really the only one?

95
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,959
Lu Shiyi, what are you doing? Give it back to me!

96
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,680
I'll give it back to you if you can catch up to me.

97
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,849
What's wrong with you?

98
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:10,750
Stop right there!

99
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,310
Stop!

100
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,930
Why did you take my stuff?

101
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,470
Stop!

102
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,470
Stop!

103
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,220
Lu Shiyi, stop!

104
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,799
Why did you take my walkman?

105
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,359
What exactly do you want?

106
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,100
No, no, no.

107
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,060
I just wanted to see how fast you could run.

108
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,239
Impressive. Impressive.

109
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:58,359
I admit defeat.

110
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,119
Is there something wrong with you?

111
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,150
I already told you not to bother me again!

112
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,729
Oh, my god.

113
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,330
She's too fast.

114
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,709
It was really worth the effort.
<i>(T/N: Lit. to wear out the iron shoes in order to find someone.)</i>

115
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,780
Let's choose her.

116
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,549
Lu Shiyi.

117
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,510
What do you want now?

118
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,919
Speedy Legs,

119
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,829
practice the relay this week

120
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,900
and get ready for next week's City-Wide Sports Competition.

121
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,089
The teacher said that I'm not allowed to attend the sports competition.

122
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,339
Also, you're not allowed to call me "Hairy Legs".
<i>(T/N: She only said the last 2 characters which literally is "hairy legs.")</i>

123
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:42,619
You're the one who has hairy legs.

124
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,899
You just need to practice.

125
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,609
You don't need to worry about the rest.

126
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:48,499
Can you not understand human language?

127
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,499
I'm not worried; I'm refusing.

128
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,590
Xia Xiaoju!

129
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,399
What do you want now?

130
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,949
You have to know

131
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,549
that me allowing you in the competition is giving you face.

132
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,709
Thank you!

133
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:10,620
You should give it to someone else instead.

134
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,959
Xia Xiaoju! What's with your attitude?

135
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,829
Shiyi. Shiyi. Shiyi.

136
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,149
Let's first forget about Xia Xiaoju's attitude.

137
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,359
Look at you.

138
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,679
How is this the attitude of someone who's asking for help?

139
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,179
Then you tell me how I should be asking

140
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,060
and what attitude I should have!

141
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,200
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

142
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,590
Are you busy?

143
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,200
Eat it. They are all for you.

144
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,810
- Does it smell good?
- Yes.

145
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,539
That's good.

146
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,679
Hurry and eat. When you're done eating, I want to discuss something with you.

147
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:13,949
I won't be taking part in the City-Wide Sports Competition.

148
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:16,690
Mr. Zhang won't agree to let me take part in it.

149
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,740
So you're worried that Mr. Zhang won't approve?

150
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,919
Think about it. If we win first place,

151
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,199
we'll bring honor back to our school. Then the headmaster will be happy

152
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,939
and Mr. Zhang won't dare to do anything to you. Right?

153
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:32,030
Besides,

154
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,639
if you're good in sports, you'll get additional points on your college entrance exams.

155
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,869
- Really?
- Of course! That's why I'm telling you this.

156
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,960
Then I'll really have to think about it.

157
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,810
What's there to think about?

158
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,809
Your grades are very bad, right?

159
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:50,200
You should hurry and find some advantages in sports.

160
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,389
That's right. It's because my grades are so bad.

161
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,760
That's why I need to study harder.

162
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,080
You'd better find someone else.

163
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,299
Wait! What do you mean? Why do you change—

164
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,900
Look.

165
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:23,029
You can still listen to it. It's just that the corner is a bit scratched.

166
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,910
Isn't it just a stupid walkman?

167
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,479
As long as you promise me that you'll take part in the sports competition, I'll buy you a new one tomorrow.

168
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,549
Do you not understand human language? I already told you I won't be participating in it.

169
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,279
What is with your attitude? Don't think that just because

170
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,080
I'm asking you for help, you can be so arrogant towards me.

171
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,440
Guys! Guys!

172
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,520
- What's the matter? Th-Th-This early in the morning?
- Yes, yes.

173
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,809
Y-You need to relax. Relax.

174
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,290
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

175
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,919
Lu Shiyi, I don't want to see you right now.

176
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,130
Please get out of my sight right now!

177
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,199
Xia Xiaoju. Don't think there's not much I can do about you.

178
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:54,810
You want to hit me, right?

179
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,130
Come on then! Hit me here.

180
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,399
You better cripple me so that I won't have to run.

181
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,929
- Hit me!
- You—

182
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,450
Bad girl, I'll hammer you to death.

183
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,999
Lu Shiyi, can you concentrate more on your studies?

184
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:35,180
How did I annoy you again, Dad?

185
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,510
Wow, so handsome!

186
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,690
- Stop playing!
- I was still fighting!

187
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,640
Dad.

188
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,810
I'm so busy that I can't even find time to study.

189
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,159
You're too busy and can't find time to study?

190
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,070
Isn't that what you said, Dad?

191
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,640
There are still two acres back at home, anyway.

192
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,900
If I can't get into an university, I'll just go back home and farm.

193
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,320
You really have no aspirations.

194
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,360
Stubborn, aren't you?

195
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,080
What're you doing?

196
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,810
You're getting bolder.

197
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,050
I've already finished my homework.

198
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,750
- I'll just play for a while.
- Hello, who is this?

199
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,219
Xiaohong, when will you be back?

200
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,560
Hurry back and control your precious son!

201
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,500
His homeroom teacher calls me daily

202
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,490
saying he hardly pays attention in class

203
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,470
and never studies after class.

204
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,129
He even dares to cheat now.

205
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,690
Now, all the teachers in the entire school know that my son cheated.

206
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,000
Tell me, where can I place my dignity?

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,370
How can I—

208
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,590
Where are you going?

209
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,689
Dad, your son is planning on going back to his room to study hard.

210
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:51,190
Go. Go. Go.

211
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,179
Look at him. He just smiles at me with a "game face" everyday.

212
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,859
<i>[Guanghui Hair Salon]</i>

213
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,160
Lu Shiyi!

214
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,640
Lu Shiyi!

215
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,130
Lu Shiyi!

216
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,099
What are you shouting for?

217
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,539
This is a public place. Can you be quieter?

218
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,619
Of course, I need something from you. Come down.

219
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:35,810
Come down and then we'll talk.

220
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,739
So I have to come down when you tell me to? How humiliating would that be?

221
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:40,149
If you're that capable, then you come up here.

222
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,549
- Come down!
- You come up.

223
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:45,239
- Do you dare to come down?
- Do you dare to come up?

224
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:47,609
- You—
- Did you guys watch too much of Journey to the West?

225
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,889
Now you're even acting. Do you guys think there's too little homework?

226
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,400
He broke my walkman.

227
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,539
Only a corner was scratched. Do you have to be like this?

228
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:56,219
It's completely broken. There's no sound. You have to compensate me for it.

229
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:59,130
You can just say that it was me who broke it. How can you prove it?

230
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,759
Are you even trying to deny it?

231
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,080
Then I say you're trying to blackmail me.

232
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,899
Cut the crap! Come down!

233
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,570
A gentleman doesn't fight with women.

234
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,770
Don't interrupt my studies.

235
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,960
How can someone be so annoying?

236
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,229
Lu Shiyi. Why did you quarrel with her again?

237
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:21,470
You still need her help.

238
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,000
Xia Xiaoju.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,840
Why do you always have to provoke my fighting spirit?

240
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,870
Maybe... I can fix it.

241
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,639
- No need. There's no sound at all.
- Xiaoju.

242
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,250
Are you still mad about what happened before?

243
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,100
Sorry. I apologize to you.

244
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,269
You... You don't have to apologize.

245
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,859
You did help me improve my grades.

246
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,739
I should be the one thanking you.

247
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,470
Then can you let me take a look at it now?

248
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,690
The problem isn't too serious.

249
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,060
You can even fix a walkman?

250
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,149
It's just a hobby of mine. Jack of all trades.

251
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:24,959
Granny Liu's DVD player and Shiyi's game console

252
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,610
were all fixed by me.

253
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,359
You're brilliant, Cheng Lang. It's good that you're here.

254
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,760
Not like someone who's so annoying.

255
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,769
Xiaoju, don't worry. I'll fix it for you.

256
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,790
Okay.

257
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,490
There are words like "hardly" and "never."
<i>[258 days left until the college entrance exam]</i>

258
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,129
If we put "never," the negative adverb,

259
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:47,759
at the beginning of a sentence, the inverted sentence should look like this.

260
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,470
"Never have I seen anybody like this before."

261
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,789
So everyone needs to remember

262
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,529
what the sentence is like if the negative adverb is placed at the beginning.

263
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:08,049
I'll tell your father later. Let's see what he'll do to you.

264
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:10,130
The second kind of inverted sentence

265
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,539
has "only" in the beginning.

266
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,059
"Only in this way can we learn English well."

267
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,010
Next, I'm going to explain the third kind.

268
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,090
I didn't lie to you, right?

269
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,330
I can really hear sounds!

270
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,179
Cheng Lang. How did you fix it?

271
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:31,520
You're really brilliant.

272
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,689
It was just a minor head crash. It was very simple.
<i>(T/N: A hard-disk failure caused by an abrupt motion of the disk such as dropping it.)</i>

273
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,100
Let's go.

274
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,480
Xiaoju. Can I ask you a question?

275
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,100
Go on.

276
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,490
Will you take part in the City-Wide Sports Competition?

277
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,790
Are you afraid that it will delay your studies?

278
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,080
Lu Shiyi asked me several times about this, too.

279
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,200
Actually, it's not that I don't want to participate.

280
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,419
It's just that my grades aren't good.

281
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,179
If I spend more time and energy on training,

282
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,570
I'm afraid I can't keep up with the studying progress.

283
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,829
What you said makes sense.

284
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,990
You're right in not going.

285
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,009
I thought you came to convince me.

286
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:30,019
Studying is of course more important.

287
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,520
Yes.

288
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
You guys are all making me angry, do you know that?

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,800
You're all seniors,

290
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,100
but the core of your body is too weak.

291
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,600
I'm telling you that poor physical fitness

292
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,500
affects your memory and brain development.

293
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,300
With a bad brain, you can't get into a good university.

294
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,600
Having you train your body is for your own good.

295
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,300
But you guys won't listen to me.

296
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,600
Qiu Letao, stand up straight.

297
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,800
Bao Xiangxiang.

298
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,800
You're not convinced, are you?

299
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,600
Fine then.

300
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,100
Bao Xiangxiang, Qiu Letao, Fu Yong, you, and you.

301
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,600
Come. Go over there.

302
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,400
I'll train you each individually.

303
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,600
The other students, you're dismissed.

304
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
I'll go over there first.

305
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,500
How did it go? Did you convince Xia Xiaoju?

306
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,000
You should find someone else.

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Her grades aren't good in the first place.

308
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,200
If we pull her in, then she'll really be unable to catch up.

309
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Xia Xiaoju even turned you down?

310
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,500
She's worried it'll affect her grades.

311
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,600
It's understandable.

312
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,100
Then think of something. What should we do?

313
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,200
When the time comes, we can't really call the people from No. 14 Senior High—

314
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,800
Cheng Lang!

315
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,900
Xiaoju is here.

316
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,500
I happen to have a free period.

317
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,000
Let me help you lift the pole

318
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
to thank you for fixing my walkman.

319
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,500
Then I'll have to bother you with it, Xiaoju.

320
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,500
With your height,

321
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,800
and you want to lift the pole? How high can you lift it? Lifting the pole.

322
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,400
What do you mean?

323
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,800
I'm 1.647 meters tall, with my shoes off.

324
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,200
So tall.

325
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,500
You...

326
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,800
I won't bother arguing with you.

327
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,500
Cheng Lang. You can't jump that high, can you?

328
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,900
Your height plus your shoes is less than 1.7 meters,

329
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,600
which is usually the height of my first jump.

330
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,800
Really?

331
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,000
If you don't believe him, then compete with him.

332
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,800
I won't compete with him. I don't even know how to jump.

333
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,100
Who asked you to jump?

334
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,400
All you need to do is stand here

335
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
and hold it up to your head.

336
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
If Cheng Lang can successfully jump over your head,

337
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,600
then you have to buy us delicious food.

338
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,800
If he can't, I'll do whatever you want.

339
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,600
How about it? Think about it.

340
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,500
No! Go over there.

341
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,800
When you two make bets, why am I always roped in?

342
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,400
My mom bought me a new game console and new games.

343
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Consider it.

344
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,800
Deal.

345
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,800
Xia Xiaoju.

346
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Cheng Lang is full of confidence.

347
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,000
Now what? Are you afraid?

348
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
I... I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid at all.

349
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,100
Your face turned pale from fear.

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I didn't.

351
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
If it didn't, then come over here.

352
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Stand over there. Stop dilly-dallying and come over here.

353
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,000
Xiaoju, just stand right here.

354
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,600
Don't move. Trust me.

355
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,000
Even if I don't jump over it, I won't let you get hurt.

356
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,800
Xia Xiaoju.

357
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,200
What's wrong?

358
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,400
Xiaoju, are you okay?

359
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,500
What did you say?

360
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,100
It's over. It's over, it's over.

361
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,600
You were stupid to begin with.

362
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Cheng Lang's jump scared you into becoming even more stupid.

363
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Cheng Lang. You have to be responsible for it.

364
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,900
Xiaoju, we're still in class right now. Where are you going?

365
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,800
A bet is a bet. I'm going to buy food.

366
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,100
The class isn't dismissed, but she goes to get food.

367
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,400
What if Teacher catches her?

368
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
You did it on purpose.

369
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,000
Who told her not to accept it when I'm still being nice.

370
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,800
Just let her suffer from this lesson.

371
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,500
How could you be so petty?

372
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,200
What if the teacher really catches her?

373
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,300
Okay, okay. Stop worrying about her.

374
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,800
Care about our own happiness, okay?

375
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,400
If I remember correctly,

376
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
there should be no one at the office at this hour.

377
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,700
Our video games are still there.

378
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,590
<i>[Teachers' Office]</i>

379
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,900
Why is the door locked?

380
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,800
It's over, we're done for.

381
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,400
I'm trapped.
<i>(T/N: Lit. there's a wolf at the front and a tiger at the back.)</i>

382
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,200
Oh my, this route is dangerous.

383
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,200
Lu Shiyi.

384
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,500
Leave!

385
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,400
It's our homeroom teacher. Go!

386
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,800
Should I save him or not?

387
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,600
Forget it. So be it.

388
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,270
Xia Xiaoju.

389
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,180
Come here.

390
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,210
Who gave you permission to go out during class?

391
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,170
Mr... Mr. Zhang.

392
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,299
I'm asking you.

393
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,569
Also, you're carrying all these buns.

394
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:14,470
Who are you carrying them for?

395
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,019
Mr... Mr. Zhang.

396
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,829
It's like this. I ran too much in gym class just now.

397
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:23,779
I was very hungry, so all of these buns are for me.

398
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,139
Who do you think you're fooling?

399
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,829
How can a little girl like you eat this many buns?

400
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,549
I really can. If you don't believe me, then let me show you.

401
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,190
This Xia Xiaoju can be quite loyal.

402
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,179
You eat one, too.

403
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,699
Take it back. You... You... Put it back.

404
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,650
- Put it back.
- Mr. Zhang.

405
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,889
Just now...

406
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:15,949
I saw one of our classmates cutting class over there just now.

407
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,829
They're over there. Look.

408
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,119
You're one to talk.

409
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,509
You're the one who loves to cut class.

410
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,689
You two, listen up. Get back to class right now.

411
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:25,260
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

412
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,600
That was close.

413
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,609
Xia Xiaoju. Why did you buy buns?

414
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:40,559
Have you ever eaten potato chips and...

415
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,260
What's wrong with you?

416
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,590
Do you feel better?

417
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,899
What did you do?

418
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,179
What could I do?

419
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,469
I was saving you.

420
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,350
Wait, did you have to do this when you saved me?

421
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,949
Ignorance is really a frightening thing.

422
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,589
What I did is called the Heimlich maneuver.

423
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,690
Forget it. Forget it.

424
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,329
Seeing that you saved me just now, I won't fuss about it.

425
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,159
But you are really stupid.

426
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:17,789
I told you to go first, but you still came to get scolded.

427
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,539
How could you be so ungrateful!

428
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,949
I did it to save you.

429
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,459
If I get caught by him, I'll only be scolded.

430
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:27,299
If you get caught climbing that high, you'll be punished. Did you know that?

431
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,760
You did worry too much about me.

432
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,730
Thanks.

433
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,709
Xia Xiaoju.

434
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,469
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

435
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,680
I'll help you wash it. I'm sorry!

436
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,509
There's no tissue right now anyway.

437
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,219
This has to be washed sooner or later. Make do with this for now.

438
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,460
<i>[Everything is according to wishes]
[Wealth and prosperity]
[Everything goes smoothly]</i>

439
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,799
Are you washing a boy's clothes?

440
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,550
It's so big.

441
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,949
You want another beating, don't you?

442
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,079
Right now, the one who needs a beating is you.

443
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,709
You're actually helping a boy wash his clothes.

444
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:30,310
It's puppy love.

445
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,589
For such a little kid like you, do you even know what is puppy love?

446
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,379
Xia Jiashu, let me tell you.

447
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,349
I'll go and tell mom and dad not to let you watch TV.

448
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,959
Then I'll go and tell mom and dad that you're helping a boy wash his clothes,

449
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,660
and that you're in a puppy love.

450
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,139
You're even threatening me now, aren't you?

451
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,379
Say it one more time.

452
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,820
Xia Xiaoju is in a puppy love. She's helping a boy wash his clothes!

453
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,509
- She's in a puppy love!
- Shut up!

454
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:49,669
Xia Xiaoju is in a puppy love!

455
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:51,470
Xia Jiashu!

00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,589
Xia Jiashu, shut up!

00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,950
I'm warning you! I'll beat you to death if I catch you!

458
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,270
Jiashu.

459
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,439
How did you get so high?

460
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:05,649
It's too dangerous! It's too dangerous!

461
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:07,479
I'll get a ladder to catch you, okay?

462
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:09,590
D-D-Don't fall down, okay?

463
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,309
Jiashu, why did you have to run away?

464
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:15,649
Because you chased me!

465
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:18,569
Even if I chased you, you didn't have to climb a tree.

466
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:20,679
Neither of us can get down now. Do you know that?

467
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,709
It was because I tried to hide from you.

468
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,299
Jiashu, hold onto it tightly.

469
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,899
Don't be afraid.

470
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,000
Sister, you need to hold onto it tightly, too.

471
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,349
Jiashu, I can't hold on much longer.

472
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:37,509
I really can't hold on anymore.

473
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:40,020
Jiashu, don't move, Jiashu.

474
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,860
Why isn't auntie here yet?

475
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,560
Jiashu.

476
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,889
Jiashu, hold onto it tightly!

477
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:51,539
Can pigs even climb trees now?

478
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,809
Can you come down? Do you want some help?

479
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:55,999
Brother Shiyi, hurry and save me!

480
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,019
Jiashu, why are you up there, too?

481
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,989
I can't get down. Save me!

482
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,559
It's okay. It's okay. I'll catch you from down here.

483
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,899
No! No! It's too risky!

484
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,149
What if you misjudged and my brother falls down?

485
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:11,280
Sister, I really can't hold on much longer.

486
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,419
Come on, Jiashu, jump.

487
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,299
Trust me. I will catch you.

488
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,800
Come down.

489
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,560
Jiashu!

490
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,989
Brother Shiyi, you're really awesome!

491
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,279
Sister, hurry and jump down, too.

492
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,829
- Brother Shiyi will definitely catch you.
- No, no, no!

493
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:43,509
With your sister's weight, my arms will be rendered useless.

494
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,609
Xia Xiaoju, climb down slowly on your own.

495
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:48,530
I'll protect you from down here.

496
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,630
Be careful. Go slowly. There's no rush.

497
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,230
Sister!

498
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:12,890
♫ <i>There you are, running wildly through the highlands</i> ♫

499
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:21,430
♫ <i>Another you is sighing silently</i> ♫

500
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:27,489
♫ <i>No one is able to understand you</i> ♫

501
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:35,230
♫ <i>Happiness is not transparent and pain is not thorough</i> ♫

502
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:44,070
♫ <i>I'm glad you're not willing to give up like this</i> ♫

503
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:49,870
♫ <i>It hurts to see the stubbornness in your eyes</i> ♫

504
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:56,849
♫ <i>I'm a bit tired and need to rest</i> ♫

505
00:33:56,849 --> 00:34:04,049
♫ <i>The marks we leave in life</i> ♫

506
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:10,770
♫ <i>How I wish to travel everywhere with you</i> ♫

507
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:18,270
♫ <i>To find the meaning of my existence along the way</i> ♫

508
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:26,949
♫ <i>The hard journey of life lets the soul recuperate</i> ♫

509

♫ <i>Be brave and find yourself</i> ♫

510
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:48,750
♫ <i>The red, green, and black colors of the forest</i> ♫

511
00:34:50,510 --> 00:35:03,520
♫ <i>The purity, joy, and freedom of oneself</i> ♫

512
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:12,609
♫ <i>I wish for you to see clearly</i> ♫
