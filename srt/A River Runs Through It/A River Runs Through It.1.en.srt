Here you are.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,229
- Morning.
- Here's the money.
- It's okay.

Watch me make my move!

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,359
- I know how, too. Watch me!
- I'm great, right?

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,200
- One more time.
- Popsicles! Popsicles!

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,629
This one has a new collection.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,629
I want this book.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,120
Come on, let's go.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,340
Her family just moved here.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,909
Uncle, could you repair my shoes?

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,009
- Was this dingsheng cake sent by her family?
- Yes, yes.

16
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,309
Is her family the new neighbors that just moved in?

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,209
Thank you for the dingsheng cake.

18
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:56,079
This girl is really pretty.

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,270
- This girl is really pretty.
- Good-looking.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,719
Five, eight, five, five, six. Five, eight, five, five, seven.

21

Congratulations on moving!

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,829
This dingsheng cake is very delicious.

23
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,230
Thank you.

24
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,629
What grade is your son in?

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,339
He'll be in third grade when school starts.

26
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,979
Good for you. He looks just like you.

27
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,830
- Really?
- I can tell you have good fortune with just one look.

Xia Xiaoju?

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,229
As a girl, you're too careless.

31
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,589
You even lost your books.

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,730
Come over here. Come over here.

33
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,860
Your daughter?

34
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,970
You don't even know how to greet people.

35
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,589
This is Auntie Ding.

36
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,429
Hi, Auntie Ding.

37
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,690
Hello.

38
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,070
Which school is she in?

39
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,829
Jiangzhou. Jiangzhou No.1 Senior High School.

40
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,549
No.1 Senior High School? What grade?

41
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,479
Third grade.
<i>(T/N: China's high school is 3 years.)</i>

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,719
My son is also in third grade

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,759
and at No. 1 Senior High School.

44
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,999
- Really?
- I say what a coincidence!

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,159
Then you guys can go to school and study together.

46
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,269
That's right!

47
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,540
We moved here because of the kids.

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,739
Tell your mom to come up here and see where to put these things.

50
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:01,199
Okay, I'll be right up. I'll be right up.

51
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,999
We just moved in. Everything is a mess and we haven't cleaned up yet.

52
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,710
Congratulations to you guys on moving in.

53
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,119
And thank you for the dingsheng cake.

Why are you being so polite?

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,109
We're neighbors.

57
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,450
Right, right. Come by often when you have time.

- Okay, okay.
- Go on ahead.

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,519
- Bye, Auntie Ding.
- We'll be leaving now.
- Bye.

Goodbye.

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,359
- I'll cut it. I'll cut it.
- I still have something to do!

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,820
Sorry about that. Come in.

Jiashu, don't touch the stuff on my table, okay?

Can you give me 100 yuan?

I...

75
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,719
I want to buy a new school uniform.

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,269
100 yuan?

77
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,479
Your school uniform looks quite new to me.

78
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,879
Why do you need to buy a new one?

79

Aren't I attending a new school?

80
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,269
My school uniform is different from others.

81
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,889
Besides, Jiashu also bought a new school uniform.

82
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,269
Jiashu is only in third grade right now.

83
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,129
His new school uniform can be used until he graduates from elementary school.

84
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:08,999
But for you, you'll spend 100 yuan to buy a new school uniform only to wear it for a year.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,149
Do you have any idea how much food we could buy with a 100 yuan?

86
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,430
- How about—
- How about what? Go buy some buns.

87
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,159
I'll cook. This way, it'll be faster.

88
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,669
Hurry and go.

89
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,350
Sure.

90
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,140
Auntie, I want to buy some buns. Where should I go?

91
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,650
You want to buy buns, right?

92
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,159
Then go straight that way then turn left.

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,750
There is a vegetable market and buns are sold there.

94
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,459
- Thanks!
- You're welcome. You're welcome.

00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,999
Stop right there!

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,810
Stop right there! Stop running!

98
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,400
Stop!

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,269
Stop!

100
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,200
Stop running!

- Stop right there! Stop running!

102
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,820
Stop running!

103
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,790
Stop!

104
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,229
- Hurry! Hurry and chase him!
- Stop right there!

105
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,069
Stop!

106
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,890
Stop running away!

107
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,390
Stop where you are!

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,909
Lad, you run away quite fast.

109
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,450
Isn't this our top student of No. 1 Senior High School, Cheng Lang?

110
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,170
Special prize in the Mathematics Competition.

111
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,020
The top student is quite different!

112
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,449
You're busy even during your vacation.

113
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,140
Is he even letting us live?

114
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,420
- That's right.
- That's right.

115
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,820
If you ask me,

116
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,750
let's finish him off today.

117
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,999
- Okay!
- Here, come on! Come on!

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,999
Get off! Get off!

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,670
Get off.

120
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,119
Lu Shiyi.

121
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,669
If you want the trophy, earn it yourself.

122
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,069
Hurry and get out of my way.

123
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,049
- Don't go!
- I can get out of the way.

124
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,669
If you want to live, then leave the trophy.

125
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,549
Continue like this, and I'll call for help.

126
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,460
- Move him to the side.
- Call out then!

127
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,949
Move him aside.

128
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,990
Let's see who you can call for help.

129
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,670
Search him.

130
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,860
Isn't he too poor?

131
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,589
He doesn't even have a single penny?

132
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,419
Tell me, where did you put the money?

133
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,700
Where did you put the money?

134
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,390
I'm asking you. You—

135
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,069
Bao Xiangxiang! Lu Shiyi!

136
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,509
And you, and you!

137
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,439
You four are all addicted to acting, aren't you?

138
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,860
All of you hurry and go home.

139
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,550
Do you hear me?

140
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,070
Hurry and go home.

141
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,929
Cheng Lang, you're no fun!

142
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:50,599
That's right. It's too boring.
<i>(T/N: "Wu liao" literally means "no talk.")</i>

143
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,910
Then how do you want to "have a talk?"

144
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,640
Lu Shiyi, it looks like you're very skilled at blocking and robbing people.

145
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,349
You do bad things quite often, right?

146
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,720
Don't you clearly know whether I've done anything bad?

147
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,919
For us, besides not sleeping together,

148
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,720
all the other times we're inseparable.

149
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,019
That's not right.

150
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:11,970
Sometimes we're together even when sleeping.

151
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,580
- Okay, okay.
- You two...

152
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,649
- Hurry and go home. Get on your bike. Get on your bike.
- You two are disgusting!

153
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:16,829
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

154
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,489
Who was it that said

155
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:20,159
to finish off our Cheng Lang just now?

156
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,800
Was it you?

157
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,789
- Was it you?
- Baobao! Baobao!

158
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,669
Stop right there!

159
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,319
Lu Shiyi, that's not fair.

160
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,349
You guys are going too far.

161
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,479
I'm telling you.

162
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,829
We agreed to prank Cheng Lang.

163
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,999
Why are you turning against me?

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,980
<i>[Guanghui Lane]</i>

165
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,140
Dad.

166
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,550
Jiashu, stay far away.

167
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,549
- Dad, I'm going to light it.
- Go ahead.

168
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:47,550
Step back a bit.

169
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,060
Are you all right?

170
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,690
Sorry about that.

171
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,229
Xiaoju, come over here.

172
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,300
It's not lit.

173
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,040
It's okay.

174
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,480
Here.

175
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
What happened?

176
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,279
What's going on here?

177
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,319
A wedding?

178
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,300
Who gets married at this time?

179
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,569
I'm guessing someone just moved in and is lighting up the fireworks to celebrate.

180
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,999
Dad, I'm afraid to.

181
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,720
That girl is very dumb.

182
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,340
She doesn't look smart at all.

183
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,890
What's wrong? I'm just being honest.

184
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,759
What's so scary about setting off firecrackers?

185
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,500
- Girls are just different.
- Yes.

186
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,620
I've always liked setting off firecrackers since I was young.

187
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,250
- Hold onto it well.
- Okay.

188
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,470
Oh no, I'm done for.

189
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,109
I didn't mean to just now.

190
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,409
Get out.

191
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:50,610
Don't bother me when I'm reading my book.

192
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,079
I'm sorry. I'm here to sincerely apologize—

193
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,980
Don't step on my carpet.

194
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,789
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

195
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:00,229
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

196
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,670
How much are your apologies worth?

197
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,969
If saying sorry works, then come and turn around. Let me blow up your bottom, too.

198
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:08,429
Wait... Why are you like this?

199
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:09,669
I have always been like this.

200
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,569
Do you refuse? Get out.

201
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:14,199
- You.
- Get out! Don't you understand it? Get out!

202
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:17,279
Lu Shiyi! How can you talk like that?

203
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,029
I'm truly sorry.

204
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,829
It's Xiaoju's fault. She's too careless.

205
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:25,579
You see, we just moved in and we don't have anything.

206
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:30,549
- I asked her father to buy some nutritious tonics for the child. Later, we'll come by and apologize.
- It's okay.

207
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,849
Kid, I apologize to you.

208
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:35,199
It's okay. There's no need, Auntie.

209
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,479
It's just a small injury. Boys have rough thick skin.

210
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,399
Just put on some ointment and he'll be fine.

211
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,099
From what I see, it's this kid who's being naughty.

212
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:43,539
Otherwise, why did it blow up on you and not the others?

213
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:46,329
You should take the kid to the hospital for a check-up.

214
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:47,939
What if there's inflammation?

215
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:50,269
It's really nothing. I'm a doctor.

216
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,280
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.

217
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,749
You're just our school doctor. How is that considered a doctor? Really...

218
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,319
- What did you say?
- Did I say something wrong?

219
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:58,680
You.

220
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,569
This is for the kid's medical bill.

221
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,329
Sister Feng, don't be so polite.

222
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:06,819
- Why are you being so polite? Hurry and take it.
- We're all neighbors. I can't take this.

223
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:09,370
Here. Kid, take it. Hurry and take it, okay?

224
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,500
Okay, we won't not bother you guys anymore. We'll leave now.

225
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,549
- Xiaoju.
- Sister Feng, don't be so courteous.

226
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:14,719
Don't be so polite. Let's go.

227
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,610
Thanks, Auntie!

228
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,710
<i>[The community is a family. Love between everyone.]</i>

229
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,469
Look at you.

230
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,009
How old are you already?

231
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,879
When will you start being sensible?

232
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,289
When I was your age, I started making money.

233
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,109
Nothing big happened.

234
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:39,789
Besides, Xiaoju didn't do it on purpose.

235
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:41,399
We're moving in today. Be happier, okay?

236
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,299
Okay, fine. Go and do your thing.

237
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,640
Here, here. Let me.

238
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,079
What are you doing?

239
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,749
Mom, what you're doing is stealing water.

240
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:22,199
What do you mean stealing water?

241
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,890
This is me saving money.

242
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,489
We just moved in and already compensated someone a sum of money.

243
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:28,760
It's all because of you.

244
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,919
Okay, fine. You hurry and go do what you need to do.

245
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,150
Stop hindering me here.

246
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,910
Really!

247
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,379
I'll make a suggestion, okay? This is the first meal after moving in today.

248
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,549
- To a fresh start.
- Sure.

249
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:51,280
Cheers.

250
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,470
You worked hard today, Mom and Dad.

251
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,530
Jiashu, you even know how to care for Dad and Mom.

252
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,379
Here, here. I'll reward you with this big drumstick.

253
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,879
- Here.
- Thanks, Mom.

254
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,570
Thank you, Mom.

255
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,250
- Xiaoju, here.
- Eat more.

256
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,710
Thanks, Dad.

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,449
Dad.

258
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:20,529
Will joining the new Jiangzhou construction team be hard work for you?

259
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,199
Are you worried about me?

260
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,439
Don't worry.

261
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,390
At least I'm a leader now.

262
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,639
Really! It won't be like before where I do heavy work every day.

263
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,909
Your brother and you are in new schools.

264
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,099
Don't worry about the affairs at home.

265
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,769
Your task is to study hard.

266
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:40,050
Right, you need to study hard.

267
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,469
I will definitely study hard.

268
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,850
I'll buy you guys a big house in the future.

269
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,259
- Okay!
- Okay! We will wait to live in your big house.

270
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:52,279
Such a flatterer.

271
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,910
Eat some more.

272
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,059
Can you sit up?

273
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,659
You can't sit up, right? Then just lie down and eat.

274
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,699
Come. Here.

275
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,640
Hurry and eat it while it's hot.

276
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,810
Dad.

277
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,840
I'm a patient.

278
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,749
Are you only giving me this to eat?

279
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:36,129
All right.

280
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:38,279
When will Mom return from her business trip?

281
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,069
It's not bad that you have something to eat. Hurry up.

282
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,469
Dad.

283
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,149
Can you give me the compensation money that they gave me

284
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,399
so that I can go out and buy something good for us to eat?

285
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,209
Don't you even think about it.

286
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,859
It's their money.

287
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:55,129
Return the money after dinner.

288
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:57,129
No, why do we need to bring it back?

289
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:58,779
They blew up my bottom like this.

290
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,889
That is my compensation. Why do we need to give it back?

291
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,299
What do you need the money for?

292
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:03,519
For video games?

293
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,669
Look at your grades now.

294
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,819
Look at Cheng Lang. He never plays video games.

295
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:09,099
And his grades are like that.

296
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:11,489
Even now, you don't reflect on yourself at all.

297
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,129
Where can I even show my face?

298
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:15,609
Dad, Dad! My bottom hurts. I'll just go back to my room and lay down.

299
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:18,169
Don't even try it. Finish your dinner first.

300
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,450
<i>Langlang, it's time for dinner.</i>

301
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,080
Coming.

302
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,150
Such a feast today.

303
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,329
My son won a trophy.

304
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:50,340
We must celebrate it.

305
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,489
When you came home with the trophy today, they all envied me.

306
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,009
They were praising you for being outstanding,

307
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:57,649
and said that I was blessed.

308
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,379
You doing this well in math is because you inherited it from your dad.

309
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:04,549
Back then, your dad helped the mathematics—

310
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,590
Anyway, you don't take after me.

311
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,929
Mom.

312
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:20,610
You have something that no one else can compare to.

313
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,909
What is it?

314
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:24,399
You have good sight. With just one glance and you chose my dad.

315
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:26,319
Then you gave birth to such a smart son like me.

316
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,689
Right?

317
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:30,180
You just know how to make me happy.

318
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,910
Let's eat.

319
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,589
Is Shiyi's injury from the fireworks serious?

320
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:39,809
It's not that serious.

321
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,349
You know how Shiyi is.

322
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,969
Even for a scratch, he'd act as if it's awful.

323
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:45,239
I'm guessing when school starts tomorrow,

324
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,529
he'd use this to ask for a sick leave.

325
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:50,109
The new girl who just moved in was badly frightened.

326
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,760
I heard that her family even dropped by to apologize.

327
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,139
They even gave money for nourishments.

328
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,999
Shiyi didn't even get to hold onto it long before Uncle Lu took it away.

329
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:58,209
It was to give it back to them.

330
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,739
You shouldn't take other people's money.

331
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:01,759
We'll all be neighbors in the future.

332
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,569
Eat. I forgot about the rice.

333
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:06,160
I'll do it. Give it to me.

334
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,640
Mom.

335
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,330
I pressed the cook button.

336
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,500
Is the rice cooker broken?

337
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,700
This...

338
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,630
<i>How can I be so dumb?</i>

339
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,700
<i>Don't laugh! You're not allowed to laugh!</i>

340
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,799
All right, stop playing around.

341
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,799
Xiaoju, hurry and go to sleep.

342
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,799
All right, stop playing. Hurry and go to sleep.

343
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,129
What are you dawdling for? Hurry and go to sleep.

344
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,799
Mom, I'm already this old and I still share a room with Jiashu.

345
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,049
It's inconvenient.

346
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,649
What's so inconvenient? He's your younger brother.

347
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,029
Besides, there are only two rooms in this house.

348
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:15,310
Where should Jiashu sleep?

349
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,549
- Then—
- All right, stop being picky.

350
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:20,409
Jiashu is growing right now.

351
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,659
If he doesn't sleep, how will he grow?

352
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:23,809
Do you hear me?

353
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:25,720
Hurry and go to sleep!

354
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,270
Why did we move at all?

355
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,170
At the old house, I could at least have my own room.

356
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,759
Sister, I can't sleep.

357
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,899
Come over here and tell me a story.

358
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:41,739
Do you even dare to ask me to tell you a story?

359
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:44,110
You want to get a beating, don't you?

360
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,300
Jiashu.

361
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,709
Jiashu. Then I will tell you a fairy tale, okay?

362
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:55,839
Sure.

363
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,669
Then wait a bit. I'll go and create the atmosphere.

364
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,159
Once upon a time, there was an old Grandma Bear.

365
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,870
She lived in the mountains.

366
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,449
The only food she had

367
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,349
were children's fingers.

368
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:23,179
At this time, outside her door

369
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:29,109
a chubby boy passed by.

370
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,209
Quicker than words can tell,

371
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:37,979
she suddenly rushed in front of him, grabbed onto his neck then said,

372
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:45,100
"Jiashu. Jiashu."

373
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,880
"Hurry and let me take you away."

374
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,510
"I haven't eaten kids in a long time."

375
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,480
<i>Mom, there's a ghost! Mom!</i>

376
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,799
My god, Xia Jiashu! You're such a coward!

377
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,900
I was counting on you to protect me!

378
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,390
Time to sleep!

379
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,740
It's very spacious!

380
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,020
Xia Xiaoju.

381
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,409
Xia Xiaoju. Wake up.

382
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,330
This kid, seriously!

383
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,630
Look at you. You have gone wild from your vacation.

384
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,370
Don't you know today is the first day of school?

385
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,419
Mom. Why didn't my alarm go off?

386
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,180
I made it. I made it.

387
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,300
<i>[309 days until the college entrance exam]</i>

388
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,999
- Hello, Ms. Wang.
- Good morning.

389
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,060
Who's that?

390
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,589
She's the new classmate, right?

391
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,550
Which school's uniform is she wearing?

392
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,320
It seems like she's in Class 8.

393
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,740
Today is the first day of school.

394
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,879
Firstly, let me introduce you...

395
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,759
Come in. Come in.

396
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,200
She's the new transfer student in our class.

397
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,620
Next, let's have her introduce herself.

398
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,840
H-Hello, everyone.

399
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,190
I'm Xia Xiaoju.

400
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,210
Right, there's even a transfer student at this time?

401
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,879
- Which school was she originally from?
- Why did she come here?

402
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,290
Are her grades especially good?

403
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,020
Is that all?

404
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,900
I've never seen her before.

405
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,349
The new classmate is a bit introverted.

406
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,210
From now on, communicate more with her,

407
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,149
and help her out. Do you hear me?

408
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:08,690
Yes.

409
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,290
I have an idea.

410
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,969
Xiaoju, today is the first day of school.

411
00:23:13,969 --> 00:23:15,410
Why don't you do the roll call?

412
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,050
This way, you can use this opportunity to get to know your classmates.

413
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,510
All of you need to cooperate.

414
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,289
Whoever's name gets called, raise your hand and say that you're here.

415
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,959
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

416
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,229
- Liu Xiaochuan.
- Present.

417
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,929
- Cheng Lang.
- Here.

418
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,939
- Qiu Letao.
- Present.

419
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,249
- Li Chenfei.
- Here.

420
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,439
- Bao Xiangxiang.
- Here, here, here. I'm Bao Xiangxiang.

421
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,380
Remember it!

422
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,100
Lu...

423
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,260
Lu Tiwei?

424
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,200
Who's that?

425
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,030
There's no one in this class with that name, right?

426
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,170
It's Lu Shiyi.

427
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,380
Those two characters are read as Shiyi.

428
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,930
Out of the three characters, you misread two of them.

429
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,260
No wonder my right eyelid kept flinching when I left home this morning.
<i>(T/N: Right side means something bad will happen.)</i>

430
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,480
It turns out it's because you're in our class.

431
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,359
Attention, everyone. Lu Shiyi will now change his name to Lu Tiwei.

432
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,830
He's tampering with the sports commission's power!
<i>(T/N: Tiwei is a homophone for sports commission.)</i>

433
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,419
- Bao Xiangxiang!
- Please take care of me in the future!

434
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:51,290
Sit down.

435
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,119
What's going on? What's going on? Be quiet!

436
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,469
Lu Shiyi, are you late again?

437
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,229
- I'm not.
- What do you mean you weren't.

438
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:01,260
I saw you jumping in through the window.

439
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,219
Try being late again and see how I'll deal with you.

440
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,380
Okay, it's getting late.

441
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,570
We're not going to do the attendance anymore.

442
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,580
Take that seat for now.

443
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,880
I'll assign you another one later.

444
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,560
Thank you, Teacher.

445
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,590
Uneducated.

446
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,589
Brother "Sports Commission," I thought you weren't coming today.

447
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,210
Who is your Brother "Sports Commission?"

448
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,670
Don't learn from those who are uneducated.

449
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,979
Class. Today, let's review past perfect tense.

450
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:41,299
What does past perfect tense mean?
<i>[Grade 3, Class 8]</i>

451
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,900
Goodbye, Teacher.

452
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,689
Stop playing. Let's go. Let's go out.

453
00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:02,899
- Where to?
- Accompany me to the bathroom. Hurry, hurry!

454
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:04,399
Why are you so troublesome?

455
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,730
Let's go. Let's go.

456
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,790
Hurry up and go.

457
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,639
Hello.

458
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,520
I'm Qiu Letao.

459
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,540
<i>[Little Tigers]
(T/N: Taiwanese boy band from 1988 to 1995.)</i>

460
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,909
Do you like Little Tigers, too? I like them very much!

461
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:34,910
I love Thunder tiger the most. You?
<i>(T/N: Nicky Wu, Wu Qilong)</i>

462
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,469
- I like Well-behaved tiger.
- W-Well-behaved tiger?
<i>(T/N: Alec Su, Su Youpeng)</i>

463
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,980
Well-behaved tiger is very good, too.

464
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,920
I can take you to a stationery store later.

465
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,569
They have many posters that other places don't have.

466
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,120
Careful.

467
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,200
Seriously!

468
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,889
By the way, why are you transferring when you're already in third grade?

469
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:57,530
It's because my family moved here.

470
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:01,279
- So that's why—
- Over there is the cafeteria, and over there is a small student store.

471
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,329
If anyone bullies you in the future, just tell me.

472
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,879
What are you doing? You scared me to death!

473
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,530
Were you scared?

474
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,180
It'd be good if you don't scare others.

475
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,039
I already told you. I won't tell others that your bottom

476
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,110
- blew up.
- Be quiet!

477
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,910
I'm warning you.

478
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,100
About my bottom. If you let a fourth person know about it...

479
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,500
I can't guarantee I won't do something.

480
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,450
Do you hear me?

481
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,900
You can rest assured.

482
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,700
The matter about your bottom being lit up—

483
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,809
About being lit up, I won't tell anyone.

484
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,429
Pinkie promise, okay? Pinkie promise.

485
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,670
Childish.

486
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,930
Xia Xiaoju.

487
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,340
Mind your tongue.

488
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,800
Xiaoju.

489
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,390
Wh-What happened?

490
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,610
I just turned around and you were gone.

491
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,859
- Are you having trouble with him?
- Not at all.

492
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:57,920
Let's go.

493
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,799
If not, then that's good. Don't mind him.

494
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,510
Let's go.

495
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,349
Oh right, you didn't answer my question just now.

496
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,819
Transferring during the third grade, can you keep your grades up?

497
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:13,030
My grades at my last school were okay, especially in Geography.

498
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,829
I think it shouldn't be a problem.

499
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,779
For angles A, B, and C, the opposite sides
<i>(T/N: Law of Sines)</i>

500
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:22,310
are a, b, and c. Vector M equals one, lambda times sin A.

501
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,630
Vector N equals sin A, one plus cos A.

502
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,660
Given vector M is parallel to vector N

503
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,099
and lambda equals two. What's the degree of angle A?

504
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:35,349
Lu Shiyi. What are you doing?

505
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:39,279
- I'm listening.
- Okay, come and solve this problem.

506
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,059
I don't know how to, but I feel like the newcomer, Xia Xiaoju, is very earnest.

507
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,960
Why don't we have her tell us about it?

508
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,690
Xia Xiaoju.

509
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,409
Don't be nervous, okay? This is a basic problem.

510
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:58,369
Come and stand up. Loudly tell everyone what your answer is.

511
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,500
Zero?

512
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,309
Zero? I'm asking you what the angle of A is.

513
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,150
No matter how you calculate it, it can't be zero.

514
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,360
Everyone, take a look at your tests.

515
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,790
- Hurry and correct the problems that you got wrong.
- It's okay. We'll get it right next time.

516
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,020
Everyone, don't panic!

517
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,609
Oh my goodness. Xia Xiaoju, you're so dumb.

518
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:46,860
Even saying that my grades were fine.

519
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,679
- That's embarrassing.
- Careful.

520
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,170
Be careful of getting burned.

521
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,370
Thanks.

522
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,860
What a coincidence.

523
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,000
We're in the same class.

524
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,060
Is the mathematics curriculum at your old school different than ours?

525
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,740
Don't talk about it.

526
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,960
I find myself humiliating.

527
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,759
Don't worry. It's common for a transfer student.

528
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,480
Are all of your school's basic questions this hard?

529
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,330
I'm confused upon reading them.

530
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,779
The teaching pace at our school is a little faster than others,

531
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:21,380
but it shouldn't be considered hard.

532
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,520
I think that you just need to learn it slowly, and you'll eventually catch up.

533
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,030
Of course, you won't think it's hard.

534
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,580
Third place in the national physics competition.

535
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,010
First place in the math competition in the city.

536
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,549
If you think it's hard, then I don't even need to learn it.

537
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,360
You're quite well-informed.

538
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,869
Mr. Monitor, you're famous in the school.

539
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,900
I truly admire you.

540
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,210
I find you quite humorous.

541
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,960
Really?

542
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,660
My classmates used to say that, too.

543
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,639
Has he recovered?

544
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,429
Playing basketball already?

545
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,429
He's not fully recovered yet.

546
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,229
But he's the type that can't sit idly.

547
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,590
His hands will itch if he doesn't play sports everyday.

548
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,640
Excuse me, move out of the way!

549
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,740
- Oh my!
- Are you all right?

550
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,919
I-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

551
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,940
- I didn't do it on purpose. A-Are you—
- Shut up!

552
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,330
I really didn't do it on purpose. Someone bumped into me.

553
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,439
Are you all right? Do you need to go to the infirmary?

554
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:27,519
- Go to your dad and have him take a look, Shiyi.
- I'm not going.

555
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,020
I'm telling you, Xia Xiaoju.

556
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,069
I get bad luck whenever I see you!

557
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,829
Let's go.

558
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,999
Shiyi, are you really okay?

559
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,020
I'm fine.

560
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,959
I'm done for. I offended him again.

561
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,540
Did I interrupt you?

562
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,960
Nope.

563
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,679
How can I help you?

564
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
I...

565
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,589
This is an anti-inflammatory medicine.

566
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,530
Can you...

567
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,760
Can you help me give it Lu Shiyi?

568
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,510
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

569
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,480
I don't dare to.

570
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,109
I wounded his bottom yesterday.

571
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,940
Just now, I spilled hot water on his wound.

572
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,469
What? Did you wound our Shiyi's bottom?

573
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,110
Shut up.

574
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,700
Was his bottom wounded? What happened?

575
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,350
- I never thought that her and Shiyi...
- Right?

576
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,140
Brother Lin, it seems like your business is doing well.

577
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,129
<i>It's not bad.
[Guanghui Hair Salon]</i>

578
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,260
Xia Jiashu.

579
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,370
I'm saying it for the last time.

580
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,160
I miss you guys so much.

581
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,210
<i>[Hero Ju, you're the best!]
[Hero Ju, I can't bear for you to leave. I know you will do well. Take care of yourself!]</i>

582
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,880
It would have been nice if I didn't have to transfer schools.

583
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,209
Xiaoju, what are you looking at?

584
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:53,710
N-Nothing.

585
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,940
If you have the time, read more books.

586
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,109
Always doing these useless things.

587
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:02,239
Mom, this isn't something useless.

588
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:04,159
They're parting gifts from my classmates.

589
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,559
What gifts?

590
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,770
You're not that old, but you have so many tricks.

591
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,480
You've transferred schools a week ago.

592
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,520
How's your studying going so far?

593
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,250
Not that great.

594
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,460
What? "Not that great?"

595
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,569
I'm telling you. To get you enrolled here,

596
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:25,999
your dad and I worked hard and paid a lot of money.

597
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,839
You're not doing that well in school?

598
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,940
Seriously!

599
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,530
Did you guys really do it for me?

600
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,370
What did you say?

601
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,469
I didn't say anything.

602
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,949
I'm telling you.

603
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,960
I heard that there are top students at this school.

604
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,360
You need to follow these top students more often

605
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,970
and learn from them.

606
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:49,159
You should also become a top student to make me happy.

607
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,749
Mom, our family is not equipped with the genetics of a top student.

608
00:34:52,749 --> 00:34:54,870
What are you saying?

609
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,350
Mom. The placement test in the new school,

610
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:00,380
I was the first in the entire grade.

611
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,949
You're great, Jiashu!

612
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,250
Mom will make some good food for you tomorrow.

613
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,669
Listen to what your brother said.

614
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,159
You're not working hard, and you're making up excuses.

615
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,430
Xia Jiashu.

616
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,389
Okay, that's enough. Stop glaring at your younger brother.

617
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:17,419
Aren't you humiliated? Hurry and read your books.

618
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:20,260
Stop doing these useless stuff everyday.

619
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,420
Seriously!

620
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,429
I'm warning you.

621
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,169
If your mouth is annoying again, I'll beat you up. Don't think I won't do it.

622
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:33,110
I'm telling the truth.

623
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,210
Who told you to have such bad grades.

624
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,980
And you're blaming me?

625
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,420
If I don't blame you, who will I blame?

626
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,229
If it wasn't because you wanted to transfer to a key elementary school

627
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,730
and we had to move here,

628
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,760
would I have transferred schools during my last year?

629
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,390
I couldn't adapt to it at all.

630
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,590
It's clearly because you're dumb.

631
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,439
You're not good at studying. How can you blame me for it?

632
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:55,489
Get out! I get annoyed whenever I see you.

633
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,970
What makes you think you can be like this?

634
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,530
This is my room, too.

635
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,859
If you bully me again, I'll tell our mom.

636
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,700
All you know is how to use Mom to pressure me.

637
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,260
- Thank you.
- Okay.

638
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,120
Sorry about that.

639
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,539
Happy New Year! What are you doing? Get up! Get up!

640
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,519
Everyone, hurry and take a look!

641
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,119
Xia Xiaoju's shoes are worn out.

642
