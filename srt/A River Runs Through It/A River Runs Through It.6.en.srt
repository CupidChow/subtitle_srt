00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,400
<i>[A River Runs Through It]</i>

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,400
<i>[Episode 6: Our smallness and greatness, part II]</i>

3
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,830
<i>[3 days until the college entrance exam]</i>

4
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,910
<i>[Fighting for our dreams! / This is your final fight based on your abilities for your future! / Dear teachers, you have worked hard!]</i>

5
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:49,759
Students, this is our last class meeting.

6
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,359
Normally in these meetings,

7
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,439
we would talk about grades,

8
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,759
but we won't do that today.

9
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,040
Let's talk about something else.

10
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:04,780
As your teacher, who spent the last three years of high school with everyone,

11
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,270
I've personally witnessed your efforts and hard work.

12
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,339
Of course, I have also witnessed your naughtiness and playfulness.

13
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:16,130
Many students say,

14
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,390
"It would have been better if our homeroom teacher was gentler and nicer."

15
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,230
I'll satisfy everyone.

16
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,630
Today I'll be gentle and nice for once.

17
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:39,469
These are all the things I have confiscated over the past three years.

18
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,749
You should remember and recognize these.

19
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,720
Hurry and come up to take them back.

20
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,240
What's wrong with all of you today?

21
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,959
Lu Shiyi.

22
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,629
Don't you normally fear nothing?

23
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,669
Most of the things here are yours.

24
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,520
Come up and take the lead.

25
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,600
What's wrong?

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,160
Have all of you become shy today?

27
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,599
That's right. I remember I confiscated your game machine,

28
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,439
but no matter how hard I looked, I couldn't find it.

29
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,549
Today, I want to apologize to you.

30
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,750
I failed to protect your personal items.

31
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,079
Teacher, that game machine...

33
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,710
I took it back myself previously.

34
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,410
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,189
You...

36
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,909
Little brat!

37
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,920
You are asking for a scolding!

38
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,610
Sit.

39
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,599
From all the students in this class,

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,260
the person who made me mad the most is you,

41
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,830
but I still always thought highly of you.

42
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:12,380
Students, graduation is not the end.

43
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,509
On the contrary, it's a new start.

44
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,549
I sincerely hope that in your life ahead,

45
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,999
when you're in a difficult situation, you can overcome the wind and waves to success.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,069
When facing difficulty, to never give up!

47
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,020
You must learn to be grateful.

48
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,209
Be thankful for your parents.

49
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:37,719
Their love for you is endless.

50
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,230
You must also be thankful for yourselves.

51
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,010
The person you are today is because of the hard work you put in yesterday.

52
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,319
Let's not forget the school we came from

53
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,470
and meet again in society.

54
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,999
The college entrance exam is imminent.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,549
I will only ask one thing.

56
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,389
Do you have confidence?

57
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,269
- Yes.
- Yes.

58
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,039
Louder! I can't hear you.

59
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,670
- Yes!
- Yes!

60
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,340
Very good.

61
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,229
Class dismissed.

62
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,090
Stand up!

63
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,050
♫ <i>My heart is drifting looking for a dream that lost its way</i> ♫

64
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,310
♫ <i>I still sing, my strength and stubbornness will shine</i> ♫

65
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,490
Goodbye, Teacher. Thank you, Teacher!

66
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,850
♫ <i>The sun that uses the cleansing rain will once again become crazy for me</i> ♫

67
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,510
♫ <i>Fly against the wind</i> ♫

68
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,890
Jiashu, are you waiting for me?

69
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,489
Xiaoju, are you all ready?

70
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,309
The red shirt is a good choice.
(TN: Red is thought to bring good luck.)

71
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:22,509
It's auspicious.

72
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,859
And the logo is a big checkmark!

73
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:27,039
When you're answering the questions, you're sure to get them right!

74
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,050
Your mom's right!

75
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,400
Sister, fighting!

76
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,509
- All right.
- Check one more time!

77
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,639
Right, hurry and check.

78
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,509
Admission card, ID card.

79
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,639
- Pens.
- Pencil, pens, and erasers.

80
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,949
All right, they're all here.

81
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,650
And this. Hurry.

82
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,650
- All right.
- Good.

83
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,240
- I'm leaving.
- Bye, Sister!

84
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,159
- Fighting, Sister! You'll get it all right!
- Read it carefully!

85
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Fighting! Fighting!

86
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,669
I'm so nervous.

87
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,599
<i>All my hard work these past years</i>

88
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,159
<i>is for this day.</i>

89
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,640
<i>If we mess up, all of our hard work would've been in vain. </i>

90
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,629
Mom, you really don't need to go. It's not the first time I am taking a test.
<i>[During College Entrance Exams, we'll be closed for three days.]</i>

91
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:18,230
The College Entrance Exam isn't a normal exam.

92
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,789
It's fine if I don't do business. Let's go.

93
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,069
Mom, think about it.

94
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,740
If you go, I will get nervous while taking the test.

95
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,340
Isn't it?

96
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,999
All right. Do your very best.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,109
Don't be nervous.

98
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,389
Also, don't be careless.

99
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,979
- I understand.
- I believe in you.

100
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:36,879
You won't have any problems.

101
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,229
Don't worry, Mom. I'll go then.

102
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,480
Hold on.

103
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,180
Give me your hand.

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,669
Fighting!

105
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,069
Yes!

106
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,350
Then, Mom, hurry and go back.

107
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,550
I'm off. Wait for my return.

108
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,509
When you come back, I will cook something good for you.

109
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,110
Okay!

110
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,510
I'm begging you.

111
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,439
Hurry and go back. I'm already this old.

112
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,669
I don't need someone to send me to the exam.

113
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,700
It's embarrassing.

114
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,600
How is it embarrassing?

115
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,999
Don't ride the bike.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,829
The two of us will take a taxi.

117
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,109
I must personally see you enter the testing site.

118
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,780
Cheng Lang, come take a taxi with us.

119
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,549
It's okay, Uncle Lu. I'll go by bike.

120
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,999
- See you there.
- See you.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,700
Let's go.

122
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,689
- During the exam, read the questions carefully.
- I know!

123
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:21,669
Read the questions in detail.

124
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,870
Stop holding me.

125
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,669
- Don't rush to answer.
- Okay! I get it!

126
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,719
Read the questions clearly.

127
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,370
Stop talking, I know!

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,269
Xiaoju, why are you crouching here?

129
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,669
Why are you here, Dad?

130
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,249
I was worried after you left, so I came to see you off.

131
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:43,669
What's wrong?

132
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,920
Dad, my stomach hurts.

133
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,070
Stomach? Weren't you fine at home just now?

134
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,229
I don't know. It might be because of the garlic juice.

135
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,830
This... This is so...

136
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,699
Dad, let's hurry and go.

137
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,909
- I need to take the exam.
- Listen to me. Sit here.

138
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,589
Here.

139
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,839
Let me ask you, can you persevere through?

140
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,280
- I can.
- Okay.

141
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,600
Wait for me here.

142
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,279
There's a pharmacy up ahead. I'll go buy some medicine for you.

143
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,549
Dad, then go quickly.

144
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,939
All right, wait here.

145
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:09,349
Hang in there.

146
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,960
Dad, go quickly!

147
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,439
Come on. Hurry!

148
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,759
Hurry, we're about to be late.

149
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,360
Wait for me!

150
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,150
Stop dawdling! Hurry!

151
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,210
- Xiaoju!
- Dad.

152
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,110
Here. Take it three times a day.

153
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,440
Is it hot?

154
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,760
Dad, let's hurry and go!

155
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,010
Here!

156
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,110
Dad. Dad.

157
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,580
Dad! Dad!

158
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,260
Dad!

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,670
Dad!

160
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,350
Dad!

161
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,480
Get up, Dad.

162
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,469
Dad.

163
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,790
Get up, Dad.

164
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,789
Help!

165
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:18,010
Anyone?

166
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,229

I'm sorry.

You did nothing wrong.

That's right. Let them go with him.

With your scores, you can still be an undergraduate.

Look at me.

389
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,400
I don't even have the qualifications to go to college.

390

I wonder how is Cheng Lang doing.

Lu Shiyi, don't you have the best relationship with Cheng Lang?

392

You have to comfort him.

393
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,800
That's right. You should go visit him often.

394
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,300
I called him today, but he didn't come.

395
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,200
That's right. You should go over to his house if you aren't busy.

396
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,500
All right, enough.

397
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,200
Do you really think Cheng Lang is that weak?

398
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
You look too down on him.

399
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,300
Here. Today Cheng Lang is absent.

400
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,100

411
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,500
can't bear to part ways with any of you.

412

No, I...

I just hate to part ways with everyone.

417
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,800
- I...
- All right. Stop being so sentimental.

418
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,900

you got into Jiangzhou University!

427
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,700
Was it the Mr. Confucius your parents found you super effective?

428
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,100
When you mention him, I get angry!

429
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,400
He's just a liar.

430
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,800
What effect?

431
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,200
I just so happen to have this newspaper with me.

432
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,000
Look.

434
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Pass it on to see.

435
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,600
That Mr. Confucius

436
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
tricked me into drinking so much garlic juice.

437
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,800
He caused me a stomachache the morning of the exam.

438
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,200
If it wasn't for my upset stomach,

439
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,400
I feel I could have done even better!

440
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,000
Weren't there walnuts added into the garlic juice?

441
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,100
Based on my guess, if it weren't for those walnuts,

442
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,800
you wouldn't have even made it to college!

443
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,400
Everyone knows what's your brain like, right?

444
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,300
With so many classmates here,

445
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,600
give me some face, all right?

446

That's more like it.

Everyone should be happy.

448
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,800

but I'm still happy.

is to rest and play. Rest and play.

465
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,500
I have an idea.

466
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,200
How about we have a party?

No problem!

How long has it been since our Xia family had something worth celebrating for?

469
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,200
Let's not celebrate.

That's right.

475
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,000
Even though his mom acts like she doesn't care in front of her son,

476
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,200
when she talks with us, she is very upset.

477
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,800
She keeps blaming herself,

478
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,400
saying she should have gone along with Cheng Lang to the exam.

479
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,200
It's really a shame.

480
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Xiaoju. Look.

481
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,800
Cheng Lang helped you out a lot when preparing for the exam.

482
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,800
You have to think of a way to talk sense into him.

483
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,000
How is she able to talk sense into someone?

484
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Besides, what principles doesn't Cheng Lang know?

485
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,400
Right now, what's important is to cheer him up.

How could we make Cheng Lang happy?

488

♫ <i>There you are, running wildly through the highlands</i> ♫

493
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:07,200
♫ <i>Another you is sighing silently</i> ♫

♫ <i>I'm glad you're not willing to give up like this</i> ♫

497
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,200
♫ <i>It hurts to see the stubbornness in your eyes</i> ♫

00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:51,000
♫ <i>The purity, joy, and freedom of oneself</i> ♫

506
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,600
♫ <i>I wish for you to see clearly</i> ♫

507
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:12,900
