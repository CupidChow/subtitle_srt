Wait.

00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:42,849
Why are you here?

7
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:44,359
I'm going to the locker room.

- I...

- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

Shiyi... Shiyi, what was that just now?

00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:36,519
Sh-Sh-Sh-She might have been t-too excited that we won the tournament.

18
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,619
She went into the wrong locker room. Sh-She was too shocked.

19
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,600
X-Xiaoju also needs to change clothes?

20
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,780

You already confessed like that. How can he not take it seriously?

There are quite a lot of mosquitoes in your room. Didn't you light the mosquito-repellent incense?

51

I already lit the mosquito-repellent incense.

52

No way, it won't do. I must go find Lu Shiyi right now,

53

Sis, can I look at it after I come back later?

64
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:54,049
- It's really quick. It's just filling out the form.
- I really have something urgent!

You've already read that book over ten thousand times.

68
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,409
Why do you keep flipping it back and forth?

69
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,850
This book?

70
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,399
I forgot about it so I'm reading it again.

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,899
Here's the thing...

74
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,999
you've received many love letters from girls before.

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,109
How does it feel getting love confessions from that many girls?

76
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,259
Is there something going on? Did a girl confess to you?

77
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,039
Not me.

78
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,200
It's a friend of mine.

79
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,420

Tell me what's the situation. I'll help you analyze it.

I-It's like this, Brother Lang.

00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,999
I have a friend...

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,329
His best female buddy confessed her love to him.

86
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:12,759
Right now, he's anxious to death,

87
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,349
and doesn't know what he should do.

88
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,479
I've never dated before so I don't have any experience.

89
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,199
So I can only come here and ask you.

90
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,500
Give him some pointers.

91
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,920
A friend of yours told you this?

92
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,989
Does the friend of yours like that girl?

93
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,549
It's because he doesn't know,

94
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:31,809
so that's why he's perplexed. Or else he wouldn't have come and asked me.

95
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,039
Why are you still not answering the phone?

96
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,919
Classmate, why don't you try again tomorrow?

97
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:40,539
Yes, why don't you come again tomorrow.

98
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,489
Sorry about that. T-T-This is urgent.

99
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:45,399
Can I make one last phone call? Just one last call.

100
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,199
Hello, Lu Shiyi! T-Tomorrow afternoon, I'll...

101
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,289
H-He's not there?

102
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,440
Let me ask you this.

103
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,030
Do you think that this girl is cute?

104
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,899
She's not cute. Not at all.

105
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:05,849
- Not cute at all?
- Not cute at all.

106
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:08,300
Then don't hold her back.

107
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,559
You mean... reject her directly?

108
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:17,959
Or what else? You don't even like her.

109
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,779
I already told you, it's not me! What are you talking about?

110
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,579
Let me ask you this. Is the girl Xia Xiaoju?

111
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,979
Didn't I already tell you? It's not me!

112
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,949
It's not me! Don't you understand human language?

113
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,289
That's true. Xia Xiaoju probably...

114
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,750
probably doesn't like someone like you.

115
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,119
Wait, Cheng Lang. What do you mean?

116
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:45,379
What am I like? What do you mean Xia Xiaoju doesn't like someone like me?

117
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,179
- What's wrong with me?
- Didn't you just say that

118
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:48,859
it's not you? W-What are you getting so agitated for?

119
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,789
You can't make wild guesses either!

120
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,789
It was you who came over here to ask me!

121
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:54,739
- All right, fine.
- You really like Xia Xiaoju?

122
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:57,399
I'm not going to ask you anymore. Go back to your business.

123
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,479
I asked you and got nothing! Remember to burn some mosquito-repelling incense at night.

124
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,219
- I'm leaving now to go to sleep. Get some rest soon.
- And you're now blaming me?

125
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:03,780
Bye bye!

126
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,679
What is wrong with this Cheng Lang? Seriously!

127
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,290
He speaks carelessly once it comes down to business.

128
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:16,760
Isn't this just a rubbish talk?

129
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,779
Shiyi, your dorm's phone kept ringing just now.

130
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,780
I saw that it was too loud, so I answer it.

131
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,459
- Who called?
- I think it was a girl called Xia Xiaoju.

132
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,519
<i>Please pass on this message once he comes back.</i>

133
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,709
<i>I'll wait for him at the library entrance tomorrow at noon.</i>

134
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:36,660
Is that all? I may not be free tomorrow.

135
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,740
All right, okay. I'm leaving.

136
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,830
- Thanks, Bro.
- Okay.

137
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,200
Am I really that charming?

138
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,890
I'm too handsome.

139
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,980
Now let's talk about accounting.

140
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,839
There are typically two types of accounting.

141
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,250
One is cash basis.

142
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,810
The requirements for accounting...

143
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,519
Oh my God.

144
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,410
Why isn't class over yet?

145
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,729
Be patient, be patient. There are 5 minutes left.

146
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:14,320
Hold on for a bit longer.

147
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,239
Please take a look at page 37 of your textbooks.

148
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:21,709
There are some cases about accounting.

149
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,389
After you're done reading it, you can discuss it with the person sitting next to you.

150
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,449
Okay everyone.

151
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:41,909
Everyone should go back and digest the concepts I talked about today.

152
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,229
We'll end here today.

153
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,759
Class is over.

154
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,839
- I'm leaving.
- Okay, go ahead.

155
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,660
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

156
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,879
What's wrong with your eyes?

157
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,489
I was standing right there. Can't you see me?

158
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:07,010
I was in a hurry.

159
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,219
I thought you'd be waiting for me at the library's entrance.

160
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:11,110
You can't wait to see me?

161
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,420
I have something extremely important that I must tell you.

162
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,080
I know.

163
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,300
All right, let's go then.

164
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,079
Where to?

165
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,479
I'll take you to eat some good food. I know a very good restaurant.

166
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,839
Let's go later.

167
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,739
I really have something extremely important to tell you.

168
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,589
How can it wait?

169

171
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,930
I didn't even eat breakfast!

172
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,130
Besides, this isn't the right place for a conversation.

173
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,679
Let's go! We'll talk while we eat. Let's go, let's go!

176

<i>Actually, I can make do with Xia Xiaoju.</i>

177

178
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,320
<i>I'll just reluctantly say yes to her.</i>

179
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,369
Wait, what are you doing?

180
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,209
Give it to me. I can carry it myself.

181
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,909
Stand still.

182
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,479
Bro, I'm begging you. Act like how you were before, okay?

183
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,959
Give it to me.

184
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,199
I really can carry it myself.

185
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,960
What? Are you looking down on me?

186
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,979
- No. I'm not looking down on you.
- Stand still, then.

Hi. Two Australian angus steak combos, please.

190
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,199
- Thanks.
- Okay.

191
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,910
Please wait a moment.

192
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,329
Datu, why did you choose such an expensive place?

193
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,349
Don't worry. This meal is my treat.

194
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,349
Wait.

195
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,659
I want to talk about what happened yesterday.

196
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,350
I know.

197
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,439
Well... about what you told me yesterday,

198
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:25,690
I thought about it carefully just now on the bus.

199
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,519
I think that we can—

200
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,809
No, no!

201
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:30,930
It was a misunderstanding!

202
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,410
Misunderstanding?

203
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,349
That... I was playing truth or dare with Qiu Le Tao yesterday,

204
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,639
and I lost.

205
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,980
So I chose dare.

206
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,049
Oh, a dare?

207
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,469
You mustn't take it seriously.

208
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,440
I don't like you.

209
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,340
Did you think I would take it seriously?

210
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,220
I was afraid you'd misunderstand so I wanted to explain it to you.

211
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,739
It doesn't matter if you explain it or not, actually.

212
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:06,299
Because I didn't take it to heart at all.

213
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,320
I wouldn't misunderstand it, and especially won't take it seriously.

214
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,890
Then I'm relieved!

215
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,860
I was afraid you'd misunderstand and get angry at me just now.

216
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,789
Am I such a petty person?

217
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,939
Besides, is there something wrong with my brain? To like you?

218
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,819
You carried my bag and gave the seat to me on the bus.

219
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:32,279
You scared me! I was afraid you liked me.

220
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,710
That was called being a gentleman.

221
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,399
Also, the reason why I brought you to such a nice restaurant

222
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
was because I was worried you'd feel bad after I rejected you.

223
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,879
What were you thinking?

224
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,289
Yes, you're right. Datu is the most loyal.

225
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,470
Thanks.

226
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,639
Waitress!

227
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,709
Do you have chopsticks?

228
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,709
Shut up.

229
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,959
It's a western restaurant.

230
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,910
Aren't you embarrassed?

231
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,020
Datu! This tastes so good!

232
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,589
Datu, the steak is so delicious.

233
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,669
Let's bring Cheng Lang here next time, okay?

234
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,249
Why are you talking so much?

235
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,080
Can't you just eat your food?

236
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,229
This is really delicious!

237
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:40,590
May I ask for more?

238
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,110
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

239
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,010
I suddenly don't want to treat you anymore,

240
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,329
Datu, hurry and eat. If you can't finish it, give it to me.

241
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,280
Sorry about that.

242
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,879
Are you all right?

243
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,970
I'm fine. Thanks.

244
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,329
Why didn't you pull me?

245
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:40,589
Pull you?

246
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,329
Are you a door? Why would I pull you?

247
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,119
- We've arrived at Changde Road station. We've arrived at Changde Road station.
- Me!

248
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,409
Wait, didn't you say ladies first?

249
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:09,550
In modern society, men and women are equals.

250
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,579
Can't you see that I'm carrying such a heavy bag? Don't you know to offer me the seat?

251
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:16,739
You're not elderly or handicapped. Why should I give it to you?

252
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,059
Datu! Where are you going?

253
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,830
Do you want to go to the library together?

254
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,279
Why do you care where I go? Can you stop following me?

255
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,049
That Datu. Your mood changes faster than flipping books!

256
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,010
<i>[Weng You Library]</i>

257
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,160
Strange.

258
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,980
Why am I this angry?

259
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,419
<i>You mustn't take it seriously.</i>

260
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,250
<i>I don't like you.</i>

261
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,410
Is it because Xia Xiaoju said she doesn't like me?

262
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,400
How is that possible?

263
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,610
For this problem, it's asking to solve for the difference quotient.

264
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,780
Delta Y over delta X equals f(b).

265
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,639
Minus the value of f(a) over B minus A.

266
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,270
Do you understand, Xiaoju?

267
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,960
Xiaoju?

268
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,780
Let me think about it?

269
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,999
You can go back and slowly digest the process.

270
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,900
Feel free to ask me if you don't understand something.

271
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,429
Lin You! Lin You!

272
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,759
Over here! Over here! Hurry and come over here!

273
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,090
You guys are here, too?

274
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,199
Lin You. I'm learning C programming on my own.

275
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:57,369
But I would like to ask you about the solution to this question.

276
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,299
This is how I solved it.

277
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:01,700
When I calculate it, when the number is one, it equals ten.

278
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,110
But my final answer is—

279
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,999
Lin You, why don't you sit here?

280
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:06,550
It's more convenient here.

281
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,030
Sure!

282
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,529
Look, this is how I solved the problem.

283
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,679
N squared equals seventeen.

284
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,859
That means, if the first number is ten,

285
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,540
then the second number should be two. Do you understand now?

286
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,969
I get it now.

287
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:35,929
I really can't skip a day of programming class.

288
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:39,419
It was because there were a few times it conflicted with other classes so I didn't attend.

289
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,479
Now I could hardly understand it when I teach myself.

290
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:45,599
It's okay. I can lend you my notes next time.

291
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,790
That would be great! Thank you, Lin You!

292
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,380
You're welcome.

293
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,069
Le Tao. What about this one?

294
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:03,940
"Fungus and moss will make lichen when they come together.

295
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,679
If they are separated, neither of them will be able to survive on their own.

296
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,880
They will both die."`

297
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,620
How is it? How is it?

298
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,460
It's not that good.

299
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,929
So you're saying that one of us is fungus and the other is moss?

300
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:21,970
Don't take it literally.

301
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,410
You need to learn how to understand its true essence.

302
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,749
The essence is that you can't live without the other.

303
00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:31,050
How deep a meaning is that!

304
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,860
Then, I...

305
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,230
I'll just think about it on my own.

306
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,730
Then let me help you keep searching.

307
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,680
Thanks.

00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,730

Of course!

314
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,709
That's good then!

315
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:00,820
I made a major decision today,

316
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,910
and now, I need your help.

Don't you worry. Anything that I can do,

318
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,200
or can't do, I'll do them for you.

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,980
<i>I want to give him a surprise!</i>

322
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,929
This is the last vial and you can be discharged.

323
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:23,010
Really? Thank you, Nurse! Thank you, Nurse!

324
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,110
I'm finally free!

325
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,069
You can't go now.

326
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,780
Why?

327
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,550
Sister Nurse,

328
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,319
Don't you think he needs to do other examinations?

329
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,480
I feel like he's not recovered yet.

330
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,099
The nurse already said that I can be discharged. Do what examinations?

331
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:48,799
Then, take another IV to strengthen the effect?

332
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,939
Xia Xiaoju, are you the devil?

333
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:52,850
How can you just casually get an injection whenever you want it?

334
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,890
- Seriously!
- That's right. You can't just carelessly get an IV.

335
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,140
Time to leave the hospital!

336
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,029
If we really leave right now, then all of our previous efforts would have been wasted.

337
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:08,970
So we need to find a way to delay him.

338
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,970
But even the nurse said he can be discharged. What can we do?

339
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,069
There's no other way.

340
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,709
So that's why we need to think of something!

341
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,019
Think of what? If it really doesn't work, let's just give up.

342
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:19,630
- We can't delay him any longer.
- But—

343
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,900
What are you two whispering about?

344
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,939
Nothing. Are you done packing?

345
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:24,579
Just a necklace.

346
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:26,820
- Don't leave anything behind.
- How is it?

347
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,420
Really handsome!

348
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,469
It looks good.

349
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,040
Of course!

350
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,660
Huang Jun, how about we leave a bit later?

351
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,939
What for? I don't want to stay here a minute longer.

352
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,240
Shiyi... Shiyi...

353
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,359
- What about him?
- He...

354
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,579
He needs to use the bathroom.

355
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:50,789
Okay, hurry and go.

356
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:52,749
I... I don't need to!

357
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:55,760
I don't need to go!

358
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,410
Go ahead. Don't forget anything.

359
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,469
By the way, where's Le Tao?

360
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:07,010
She didn't come?

361
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,680
She...

362
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,590
She... Something came up so she couldn't come.

363
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,779
Okay. Hurry up, Shiyi!

364
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:21,420
Don't rush me!

365
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,160
What should I do? What should I do?

366
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,960
- Huang Jun.
- Yes?

367
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,870
I-I think that today's... date and weather

368
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,600
is pretty good. How about...

369
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,960
we celebrate by having dinner together?

370
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:41,120
What is there to celebrate?

371
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,979
I just recovered a bit. I want to go back to the dorms!

372
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,060
Let's go.

373
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,610
Come on.

374
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,780
Hold on, wait!

375
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,560
How could we not celebrate it?

376
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,679
Don't you think so? Right?

377
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,069
What is there to celebrate?

378
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,860
- He originally—
- That's right. What is this?

379
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,980
- Let's go.
- Hold on! Wait!

380
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,150
We should celebrate.

381
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,609
I didn't even eat in order to come pick you up today. I'm a bit hungry.

382
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:08,160
I'm also very hungry.

383
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,490
You should have told me sooner.

384
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,800
Then let's get some food downstairs.

385
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,209
- Then let's go.
- Let's go.

386
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,459
- Okay?
- Let's go.

387
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:16,559
- Let's go.
- Slow down.

388
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,580
Is your leg okay now?

389
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,109
Slow down. Don't use your strength. Slowly.

390
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,700
I can't.

391
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,049
What's going on? Are you all right?

392
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:33,970
What a coincidence! I have a stomachache.

393
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,459
I also need to use the bathroom!

394
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:36,990
Maybe she ate something bad yesterday.

395
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,739
You two!

396
00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:40,950
Wait for me! Wait for me!

397
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,919
Then come on. Let's sit here and wait for her, okay?

398
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,129
There's only you and me. Stop acting.

399
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:47,760
Just sit down. I know you're fine!

400
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,269
Careful!

401
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,500
<i>[Jiangzhou University]</i>

402
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,679
I just got discharged,

403
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,310
and you both dragged me out here for a walk.

404
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,459
And you just pushed me!

405
00:28:58,459 --> 00:29:00,060
His leg is hurt. Be careful.

406
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,999
That's right! If I'm wounded again, you both need to take care of me for life!

407
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:05,420
- I...
- It's enough that you act in front of Le Tao,

408
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,440
yet you're also acting in front of us?

409
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,199
Your leg just pulled a muscle at most and got a little scratched.

410
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:12,609
Even if you walk the whole day, your leg won't go crippled.

411
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:14,670
- He kicked me!
- Be gentle!

412
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,760
Are you done or not?

413
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,759
Do you have to walk this way?

414
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,680
As if one leg is shorter than the other? Like 1.7 meters and 1.5 meters long?

415
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,949
Weren't you able to jump around today when you were at the hospital?

416
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:23,750
Can you please stop acting? I'm begging you.

417
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,229
I wasn't acting, Shiyi.

418
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,900
Shiyi!

419
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,680
- Why are there so many people?
- Wow.

420
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,919

Hold on.

Let's put aside accounting first.

459
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,839
I have something more important that I need to talk to you about right now.

460
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,590
What is it?

461
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,919
I'm going to sign up for the campus singing competition.

462
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,200
Okay, great! I'll go and fill the form for you right now!

463
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,950
Why do you suddenly want to sign up for the campus singing competition?

464
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,200
I saw you confess to Huang Jun today.

465
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,879
I was deeply moved.

466
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,309
So I was thinking, since both Cheng Lang and I like each other,

467
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,629
one of us has to confess first, right?

468
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:42,299
If he's not taking the initiative to do it, then I will.

469
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,829
So that's why,

470
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,069
at the campus singing competition,

471
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,409
I want to sing a song that expresses my feelings and confess to him.

472
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:52,419
Really?

473
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:57,300
I think Cheng Lang will definitely be deeply touched!

476
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,529
Really?

477
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:07,580
Huang Chan, sign me up too.

478
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,879
I also want to participate.

479
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,109
You want to participate, too?

480
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,200
Thank you! Thanks!

481
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,189
At that time, I'll sing

482
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,840
and Huang Jun will play for me.

483
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,829
I think that you both can sing

484
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,519
The Love of Boat Trackers.

485
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,559
It goes like this...

486
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,039
- ♪ Sister, sit at— ♪
- Xia Xiaoju!

487
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,689
Stop making fun of me!

488
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:28,949
Huang Jun!

489
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,000
Your girl are going crazy!

490
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,000
You guys only know how to talk about love,

491
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,120
instead of putting the effort into studying. Love cannot put food on the table.

492
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,920
What's going on? What happened?

493
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,790
What are you guys doing?

494
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,020
Nothing. Continue reading.

You still haven't chosen what song you're going to sing?
<i>[Classic Videos]</i>

497
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,600
Yes, it's so difficult.

498
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,949
Indeed, it's an assigned topic.

499
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,870
The scope is too narrow.

500
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,189
What about you? Have you decided yet?

501
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,389
I've decided!

502
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,799
I'll be singing our love song.

503
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,700
Like You.

It's great to have a boyfriend.

505
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:30,529
Aren't you about to get one too?

506
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,039
What are you talking about?

507
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,940
Stop making fun of me.

00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,000
I know what I want to sing.

♫ <i>It hurts to see the stubbornness in your eyes</i> ♫

517
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,699
♫ <i>I'm a bit tired and need to rest</i> ♫

518

♫ <i>The marks we leave in life</i> ♫
