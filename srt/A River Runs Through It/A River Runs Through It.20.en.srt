The last time we came here,

42
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,439
didn't you eat the same food

43
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,939
and it wasn't enough?

44

I-I was just hungry then.

my appetite gets better.

49
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,380
Well, then I'll get started.

50
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,349
Shiyi, you went to the blood donation bank today.

51
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,349
How was it?

52
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,509
Shen Duo said my illness is not easy to cure.

53
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,500
She suggested that I change majors.

54
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,969
Change major?

55
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,719
So what's your opinion?

56
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,759
It's not about what I want.

57
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,339
Sometimes, you just have to face reality.

58
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,479
It was not easy for you to get into your dream university.

59
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,129
How can you give up?

60
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,509
That's not the Lu Shiyi I know.

61
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,969
Right, Cheng Lang?

62
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:37,059
Today is only the first day. The start is the hardest.

63
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:39,020
Why are you giving up now?

64
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,059
I didn't say I wouldn't try treating it.

65
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:49,710
Hurry and eat!

66
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,849
Can you not talk like that in the future?

67
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,680
All right.

68
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,759
Well, if I could get cured,

69
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,160
are there any rewards?

70
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,179
If I can do it, I can promise you anything.

71
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:11,819
Pinky swear?

72
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:12,849
You were the one to say it.

73
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:13,759
You have my word.

74
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,349
When have I ever gone back on my words?

75
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,899
Cheng Lang can also be our witness today.

76
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:20,039
All right. I'll be your witness. Just rest assured.

77
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,859
And you, continue going to the blood donation room tomorrow, okay?

78
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:25,650
Got it.

79
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,569
Cheng Lang, tomorrow is Friday.

80
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,669
Do you want to join us?

81
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,880
Tomorrow?

82
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,409
I have a penpal who I have been keeping in touch with. We agreed to meet tomorrow.

83
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,829
But it's at 6:00 p.m.

84
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,969
I'm free in the morning. I can go with you.

Lin You, where's your homework?

87
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,390
I...

88
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,939
I'll submit it after class.

89
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,139
Then later during class, are you going to listen to me

90
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,130
or try to finish your homework?

91
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,549
Even if you're a college student with an art specialty,

92
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,199
you can't be offhand with this.

93
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,959
It won't work with me.

94
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,600
Professor, for this group assignment,

95
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,479
Lin You and I are a team.

96
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,110
I'm also responsible for her not finishing her homework.

97
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,509
I forgot to consider her rehearsal time for her dancing group

98
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,269
so I didn't arrange the tasks properly,

99
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,439
so she couldn't submit it.

100
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,159
Punish me if you have to, Professor.

101
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,580
Is that true, Lin You?

102
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,470
- No.
- Yes!

103
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,120
You two really do cooperate well together.

104
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,789
Cheng Lang, I allowed you to audit the class

105
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,770
because I thought you were studious.

106
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,660
It's not for you to act like a hero here.

107
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,119
If you do so and don't cherish this opportunity,

108
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:26,490
then don't come to my class in the future.

109
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,890
Professor, I promise to never do it again.

110
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,029
After class, we'll rewrite it.

111
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,550
We promise to submit something that we make you satisfied with.

112
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,830
All right.

113
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,589
Before 5:30 p.m. today, come to my office with the finished homework.

114
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,589
If you can't finish it,

115
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,760
don't come here again.

116
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,839
All right, Professor.

117
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,639
All right, sit down.

118
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,320
Thank you, Professor.

119
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,740
Thank you, Professor.

120
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,400
Open your textbook on page three.

121
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,999
Sorry,

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,980
I caused you to be scolded by the professor.

123
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,029
I won't lose any flesh just by getting scolded.

124
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,710
It's fine.

125
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,719
But what if you lose the opportunity to audit the class?

126
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,809
As long as we submit the homework before she leaves work,

127
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,109
it'll be fine.

128
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,330
Don't worry about it.

129
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,399
Besides, even if I can't audit the class,

130
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,760
I can learn from you.

131
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,130
I'm in a difficult position myself.

132
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,640
Lin You.

133
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,280
Has something been troubling you recently?

134
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,549
Maybe you'll feel better if you say it out.

135
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,320
I can see if I can help you with anything.

136
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm fine.

137
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,149
Okay, let's go to the library

138
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,380
to discuss the assignment.

139
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,820
Lin You, you said we're friends.

140
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,230
If there's anything I can do for you,

141
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,000
you must tell me.

142
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,920
Let's go.

143
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,300
Did you reconcile with Huang Jun?

144
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,469
Didn't you say that you'd never talk to him?

145
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:33,839
Since he made a sincere apology,

146
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,519
I forgave him for now.

147
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,880
After all, I am pretty and kind.

148
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,200
Will you accompany Shiyi to the hospital today?

149
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,120
That's right.

150
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,409
How is he? Has he gotten better recently?

151
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:56,379
I think he's getting much better.

152
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:59,519
He's not afraid of watching blood drawing anymore.

153
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,709
Look how happy you are.

154
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,029
But to be honest,

155
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,669
have you ever considered Shiyi?

156
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,350
In fact, I think Shiyi is quite handsome.

157
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,050
What are you saying?

158
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,589
How can I date him?

159
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,999
He and I are like brother and sister.

160
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,739
Even if you're dating, you shouldn't randomly try to match people as a couple.

161
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,700
Don't you have a date with Huang Jun?

162
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,759
We're going to watch a movie.

163
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,549
By the way, today's Friday.

164
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,370
Don't forget about the meeting.

165
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,660
I don't know if I should go or not?

166
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,369
Of course, you should. I wrote, "Be there or be square."

167

So you'd have a reason to object against me studying medicine?

388
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:44,700
I'll think of a way to deal with this myself.

No matter what happens,

390

I definitely won't give up studying medicine.

391
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:52,140

392
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,320

You're out of your mind. You know nothing.

396

How can you judge him like that?

397
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,900
Mom, I'm wrong.

398
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,610
What happened before, Mom?

399
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,309
Mom.

400
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,279
Tell me about it.

401
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,950
Mom.

402
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,180
There was a young man.

403
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,250
If he was treated conservatively,

404
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,400
he would stay in a coma.

405
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,470
Your father didn't accept it.

406
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,289
He asked for reoperation. He wanted to give it a try.

407
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,960
The family agreed, too.

408
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,580
Unexpectedly, the operation was unsuccessful.

409
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,360
The patient was gone.

410
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,440
Although it's not his responsibility,

411
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,520
for so long,

412
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,969
he couldn't let it go.

413
00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:30,050
He blames himself all the time.

414
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,330
Dad, stop drinking.

415
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,470
I'm sorry.

416
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,940
I didn't know what got into me just then.

417
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,560
I didn't mean to say those words.

418
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,970
You're right.

419
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,249
I don't have any right to interfere with your life.

420
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:07,840
My own life is all a mess.

421
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,580
Dad, don't say that.

422
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:18,529
Aren't you curious why I insist on studying medicine?

423
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,899
It's because of you.

424
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:25,519
Ever since I was a child, I thought you were so cool when saving and treating patients.

425
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:27,490
Of all my classmates,

426
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,180
only my father is a doctor who can save lives.

427
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,409
Even though you're just a doctor in the school infirmary now,

428
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:40,559
you still meticulously fulfilled the duties of a doctor.

429
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,949
Although I've always been naughty from a young age

430
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,250
and never told you anything,

431
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,790
I've always treated you as my hero, Dad.

432
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,960
It's true!

433
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,759
Actually, I think what happened before is not your fault.

434
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:03,499
Your suggestion was intended to make a better result for the patient.

435
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:05,090
Right?

436
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,360
Son.

437
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,980
You're right. It's so simple to understand.

438
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,120
Even you understand.

439
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,560
But I only understood it today.

440
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,950
- Son, you're better than me.
- I'm not.

441
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,750
When things happen to you, instead of running away,

442
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,250
you faced them bravely.

443
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,640
I am proud of you.

444
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,490
Go and cure your blood phobia.

445
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,399
Don't be afraid of anything.

446
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,540
Your mother and I will always be by your side.

447
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,730
We're your strongest support.

448
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,990
Dad. I'm sorry.

449
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,060
I really didn't mean it just now.

450
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,150
I don't know why I said that. Don't take it to heart.

451
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,759
I'm sorry.

452
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,739
If I took all that you said for all these years to heart,

453
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:21,940
I would have died of anger already.

454
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,159
It's fine that you aren't angry.

455

Not only didn't it help you, but Uncle also found out.

480

What did Uncle say?

481
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,050
This has nothing to do with you.

00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,400
I couldn't have kept it a secret forever.

483
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,210
My dad and I already talked about it.

484
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,970
He's not against me learning medicine,

485
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,000
and he'll help treat my hemophobia too.

What do have to say?

491
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,590
Why are you so mysterious?

492
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,509
Look at the flowers. They're quite cute.

493
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,200
Just-Just like someone.

494
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,039
Did you bring me chrysanthemums?

495
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,500
You must be cursing me.

496
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,020
How do I curse you?

497
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,479
Then tell me. Who sends these to a living person?

498
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:17,229
They're not chrysanthemums.

499
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,560
They're daisies.

500
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,080
Oh, my goodness.

501
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,259
Datu, it's not a proper way to give flowers to girls.

502
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:31,139
You're lucky that I'm not who you like.

503
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:34,000
Or, do you know what will happen?

504
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,220
What-What will happen?

505
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,040
A red card, and you're out.

506
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,610
Who wants those kind of flowers?

507
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,609
What's wrong with my flowers?

508
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:48,769
I gave them to you. You have to take them. You must take care of them.

509
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:51,709
- I don't want them.
- You have to.

510
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,670
I don't know how to care for flowers.

511
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,190
It's okay.

512
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,989
Just like you, the flower is vigorous and easy to grow.

513
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:04,429
Well, being vigorous is not a merit.

514
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,660
Can't you get me some other flowers?

515
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,190
Well, they're quite cute.

516
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:44,260
♫ <i>There you are, running wildly through the highlands</i> ♫

517
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:51,640
♫ <i>Another you is sighing silently</i> ♫

518
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:57,680
♫ <i>No one is able to understand you</i> ♫

519
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:06,920
♫ <i>Happiness is not transparent and pain is not thorough</i> ♫

520
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:14,400
♫ <i>I'm glad you're not willing to give up like this</i> ♫

521
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,580
♫ <i>It hurts to see the stubbornness in your eyes</i> ♫

522
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:27,119
♫ <i>I'm a bit tired and need to rest</i> ♫

523
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:34,319
♫ <i>The marks we leave in life</i> ♫

524
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:41,780
♫ <i>How I wish to travel everywhere with you</i> ♫

525
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:49,220
♫ <i>To find the meaning of my existence along the way</i> ♫

526
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:57,260
♫ <i>The hard journey of life lets the soul recuperate</i> ♫

527
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:04,760
♫ <i>Be brave and find yourself</i> ♫

528
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:18,920
♫ <i>The red, green, and black colors of the forest</i> ♫

529
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:33,980
♫ <i>The purity, joy, and freedom of oneself</i> ♫

530
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:42,860
♫ <i>I wish for you to see clearly</i> ♫

531
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:57,780
♫ <i>The true you within all the dust</i> ♫
