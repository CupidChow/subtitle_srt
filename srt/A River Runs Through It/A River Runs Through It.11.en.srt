<i>[Episode 11: Even if a confession becomes a mistake I]</i>

3
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,300
Xiaoju.

4
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,900
What's the matter?

5
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,999
What happened?

6
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:34,269
What's wrong?

7
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,510
I think... I'm in love.

8
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,479
You're in love?

9
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,360
With whom?

10
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:48,629
Wait, you were with Huang Jun just now.

11
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:50,980
Did he confess his love to you?

12
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,940
Then were you who confessed to him?

13
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,550
Then why did you say that you fell in love?

14
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,860
No, that's not right.

15
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,390
I didn't see anything between you and Huang Jun before.

16
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,829
What happened?

17
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,980
Tell the truth.

18
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,259
Just...

19
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:14,250
Just now, Huang Jun gave me a ride on his motorbike.

20
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,290
His back is really handsome.

21
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,719
From that moment,

22
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,910
I'm pretty sure that

23
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,110
I fell in love.

24
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,389
You're crazy, you...

25
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,030
How can you fall in love so easily?

26
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,829
I don't care if you believe it or not.

27
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:38,749
Anyway, there is such a moment

28
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:43,240
that people will remember for a lifetime.

29
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,169
It's not only me.

30
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:03,359
Aren't you happy that

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,720
Cheng Lang remembered your birthday?

32
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,000
Let me tell you. I held hands with Cheng Lang!

33
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,289
You guys held hands?

34
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,359
Really? Wait.

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,009
Did he hold yours first, or did you hold his?

36
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:21,940
No, no. He held mine.

37
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,060
Oh my god.

38
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,920
I told you that he had some feelings towards you!

39
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,439
- Really?
- Really! Think about it.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,220
If he doesn't have feelings for you, why did he hold your hand?

41
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,629
You need to strike the iron while it's hot,

42
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,989
and make him yours.

43
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:33,549
No, no, no.

44
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,779
He saw that I ran too slowly at the time, so he helped me.

45
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:38,079
But that doesn't mean he likes me.

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,079
I'm sure that even if he's not at the stage of liking you,

47
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,269
he's treating you differently

48
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,549
compared to other girls.

49
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,009
If you don't believe me, you can ask Xiaoling!

50
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:46,660
- Xiao—
- Xiao—

51
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,629
Oh no!

52
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,730
We forgot about Xiaoling and the others!

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,520
Hurry up! Hurry up!

54
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,400
Excuse me, miss. We're about to close.

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,319
Can you wait a moment?

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,770
Our friends aren't back yet.

57
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,389
Right, we still have so much food left.

58
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,669
We haven't finished them yet.

59
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,470
Time is up. We need to close.

<i>Cheng Lang!</i>

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,290
<i>Xia Xiaoju!</i>

62
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,599
P-P-Professor,

63
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,720
I don't know the answer to this question.

64
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,999
- Xiaoju.
- Quiet down! Quiet down!

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,480
He didn't ask you to answer a question.

66
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,669
You don't know how, yet you dare to sleep?

67
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,879
I'm telling you.

68
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,599
If you don't study hard,

69
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,440
you'll have to retake the class next semester.

70
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,599
And all of you,

71
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,769
the importance of advanced mathematics for accountants

72
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,479
is a given.

73
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,639
If you don't learn advanced mathematics well,

74
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,319
then you don't need to learn accounting.

75
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,199
If you're lazy now,

76
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,039
then if you calculate something incorrectly in the future,

77
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,510
you might even end up in jail!

78
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,389
Do you understand, everyone?

79
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,409
Sit down!

80
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,440
Thank you, Professor.

81
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,639
All right, let's continue our class.

82
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,230
Thus, this function is a multifunction.

83
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,639
Why is it that I still humiliate myself

84
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,939
even in college?

85
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:58,919
Don't worry.

86
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,860
People will forget it in a few days.

87
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,600
Hey, why don't you wake me up?

88
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,300
I wasn't paying attention either.

89
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,880
You weren't paying attention?

90
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,719
Were you secretly being lovesick behind my back?

91
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,879
What nonsense are you talking about?

92
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,550
Disgusting.

93
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,270
We'll know if I was talking nonsense with just one look!

94
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,659
Huang Jun. HJ.
<i>[HJ, HJ, Huang Jun, Huang Jun, HJ, HJ]</i>

95
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:30,010
This many!

96
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,789
What charm does Huang Jun have

97
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,829
to make Taotao, who loves to learn, become distracted in class?

98
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,439
This is you taking 100 steps,

99
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,879
and laughing at me for taking fifty.
<i>(T/N: Since Xiaoju hasn't made much progress with her love life.)</i>

100
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,039
The professor didn't hear you,

101
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,949
but I heard it clearly.

102
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,969
Cheng Lang. Cheng Lang! Cheng Lang!

103
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,830
Stop talking nonsense!

104
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,639
Tell me the truth. What did you dream about?

105
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,600
Calling his name so sadly.

106
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,549
I dreamed that Cheng Lang held hands with another girl.

107
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,949
You're just dreaming about what's been on your mind.

108
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,669
It means that you're feeling really insecure.

109
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,860
That's why I told you

110
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,849
to confess your love as soon as possible.

111
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:12,829
If you keep dragging it out,

112
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,799
Cheng Lang will really go to someone else.

113
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:17,020
If that happens, don't come to me.

114
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,630
I...

115
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,109
I'm not ready.

116
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,759
What is there to prepare for?

117
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,509
I'm telling you, why not do it today?

118
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,669
Let's do it today.

119
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,200
- What are you doing?
- Let's make a quick decision.

120
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,669
- Let's go.
- Wait, wh-where are we going?

121
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,929
Where? To see Cheng Lang.

122
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,349
Hurry, hurry!

123
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,909
We're going to see Cheng Lang? Where will we find him?

124
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,029
The gym.

125
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,099
- Why are you acting so strange?
- Hurry up.

126
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,670

127
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,469

00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,659
Great!

130
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,229
That guy is not bad.

131
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,080
He's just like a real-life Kaede Rukawa.
<i>(T/N: A fictional character from Slam Dunk.)</i>

132
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,399
I'm telling you. We can definitely make it into the tournament this year.

133
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,770
I also think Cheng Lang is not bad.

134
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,229
Huang Jun made a shot!

135
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,260
He is so handsome.

136
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,669
But... There are so many people wearing the same jersey,

137
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,549
and you can recognize which one is Huang Jun with just one look?

138
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,589
- You're really something!
- Hurry, hurry!

139
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,839
Go and give Cheng Lang some water.

140
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,759
Go, let's go! Let's go!

141
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,640
- Hurry up!
- Good!

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,590
<i>Great!</i>

Huang Jun.

- Why are you here?
- I... I...

146
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,779
You must be tired. I-I brought you some water.

147
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,909
You performed very well just now.

148
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,810
You were very cool.

149
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,929
Let me tell you. You could have gone up for a joint defense just now.

150
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:02,929
OK, no problem.

151
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:04,549
You were very awesome just now.

152
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,839
Go ahead first.

153
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,440

Wh-What's wrong?

158
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,000
Thanks, but I have my own.

159
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,979
- Thanks.
- Give it back to me!

160
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,079
What are you doing? So stingy!

161
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,229
Didn't you buy it for me?

162
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,800
Who said it was for you? I...

163
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,520
<i>Take it.</i>

164
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,569
It's okay, there's no need. I-I brought my own water.

165
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,029
I already brought one for you.

166
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,350
No, it's okay. Thanks.

167
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,030
- Take it.
- It's okay, there's no need.

168
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,760
Hey bro.

169
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,420
Thank you, bro.

170
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,009
I already have water. Thanks.

171
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,029
Then how about opening it for me?

172
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,549
It's too tight. I can't open it.

173
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,230
- Okay.
- Let me help you.

174
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,390
Here you are.

175
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,350
Drink it yourself.

176
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,780
You don't want it anymore?

177
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,959
Xia Xiaoju.

178
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,149
- I really admit defeat towards you.
- My hair style.

179
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,739
Shiyi. Cheng Lang.

180
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:11,049
Come here and have a rest.

181
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,640
Let's go.

182
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,179
<i>Cheng Lang is so excellent.</i>

183
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,440
<i>Maybe someone will snatch him one day.</i>

184
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,149
<i>Taotao is right. I need to profess my love.</i>

185
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:28,960
Thanks.

186
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,959
Thank you.

187
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,549
I'll wipe it for you.

188
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,050
Do you have one?

189
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,660
Thank you.

190
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,040
- You're welcome.
- Xiaoju.

191
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,560
Why didn't you wipe it for me?

192
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,840
It's not like you don't have hands.

193
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,690
Good girl.

194
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,080
Stop playing around.

195
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,550
Here. Our dishes are here.

196
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,440
Cheng Lang.

197
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,850
Here, this is for you!

198
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,550
Xiaoju, is that Lin You?

199
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,930
Lin You!

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,109
What a coincidence!

201
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,669
You're all here.

202
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,369
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

203
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,490
Come and have a seat. Join us.

204
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,830
Right, I ordered a lot.

205
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,069
Hey beauty, come and join us. Have a seat!

206
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,000
- Come on.
- Have a seat.

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,940
Then... Sorry for intruding.

208
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,540
You're welcome.

209
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,760
Are you familiar with her?

210
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,180
Come on.

211
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,030
Thank you.

212
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,669
You're also learning advanced mathematics, too?

213
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,340
Yes, it's too difficult to understand.

214
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,860
I'm really having a hard time.

215
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,789
Me too.

216
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,130
It feels like the professor is talking about something obscure.

217
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,180
So difficult.

218
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,640
What do you think is not difficult to learn?

219
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,859
You won't feel well if you don't tease me, is that it?

220
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,579
I was just telling the truth. Why did you throw that to me?

221
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,770
Stop it, stop it. Okay, okay. Stop playing around.

222
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,839
Let's eat dinner. Let's eat dinner.

223
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,329
Let's eat dinner. Stop playing around.

224
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,400
I'll just throw my last one.

225
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,269
Eat.

226
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay, fine.

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,080
You're dumb yet you won't let others say it.

228
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,550
Let's eat, okay?

229
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:19,149
I think you two are like Cheng Lang's children.

230
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,880
Now you know how difficult it is for me.

231
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,660
Xiaoju, if you think that advanced mathematics is hard,

232
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,340
I can tutor you.

233
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,229
Lin You, if you'd like,

234
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,879
you can come, too.

235
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,149
Really? That's great!

236
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:42,729
Lin You, let me tell you. Cheng Lang is better at teaching than our professor!

237
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:45,669
I was able to get into Jiangzhou University because of him.

238
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,600
Let's go together.

239
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,369
Then thank you so much.

240
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,690
Actually, I'm really worried about not passing this time.

241
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,669
There's no need to be so polite with me.

242
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,879
You helped me a lot before, too.

243
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,669
We're just helping each other.

244
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,719
- Let's eat! Let's eat!
- Let's eat!

245
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,260
Let's eat!

246
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,000
Have some more.

247
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,109
- Go. Don't fight me for the bill!
- Why are you talking so much?
<i>[Let's Enjoy the World Tonight, Cantonese-Style Food Stall]</i>

248
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:11,999
- Actually, advanced math is not difficult.
- Boss, don't take his money!

249
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,739
- Just take it. Put it away.
- How can I let you pay for it?

250
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:17,689
Cheng Lang, do you have to go to your job later?

251
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:18,930
I'll go this way later.

252
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,590
Take care.

253
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,349
Can you go to the stall next to the video shop

254
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:26,220
and buy some candy roasted chestnuts for me?

255
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,210
Why don't you go yourself?

256
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,300
Are you stupid? I'm making an opportunity for you.

257
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,800
Now that you mention it...

258
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,440
No, it's too embarrassing.

259
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,669
What is there to be embarrassed about?

260
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,839
Hurry and go.

261

Okay, bye bye, Lang.

265
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,220
I'm leaving now.

266
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,149
I also need to go this way. I have something I need to do.

267
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,639
You guys can go back first.

268
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,100
Okay, go ahead.

269
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,220

Where is Xiaoju going?

274
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,829
I asked her to help me do something.

To help you with what? I can help you.

277
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,050
It's a girl thing. You can't help.

278
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,330
Then I can help.

279
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,529
No need. She can do it alone. Let's go.

280
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:18,130
- Let's hurry and go back.
- Let's go.

Let's go.

Where are you going?

283
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,249
Taotao wanted me

284
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:36,609
to buy her some candy roasted chestnut from near the video store.

285
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:38,739
Something urgent came up, so she went back first.

286
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,100
It's on the way, we can go together.

287
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,329

I can help you buy it.

Let me.

310
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,140
Why are you such a chicken?

311
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,930
Why are you so useless? It was just the two of you.

312
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,459
The ambiance was good. Everything was good.

It was such a great opportunity, yet you just wasted it!

314
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,899
What do you mean everything was good?

315
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:30,880
When I saw his face,

316
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,780
all I wanted to say was stuck in my throat.

317
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,690
What do you want me to say then?

318
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,200
Taotao, what should I do?

319
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,479
What can you do? What else can you do?

320
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,950
Since it didn't work out this time, try again next time.

321
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,599
But once I meet his eyes, I really can't utter anything.

322
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,180
Since you can't say it...

323

What is it?

330
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,970
As you've read so many romance novels,

331
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,310
how do they profess their love?

332
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,830
Profess their love? Who wants to profess their love?

333
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,099
M-M-Me. Me. I want to. Can't I?

334
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,180
Sure you can.

335
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,269
Let me tell you. There are painful romance stories,

336
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:39,920
unrequited love stories, pure love stories,

337
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,159
reunion love stories, childhood friends romance stories, and more.

338
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,279
Painful romance includes two types: physically painful and psychologically painful.

339
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,140
Which one do you want?

340
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,159
U-Unrequited love story.

341
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,900
Un... Unrequited love story.

342
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,300
Unrequited love story.

343
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,210
Then... Let me find it for you.

344
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,459
This one...

345
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:03,239
Okay, that's enough. You...

346
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,580
Just give them all to me.

347
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,409
These are my treasures.

348
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:07,969
Okay. Thanks!

349
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:09,529
You can continue. Continue crying.

350
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:11,210
Sorry for disturbing you.

351
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,579
This one! This one!

352
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,310
This one is good.

353
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,309
"Fold full and exquisite little stars,

354
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,349
and carefully put them into a glass bottle."

355
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,580
Fold stars?

356
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,009
Will this work?

357
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,050
Of course, it will.

358
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,130
This is equivalent to holding a sky full of stars and confessing your love.

359
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,540
How romantic.

360
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,010
What holding a sky full of stars?

361
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,399
This is too schoolgirlish.

362
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,640
This doesn't suit me. I won't do it.

363
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,980
<i>[Thinking of you right now. It moves...]</i>

364
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,890
<i>[The sky is very blue every day, with light winds and clouds. I'm thinking about you a lot.]</i>

365
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,909
What are you doing in the middle of the night instead of sleeping?

366
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:10,919
Didn't you say that it's too schoolgirlish and doesn't suit you?

367
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,159
You scared me to death!

368
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:16,560
It's because I couldn't think of any other way.

369
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,299
Then can you sleep first? After waking up tomorrow, I'll help you fold them.

370
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:21,580
No.

371
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,710
These types of things are only sincere when I fold it myself.

372
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,530
You...

373
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,330
But you can't avoid sleep.

374
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,700
It's because I won't make it in time.

375
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,799
I asked Cheng Lang to tutor me in advanced mathematics tomorrow,

376
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:37,280
but I was just able to fold this little. Look!

377
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,559
It's okay. Hurry and go to sleep.

378
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,260
Don't mind me. Go, go!

379
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,920
Whatever.

380
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,589
Where are you going?

381
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,940
Toilet.

382
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,060
Be careful of mice!

383
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,899
Try this one?

384
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:07,020
This makes me look fat.

385
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,040
I hate tucking my shirt in.

386
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,190
Wait! Why do your clothes all look the same?

387
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,610
I think this one looks quite good.

388
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,399
"Quite good?" How?

389
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,449
Are you going to wear this on your date?

390
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:25,590
This won't do. You can't be like this.

391
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,510
I have an idea.

392
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,160
What do you think?

393
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,399
This dress is really beautiful. Did you just bought it?

394
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:55,780
Wear this one. I guarantee Cheng Lang will be captivated by you.

395
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,599
I'm not used to wearing it. I don't want it.

396
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,189
What do you mean you're not used to it?

397
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,949
Are you kidding? Lin You had something come up so she can't go.

398
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,239
So right now, this is a God-given opportunity. It'll only be you and Chang Lang.

399
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:09,909
Just the two of you. Of course, you need to dress beautifully.

400
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:12,820
Hurry and change into it. Hurry up!

401
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,320
- Change!
- Okay, okay. I'll change.

402
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,810
Hurry up!

403
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,310
Xiaoju.

404
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,039
Where's Lin You?

405
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,700
Didn't she come with you?

406
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,209
Something came up for her dancing troupe today,

407
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:55,740
so she's not coming.

408
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,779
- Then let's get started.
- Okay.

409
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,279
Xiaoju, here's the thing.

410
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,919
Our target is to not fail the class.

411
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,489
So the examples the professor has explained to us in class are of great importance.

412
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,010
Let's first take a look at an example.

413
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,809
To find the area under this trapezoid,

414
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,919
we can assume the curved side of the trapezoid

415
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,780
is a continuous line y, which equals f(x).

416
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,600
Later, try to answer the questions I marked for you.

417
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,780
Try to be more detailed when writing down the steps to solving the problem.

418
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,980
Xiaoju?

419
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,849
What about this?

420
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:00,309
Try working on these few problems.

421
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,359
I need to go to the restroom. I'll be right back.

422
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,320
Sure.

423
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,620
Is this yours?

424
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,660
It looks pretty.

425
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,299
D-Do you like it?

426
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:53,579
How could I like this?

427
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:56,039
Isn't this something that girls would like?

428
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,720
How are you with the problems?

429
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,420
The problems...

430
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,039
I... I...

431
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,039
I also need to go to the restroom.

432
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,760
Let's talk about it later.

433
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,380
She wrote nothing at all.

434
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,679
In this way, the area you calculated is more and more precise.

435
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,100
Right?

436
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,919
Oh, I see.

437
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,469
This is much simpler than expected.

438
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,299
Cheng Lang, you're too awesome.

439
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:52,950
It's good that you understand it.

440
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,479
We still have three questions we haven't gone over,

441
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:59,189
but I still have two lectures later.

442
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,999
Do you want to wait for me

443
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,159
or meet next time?

444
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,269
- I'll wait for you here.
- Okay. Then I'll go to class first.

445
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:06,639
I'll come find you in a bit.

446
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,020
Okay.

447
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,300
Review it well.

448
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,349
Cheng Lang, is your class over?

449
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:38,140
Are you here for lessons?

450
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,459
I'm busy. I have to go.

451
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:40,729
Hey, wait a second.

452
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:42,639
The video shop called the dorm just now,

453
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,879
and I answered it for you. Brother Bin had something urgent come up,

454
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,590
so they wanted you to hurry over there right now to take over his shift.

455
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,930
Go over there now to take over his shift?

456
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,240
What is it?

457
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,649
Huang Jun, can you do me a favor?

458
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:54,059
Go to the library and tell Xiaoju that I can't make it.

459
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,469
I'll call her later tonight to set up our next tutoring time.

460
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,660
No problem. Leave it to me.

461
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,220
Hurry and go over to the video store.

462
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,580
To the library.

463
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,829
Ladies.

464
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,879
What are you doing?

465
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,469
The tournament is coming soon,

466
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,210
so we're making a few poster boards to cheer you guys on later.

467
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,900
Put it down, put it down!

468
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,709
How can you ladies do such hard work?

469
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,319
- Let me do it. Let me do it.
- You do it.

470
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,329
Be careful!

471
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,639
No problem.

472
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,200
Together. Cut it together.

473
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,980
<i>[Shiyi Must Win!]</i>

474
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,719
- How is it? Good enough?
- Not bad.

475
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,429
You cut it faster than me.

476
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,179
I'll leave this task to you.

477
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,700
Take it.

478
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
"Ride the wind and break the waves."
<i>(T/N: They used Cheng Lang's "Cheng.")</i>

479
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,860
"Shiyi must win."

480
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,709
Senior, why is there none for me?

481
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,370
You're playing favorites.

482
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,209
I'm making it right now. Hurry and cut one out.

483
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:03,389
I promise you that I'll make yours the prettiest.

484
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:06,059
- Then draw mine on this one.
- Okay.

485
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,410
Excuse me. Excuse me?

486
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,179
We're about to close the library to sort the materials.

487
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,640
Can you go to the classrooms to study?

488
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,309
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

489
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,109
Why are you writing "Shiyi" again?

490
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,639
Weren't you going to write mine?

491
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,159
Look at these. All of these are Shiyi's.
<i>[Shiyi must win!]</i>

492
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,509
Look at the ones on the bottom. All of these are his.
<i>[Shiyi's shots must go in! Shiyi, good luck!]</i>

493
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:46,160
Look! Look!

494
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,949
All of these look really ugly.

495
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,009
I promised you so I'll definitely make it.

496
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:50,519
Don't be so impatient.

497
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,429
Wait, Senior. Do you like Shiyi?

498
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,999
What? What if I do?

499
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,550
Can't I like him?

500
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,069
As expected, you're exceptional.

501
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,519
You dare to love and hate.

502
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,190
I admire you.

503
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,970
But this Shiyi is not easy to pursue.

504
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,320
I advise you to change your target as soon as possible.

505
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,600
What do you think of me?

506
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,430
Go away.

507
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,709
Let me tell you.

508
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,879
I just like someone who's hard to get.

509
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,799
Besides, I don't believe I can't get him.

510
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,019
That's right. Shen Duo is the beauty of Medical School.

511
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,510
- That's true.
- By the way,

512
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,780
that... Xia Xiaoju and Cheng Lang...

513
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,880
what is their relationship?

514
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,109
They're neighbors and went to the same high school.

515
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,709
Their relationship is pretty good.

516
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,039
I see.

517
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,850
Xia Xiaoju.

518
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,000
Did I forget something?

519
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,129
Hey, what are you doing?

520
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:52,109
There are still poster boards that you haven't cut yet. Don't see it?

521
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,760
Right, you're right.

522
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,400
How many do you still need?

523
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,359
Many. Just cut it.

524
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,150
<i>[Weng You Library]</i>

525
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Why isn't he here yet?

526
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,559
Stupid.

527
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,330
She even wore a dress today.

528
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,130
Move away.
