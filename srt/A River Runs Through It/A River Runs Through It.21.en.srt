Xia Xiaoju.

164
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,520
I promised to help her fix it.

165
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,249
I don't mean to be blunt,

166
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:58,229
but why are you fixing it?

167
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,960
Can't you just buy her a new one?

168
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,500
Come here. Come on!

169
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,900
Why are you in such a hurry?

170
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,800
Why did you drag me here?

171
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,400
Help me choose a pen.

172
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,900
What do you like...

173
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,900
What kind of pen do you girls like?

174
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,800
Is it because you broke

175
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
my pen from last time?

176
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
So you want to pay me back with a new one?

177
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,800
Stop talking so much nonsense.

178
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,400
Hurry and choose one.

179
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,600
What's the rush?

180
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,700
I need to choose carefully.

181
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
What about this one?

182
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
This one looks good.

183
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,700
Thanks, Datu, for paying for it!

184
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,800
Are you sure?

185
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,800
This color is too tacky! You have no sense of taste!

186
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,500
What is wrong with my sense of taste?

187
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,400
At least it's better than the guy who gave me daisies.

188
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,200
Wait! What's wrong with the daisies?

189
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Besides, this is not for you!

190
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,900
Seriously!

191
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,000
This isn't for me, and yet you're having me choose something for such a long time!

192
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,100
Okay now. Don't be greedy.

193
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,400
Don't you already have the little daisies?

194
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,500
Who cares about the daisies that you gave me?

195
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,200
Xiaoju, are you free this weekend?

196
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,400
- I want...
- Datu, lend me two yuan.

197
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,600
I want to eat that bread.

198
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,700
Hurry, hurry!

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I wanted to invite you to watch a film just now.

200
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,400
Eat, eat, eat! All you know is eating!

201
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,700
Are you a pig?

202
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Lin You, you have a package.

203
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,400
- Thank you.
- It came from overseas.

204
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,700
It's Loved Letter!

205
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,400
Wasn't this film just released?

206
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,000
Was the DVD also released?

207
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,500
When I was on the phone talking to Ancheng yesterday, we mentioned this movie.

208
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,200
I didn't expect that he had already sent it to me. He didn't even mention anything about it.

209
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
Of course, he couldn't!

210
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,100
If he told you, how could he surprise you?

211
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,800
Senior Sister.

212
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,900
Why are you smiling so foolishly?

213
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,500
Nothing.

214
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,199
Your pen is...

215
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
from Lu Shiyi, right?

216
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes, look.

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,500
Isn't this color a bit out of style?

218
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,200
But... I like it. As long as it's from him,

219
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
I will like it.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,400
Senior Sister, do you like Lu Shiyi?

221
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Yes, I like him.

222
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,400
By the way, Xiaoju. Could you do me a favor?

223
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,700
Sure, just tell me. I will help whatever you ask of me.

224
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,000
Can you give Lu Shiyi this movie ticket?
<i>[Xi Nan Theater: Loved Letter]</i>

225
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,400
You're shy, aren't you?

226
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,200
Just help me out, please.

227
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,300
Loved Letter?

228
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,100
Come in.

229
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,400
Datu!

230
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,600
Why are you here?

231
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,000
I need to tell you something.

232
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
What a coincidence!

233
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,800
I also want to tell you something.

234
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,300
What is it?

235
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,700
You first.

236
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,200
Here.

237
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,800
Loved Letter?

238
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,300
It's a ticket for tomorrow. Remember to go watch it.

239
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,800
Don't be late.

240
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Are you treating me to a movie?

241
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,500
But the sun didn't come out from the west side.
<i>(T/N: Indicating the impossible happened.)</i>

242
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,300
You're so long-winded. A-Are you going or not?

243
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,700
Y-Yes, I'm going!

244
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,600
Who said I'm not going?

245
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Wh-What did you want to tell me?

246
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,100
I-I got too happy and forgot.

247
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,000
I will tell you when I remember.

248
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Well, okay then.

249
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,200
Then I will leave now. Remember! Don't be late!

250
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
I won't. Bye bye.

251
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,900
Bye bye.

252
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,400
Cheng Lang, you're here.

253
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,600
Shiyi.

254
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,000
What brings you here, Cheng Lang?

255
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,700
I called home just now.

256
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
Your mom is very worried about your hemophobia

257
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,000
and wants you to go home when you're free.

258
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
Maybe a few days later.

259
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I don't have time these next few days.

260
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,300
Why? D-Do you have something going on?

261
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Actually, it's nothing big.

262
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,000
Just that... Xia Xiaoju asked me to watch a movie with her.

263
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800
You know about Loved Letter, right?

264
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,200
I don't really want to go actually.

265
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,600
But... But she already bought the ticket.

266
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
It's not proper if I refuse, right?

267
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,200
I mean if I don't go with her... Right?

268
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Yes, that's right. You must go.

269
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,800
Don't forget to call your mom.

270
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Okay, I know.

271
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm leaving.

272
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Go back and get some rest.

273
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
Don't forget!

274
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,800
Close the door when you leave.

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
Shiyi.

276
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,900
Turn your head around and look behind you.

277
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,700
Behind me?

278
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,559
There's nothing at all.

279
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,300
Can't you see that your tail is raised up to the sky?
<i>(T/N: Means he's very happy.)</i>

280
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Didn't Xia Xiaoju just ask you to watch a movie with her?

281
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,600
You're bragging so much about it!

282
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
Just continue looking at it.

283
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
I was wrong! I was wrong!

284
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,500
Hello.

285
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,800
Why haven't you sent out that letter yet?

286
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,200
Didn't you say that you'd reply to Cheng Lang and agree to meet him?

287
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm just thinking...

288
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,999
What if Cheng Lang still likes Lin You?

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,200
Then after finding out that I like him,

290
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,400
will we... still be able to stay as friends?

291
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,799
- What?
- I'll tell you some gossip.

292
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,279
What gossip?

293
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,799
Shen Duo wants me to help set her up with Datu.

294
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,300
Who?

295
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,100
Shiyi? Shen Duo?

296
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,799
Is there something going on between those two?

297
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,500
That's what I don't understand.

298
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,600
Senior Shen is so outstanding.

299
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,700
Why would she like Datu?

300
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,400
Shiyi is handsome, too.

301
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,600
He's also polite and gentlemanly.

302
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,800
Those are all fake. He's pretending.

303
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,000
Is that so? If that's the case,

304
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,600
then why do you stick to him every day?

305
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,800
Not only that, but after finding out he has hemophobia,

306
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,400
you were so worried about him,

307
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,000
and the saddest about it.

308
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,500
That's because he also helped me before.

309
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,800
Not only that, we're neighbors.

310
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
His mom told me to take care of him.

311
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,000
Then... Did you agree to help Shen Duo?

312
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,100
Someone finally has a crush on Lu Shiyi

313
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,200
so, of course, I should help him grab this opportunity.

314
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,200
You can also ask Shiyi to help you chase Cheng Lang.

315
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
Aren't they good brothers?

316
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,400
Spare me.

317
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
If Lu Shiyi finds out that I like Cheng Lang,

318
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,000
he would make fun of me.

319
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,400
And he would say stuff like,

320
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,200
"A toad wanting to eat swan meat,"
<i>(T/N: Wanting something that they're not worthy of.)</i>

321
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,600
or "a fresh flower on a heap of cow dung" and so on.
<i>(T/N: Someone untalented or ugly wanting to be with someone who is outstanding and beautiful.)</i>

322
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,900
You probably don't know, but in Lu Shiyi's heart, Cheng Lang

323
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,400
is super, super, super, super outstanding.

324
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,800
I see.

325
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,900

This Xia Xiaoju actually lied to me.

Don't leave! If you leave, I'll lose face.

What do you mean?

443

It's... because you make it difficult to ask you out

444
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,000
so I could only ask Xia Xiaoju for help.

Do you already have a girl that you like?

That's my business.

451
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,500
It's all right even if you do.
