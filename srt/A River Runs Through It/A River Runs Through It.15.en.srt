00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,259
Xiaoju, stop running.

5
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:24,339
What's going on? Don't keep it to yourself.

6
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:26,930
Tell me. I'm worried about you.

Cheng Lang...

8
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,650
He gave the gift to Lin You.

9
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,530
The one he likes is Lin You.

- Hey!
- What?

16
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,470
Help me ask Le Tao out and see what's wrong with Xia Xiaoju.

17
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,469
Why didn't you return my calls?

18
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,950
I thought you weren't in the dorm.

19
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,500
Cheng Lang asked you to get tutored in advanced math.

20
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,880
I don't want to see him right now.

21
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,769
Lin You's clothes have already been washed.

22
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,700
I picked it up for you on the way.

23
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,389
Can I trouble you to return Lin You's clothes to her?

24
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:57,600
Xiaoju, I know that you feel really terrible right now,

25
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,699
but no matter how hurt and depressed you feel, that person can't see it.

26
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,389
Listen to me. Cheer up and get your act together.

27
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,830
Get up from the place you fell.

28
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,229
Then tell me, if I compete against Lin You,

29
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,170
is there hope?

30
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,170
- I think...
- Forget it.

31
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,039
Lin You is so pretty and has good grades.

32
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:28,489
She is a good dancer, and she has a great personality.

33
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:30,750
She's simply perfect.

34
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,820
How can I compete against her?

35
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,789
It's fine. It's still graceful to lose to her.

36
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:38,340
It's fine.

37
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,229
How can you comfort someone this way?

38
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,509
I think I should change friends.

39
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,599
Okay, when you feel better,

40
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,849
you can change friends to whomever you like, all right?

41
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:50,219
But right now, we should do something first.

42
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:52,879
Big Huang found a great place to make pottery.

43
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,929
We can go together after eating, okay?

44
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,069
I'm not going.

45
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,109
You two will be lovey-dovey. Why should I go?

46
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:01,069
To be the third wheel? I'm not going.

47
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,780
Then I'll invite Shiyi, too. We can all have fun together.

48
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,639
Don't stay in the dorm.

49
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,759
I'm not going.

50
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,109
What's wrong with you?

51
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,220
After I said this much, why can't you just listen?

52
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,410
I did.

53
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,649
I just want to go home right now and eat the food my mom makes.

54
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,770
You...

55
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,960
Taotao, I'll make a love mug for you later.

56
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,949
You can only drink water from the love mug I'll make for you.

57
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,240
Okay.

58
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,669
Get to the point.

59
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,630
I know, I will right now.

60
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,199
Taotao.

61
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,409
Didn't you say that Xia Xiaoju was going to confess her love that day?

62
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,999
Why didn't she confess but instead cried?

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,039
Nothing. Stay out of it.

64
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,599
How can I stay out of it?

65
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,739
If she's unhappy, that means my Taotao will be unhappy.

66
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,419
If you're unhappy, then I'll be unhappy, too.

67
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,599
We need to find the root of the problem and resolve it.

68
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,880
This way, both of us can be happy. Right?

69
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,720
Be honest with me. Was it because Xia Xiaoju

70
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,299
found out that the one she likes was chatting and laughing with another girl that day? Is that why she was heartbroken?

71
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:22,010
No!

72
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,069
Then was it because she found out

73
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,770
that the one she likes has a girlfriend?

74
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,479
Stop making wild guesses.

75
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,879
You two can't tell others about this either.

76
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,959
If I find out that anybody else knows about this, I won't forgive you guys!

77
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,159
- So annoying.
- Taotao!

78
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,509
Tao...

79
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,269
It's most likely that I guessed correctly. The one Xia Xiaoju likes has a girlfriend.

80
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,879
Shiyi, here is your chance.

81
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,159
<i>Taotao!</i>

82
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,040
<i>Taotao, wait for me.</i>

83
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,350
Xiaoju.

84
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,879
Why are you here?

85
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,479
Lin You, I...

86
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,350
Let's go.

87
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,679
Xiaoju? Why didn't I see you just now?

88
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,919
I felt tired just now, so I was resting against it for a bit.

89
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,400
That... The bus is about to come, right?

90
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,030
Soon.

91
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,960
Do you feel better today?

92
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,479
I'm fine.

93
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,140
I'm glad you're fine.

94
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,720
Xiaoju. I bought a new CD.

95
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,449
Let's listen to it together on the bus.

96
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:15,990
Okay.

97
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,950
- Here comes the bus.
- Let's go.

98
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,640
<i>I will take you to some place nice in a bit.</i>

99
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,180
We've arrived at Jiangqian Station.

100
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,410
Hold onto this for me.

101
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,959
Lin You! We haven't arrived yet!

102
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,410
Lin You!

103
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,930
Let's get off and see what's going on.

104
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,540
Okay.

105
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,229
Don't bother my mom again!

106
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,639
What's that got to do with you?

107
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,319
Lin You, don't be afraid. I'm coming to help you!

108
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:38,399
Lin You!

109
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,580
Let me go!

110
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,649
- Get your hands off her!
- Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

111
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:45,969
You home wrecker!

112
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:49,110
- Stop fighting! Don't! Stop!
- What does it have to do with you?

113
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,850
- You ruined our family.
- Lin You! Xiaoju! Stop fighting!

114
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,130
Xiaoju!

115
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,500
Let go! Let go! Let go!

116
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,789
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Let go!

117
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,199
You dare hit my friend.

118
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,959
Lin You!

119
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,810
What are you doing? Who are you?

120
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,880
Stop fighting! Stop fighting! Don't! Stop!

121
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,700
Lin You, does it hurt?

122
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,870
You really...

123
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,350
We were both on the bus at that time. You should have told us first.

124
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,439
It was too dangerous for you to rush in there alone.

125
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,109
It's fine.

126
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,900
I'll be more gentle. Bear with it, okay?

127
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
Today...

128
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,590
Thank you.

129
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,439
What silly nonsense are you talking about?

130
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,839
We're all friends.

131
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,220
Aren't we supposed to help each other out?

132
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,610
What happened to your hand?

133
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,889
My hand is fine. I just twisted it by accident.

134
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,129
- I'll go and buy a plaster for you.
- No need.

135
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:09,689
Hurry and help Lin You apply the medicine.

136
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:11,079
She's hurt very badly.

137
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,560
Hurry.

138
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,519
I'm really fine. Don't worry about me.

139
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,439
When you get back, don't touch water.

140
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,870
Or else it will leave a scar.

141
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,439
Also remember to let the wound get some fresh air.

142
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,230
Don't scratch it.

143
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,690
It will be fine after it scabs in a few days.

144
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,340
So deep.

145
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,659
That woman was ruthless.

146
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:42,239
Also, don't eat spicy food or seafood.

147
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,750
Got it?

148
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,740
If it really hurts at night,

149
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,529
you should go to the hospital and get it checked, got it?

150
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,880
Just a little more.

151
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,370
Okay.

152
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,850
<i>Seeing how Cheng Lang is so worried for Lin You,</i>

153
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,269
<i>I realized how selfish I was before</i>

154
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,380
<i>and how ridiculous I looked.</i>

155
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,760
<i>But no matter what,</i>

156
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,110
<i>Lin You is also a good friend of mine.</i>

157
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,999
Here. Dinner is not yet ready,

158
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:43,280
so have some chicken wings first.

159
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,110
Why didn't you call me before you came home?

160
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,610
Luckily, we still have some frozen chicken wings.

161
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,590
Or else where would I buy groceries at this late hour?

162
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,310
Having chicken wings to eat is enough.

163
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,210
What's wrong with your hand?

164
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,679
Nothing. I just twisted it accidentally.

165
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,050
You're just going to school. How could you have twisted your hand?

166
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,520
I'm going to get you a plaster for it.

167
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,809
Xiaoju. How's your wrist?

168
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,740
<i>No need to worry about me.</i>

169
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,179
Lin You, are you okay?

170
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,050
My dad...

171
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,320
doesn't want my mom and me anymore.

172
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,359
<i>Get a divorce! I won't leave you a penny!</i>

173
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,510
Today, thank you very much.

174
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,739
Lin You. How could you say this?

175
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:59,050
We...

176
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,540
We're good friends.

177
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,060
Although I don't know how to comfort you,

178
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,599
if... if you need anything, you can come to me at any time.

179
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,080
Thank you, Xiaoju.

180
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,509
Thank you for staying with me at this time.

181
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,450
What are we?

182
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,130
There's no need to say thank you again.

183
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,700
By the way, do you want to go back to school with me tomorrow?

184
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,289
Tomorrow morning, my mom will go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to file for divorce.

185
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,150
I want to go with her.

186
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,960
<i>It'll probably be the afternoon before I can get back to school.</i>

187
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,050
You don't need to worry about me.

188
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,220
I've already thought it through.

189
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,510
My mom and I can live a good life, too.

190
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,440
Lin You.

191
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,660
I'll protect you from now on.

192
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,999
Go to bed early.

193
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,950
Don't be sad.

194
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,810
<i>Definitely not.</i>

195
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,009
<i>This money is for Xiaoju's and Jiashu's tuition fees and living expenses.</i>

196
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,659
<i>You can't touch a penny from it.</i>

197
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:33,759
<i>But Old Chen had an accident at the construction site.</i>

198
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,810
<i>He's in need of money. I can't ignore that.</i>

199
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,050
<i>What about your project fund this time? You still did not get it yet?</i>

200
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,440
<i>Our boss owed a lot of debts and he ran away with it.</i>

201
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,089
<i>D*mn it. Old Chen has been working for me for many years. Right?</i>

202
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,930
<i>I can't stand by and do nothing.</i>

203
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,740
<i>I'll find a way to pay for their tuition.</i>

204
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,099
Jiashu, be good and listen to me. Go out and play.

205
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,500
I'll buy you candies tomorrow.

206
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,910
<i>Mom, I'm coming to sleep.</i>

You can't sleep anyway.

233
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,440
I'll treat you to some midnight snacks.

234
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,159
Are you going or not?

235
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,279
If not, I'll go alone.

236
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,060
I'm going. Why wouldn't I?

237
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,540
Let's go.

238
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,799
How did you hurt your hand?

239
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,180
What happened?

240
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,880
It's okay.

241
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,000
Tell me. How did you get hurt?

242
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,529
It was just an accident. Why are you so nosy in many things?

243
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,939
You're really ungrateful.
<i>(T/N: Literally "white-eyed wolf")</i>

244
00:19:59,939 --> 00:20:02,299
I'm just concerned about you, okay?

245
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,780
Wait here for me. I'll fetch you some medicine.

246
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,669
No need! I've already applied some.

247
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,710
Take it.

248
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,870
No need. My mom already helped me put it on.

249
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,760
Mine is better.

250
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,800
Aren't all plasters the same?

251
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,640
Yours doesn't work.

252
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,420
It hurts!

253
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,560
What are you doing?

254
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,160
Don't move.

255
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,190
Does it hurt?

256
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,200
No.

257
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,780
I'm a medical student.

258
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,069
I know which medicine is better.

259
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,580
Take it.

260
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,810
Datu, thank you.

261
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,230
What's wrong?

262
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,230
Nothing.

263
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,709
How could it be nothing? Your eyes are red.

264
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:49,419
It's because you... you tore the plaster so hard.

265
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,210
Okay. Okay. Okay.

266
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,110
I'll make it up to you.

267
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,680
I'll treat you to midnight snacks. Let's go.

268
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,600
Xia Xiaoju. Are you feeling really upset?

269
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,900
Yes.

270
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
I feel so upset.

271
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,300
That day, you suddenly started crying in the middle of singing.

272
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,000
And then you stayed in your dorm, refusing to go anywhere.

273
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,800
If it wasn't a required course, you wouldn't attend.

274
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,600
Even the meals were brought to your dorm by Qiu Le Tao, you wouldn't eat.

275
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,400
And today, you couldn't fall asleep.

276
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,200
What exactly is going on?

277
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,500
Datu.

278
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
Do you have someone you like?

279
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,000
Yes.

280
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,400
Then does she like you?

281
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let me tell you.

282
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,189
I also have someone that I like,

283
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,600
but... that person doesn't like me.

284
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I always thought he liked me.

285
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,400
Who's the person you like?

286
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
I like...

287
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm not telling you.

288
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,000
Actually,

289
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,700
I didn't want to cry that day.

290
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
I also knew it was humiliating.

291
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
But I felt terrible. I couldn't help it.

292
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,600
I really, really couldn't help it.

293
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,800
I want to tell him I like him.

294
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,200
But...

295
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,800
But I can't tell him,

296
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,000
because he doesn't like me.

297
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:50,700
Datu. If the person you like doesn't like you back,

298
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,400
will you feel as sad as I do?

299
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Will you be as humiliated as me?

300
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
I'll feel sad.

301
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,800
So that's why you can't laugh at me.

302
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,400
If it'd been you there that day,

303
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,800
you'd cry, too.

304
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,700
I didn't laugh at you.

305
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,800
I'm just...

306
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,800
worried about you.

307
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,800
I feel better after talking about these things to you.

308
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,200
Datu, you know what?

309
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,000
You're forever my good friend.

310
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,400
You're my... best friend.

311
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,000
He doesn't like me.

312
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,400
I won't like him, either.

313
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,200
Too bad he doesn't like me.

314
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,800
Come on, let's go home.

315
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,200
♪ If you really care about me, ♪

316
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,600
♪ How could you let the endless nights ♪

317
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,400
♪ Accompany me? ♪

318
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,800
Xia Xiaoju, shut up.

319
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,000
Why aren't you sleeping in the middle of the night? Are you weeping (at a funeral)?

320
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,200
Sorry, Auntie!

321
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,500
Friends up there, how are you doing?

322
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,100
Xia Xiaoju.

323
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,000
If you shout again,

324
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
I'll plant you here.

325
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
I won't shout. I won't.

326
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,000
Hang on tight.

327
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,300
I like you.

328
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:59,220
♫ <i>There you are, running wildly through the highlands</i> ♫

329
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,300
What are you doing? You hurt me!

330
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
My butt.

331
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,400
♫ <i>No one is able to understand you</i> ♫

332
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,500
Xia Xiaoju, do you know who I am?

333
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,900
Datu.

334
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,200
Remember that.

335
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
I'm Lu Shiyi.

336
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
If you mistake me for somebody else again,

337
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,500
I'll throw you in this trash can. Do you believe I won't do it?

338
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,700
Get on!

339
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,900
So mean.

340
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,000
Are you getting on or not?

341
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,600
Yes.

342
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,800
♫ <i>I'm a bit tired and need to rest</i> ♫

343
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,800
Carry me steadily.

344
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,000
♫ <i>The marks we leave in life</i> ♫

345
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,700
Wait.

346
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Don't touch me.

347
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,000
Don't. Don't. Don't.

348
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,900
Come down. Come down.

349
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,539
I don't want to come down. I want to sleep.

350
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,000
Don't wake me up.

351
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,400
All right.

352
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,700
Aun...

353
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,600
Auntie Feng?

354
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,800
Auntie?

355
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
- Don't call me "Auntie."
- Shut up.

356
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,000
Who's calling you that?

357
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,400
Auntie Feng. Auntie?

358
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,100
Can you not wake me up?

359
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,400
Can you stop moving?

360
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Auntie Feng, it's me.

361
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,500
I'm Shiyi, Auntie.

362
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,300
Don't shake me.
