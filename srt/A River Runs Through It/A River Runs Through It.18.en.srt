is not that Cheng Lang is with Lin You?

17
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,140
It's because they aren't together.

I was really sad.

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,549
it doesn't matter if he's with me or not.

25
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,440
As long as he is happy, I'm satisfied.

You're really such a fool!

I might not have time to do it,

96
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,610
so I discussed with Yang Yu

97

to do an easier one.

But I...

104
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,379
Lin You, if you quit now, I still will need to find another partner.

105

It'll be troublesome for me.

106
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,900
Besides, you also put in a lot of effort for the beginning portion of the project.

107
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,280
I don't think it's worthwhile for you to drop out now

108

and have to restart a new project.

109

If you do so, you would get a low score on your project.

I think... I should quit.

How many years have we been sleeping together?

129
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,789
- Do I still need to ask?
- Okay, fine.

130
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,049
If you stay up all night, can you wake up early to train tomorrow morning?

131

We stayed up all night playing games before.

132
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:34,590
We were still full of energy the next day, right?

133
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,250
It's okay. It won't affect training.

134
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,180
I'll find time to sleep tomorrow.

135
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,009
Okay, I am going to sleep then.

136
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,480
Okay.

137
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,450

What kind of nonsense are you saying?

166
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,600
You don't understand.

167
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,999
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

168
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm off.

169
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,200
<i>I have known Ancheng since we were young.</i>

170
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,100
<i>I chose Jiangzhou University because of him.</i>

171
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,500
<i>She said the happiest thing is</i>

172
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
<i>when she dances to my accompaniment.</i>

173
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,600
The ball.

174
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,500
Hurry! You're so slow.

175
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,600
Let's rest a bit.

176
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,600
Datu!

177
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,800
Datu.

178
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,880
You're bleeding, Datu!

179
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,669
Oh my god, Datu. I'm so sorry.

180
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,349
I'm so sorry.

181
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

182
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,600
Datu, Datu.

183
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,600
Datu!

184
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you okay, Datu?

185
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,700
Datu.

186
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,400
Datu. Are you okay, Datu?

187
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm so sorry.

188
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
I didn't do it on purpose. Sorry.

189
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,600
Well, Xia Xiaoju, what were you thinking?

190
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
I asked you to pass me balls.

191
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
Why did you hit my face with it?

192
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,900
I... I'm sorry. I was absent-minded.

193
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,200
Let me wipe it for you.

194
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,400
Does it still hurt?

195
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,000
Yes.

196
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
It hurts so much.

197
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry.

198
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,200
I didn't do it on purpose.

199
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,800
All right.

200
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,200
That's all for today's training.

201
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Let's go. I'll get you something to eat.

202
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,500
Let me tell you, I haven't eaten such delicious chicken cutlet for a long time.

203
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
Isn't this too greasy?

204
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,500
Just looking at it seems too greasy.

205
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,400
You eat it.

206
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,799
Datu, I already ate a piece.

207
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,200
Eat this one. You don't need to take that much care of me.

208
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,500
I really don't need it.

209
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,800
I really think it's too greasy.

210
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,000
Besides, you've picked it with your chopsticks.

211
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,400
Your saliva is all over it.

212
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't want to eat your saliva.

213
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,200
When you picked it up, your saliva also got on it!

214
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,600
I didn't eat any of it, though.

215
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,400
I promise it's clean. Hurry and eat!

216
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
Okay, I'll eat it.

217
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,100
It's really good!

218
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,500
Thank you, here.

219
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,000
Did you send these to the wrong table?

220
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,800
No, no.

221
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,500
I ordered these.

222
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,700
Okay.

223
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,500
Here are all your dishes. Please enjoy.

224
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,800
Thanks.

225
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,400
Datu, why did you order so many dishes?

226
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,700
These are enough for five people. Can we even finish all of this?

227
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,400
Of course, we can.

228
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
I've been training so hard lately.

229
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,400
It's easy for me to eat all of these.

230
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,800
Hurry and eat!

231
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,400
Wait.

232
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Please use serving chopsticks to pick food.

233
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,600
Or all these dishes will have your saliva on it.

234
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,900
I won't be able to eat it. Here.

235
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,800
You are taking revenge.

236
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
- Stop messing around.
- I won't let you pick it up!

237
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,100
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,000
Don't move.

239
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,700
Come here.

240
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,800
Haven't you finished wiping?

241
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,400
The dishes are getting cold.

242
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
It's clean now.

243
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,800
I'll use this pair of serving chopsticks to eat.

244
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Are you actually going to use serving chopsticks?

245
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,100
I was just kidding.

246
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,400
Here, eat this.

247
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,900
Okay.

248
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,600
Eat more if you like it.

249
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,200
Thank you.

250
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You said you've been training so hard,

251
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
so you can finish all of this.

252
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,600
There's so much left, it's a waste of food.

253
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,400
It seems you really like these dishes.

254
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,600
How about I pack up all these for you?

255
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Waitress, can I have three to-go boxes? Thanks.

256
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,700
Okay, please wait.

257
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,100
Thank you Datu for treating me to a delicious meal.

258
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,800
Okay.

259
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,700
I'll send you here today.

260
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,400
I need to go to the basketball gym later.

261
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,800
Go back on your own.

262
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,100
Then you should head back and rest early as well.

263
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,300
I shall go now, bye.

264
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,400
Bye bye.

265
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Go on and head back!

266
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,200
Bye bye.

267
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,800
Why is Datu so loyal?

268
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,600
<i>Cheng Lang, I hope you are well.</i>

269
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,600
<i>I have had a lot things troubling me lately.</i>

270
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,200
<i>I don't know if you are the same.</i>

271
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,000
<i>Actually, in everyone's heart, </i>

272
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,400
<i>there are one or two things they can't let go.</i>

273
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,800
<i>There are also one or two people they can't forget.</i>

274
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,000
<i>If we compare life to a dish,</i>

275
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,800
<i>sentiment is the salt in it.</i>

276
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
<i>If there's no salt,</i>

277
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,400
<i>the dish would be bland.</i>

278
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,400
<i>But no one can survive on salt only.</i>

279
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,700
<i>There are many things people can't control.</i>

280
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,400
<i>It's like the sun will set everyday.</i>

281
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,200
<i>The moon will wax and wane.</i>

282
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,300
<i>[Boy's Dormitory]</i>

283
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Cheng Lang, a letter for you again.

284
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
My letter?

285
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,700
It's still from Mango Pudding.

286
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,000
Is it from a girl who secretly likes you?

287
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,229
I don't think so. It's different from other love letters I got.

288
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:09,639
She has written five letters to you.

289
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,470
Why don't you reply to her?

290
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,396
Reply with what? I don't even know who she is.

291
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:15,949
When we made penpals in high school,

292
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,229
we wrote about our daily life

293
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,729
and things we can't say normally to others.

294
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:24,700
After all, you don't know each other.

295
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,320
But obviously, this person knows who I am.

296
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,039
Why don't you ask to meet her on campus then?

297
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,620
I'm off.

298
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,410
<i>Mango Pudding,</i>

299
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,010
<i>hello.</i>

300
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,460
Taotao.

301
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,030
What's wrong?

302
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,070
<i>[To: Mango Pudding]</i>

303
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,530
Cheng Lang wrote back to you?

304
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,639
- Let me have a look.
- I won't.

305
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,370
Let me have a look.

306
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,069
I need to write back to him.

307
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,790
I have to go to my part-time job afterwards.

308
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,680
I really hope Cheng Lang can see your painstaking effort.

309
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,590
What's wrong, Manager?

310
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,639
Well, it's hard for a young girl like you to work outside.

311
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,949
I thought about it.

312
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:08,030
I'll give your salary in advance.

313
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,650
Take it.

314
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,560
Manager.

315
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,349
But let's have a deal. Keep it a secret.

316
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,589
Don't let other people know, understand?

317
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,919
I understand. Thank you, Manager.

318
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,239
Work hard, fighting!

319
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:21,189
Fighting, fighting!

320
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,390
- Go to work.
- Okay.

321
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,999
Mom.

322
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,559
Why are you back now?

323
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,670
Don't you have class?

324
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,999
I have class in the morning, but not in the afternoon.

325
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,179
Mom, look what this is.

326
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,199
What is it?

327
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,310
Open it and take a look.

328
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,190
Where did you get it?

329
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,919
This is the first sum of money I earned in my life.

330
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,279
I wanted to buy something for Xia Jiashu and you.

331
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,349
But I thought of the thing that happened at dad's construction site, I bought nothing.

332
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,429
Mom, take it.

333
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,899
Your daughter can earn money now.

334
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:11,050
You have really grown up!

335
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,919
Let me tell you,

336
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,519
your dad signed a project just yesterday.

337
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,679
They've paid us a deposit.

338
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,450
We aren't short on money any more.

339
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,189
Really? That's great.

340
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,950
We don't need to live in a financial strait anymore.

341
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,120
Mom, give me the money. I'll use it as my living expenses.

342
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,189
Here's 100 yuan.

343
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,109
Ask me for more after you spent it.

344
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,399
I'll save these for you.

345
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,350
What do you want to eat? I'll cook for you.

346
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,309
I earned all that money.

347
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,519
If it were my dad,

348
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,919
he would give all of it to me.

349
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,999
Your dad?

350
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,399
If he is in charge of money,

351
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,399
we'll have nothing to eat for the next half month.

352
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,089
Tell me what you want to eat.

353
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:53,519
You haven't came home for such a long time.

354
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,159
Do you miss the dishes I made for you?

355
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,189
Chicken wings.

356
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,429
Lu Shiyi quite likes the chicken wings you made.

357
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,429
I'll bring some for him.

358
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,790
Okay, no problem.

359
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,040
Xiaoju, Cheng Lang wrote back to you.

360
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,539
But he doesn't know it's you that have been writing letters to him.

361
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:14,519
Look at you.

362
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,159
You can use a pen name,

363
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,309
but you should at least give him some hints.

364
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,759
Mango Pudding.

365
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,559
It would be strange if he can guess it's you.

366
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,879
Seeing how slow your progress is,

367
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,040
I'm anxious for you.

368
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,049
Taotao, look at this. It's cute, right?

369
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:34,069
Doesn't it suit Cheng Lang?

370
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,169
What's cute about the dog? It's silly.

371
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,309
Silly?

372
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,210
I think it's cute.

373
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:45,620
How about putting it in an envelop and giving it to Cheng Lang?

374
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,279
Giving the silly dog you like to the person you like,

375
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,829
you are such a fool.

376
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,519
I'll call him Da Bai in the future.
<i>(T/N: Short for large fool)</i>

377
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,229
I'll call Huang Jun Garfield then.

378
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,110
- Why?
- Because he is silly.

379
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,179
My... My Da Huang is not silly.

380
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,290
Cheng Lang and you are the silly ones.

381
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,110
You're silly.

382
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,130
Boss, I want this one.

383
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,650
Are you planning to pull another all-nighter to do homework, again?

384
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,149
No.

385
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:21,019
I've finished our group project.

386
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:23,629
I'm making an outline for Lin You now.

387
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:25,589
She didn't participate in the latter part of this project.

388
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,949
If there's an outline,

389
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,589
she can get familiar with the process more quickly.

390
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,300
Cheng Lang, you're so silly.

391
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,110
I think you both are silly.

392
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,720
You're so noisy.

393
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,900
Then I'm going to lie down.

394
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,710
Hurry and sleep.

395
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,680
Cheng Lang, you're here.

396
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,609
What's wrong?

397
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:58,040
Mango Pudding wrote a letter to you again.

398
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,440
Thank you.

399
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,590
Then I'm going back. Hurry and go to sleep.

400
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,620
Go to sleep. Don't wait for me.

401
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,472
<i>[Gym]</i>

402
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,680
Cheng Lang scored.

403
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,110
- Hurry.
- What's wrong?

404
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,140
Look. Cheng Lang likes it.

405
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,459
Yes, he likes... a silly dog.

406
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:48,000
It's Da Bai, not a silly dog.

407
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,520
It's Da Bai, Cheng Lang.

408
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,439
Be quiet.

409
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,750
No, I'm going to say it aloud!

410
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,349
It's Da Bai, Cheng Lang. It's Da Bai, Cheng Lang.

411
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,039
- It's Da Bai, Cheng Lang.
- Be quiet, Taotao.

412
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,810
Look at them.

413
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,949
Cheng Lang!

414
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,039
- Cheng Lang, it's Da Bai!
- It's fine.

415
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,730
- We're just playing.
- Cheng Lang!

416
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,920
It seems Xiaoju has recovered from emotional wounds.

417
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,710
It's good that she has.

418
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:16,488
I say that you have done so much for her.

419
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,310
Are you sure you are not going to tell her?

420
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,949
When she practices basketball with you later, tell her and she'll be yours.

421
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,999
Understand?

422
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,659
Why are you so noisy?

423
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:27,030
Give me the ball.

424
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,520
Why are you looking at me all of the sudden?

425
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,159
What's wrong?

426
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:24,970
Xia Xiaoju.

427
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,350
Who did you like before?

428
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,330
Can you tell me now?

429
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,519
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

430
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,770
Do you still like him now?
