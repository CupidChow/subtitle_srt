00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,419
<i>[A River Runs Through It]</i>

2
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,457
<i>[Episode 9: Although we argue with families, I still love you]</i>

3
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,910
You're back.

4
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,579
First, giving you gifts.

5
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:37,019
A boy won't give you a gift for no reason.

6
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,309
If he remembers to give you a gift,

7
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,720
he must like you.

8
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,939
Look, the shell wind chime.

9
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,209
When we came back from the sea last time,

10
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,930
Cheng Lang gave me that shell wind chime.

11
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,899
Jackpot, jackpot! I knew he must like you.

12
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:54,159
This line is correct. Checkmark.

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,589
B-B-But aren't we a bit too arbitrary?

14
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,829
Cheng Lang said he wanted to thank me for organizing a trip to the sea

15
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,119
to make him happy.

16
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,659
Are you an idiot? Why didn't he give me one as well?

17
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,129
I also helped, okay?

18
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:06,809
You're right.

19
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:08,999
Come, let's continue! Let's continue!

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,469
Second, he will care about you.

21
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,859
When you're happy, he'll feel happy for you.

22
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:16,109
When you're sad,

23
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,259
he'll be with you and comfort you.

24
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:21,820
How is it? Does this one match you two?

25
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,619
Cheng Lang was happy for me when I got admitted into Jiangzhou University.

26
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:27,079
It's not like what Lu Shiyi said,

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,569
that since I was admitted into Jiangzhou University, he can't get rid of me.

28
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:30,519
Don't go off topic.

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,420
We are talking about Cheng Lang right now.

30
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,869
When you're happy, he'll feel happy for you, right?

31
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:38,270
- Yes.
- It matches.

32
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,269
Then when you're sad,

33
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,630
will he be with you and comfort you?

34
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,030
I have nothing to be sad about now.

35
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,809
You'll eventually have one. Let's tick it.

36
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:50,159
You want me to be unhappy.

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,499
- You want me to be sad, is that it?
- No, no!

38
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:52,629
I didn't mean that.

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,569
We all have ups and downs in our lives,

40
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,139
but none of these things matter right now.

41
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:59,990
What matters is whether Cheng Lang cares about you.

42
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,799
- Understand?
- Yes.

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,600
Continue.

44
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,419
Third, if a boy likes you,

45
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:12,300
he'll care about your health.

46
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,719
Son, are you tired?

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,550
Drink some water.

48
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,469
Let me tell you. Don't worry about our family too much.

49
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:26,599
Study hard.

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,440
Look at your sweat.

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,779
There is enough coal for our shop to use for several days.

52
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:33,669
And I've told that shop owner to send you some every two days.

53
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,719
Don't carry it yourself.

54
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,999
Okay, don't worry.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,610
I can do it myself.

56
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,109
Besides, people in our neighborhood will help me.

57
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:42,339
Clean your dirty face.

58
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:43,749
Is it dirty?

59
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,910
Don't rub it again.

60
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,519
Let me tell you. You should study hard at school.

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,640
Don't worry about home.

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,390
Clean it yourself.

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,910
Here, this is for your living expenses.

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,959
Why did you suddenly give me so much?

65
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,010
I don't need that much.

66
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,110
It's not much. Take care of yourself at school.

67
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,669
Mom, I don't have that many expenses. I really don't need that much.

68
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,499
Listen to me.

69
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:12,270
If you want to eat something, just buy it. Don't try to save money for me.

70
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,160
Take it.

71
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,760
Cheng Lang is a good boy.

72
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,830
Shiyi and his father are still in a cold war.

73
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,969
Shiyi was admitted to Jiangzhou University.

74
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:34,349
He can even become a doctor in the future.

75
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,619
How good it is!

76
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:39,230
What exactly is Old Lu unsatisfied with?

77
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,599
Is it because of that thing in the past

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,729
that Old Lu doesn't want him to learn medicine?

79
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:46,000
What do you think?

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
What is it?

81
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,309
In the past, Old Lu made a medical mistake during a surgery,

82
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:59,240
so he couldn't forgive himself for this.

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,390
No wonder.

84
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,740
Didn't you wear these pants before?

85
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,560
Don't take it. I'll wash it for you in a bit.

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,220
Okay.

87
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,160
Is this yours?

88
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,669
This is... This is not mine.

89
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:34,919
This is... is Xia Xiaoju's.

90
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,080
Why would you have Xia Xiaoju's things?

91
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,449
My son has grown up.

92
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,020
What nonsense are you talking about, Mom?

93
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,849
How could I like her? Hurry and give it to me!

94
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:46,549
I didn't say anything!

95
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,830
Give it to me! You're too nosy!

96
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,199
<i>I'll wash it for you, okay?</i>

97
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,910
<i>Okay.</i>

98
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,899
Tomorrow is the last day to register,

99
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,269
yet you want to go today.

100
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,270
You can't stay at home any longer?

101
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,439
I can't stay at home any longer.

102
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,120
I have to check what the school is like first.

103
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,720
There's nothing I can do about you two.

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,689
Where can I put it?

105
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,159
Put it there first.

106
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
I'll help you to put it in later.

107
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,950
By the way, there are some clothes on the balcony. Go and help me grab them.

108
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,870
Okay.

109
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,050
Naughty boy.

110
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,900
<i>[Slam Dunk]</i>

111
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,270
These are your treasures.

112
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,389
What is the meaning of this?

113
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,509
Look at the things he's bringing.

114
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,819
He wants to learn medicine but is still reading these. Can he learn it well?

115
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,319
You care about him,

116
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,731
don't say anything else.

117
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:07,269
Is there any point in continuing to be stubborn?

118
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,669
I finally have my own room!

119
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:46,320
Xia Jiashu, take it out.

120
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,450
What should I use to pack it?

121
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,710
Xia Jiashu!

122
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,199
Xia Jiashu!

123
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,630
Are you looking for a beating?

124
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,899
Jiashu.

125
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,229
Jiashu, let me have a look.

126
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:14,720
What happened? What happened?

127
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,879
- It's okay.
- Hurry and get up. Get up.

128
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,549
What is wrong with you?

129
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,610
Sister pushed me.

130
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,939
If you didn't touch my things, I wouldn't have pushed you.

131
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,299
I didn't touch your things!

132
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,689
My wind chime was broken into pieces,

133
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:29,839
yet you still say you didn't touch it?

134
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,209
Okay, stop yelling! You argue every day.

135
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,709
Your arguing is making my head burst!

136
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,789
It will be quiet if one of you leaves.

137
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,229
Okay, Jiashu.

138
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,329
Don't cry, okay? It's okay, be good.

139
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,819
Don't cry. I'll rub it for you.

140
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:44,610
You're his older sister, so why can't you yield to your younger brother?

141
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,279
Did you push your brother just for a broken wind chime?

142
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,350
It's okay, Jiashu. Don't cry. Don't cry.

143
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,099
I'll rub it for you, then it'll be fine.

144
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,783
Your sister is really insensible

145
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:56,087
and won't even concede to her brother.

146
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,029
Why do I have to yield to him?

147
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,329
Since I was little, I was always the one to concede to him in everything.

148
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:07,109
No matter if it's food or clothes, you'll always think of him first, then me.

149
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,709
When there's only one portion,

150
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,709
you'll surely give it to Xia Jiashu.

151
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,690
Because you're always like this, that's why I hate him.

152
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,370
No matter what happens every time, it's always my fault.

153
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,549
It's all my fault!

154
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,350
Am I really your biological daughter?

155
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,280
Don't be angry, Sister.

156
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,020
Xiaoju!

157
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,440
Xiaoju!

158
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,940
Xiaoju.

159
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,139
Xiaoju, what happened? Why are you crying?

160
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,340
Tell me what happened.

161
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,170
Did someone bully you?

162
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,300
Are you going to school now?

163
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,589
What happened?

164
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,129
Why are you crying?

165
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,860
Where are you going?

166
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,899
What's wrong?

167
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,510
I'm fine.

168
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,900
Xiaoju, wipe your tears.

169
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,610
Xia Xiaoju, can you stop crying?

170
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,149
It's embarrassing like this.

171
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,230
It's none of your business!

172
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,479
What? What are you guys looking at?

173
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,750
Haven't you seen someone cry before?

174
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,840
Don't cry.

175
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,170
Building No. 25, Room 435.

176
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,230
Building No. 25...

177
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,759
Don't cry. We're at school now.

178
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,880
Don't cry. Don't cry.

179
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,199
Building No. 25...

180
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,100
That one. It's Building No. 25.

181
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:29,900
<i>[Female Dormitory Building No. 25]</i>

182
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,240
Wait.

183
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,179
You take Xiaoju up first. I'll be back later.

184
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,609
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back soon.

185
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,880
Xiaoju.

186
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,040
Let's go.

187
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,620
It's here, Xiaoju. Come.

188
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,260
Come in.

189
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,529
Xiaoju, how about you take this bed?

190
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,119
It's convenient, and it's close to the desk.

191
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:24,420
Let's open the windows for some fresh air.

192
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,149
Thank you for today.

193
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,219
You can go back first.

194
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,439
It's okay. I can accompany you for a while more.

195
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,340
I still need to wait for Shiyi.

196
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,239
<i>When you're sad, he'll be with you and comfort you.</i>

197
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,560
What are you thinking?

198
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,810
Nothing.

199
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,199
It's quite hard to find your room.

200
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,589
It took me a long time.

201
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,469
You have good taste to have chosen this one.

202
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:01,200
The lower bunk is more convenient.

203
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,029
As a girl, can't you be more meticulous?

204
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,343
You just came here, and you didn't bring a thermos flask or mattress.

205
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,030
These are for you.

206
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,009
You're quite scrupulous today. Not like how you typically are.

207
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,880
I've always been scrupulous.

208
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,659
I'm going back now. I just suddenly came out and didn't tell my mom.

209
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,710
Take care of Xiaoju. Help her clean the dorm a bit.

210
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,869
Don't worry.

211
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,099
I'm leaving now.

212
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,519
Then be careful on the way back.

213
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,370
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

214
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,610
Thanks.

215
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,709
Are you here to help or make trouble for me?

216
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,220
There's dust all over it.

217
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,469
Wait. What did you say?

218
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,120
- You've wronged a good-hearted person.
- You...

219
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,789
I don't want to argue with you today.

220
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,560
Go sit down over there.

221
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,959
It seems like your roommates will report here tomorrow.

222
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,680
Are you sure you don't want to go back home today?

223
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,370
- I'm not going back home.
- What's wrong?

224
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,349
Did you argue with your brother again?

225
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,199
Xia Jiashu is a good boy.

226
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,099
Why do you always argue with him?

227
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,950
Then I can give him to your family.

228
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,539
You don't want your biological brother?

229
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:30,710
What did Xia Jiashu do to annoy you?

230
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,400
He broke my thing.

231
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,439
Because of this?

232
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,060
What great thing of yours did he break?

233
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,899
I can just buy you another one. Won't that do? Be happy.

234
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:41,179
If he broke something else, I would have forgiven him.

235
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,370
He just happened to have broken my shell–

236
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,270
What shell?

237
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,439
It's none of your business.

238
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,909
You... You don't need to be here anymore.

239
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,710
- You can leave.
- Okay.

240
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,020
By the way,

241
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,920
take it.

242
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,040
A shell hairpin?

243
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,979
- Where did you get it?
- Of course, I bought it.

244
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,440
- Did you buy this when we went to the sea?
- Yes.

245
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,000
I liked this hairpin when I first saw it.

246
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,850
<i>This hairpin is ugly.</i>

247
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,209
But didn't you say it looked ugly?

248
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,999
Something's not right. You're being nice to me for no reason.

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,999
- You must have an evil purpose.
- You...

250
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,440
What about me?

251
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,369
Yes, I have an evil purpose.

252
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,319
Take a look at your face in the window.

253
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,489
You must be ugly when you wear it.

254
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:39,570
I just want to see how ugly you'll be after wearing it.

255
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,999
This is a personal attack.

256
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,909
I'm just telling the truth. Am I wrong?

257
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:47,099
Go, go, go. Hurry and leave. I don't want to see you.

258
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,899
What are you doing? I'm just kidding.

259
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,010
<i>You argue every day that my head is about to burst.</i>

260
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,270
<i>It will be quiet if one of you leaves.</i>

261
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,159
<i>I'll award you again with a big drumstick. Here.</i>

262
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,089
<i>Thank you, Mom.</i>

263
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,709
<i>In order to help you transfer to this school,</i>

264
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,199
<i>your dad and I made so much effort and spent so much money.</i>

265
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,879
<i>Yet you're still not that good with your studies.</i>

266
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,540
<i>Seriously!</i>

267
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,380
<i>Xiaoju, what's wrong with you?</i>

268
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,309
<i>No matter what he did, you can't hit your brother.</i>

269
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,099
<i>As his sister, you should yield to your brother.</i>

270
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,309
<i>My mom won't listen to me every time.</i>

271
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,359
<i>Just because I'm his sister, I must yield to my brother?</i>

272
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,230
<i>I also hope Mom can care about me.</i>

273
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,799
<i>I can't feel mom's love for me.</i>

274
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,489
<i>That love is given to my brother more,</i>

275
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:30,400
<i>not me.</i>

276

278
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,300
I'm Xia Xiaoju.

279
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,600
Hello, I'm Huang Chan.

280
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
Hello, Xiaoju, I'm Gui Xiaoling.

281
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,900
Hello, hello.

282
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,200
- Let's be friends in the next four years.
- Okay.

283
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,800
Since it's four years, we can have a good chat later.

284
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,200
We'll clean up first. It's too messy.

285
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
- You're here, too?
- Hello.

286
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
You're being too unreasonable!

287
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
- How could there be such a person?
- That's right.

288
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
What are you looking at?

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,400
It'll be unfortunate to live with him.

290
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,400
What are you doing here?

291
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I live in this dorm.

292
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm taking over this whole dorm.

293
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
Go find Auntie to get another dorm for you.

294
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,100
Why would I do that?

295
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
"Why would I do that?"

296
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,400
Don't you see these are all my stuff?

297
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
There's no place for you to live here.

298
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,800
I think you should be the one to move out of here.

299
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,100
Bro, while I'm still talking nicely to you,

300
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,500
hurry and scram out of here. Do you hear me?

301
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,200
Or else, don't blame me for being rude to you.

302
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,400
What if I say no?

303
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,500
Then this problem can't be settled nicely.

304
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
I'll do it.

305
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,200
Look at what you've done.

306
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
No matter what happens, remember to call me, okay?

307
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,200
I know.

308
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,600
Don't miss me too much.

309
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,000
You can't put your books there.

310
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,300
It's convenient to put the books here.

311
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,600
Also, where do you want to put this?

312
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,500
Look at your snacks.

313
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I'm telling you to eat less in the future.

314
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,600
Eating snacks is bad for your health.

315
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,500
I'm going to eat it with my classmates.

316
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,900
Xiaoju.

317
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,000
Are you a local here?

318
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,800
Why are you here so early?

319
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,600
I have nothing to do at home,

320
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,900
so I came here to take a look around the school and get familiar with the surroundings.

321
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,700
Dad, Dad.

322
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's also get familiar and walk around.

323
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,100
I'm hungry now.

324
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,400
Let's go to eat something.

325
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,700
Okay, then let's hurry and go.

326
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,200
- Let's go. Let's go.
- I also want to go!

327
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,800
Then let's go together.

328
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Xiaoju, let's go together.

329
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,500
I won't be going, you two can go.

330
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,400
Then let's meet here at the dorm later.

331
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,700
- Okay.
- We shall go now.

332
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,400
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's clean it up when we get back.
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye.

333
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Let's go, Mom.

334
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,800
Then we'll be going now.

335
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Goodbye, Uncle.

336
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,600
Dorm Leader, look. I-Is this okay?

337
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,200
If you put it like that, it's not comfortable.

338
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,100
Okay, okay.

339
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,600
Look, is it okay like this?

340
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Okay, just put it like this.

341
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,900
By the way, just call me Shiyi in the future.

342
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,200
You don't need to call me Dorm Leader.

343
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,900
Dorm Leader Shiyi, is there anything else you want me to do?

344
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,600
Come here. Come here!

345
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,000
Cut the hair on your neck as soon as possible.

346
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
I feel uncomfortable looking at it.

347
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
I like a clean roommate, understand?

348
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,900
I'll cut it now.

349
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,600
Dorm Leader, I, Huang Jun,

350
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
like music the most, second is basketball.

351
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Other than that, I'm loyal.

352
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
I-I'll go and cut my hair now.

353
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,800
Since we live in the same dorm,

354
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,200
we're friends in the future.

355
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,500
I hope we can live in harmony.

356
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,400
Live in harmony.

357
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,300
Go. Go and cut your hair.

358
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,500
The g-guitar...

359
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,900
I'll go and cut my hair.

360
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,200
Go.

361
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,400
Cut it cleanly, okay?

362
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,700
Xiaoju?

363
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Taotao!

364
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
It's you! Oh my god.

365
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,000
When I was downstairs,

366
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,200
I was wondering if we'd live in the same room.

367
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,400
That's great!

368
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,800
What a coincidence!

369
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,000
I thought I would have no one to talk with, do you know?

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,400
What's wrong?

371
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,600
I'm fine. I'm just too excited.

372
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,800
Y-You didn't bring luggage?

373
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,200
Of course, I brought them. It's downstairs.

374
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,000
My parents are looking after it.

375
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,400
Okay, then I'll help you move in.

376
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,500
- Okay?
- Okay, let's go.

377
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,700
Xiaoju, you're so nice.

378
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,400
What else should we go buy later?

379
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
Let's buy some bananas.

380
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,700
Only bananas?

381
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,800
This dress is quite suitable for you.

382
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,500
Have a look here.

383
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,200
- This one?
- Yes.

384
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
I think it's just so-so.

385
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,500
There are silk scarves! Let's go and have a look.

386
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,800
Is this one pretty? Does it look pretty?

387
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,600
- What do you think?
- It's just so-so.

388
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000
Boss, how much is this silk scarf?

389
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,400
35 yuan.

390
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
It's too expensive, can you make it cheaper?

391
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,200
- Tell me how much you want it for?
- Ten yuan.

392
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
No, no. I'll lose money.

393
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,400
- Can you make it cheap—
- Boss, we'll go somewhere else to have a look. Let's go.

394
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,200
Ten yuan? That's too expensive.

395
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,800
I don't want it even if it costs five yuan.

396
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,200
- But I think it's pretty.
- Listen to me this time.

397
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,800
Wait a second!

398
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,100
Little girl!

399
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,700
I'll just sell it to you at a loss. Ten yuan.

400
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,800
Okay.

401
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,500
Sorry, Boss. My friend doesn't want to buy it anymore. Thank you.

402
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,100
Stop! What do you mean?

403
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,600
Just now, you were wasting my time by bargaining.

404
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,400
Now you don't want to buy it. Are you kidding me?

405
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,700
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- What do you mean you're sorry?

406
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,500
Why didn't you ask around to know that I have a bad temper on this street?

407
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
You must buy it today! You must buy it no matter what!

408
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,600
Hurry and pay up!

409
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
No, it's too expensive.

410
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,400
It costs only ten yuan. Give me money!

411
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,000
Hurry! You must buy it today!

412
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,300
Ten yuan! Hurry and pay up!

413
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,800
What do you mean it's expensive? Hurry and pay up!

414
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,900
Ten yuan! If you don't buy it, you won't leave today. Do you understand?

415
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,300
- No, Boss...
- Why are you shouting for?

416
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,600
Are you bullying girls?

417
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,800
Do you believe that I will call the police to arrest you?

418
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,200
Are you with them?

419
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,400
Do you want to uphold justice?

420
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,600
- Okay, call the police.
- What do we do?

421
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,800
Call them. Call the police!

422
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,500
- If you don't, I'll look down on you! Hurry up!
- Call the police!

423
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,000
Unscrupulous businessmen like you should be punished.

424
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,800
What are you doing?

425
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,600
I'm just kidding. Don't take it seriously.

426
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,800
Disperse! What are you looking at?

427
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,200
- Just continue your shopping!
- What kind of person is he?

428
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
Just go, leave!

429
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

430
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,000
You don't remember me, Tangerine?
<i>(T/N: Juzi, the "Ju" in her name means tangerine.)</i>

431
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,800
The sports event, soap?

432
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,200
Grapefruit?
<i>(T/N: Youzi, the "You" in Lin You means grapefruit.)</i>

433
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,600
Why are you here?

434
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm a student at Jiangzhou University.

435
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,800
We're in Jiangzhou University, too.

436
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
Which major are you studying?

437
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
Computer science major.

438
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,800
I just finished registering, so I came out here for shopping.

439
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,400
Okay, let's shop together then.

440
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,800
This is my good friend, Qiu Letao.

441
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,200
You can just call me Peach.
<i>(T/N: Taozi, the "Tao" in her name means peach.)</i>

442
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,000
Okay.

443
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
- Let's go, let's go.
- Okay.
- Let's go.

444
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You were so cool just now.

445
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
That's right, especially cool.

446
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,500
We're both accounting majors.

447
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,100
Lin You, you can even dance as well?

448
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,000
My mom had me learn it since I was young.

449
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,400
I didn't imagine that once I started learning it, I'd continue it until now.

450
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,600
No wonder you have such a good figure and demeanor.

451
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,000
If only I was as excellent as you, then that'd be great.

452
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,600
Taotao, do you know how hard it is to get into the computer science major?

453
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,400
Yet Lin You got into this major.

454
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
The reason why I'm majoring in computer science

455
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,600
is because it'll be easier to go abroad in the future.

456
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,200
Do you want to go abroad?

457
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,800
Maybe.

458
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,400
She wants to go abroad? She is so excellent.

459
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Hello.

460
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,100
She is too outstanding.

461
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,100
Okay, I'll go over there now then.

462
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,800
I'm sorry.

463
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,400
I might not be able to have lunch with you today.

464
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,800
The dance troupe wants me to hurry over there for a rehearsal.

465
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,900
It's fine.

466
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,600
We have plenty of time in the future.

467
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,400
- Let's have lunch next time.
- Okay.

468
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,700
If you want to find me,

469
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,600
you can go to the dance center over there.

470
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,500
I'll usually be there when I don't have classes.

471
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,200
Okay, go ahead first.

472
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,400
Let's meet next time.

473
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,700
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

474
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,300
Bye bye.

475
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,499
Look at her, and then look at you.

476
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,400
You're not any better either.

477
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,300
It's still early now.

478
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,600
Let's go somewhere else and walk around.

479
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,400
I'll take you to a good place.

480
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,800
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

481
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
<i>[Male Dormitory Building No. 29]</i>

482
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,269
Wait. Why did you take me here?

483
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:35,170
This is the male dormitory.

484
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:38,450
Let's go. It's okay. Don't be afraid.

485
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,570
Where is he?

486
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,910
Where is he?

487
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,069
What are you two doing sneaking around? Come here, come here!

488
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,030
Come in, come in!

489
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,400
Let's go.

490
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,713
You can just come here.

491
00:28:57,714 --> 00:28:58,720
You even brought fruits.

492
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,880
Bananas, tangerines, and what's this? Almonds.

493
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,610
That's not...

494
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,840
Go ahead and look around.

495
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,700
Feel this place.

496
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,759
How many people live here?

497
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,279
Two.

498
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,540
This is awesome.

499
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,999
We happen to have only one guy in each of our departments,

500
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,300
so we live in the same room.

501
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,560
You can even use a phone in your room?

502
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,720
This is so unfair.

503
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,440
Maybe the school is afraid that you girls will spend too much time on the phone, that you'll start fighting with each other.

504
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,360
Why do you also have a TV here?

505
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,230
Wait, TVs are forbidden at our school, right?

506
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,730
Yes.

507
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,372
- You're just going to blatantly put it here?
- Hey, don't!

508
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:43,560
Aren't you afraid this will be taken away by the dorm supervisor?

509
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,659
When he comes here for an inspection, I can just hide it in advance.

510
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,050
Whose guitars are these?

511
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:55,086
Don't touch it. They're not mine.

512
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,080
They are my roommate's.

513
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,109
- He plays rock.
- ♪ The sun has filled my chest ♪

514
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,049
Turn around! Turn... Turn around!

515
00:30:05,757 --> 00:30:06,829
Why are there girls in our room?

516
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,910
Look at you.

517
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,720
Why can't you wear clothes after taking a shower?

518
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,250
Why are you streaking? Seriously!

519
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,829
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Come here.

520
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,490
Let me introduce them to you.

521
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,109
They're my high school classmates.

522
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,730
Xia Xiaoju, Qiu Le Tao.

523
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,370
- Hello.
- Hello.

524
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,800
- This is my roommate, Huang Jun.
- Scared me to death.

525
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,915
Department of veterinary medicine.

526
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,440
It means a veterinarian.

527
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,310
We're both doctors.

528
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,709
He is a vet who plays rock.

529
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,692
This person is quite interesting.

530
00:30:40,693 --> 00:30:41,349
What are you laughing at?

531
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,630
Why are you laughing?

532
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,660
Okay, enough.

533
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,129
You've already seen my roommate's body.

534
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:50,050
I think you've visited this place long enough. If there's nothing else, go back.

535
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,150
That... Cheng Lang wasn't with you today?

536
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,600
Come here, come here! What a coincidence!

537
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,840
Xiaoju? Le Tao?

538
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,900
Why are you here?

539
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,949
They wanted to drop by.

540
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,783
No, it's been a long time since we last saw you guys after we finished registering,

541
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:11,200
so we came here to hangout with you.

542
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,130
Cheng Lang is in both the department of philosophy and of computer science.

543
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,330
Where will he have the time to hangout with you?

544
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,380
By the way, have you found out what your computer science schedule will be?

545
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,390
I found out what the schedule is like for the first half of the year,

546
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,110
but they told me that there might be adjustments this year.

547
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,999
Computer science?

548
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,069
Lin You is also in that major.

549
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,309
If you need any help in the future,

550
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,879
you can find her.

551
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,960
Lin You? Who is she?

552
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,349
She's the one that I dirtied her clothes at the sports event,

553
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:43,980
so I compensated her with the soap that you won.

554
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,430
I still remember her.

555
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,570
- Here.
- Where is she?

556
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,600
Stop.

557
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,069
Okay. Now let's have Lin You give us a demonstration.

558
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,230
There, there.

559
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,830
How is it? Is she pretty?

560
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,440
Okay, let's rest for a bit.

561
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,010
Lin You.

562
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,270
Do you want to attend computer science classes?
<i>(T/N: Not as an officially registered student, just to get a feel for the course.)</i>

563
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,490
I'd like to know what courses are available and their schedules.

564
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,229
Xiaoju told me you're in this major,

565
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,159
so I wanted to ask you for a favor.

566
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,000
No problem.

567
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,520
How about this? Come and find me after class tomorrow.

568
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,070
I'll give you a few books about computer science.

569
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,709
Thank you.

570
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,709
You're welcome.

571
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,910
Come on, everyone gather around.

572
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,300
- I'll go and rehearse now.
- Okay.

573
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,030
- Bye bye. See you tomorrow.
- Bye bye.

574
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,740
See you tomorrow.

575
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,279
Why did it get stuck?

576
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,120
Then let's not watch it.

577
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,850
It's time for lights out.

578
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:38,800
We're still watching a movie. Why did the electricity get cut off?

579
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,190
Think of a solution, think of a solution!

580
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,839
This works.

581
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,880
- Give it to me, give it to me!
- Here, the wire!

582
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,720
- Will it work?
- No problem.

583
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,490
Hurry!

584
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,590
Okay, it works.

585
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:10,300
It's exciting to watch a horror movie with the lights out.

586
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,560
What are you doing?

587
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,540
♫ <i>There you are, running wildly through the highlands</i> ♫

588
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,620
♫ <i>Another you is sighing silently</i> ♫

589
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:06,859

592

00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,299
