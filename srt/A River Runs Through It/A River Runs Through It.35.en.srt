I came here today to inform you that you're going to be a bridesmaid.

Hurry and tell me the truth. Who is the groom?

Cheng Lang bought these for me.

I told him that there aren't many people perming their hair anymore.

34
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,699
What I had before was already enough, but he said that wouldn't do.

35
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,269
He said I should keep up with the trends.

36
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,469
And he also said my former equipment is too old and not safe.

- You can return them!

I asked Xiaoju to buy things for me last time, and they can all be returned.

I must say! I was wondering how you knew how to buy things on the Internet!

Every time you ask her about marriage,

00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:15,429
she would just laugh it off, and then say that she knows what she's doing.

55

Cheng Lang is the same. He won't let me intervene.

We're getting old now.

57

Even if they won't let us intervene, we'd still be worried about it.

That's all it is. We'd get anxious.

Although Shiyi doesn't talk about it,

60
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm guessing he has someone.

61
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,349
You guys have boys. It's no problem if they delay it for two years,

62
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,829
but for my Xiaoju, that won't do.

63
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,229
If she delays it for two more years, she'll be an old maid.

64
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,109
I'm also worried about Cheng Lang.

65
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,829
Every time he comes back,

66
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,919
if he's not sleeping, then he's playing video games.

67

I don't have time to ask nor do I know how to ask him.

68
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,840
Then don't ask. Or else he'd be annoyed at you.

The first thing you should do right now is to contact the local travel agencies.

They have other travel routes.

82
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,789
They should be able to head directly north to Queensland.

83
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,599
Then they can change flights from Queensland to return here, understand?

Okay, I understand now. I'll be on it right now.

Who is this person that I must go?

159
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,440
- Hurry! We're coming! We're coming!
- All right, fine.

160
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,330
- Jiashu.
- Brother Cheng Lang.

161
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,830
Uncle Xia.

162
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,139
Cheng Lang, why are you here?

163
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,029
Old Xia, drink with Cheng Lang.

164
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,199
Uncle Xia, I drove today so I can't drink.

165
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,549
- Is that so?
- You drove? All right. Don't drink, then.

166
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:13,709
- Jiashu, get some beverages.
- Thanks, Jiashu.

167
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,209
- Thanks, Jiashu.
- You're welcome.

168
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,930
- Does everyone has something to drink?
- Everyone does.

169
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,400
Cheng Lang, eat this.

170
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,800
Thank you, Auntie.

171
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,700
I didn't know what you like to eat,

172
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,000
- so I just randomly prepared these dishes.
- Dad, here.

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't be so polite. Just make yourself at home.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,800
Okay.

175
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,400
Eat more.

176
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,000
Xiaoju, don't just eat on your own.

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,400
Why aren't you giving Cheng Lang some food?

178
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Mom, Cheng Lang is my best friend.

179
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,600
- Get food yourself, okay?
- Okay.

180
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,900
Look at you.

181
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,400
Cheng Lang hasn't been to our home for a long time.

182
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,500
You usually don't even take the initiative to invite Cheng Lang to our house for dinner.

183
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,200
That year when you needed to take the entrance exams,

184
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,400
if Cheng Lang didn't help tutor you,

185
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,600
would you have made it to a university?

186
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,700
True! That's right!

187
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,200
- Just make yourself at home.
- Here.

188
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Thank you, Auntie. I'll do it myself. I'll do it myself.

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,100
If you want to eat something in the future, just call me.

190
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,700
I like cooking.

191
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,800
Then I'll thank you in advance, Auntie.

192
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,200
Your mom said she likes cooking, but she didn't cook for us at noon.

193
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Have you still not figured it out?

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
She is looking for a son-in-law for you. Understand?

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What are you two whispering about?

196
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,400
- N-Nothing.
- Hurry up and eat.

197
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,700
Cheng Lang, eat more.

198
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,000
Eat more.

199
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,500
You said you drove here just now.

200
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,800
What kind of car do you drive?

201
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,600
- I—
- What's your position in the company?

202
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,000
How much is your salary?

203
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,800
Dad!

204
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,400
Why are you asking about these things?

205
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
- Just eat.
- Oh, that's right.

206
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
I'm just caring about him.

207
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

208
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Cheng Lang, you're not young anymore.

209
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,200
Do you have any plans for your future?

210
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,400
What plan?

211
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Getting married.

212
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,200
- Your career is developing smoothly now...
- Mom.

213
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,500
About your marriage...

214
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,900
- I...
- Mom.

215
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,600
You told Dad to stop talking about it,

216
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
yet you're still talking about it.

217
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,000
I won't talk about it anymore.

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
I hope you don't mind.

219
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
I don't mind. I don't mind. It's all right.

220
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,500
Your uncle and I just care about you.

221
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,200
Cheng Lang, eat more.

222
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
Hurry and eat more.

223
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,600
After dinner, have Xiaoju take you out for a walk.

224
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,500
She's right.

225
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,600
Take a walk around.

226
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,200
He's not an outsider! Besides, he grew up here.

227
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,100
Why should we walk around?

228
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,700
Cheng Lang was busy working in recent years.

229
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,600
How is he like you? You only know how to eat and play every day.

230
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,000
- Cheng Lang, Jiangzhou has changed a lot.
- Really?

231
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
She knows all about it.

232
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,400
Let her accompany you to walk around later.

233
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,500
Okay, no problem.

234
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,800
Xiaoju, we should hurry up and eat.

235
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,600
Walk around with me later.

236
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,700
Okay, I'll take him to walk around.

237
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,000
- That's right.
- Okay.

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,500
You guys go out and walk around later.

239
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,600
Eat more. Eat more.

240
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,200
Uncle, Auntie, I want to give you a toast.

241
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,800
- Okay. Here.
- Okay.

242
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,200
- Come here more often in the future.
- I'll come more often.

243
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,800
<i>[Guang Hui Hair Salon]</i>

244
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,800
I don't know what's wrong with my mom.

246
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
Auntie did it with good intentions.

247
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
It's okay.

248
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,300
My mom suddenly called me so many times and asked me to return immediately.

249
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,600
I thought something happened.

250
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,300
You don't think our moms think we're a couple, right?

251
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,600
So they deliberately collaborated for this dinner?

252
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,000
Thinking about this... it seems it's possible.

253
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,800
Get in the car.

254
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,400
Why do you think my mom is trying to bring us together?

255
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,400
Why are you laughing?

256
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,000
Classmate Xiaoju, could it be perhaps that you haven't given up on me yet,

257
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
so you did something to let your mom misunderstand?

258
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
What are you talking about?

259
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,300
I've long given up on you, okay?

260
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,700
You're right.

261
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,000
Your heart has followed someone across the sea,

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,600
to the other side of the ocean.

263
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,800
Don't mention Lu Shiyi to me.

264
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,900
Did I mention Lu Shiyi, these two words?

265
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,400
Many of our classmates have gone abroad, right?

266
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,200
You...

267
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,400
Okay, I won't tease you anymore.

268
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,000
Xiaoju.

269
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,400
These past few years, have you gotten a boyfriend?

270
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,900
You're making your parents so anxious.

271
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,300
I've tried going out with someone twice.

272
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,300
But I think it's... quite boring.

273
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,600
I heard that Shiyi is coming back to Jiangzhou soon.

274
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,400
That's... pretty good.

275
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,100
His parents are getting old.

276
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,200
He's been away for so many years.

277
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,100
He should have come back earlier.

278
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,600
Then do you still like him?

279
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,900
It's useless to talk about this anymore.

280
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,100
In our life, we need to look forward.

281
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,600
Maybe he has broken up with Shen Duo now.

282
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,200
I think you should tell him—

283
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,600
We've already missed the chance.

284
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,200
Even if he has broken up with Shen Duo,

285
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,400
he hasn't contacted me all these years.

286
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,900
Doesn't that already mean something?

287
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,000
At least, you tried fighting for it.

288
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,400
Even if you may get a bad result,

289
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,700
don't leave yourself with regrets.

290
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,300
Xiaoju.

291
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,400
I hope you can be happy.

292
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,900
Cheng Lang, I know what you meant.

293
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,100
But after all these years,

294
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,300
we have all changed.

295
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,400
Maybe he already has a girlfriend and is talking about marriage.

296
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,400
But you. You're pushing me away so anxiously.

297
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Do you dislike being misunderstood as a couple with me?

298
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,900
Yes.

299
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,900
You eat so much,

300
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,800
if you really become my girlfriend,

301
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,400
I'll be broke in no time.

302
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
What's wrong?

303
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,600
Actually there's one thing,

304
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,400
I...

305
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,700
I didn't dare to tell you.

306
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,000
What is it?

307
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,500
What can make you become so troubled like this?

308
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,700
Tell me.

309
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,400
Let's see if you can make me troubled as well.

310
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Lin You is married.

311
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,900
Really? That's great.

312
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,500
Do you two still keep in touch after all these years?

313
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,500
Tell her congratulations for me.

314
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,000
What's wrong?

315
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,400
Isn't this quite good?

316
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,800
No matter what, we used to be classmates before.

317
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,900
Now that I know she's living quite well... I'm relieved.

318
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,069
It's late.

319
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,000
I need to go on a business trip next week.

It's... It's so late, and you still need to go back to the company?

322
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,400
It's rare for you to come back.

you can arrange it with Tour Guide Xia directly.

From the boss to his employees, the educational level is about the same.

Why don't you say it's your name that's too uncommon?

367
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,860
Is this Tour Guide Xia's usual attitude towards customers?

368
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,349
Tell me how you're going to arrange it.

Let's talk about business.

370
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,860
Mr. Lu grew up in Jiangzhou.

371
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,780
I wonder, what kind of service I can provide you?

372
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,919
Here's the thing.

373
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,109
I plan on proposing to my girlfriend,

374
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,159
so I specifically ordered this romantic tour.

375
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,879
About this tour, I want you to take me to the tour spots in advance first.

376
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,550
I'll have to trouble you, Tour Guide Xia.

377
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,900
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

378
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,159
I can't help fulfill your request of a romantic tour.

379
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,639
I can recommend my colleague to you.

380
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,999
He specializes in newlyweds—

381
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,660
But the tour guide that I specifically requested in the contract is you.

382
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,399
Please trust my professional judgment.

383
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,620
If you want,

384
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,660
I can call him here.

385
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,980
Okay.

386
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,840
If you insist to do so,

387
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,740
there's nothing I can do about it.

388
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,829
By this time, your President Li should have already stamped the contract.

389
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,279
I'll just talk to him directly about the penalty from the breach of contract.

390
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,410

Or else you'll have to bear the consequences.

It's a vast municipal lake.

There's a broad view of the beautiful natural landscape,

398
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,010
and the rich surrounding landscapes. They form—

399
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,639
Is this the level of your company's ace tour guide?

400
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,810
I think that your professional abilities are just mediocre.

401
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,690
How do you guys have the nerve to charge so much money?

402
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,020
What do you mean?

403
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,850
Can you stop talking sarcastically?

404
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:23,909
Mr. Lu, if you're not satisfied with anything, please tell me at any time.

405
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,999
Of course, I'm not satisfied.

406
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,759
Since it is a privately customized tour,

407
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,020
then you'll need to arrange it flexibly,

408
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,880
according to the customer's needs.

409
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,759
What do you mean?

410
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,169
Do you want to go to all these places?

411
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:40,600
I need to visit more places and compare them,

412
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,710
so that I'll know which tour route suits my girlfriend best.

Haven't you already been there before?

Isn't it good to let my girlfriend know more about my past?

I'm sorry, Mr. Lu. We have a limited amount of time for this tour.

It's such a long drive to Yunhai.

It's easy to feel sleepy.

Also, I don't have a habit of talking about my girlfriend with other women.

00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:24,370
♫ <i>Listening to your voice in the darkness</i> ♫

480
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,200
We've arrived?

481
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,229
Why didn't you wake me up?

482
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,589
You snored so loudly, Tour Guide Xia.

483
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,390
Non...

484
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,469
Mr. Lu, I never snore when I'm sleeping.

485
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,730
Let's get out of the car, Tour Guide Xia.

486
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,930
This place developed very well.

487
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,250
It has changed a lot. It's completely different than what it used to be.

488
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,459
I remember when you took us here back then, this place was just a wild beach.

489
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:19,230
Now, it has been developed so well.

490
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,330
It seems the old you had an eye for beautiful tourist attractions back then.

491
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,759
I wonder who said my professional judgment was mediocre just now.

492
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,450
Fine. Lead the way, Tour Guide Xia.

493
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,100
It's so comfortable!

494
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,430
I remembered the year we graduated from high school, you lost all of our money.

495
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,759
We climbed over that whole mountain in order to reach the beach over there.

496
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,400
It feels different when I spend money to travel here!

497
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,259
Lu Shiyi, about that thing, you have no right to comment.

498
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:05,129
You didn't give me your money at that time, so I didn't lose your money.

499
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:07,200
Tour Guide Xia, have a look.

500
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,399
Do you see the beach over there?

501
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,060
If I make a heart shape covered with shells,

502
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,850
or if I write out, "I love you,"

503
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,890
I think my girlfriend will like it, right?

504
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,509
Go and ask your girlfriend.

505
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:24,069
I'm not your girlfriend.

506
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,279
But don't you girls like reading those romantic novels?

507
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,229
Don't the overbearing CEO's in those novels all propose like this?

508
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,919
Besides, the beach itself is full of mysteries.

509
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,880
I feel like it can't go wrong if I give her a romantic surprise here.

510
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,899
Whatever. As long as you're happy.

511
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,770
Tour Guide Xia.

512
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,330
What?

513
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,910
Come here.

514
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,290
Pick one for me.

515
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,800
Not bad.

516
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,000
<i>Taotao, Taotao. Is it pretty? Is it pretty?</i>

517
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

518
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,200
<i>This hairpin is so ugly,</i>

519
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,300
<i>but it suits you well.</i>

520
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,000
<i>No one will think you're a dummy if you don't talk.</i>

521
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,900
<i>Take it.</i>

522
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,300
<i>The shell hairpin.</i>

523
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,500
<i>Where did you get it?</i>

524
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,100
<i>Nonsense! Of course, I bought it!</i>

525
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,400
<i>I can only ask Datu to buy a new one for me.</i>

526
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,000
Boss, please wrap this bracelet for me. Please wrap it nicely.

527
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Thanks.

528
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Handsome, you have a good eye. Ten yuan.

529
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Of course.

530
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,500
This is for my girlfriend.

531
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,600
Lu Shiyi! You clearly already wanted to get this bracelet.

532
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,800
Why would you still ask me to pick something for you?

533
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,900
I suddenly remember.

534
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,600
My girlfriend doesn't like wearing these kinds of shell hairpins.

535
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,900
This bracelet suits her better.

536
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,100
What do you think?

537
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,700
Why are you walking so quickly?

538
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Time is limited.

539
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,800
I just want to finish your plan as soon as possible.

540
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,400
You're right.

541
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,200
I want to make the most romantic proposal for my girlfriend.

542
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,600
So... I'll have to thank you.

543
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,000
It's my job.

544
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,200
There's no need to thank me.

545
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,900
After the proposal, I want to set off magnificent fireworks here.

546
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,000
She'll surely like it.

547
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,600
Okay, you do that.

548
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,000
As long as the both of you are happy.

549
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,200
What are you doing?

550
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
I'm taking a photo.

551
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,800
Just take it. Didn't you say you want to take pictures?

552
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,200
Can you step away?

553
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,700
I want to take a photo of the sea for my girlfriend.

554
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,400
Thank you.

555
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,200
This is beautiful.

556
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,000
This angle is good.

557
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,800
I'm practically a master of photography.

558
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,500
Oh my god.

559
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,800
Have you taken enough pictures yet?

560
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
Can you stop disturbing me while taking photos? Okay?

561
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
Okay, just take photos here.

562
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Take more photos!

563
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
Lu Shiyi.

564
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,700
Lu Shiyi!

565
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,400
Lu Shiyi, stand right there!

566
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,200
Why do we have to stay here for a night?

567
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,000
Why didn't you say so in advance?

568
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Aren't you a professional tour guide?

569
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Do you still need to ask about these types of things?

570
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,700
When you took us to Yunhai before,

571
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,800
we also stayed here for one night.

572
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,200
Or else how could it be called a nostalgic tour, right?

573
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
I didn't bring anything.

574
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,500
How can I stay here?

575
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,700
You don't need to bring anything. I've already arranged everything for you.

576
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,800
Someone will send it to you soon.

577
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,000
Do you want to sleep upstairs or downstairs?

578
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,100
It's too tiring to climb the stairs.

579
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
I'll sleep downstairs.

580
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,800
- You...
- Be quiet upstairs.

581
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,900
Don't disturb my rest.

582
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,400
You!

583
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,000
Childish.

584
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,400
<i>Xia Xiaoju!</i>

585
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,000
Xia Xiaoju! Xia Xiaoju! Xia Xiaoju! Xia Xiaoju! Xia Xiaoju!

586
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
<i>Tour Guide Xia!</i>

587
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
Xia Xiaoju!

588
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,100
Why are you shouting there?

589
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,000
It's a public place. Can you please be quiet?

590
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,400
Of course I have something to tell you.

591
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,700
Hurry and come downstairs for dinner. Don't make me go upstairs and drag you down here.

592
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,000
If I did what you told me to do, I'll lose my face.

593
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,200
Come upstairs if you can.

594
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,000
- Come downstairs!
- You come up here!

595
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,200
I told you to come down here!

596
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
<i>- Come down here!
- You come up here!</i>

597
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,800
<i>Do you dare to come down here?</i>

598
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
<i>Do you dare to come up here?</i>

599
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,100
You come up here!

600
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,800
Okay, enough playing around.

601
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,100
Hurry and come down here. Hurry up.

602
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,000
- Thank you.
- Hello, Sir.

603
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,500
Here's your lover's duo meal.

604
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,600
Waitress, please bring the menu.

605
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,100
Okay, Miss, please wait.

606
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,600
Don't you like the meal I ordered?

607
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,200
I'm a vegetarian now.

608
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,600
You've liked eating meat for so many years.

609
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,200
How could you change so suddenly?

610
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,000
You're not on a diet, are you?

611
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You're already so thin.

612
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,200
You don't need to lose weight.

613
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,000
The steak here is delicious.

614
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,800
Have a taste.

615
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,600
Why are you looking at me?

616
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,500
It's getting cold.

617
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,500
Lu Shiyi, what is the meaning of this?

618
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,800
You're someone who already has a girlfriend.

619
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,600
Yet, you're eating a lover's duo meal with someone else?

620
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,200
Do you not know what it means to have a sense of propriety?

621
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,100
Xia Xiaoju, do we have some kind of misunderstanding?

622
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,400
Aren't we here to visit places for my romantic proposal tour?

623
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,200
At most, we're just here trying out the lover's duo meal.

624
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,800
This is part of your job.

625
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,500
Lu Shiyi. I won't serve you anymore.

626
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,000
You can call whoever you want.

627
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,800
If worst comes to worst, I'll just quit!

628
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,200
I can compensate you for breach of contract.

629
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,800
I refuse to take on your request.

630
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,400
Goodbye.

631
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,200
Xiaoju. Xia Xiaoju!

632
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
Xia Xiaoju! Let me explain.

633
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,500
Xia Xiaoju.

634
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,600
You already have a girlfriend and yet you're flirting with me.

635
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,300
I won't be fooled by you!

636
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,000
Xiaoju, let me explain.

637
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,100
- I...
- Let me go!

638
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,800
You deserve it!

639
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,400
Xia Xiaoju! I can't swim!

640
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,700
