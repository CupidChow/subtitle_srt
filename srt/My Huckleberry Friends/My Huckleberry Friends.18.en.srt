Hello, old times

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,340
Hello, old times is a 30 episodes series, adapted from August Changan's novel of the same name.

4
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,740
Xinrui is damn annoying. How can he be seated in the middle?

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,180
Indeed. Why not take a look at herself?

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,130
How dare a minor role can like me?

7
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,720
Enough.

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,610
I am not a minor role. Not.

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,530
You are an audiance all your life. We are the lead.

00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,830
Episode 18 The Farthest Distance

11
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,720
bright and early...blab, blab, blab...

12
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,530
Can we just take a good sleep?

13
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,800
You bastard. Get up right now.

14
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,780
Our daughter has been helping look after the shop for a long time.

15
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,079
Hurry up and done your meal soon. Then go to school.

16
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,420
Mom

17
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,880
What's wrong?

18
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,220
Want money?

19
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,010
I want a mobile phone.

20
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,810
I know it. No way.

21
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,250
Mom

22
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,450
Could I buy a repeater?

23
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,440
What is that for?

24
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,220
It's necessary for recording when reading the textbook.

25
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,650
Buy what the fuck repeater?

26
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,140
That's a waste of money.

27
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,450
You don't think I know nothing about the dumb English,

28
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,700
which doesn't need to speak,

29
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,210
but just read and write.

30
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,140
But

31
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,850
But what

32
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,370
You use the pen or your mouth to take the exam

33
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,220
Pen.

34
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,610
That's right

35
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,650
You bastard,

36
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,780
I will let you die there if you don't get up now.

37
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,860
Okay. Okay.

38
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Hey, Yu.

39
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,500
Why are you so upset?

40
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,250
You don't like that movie?

41
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,370
Yes, I like it.

42
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,730
Then that must be Lin Yang.

43
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,450
He is still worrying about that thing happened during New Year.

44
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,610
I don't know when he will let it go.

45
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,610
In my opinion, you can't fully blame it on him.

46
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,970
He is just too care about you, which lead to the mess.

47
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,140
He is worrying about you.

48
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,490
But that's too much.

49
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,420
Ah. Let's leave him alone.

50
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,140
Again. You come so early to take the seat.

51
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,770
What's wrong?

52
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,420
Nothing.

53
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,810
I just thought you wouldn't come today.

54
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,700
I don't want to come either.

55
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,770
That's all because of this physics competition.

56
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,530
I must well prepared in the last minute rush.

57
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,330
Ahh...

58
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,330
My apologies the other day.

59
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,620
If I knew that was a movie,

60
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,810
we could date together.

61
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,580
Is this your book for the physics competition?

62
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,210
Can I have a look?

63
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:15,810
Yes.

64
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,900
Bravo.

65
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,900
All these are beyond our reach.

66
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,300
Nope.

67
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,490
You have done your routines.

68
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,020
And then you could still spare some time to do this.

69
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,090
Ahh

70
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,980
Here is an extraction.

71
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,930
I always found my pronunciation not very accurate.

72
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,050
It's a bit weird.

73
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,370
Is this one?

74
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,860
Your pronunciation is much more accurate than mine.

75
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,090
No. Mine sucks.

76
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,580
If you want to read this well,

77
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,130
you must listen to the tape as much as you can and then practice it accordingly.

78
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,020
I have lost my tape long long ago.

79
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,970
How I wished I worked hard at the early stage.

80
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,740
Actually, I haven't utilized the tape for a long time.

81
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,930
You could also listen to MP3.

82
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,770
Yes. But its storage capacity is too limited.

83
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,460
Actually, I always burn CDs.

84
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,420
Listen to CD directly.

85
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,180
Burn CD?

86
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,930
That's burn MP3 into CD.

87
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,620
it's convenient. And the storage capacity is okay.

88
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,420
It includes main content of high school, senior and junior.

89
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,180
It is a piece of cake.

90
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,080
How about this? I will give a CD to you.

91
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,980
to me?

92
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,620
Thanks for

93
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,360
saving seat for me all the time.

94
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,370
Thanks.

95
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:39,860
No problem.

96
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,420
Anything good happened?

97
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,330
Nothing.

98
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,210
Good shot.

99
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,330
What are you watching?

100
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,090
You know her?

101
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,620
We are in the same after-school class.

102
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,620
Really?

103
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,420
Why is Xin Rui running everyday?

104
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,900
That proves you watch her everyday.

105
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,140
She is gorgerous these days.

106
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,250
Nothing changed compared with what I saw last time.

107
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,800
You are wavering.

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
What are you talking about?

109
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,210
Anyway, not smarter than our Qianqian.

110
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,620
But I think

111
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,850
better than Zhouzhou

112
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,090
There is an elective course called aesthetics in college.

113
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,180
I suggest you could major it.

114
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,620
Lin Yang

115
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,210
Do you need me to save a seat for you tomorrow?

116
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,740
Appreciate it.

117
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,900
It's really hard to get up so early for me.

118
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,420
No worries. I go to bed very early.

119
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,740
Ah, that CD.

120
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,180
I will keep that in mind.

121
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,810
See you.

122
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,620
Bye-bye.

123
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,420
What happened?

124
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,460
Don't you see it. She was borrowing English CD from me.

125
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,010
Do you have some difficulties with Yu Zhouzhou?

126
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,050
Alter your target?

127
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,930
What is wrong?

128
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,020
Actually, I really want to

129
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,050
have a talk with Zhouzhou.

130
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,420
But each time it becomes super embarrassing.

131
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,570
I don't know why.

132
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,090
If you'd like to take my advice,

133
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,169
I think you just care about Yu Zhouhou too much.

134
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,090
The correct attitude is

135
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,090
take it easy.

136
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,740
Morning.

137
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:55,980
Morning.

138
00:08:59,260 --> 00:08:59,520
Ah

139
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,330
I brought the CD you mentioned last time.

140
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,330
CD

141
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,060

142
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:04,860
Yes.

143
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:05,980
Thank you.

144
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,450
That's all right.

I just draw it casually.

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,740
Unfortunately, I don't have a CD player.

154
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,290
Oh. I bring one with me.

Correct.

Can I take a look on this?

174
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,010
You have so many CDs.

175
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,620
These are my recent selections.

176
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,300
Which one sounds good?

177
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,260
Let me have a look.

178
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,820
I think you've heard Jay Zhou's and Stefanie Sun's

179
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,010
Ah, have you ever heard the band of The Flowers?

180
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,570
A very fabulous band.

181
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,980
The vocal is just a few years older than us.

182
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,890
I will listen to their songs while I am doing my homework.

183
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,500
Which one is your favorite?

184
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,980
The last one,

185
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,180
called Foam.

186
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,090
Previously

187
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,690
I always think they are not decent and act inappropriately.

188
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,450
Later on, a friend recommends it to me.

189
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,980
Once I heard it, single cycle for a month.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,210
This is the homework for today.

191
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,080
Please help to give out your homework.

192
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,690
Zhouzhou

193
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,410
Can I borrow that?

194
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,210
Yes.

195
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,650
Just in time. My ears hurt.

196
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,210
Ah, what songs are you listening to now?

197
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,690
No, I am listening to English textbook.

198
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,820
CD.

199
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,260
A friend gives it to me.

200
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,380
You've made such big progress recently.

201
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,490
I am supposing you will surpass me soon.

202
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,860
Impossible.

203
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,450
I will bring you the charging line.

204
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,740
You don't need it?

205
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,500
No, I don't.

206
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,300
The huge progress you have made

207
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,380
give me very big pressure.

208
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,170
Don't be ridiculous.

209
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,530
Fighting.

210
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,050
Thanks.

211
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,690
You are welcome.

212
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,060
Lin Yang, you haven't got a seat?

213
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,890
Come here to dinner with us.

214
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,010
I am afraid I am not so welcome by someone.

215
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,970
Who will be not glad?

216
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,620
Lin Yang,

217
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,690
what lessons do you want to teach us?

218
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,210
We will try to reflect ourselves soon.

219
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,620
I had better sit over there.

220
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,980
What is wrong with you?

221
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,820
Can we just turn to another page?

222
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,330
You've heard his deliberately surly talking.

223
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,980
Too hard to deal with. Hopeless.

224
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,500
Just eat.

225
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:00,890
Stop.

226
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,180
Xin Meixiang

227
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,180
This one works, right?

228
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,740
Xin Meixiang

229
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,500
What are you doing?

230
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,770
Nothing. We need to talk.

231
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,570
What happened to you these days?

232
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,650
What are you talking about?

233
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,980
I think you've changed.

234
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,530
Do not read too much Stands Literature.

235
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,090
What have I changed?

236
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
Look at your hair.

237
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,740
How can it be this?

238
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,570
You skin is whiter.

239
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,090
Your temperament has changed, too.

240
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,740
Your marks has increased.

241
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,000
And you are running every day.

242
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,380
So

243
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,820
can I take it as a compliment?

244
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,530
Take it as a compliment.

245
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,810
Let me tell you.

246
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,500
No matter what you've done,

247
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,300
You are still that tasteless Xin Meixiang.

248
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,200
You don't think you change your name to Xinrui,

249
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,740
you could become fancy.

250
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,420
That's useless.

251
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,300
Boring.

252
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,770
You know yourself

253
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,570
you won't be Ling Xiangqian

254
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,740
or Yu Zhouzhou.

255
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
Then what you expect me to be?

256
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,420
The same as you.

257
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,740
Playing games when having classes?

258
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,450
Smoking at the corner all day long.

259
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,060
Robbing money from pupils?

260
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,940
Bullying girls?

261
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,330
If you don't like that, I can change.

262
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,320
Just do what you like.

263
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,450
That's nothing to do with me.

264
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,650
I see that recently you become close to Lin Yang.

265
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,820
But you know that yourself

266
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,770
You are not the same people.

267
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,330
We

268
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,820
We and they have nothing in common.

269
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,170
Is there any meaning that you force yourself?

270
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,130
None of your business.

271
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,300
Are you happy?

272
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:52,980
Yes.

273
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,130
You surely are.

274
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,450
You can study hard.

275
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,180
You can get higher marks and become smarter.

276
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,130
All that.

277
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,010
But is there anything wrong with previous Xinrui.

278
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,380
Do you know me?

279
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,090
Be anyone else,

280
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,890
except myself.

281
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,890
So you want to be You Zhouzhou.

282
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,130
You want to do what exactly what she does,

283
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,650
even grow fond of Lin Yang, right?

284
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,500
Shut up.

285
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,380
Okay. Please pay attention here, everyone.

286
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,089
You may encounter various issues here.

287
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,170
Then, I will explain to you.

288
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,980
Paraphrasing.

289
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,980
Sometimes, though there is some new words in the article,

290
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,540
I am late.

291
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,780
the author may

292
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,859
-explain the new words somehow -Just started.

293
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,740
That's all because of Jiang Chuan.

294
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,680
Requested me to play CS.

295
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,090
I've got very bad luck today.

296
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:29,930
I lost several sets.

297
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,860
What's wrong?

298
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,040
Nothing.

299
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,780
It's a little difficult today.

300
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,500
What's wrong?

301
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,380
You don't talk much today and look preoccupied.

302
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,570
Nothing.

303
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,860
Maybe because I didn't sleep well last night.

304
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,890
Well, just go back and have a good rest.

305
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,620
Ok, see you tomorrow.

306
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,290
Bye.

307
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,660
What happened?

308
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,690
Come here.

309
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,690
Never mind.

310
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,020
Can you still walk?

311
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,740
Yeah, I'm fine. You go back first.

312
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,170
The bus stop isn't far anyway.

313
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,050
I‘ve got to go.

314
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,290
Ah, let me hail a taxi to see you home.

315
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,620
My house is up ahead.

316
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,930
[Mei Xiang Grocery Store]

317
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,450
You live here.

318
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,210
Yeah, it's shabby.

319
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,050
It has long been said that the house will be demolished,

320
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,450
so we didn't decorate it much.

321
00:18:59,050 --> 00:18:59,730
You know,

322
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,980
when I was a child,

323
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,740
what I envied most was the children whose families run snack bars.

324
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,290
I always think they can have endless snacks,

325
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,380
endless notebooks and pens.

326
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,020
It's too good to be true.

327
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,530
If my mom knew I was taking something,

328
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,380
she would slap me in the face.

329
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,050
You are so serious even when you‘re joking.

330
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,260
Thank you for taking me home.

331
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,810
Then, I have to go now.

332
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,450
Ok,

333
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:20,900
oh,

334
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,210
remember to apply cold water to your feet,

335
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,850
when you get home.

336
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,540
Otherwise it will be difficult to reduce the swelling.

337
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,140
I used to sprain my ankle like this when I was playing basketball.

338
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:28,930
Thanks.

339
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,380
Bye.

340
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,620
You bad girl!

341
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,020
Mom!

342
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,920
Why you come back so early?

343
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,090
Have you skipped the class？

344
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,450
Mom!

345
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,290
How dare you?

346
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,620
Mom, I'm not.

347
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,380
I came back by taxi, so...

348
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,140
You took a taxi back?

349
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,860
You know how to enjoy life now.

350
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
Mrs, Mrs!

351
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,490
The thing is that,

352
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,210
Xin Rui sprained her ankle,

353
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,210
and I called a taxi to take her back.

354
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,050
Who are you?

355
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,890
I'm her classmate, in the same cram school.

356
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,780
What's your name?

357
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,330
Lin Yang.

358
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,570
Which school are you in?

359
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,280
Also in Zhen Hua.

360
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,860
Zhen Hua... Lin Yang...

361
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,810
Oh! It was you who were praised by the teacher

362
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,900
at the last parent-teacher meeting.

363
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,500
Thanks for taking Xin Rui back.

364
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,860
Come on in and take a seat.

365
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,380
Mrs.

366
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,780
Mom, our home...

367
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,740
Lin Yang took a taxi to bring you back.

368
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,290
Let him in for a glass of water.

369
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,540
Come on, Lin Yang, come in.

370
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,660
Ok, ok.

371
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,090
Lin Yang, have some candies.

372
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,020
Thank you.

373
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,370
They're almost overdue.

374
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,380
Eat it. She's talking nonsense.

375
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,020
Ok.

376
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,260
Lin Yang.

377
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,140
If I recall correctly,

378
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,930
your parents are both government cadres, right?

379
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,570
They are just responsible for trivial matters at work.

380
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,680
That's pretty good.

381
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,660
Don't like me.

382
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,020
I just run this small store,

383
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,500
working my ass off every day.

384
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,980
This daughter, ah, is also not good enough.

385
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,900
Mrs, Xin Rui is good.

386
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,810
Good? She has brought so many troubles since she was  child.

387
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,620
There is nothing she can do for the home.

388
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,690
And now, she becomes more weird.

389
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,090
She goes to bed when coming back.

390
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
And always getting up in the middle of the night,

391
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,040
which makes it difficult for her father and me

392
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,170
to have a good rest.

393
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,660
Do you really go to bed at eight?

394
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,050
They always quarrel. So I can't study.

395
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,260
We quarrel?

396
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,210
So it's our fault?

397
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,860
Your cram school

398
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,740
cost me a lot of money.

399
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,500
How long do I have to work to earn these money.

400
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,380
Mrs, I think,

401
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,930
the most important thing for students is study.

402
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,860
When Xin Rui first came to Zhen Hua,

403
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,740
her study was not good in fact.

404
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,140
After only half a semester,

405
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,210
she has made great progress.

406
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,140
She must have made great efforts.

407
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,410
As parents, you should give her more understanding.

408
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,620
Really?

409
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,380
You didn't show your mother your report card?

410
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,500
I did,

411
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,450
but she just made a perfunctory reply,

412
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,210
and didn't take it seriously.

413
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,690
There are so many students in the school,

414
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,330
and it is normal for

415
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,660
the ranking to change from time to time.

416
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,570
Zhen Hua is the best high school in our province,

417
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,780
and it has the best students as well.

418
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,260
It's very difficult to

419
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,020
make a little progress.

420
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,740
Not to mention that Xin Rui is a transfer student.

421
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,280
In such a short period of time,

422
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,260
it is not easy to

423
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,410
make such a great leap.

424
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,410
And I think she still has room for improvement.

425
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,680
She?

426
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,540
Come on.

427
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,890
Ah, can't you keep your voice down?

428
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,380
This soup is so delicious.

429
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,140
You are so gluttonous and lazy.

430
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,450
Did you play cards with Mr. Wang again today?

431
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,170
I was going to come back early,

432
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,410
Mr. Wang insisted on taking me there.

433
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,980
I'm full.

434
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,380
I'm going to bed.

435
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,780
It's only seven thirty now.

436
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,290
Don't you wash the dishes?

437
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,210
I have to go to bed early,

438
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,140
and get up to read.

439
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,370
By the way,

440
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,130
If you want to quarrel,

441
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,010
keep your voice down.

442
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,500
I'm afraid I can't sleep well.

443
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,980
Eh, when does she dare to talk to you like that?

444
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,780
Leave her alone.

445
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,330
Zhouzhou, let's go.

446
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,810
Xin Rui.

447
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,610
You must have done well in the English exam this time.

448
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,380
I'm sure I can't compare with you.

449
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,570
I got to go now.

450
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,800
Eh,

451
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,780
we finally finished the exam,

452
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,020
don't you take a break?

453
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,930
You haven't come to the comics and animation club for a long time.

454
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,810
I am weak in basic knowledge,

455
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,660
so I have to read more books when you spend your club time.

456
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,810
I‘m leaving now.

457
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,260
So horrible.

458
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,770
You know that I've always been afraid of two kinds of people.

459
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,410
One is those who can lose weight after the New Year,

460
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,540
and the other is those who can still study after the exam.

461
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,660
Is there anything else that these two kinds of people can't do?

462
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,570
Affectation.

463
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,450
Who knows whether she goes back to study?

464
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,620
She has done well in the exam once, and she becomes complacent.

465
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,020
It seems like she has put a lot of pressure on you.

466
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,290
Don't you worry?

467
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,050
Zhouzhou,

468
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,050
I think you should be careful about Xin Rui.

469
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,690
Why?

470
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,810
Are you afraid she'll overtake me?

471
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,450
I don't care about it.

472
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,450
I can't tell you why,

473
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,380
but I think that,

474
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,410
you are too good to her,

475
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,050
and she is ambitious.

476
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,780
I vaguely feel a little dangerous.

477
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,260
Vaguely?

478
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,570
Did you feel it by sight, taste or touch?

479
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,090
It's my seventh sense.

480
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,500
[Lin Yang: Zhouzhou, how long are you going to have the cold war with me?]

481
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,310
[New Message To: Lin Yang It's you that always say something obscure.]

482
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,200
[Lin Yang: If there's anything I've done to upset you, I apologize.]

483
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,780
[Can we have a talk tomorrow?]

484
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,670
[New Message To: Lin Yang Ok. ]

485
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,210
Hey, let me tell you something.

486
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,020
The score gap between Zhouzhou and Ling Xiangqian is very small this time.

487
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,210
The math score of Ling Xiangqian is 145, which is five points higher than that of Yu Zhouzhou.

488
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,050
But Yu Zhouzhou's Chinese and English combined scores

489
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,450
are 12 points higher than Ling Xiangqian.

490
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,900
But their scores of history and geography are about the same.

491
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,140
Well, you are really worried about others.

492
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,010
You screwed up the exam yourself,

493
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,500
and you still have time to care about the other two.

494
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,620
You're wrong.

495
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,620
I can't take part in the Olympic Games.

496
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,210
Can't I, can't I watch the Olympic Games?

497
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,170
Besides, they compete so fiercely in every exam.

498
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,260
I get nervous every time, you know?

499
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,570
You really have the spirit of entertainment.

500
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,740
But Zhouzhou screwed up politics this time.

501
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,570
Ling Xiangqian's score is 93.

502
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,690
Yu Zhouzhou's score is 77.

503
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,330
Oh my God, Yu Zhouzhou is out of the game directly.

504
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,170
You have overlooked a contestant.

505
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,780
She has done very well in the exam this time.

506
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,540
Come on.

507
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,500
She is the unseeded player.

508
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,260
Hey, Xin Rui, have you calculated your score this time?

509
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,450
No, I haven't.

510
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,570
[Xin Rui No.1 Ling Xiangqian No.2 Yu Zhouzhou No.3]

511
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,280
The ranking of the mid-term exam.

512
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
I just printed it out.

513
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,410
Take a look at it.

514
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,140
Is there anything you want to say?

515
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,170
Xin Rui has been working very hard recently,

516
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,690
but I don't expect her to make so much progress.

517
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,170
I didn't do well in this exam. I have nothing to say.

518
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,260
I'm not the kind of teacher who only looks at rankings, right?

519
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,260
Xin Rui has made great progress this time.

520
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,780
All teachers are very happy.

521
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,900
But the reason why she got the first place in the exam,

522
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,980
mainly thanks to you two who are going backwards at the same time.

523
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,860
Did you two discuss to retrogress together in advance?

524
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,860
Ling Xiangqian, English is your strong point.

525
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,140
But it's 20 points less than the last time.

526
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,170
Yu Zhouzhou,

527
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,540
Your politics just get a score of 77.

528
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,980
I thought I had typed it wrong at first.

529
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,930
The teachers also came to ask me

530
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,690
whether you've had some psychological pressure.

531
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,500
I say, what kind of psychological pressure do you have?

532
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,860
Mr, I was just lazy and didn't review politics well.

533
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,660
I was probably too nervous.

534
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,930
I want to tell you

535
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,450
and remind you that,

536
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,980
now is the critical period in high school,

537
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,620
and never relax yourself.

538
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,450
Ok, you guys go back.

539
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,570
Come back.

540
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,020
Send these out.

541
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,980
Come on.

542
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,900
I don't believe that you don't care about the scores.

543
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,020
You've made so much progress this time.

544
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,980
Maybe you can get into the top ten in the class.

545
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,290
If that's the case,

546
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,570
I'd be grateful.

547
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,050
The exam results of this time have come out.

548
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,380
The No.1 is...

549
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,900
Xin Rui is the No.1.

550
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,330
Many students have got the wrong answer to this sentence pattern.

551
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,290
Next, I'm going to ask a student to talk about it.

552
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,690
Xin Rui.

553
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,210
Xin Rui.

554
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,290
Mrs.

555
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,660
Although you have won the first place in the exam, you should listen carefully.

556
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,620
I know, Mrs.

557
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,380
The treatment of the first place is different.

558
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,930
Even the teacher's attitude towards her has changed.

559
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,690
You've made a lot of progress this time,

560
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,570
especially in the English composition.

561
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,890
There are three full-mark compositions this time.

562
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,540
But I like your composition best.

563
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,290
Can you read it out?

564
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,050
Ok.

565
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,900
Very good, excellent.

566
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,330
Xin Rui's progress

567
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,050
confirms what I said before.

568
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,780
English is a subject that can be improved

569
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,780
as long as you are willing to work hard.

570
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,620
During this period of time, I think that every student here

571
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,620
has seen Xin Rui's efforts.

572
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,410
But I'm still very surprised.

573
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,570
Xin Rui's spoken language has also improved so much.

574
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,780
It can be seen that she has made

575
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,280
a lot of efforts behind her that we have not seen.

576
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,540
Okay, let's move on to sentence patterns.

577
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,620
What's the matter, Miss Ling?

578
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:07,860
Why are you lose your temper?

579
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,980
I'm not lose my temper.

580
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,330
I'm just in a bad mood.

581
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,690
You got second in the exam.

582
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,860
How do you know?

583
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,210
The school just finished the exam,

584
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,930
it must be because of the grade.

585
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,900
Bad mood must not be the first,

586
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,740
but you are not crying.

587
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,860
Who is crying?

588
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,410
That means no.

589
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,170
It's not so bad without crying.

590
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,860
Either second or third.

591
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,780
You know me pretty well.

592
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,660
Of course.

593
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
I also heard from the student union of your class

594
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,740
that Xin Rui is the first one this time.

595
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,020
Well, you know that,

596
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,290
and you pretend to analyze it.

597
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,660
But what I said makes sense.

598
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,410
But I don't like Xin Rui,

599
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,540
and I don't know what I think.

600
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,320
I think even if Yu Zhouzhou takes the first place,

601
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,450
I won't be so uncomfortable.

602
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,620
To Xin Rui, I can't say how it feels.

603
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,930
But I heard that she has improved a lot,

604
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,330
especially in English.

605
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,860
The English corner of the school radio station

606
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,690
also wants her to be a role model for progress.

607
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,090
Chu Tiankuo. Are you disgusting me on purpose?

608
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,980
I didn't arrange it.

609
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,740
The teacher in charge at the school said that

610
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,050
she could be a role model for other students.

611
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,930
But I think our Ling Xiangqian

612
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,540
will definitely not be afraid of her.

613
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,780
Where are you going?

614
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,570
Study.

615
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,930
Otherwise, I'm afraid I will lost to Xin Rui next time.

616
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,570
Yan Yi, if there is something you don't understand,

617
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,450
let me help you.

618
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,780
That's ok, Zhouzhou.

619
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,810
I 'll look for Xin Rui.

620
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,020
Is there a feeling that you are over party?

621
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,450
What over party?

622
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,860
The first one in the liberal arts class of Zhenhua Middle School.

623
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,930
My ancestor, when will you get it back?

624
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,980
I am in a hurry.

625
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,530
Piece of cake.

626
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,570
Zhouzhou.

627
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,690
Do you have your CD player?

628
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,450
What's the matter?

629
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,410
Jay-Chou!

630
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,140
How about it? Is it awesome? Is it awesome?

631
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,260
Hey! Show me!

632
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,380
Isn't it posted in a few days?

633
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,810
I bought the pre-sale in the first batch.

634
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,040
I just pretended to be sick

635
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,920
and took it back from the store.

636
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,140
Hey, stop and get the CD player quickly.

637
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,660
It is with Xin Rui.

638
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,450
Then you go and ask, how can I go?

639
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,020
Xin Rui, did you bring my CD player?

640
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,140
Give it to me.

641
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,780
Thank you.

642
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,570
Never mind.

643
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,410
No, isn't it a mouth?

644
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,770
I didn't see.

645
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,739
Zhouzhou, give you a headset.

646
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,060
Chen Yao, you will listen later.

647
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,610
-Why? 
 -Xin Rui.

648
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,780
-The disc is mine and the CD player is Zhouzhou's. 
 -I still don't know this question.

649
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,130
-You will listen later. 
 -Can you tell me more about it?

650
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,739
It's okay, you listen first,

651
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:23,980
I'll listen later.

652
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,340
Thanks!

653
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Yu Zhouzhou.

654
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,060
You solve it according to my answer first,

655
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,580
and then I'll get some water.

656
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,500
Ok, fine.

657
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,410
So you know that day I looked for you all day

658
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,130
and made all the calls I could make.

659
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,610
I know,

660
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,130
and I thank you very much.

661
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,130
I'm not asking you to thank me.

662
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,690
I'm worried about you.

663
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,020
I almost went to the police station to report the crime.

664
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,580
Are you so worried?

665
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,290
Are you worried about my safety,

666
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,450
or are you worried about my being with Chen An?

667
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,130
You know it.

668
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,410
I don't know it.

669
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,300
The former.

670
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,410
Can you be frank?

671
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,820
All right, I worried all about it.

672
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,980
Lin Yang. I have my own friends

673
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,340
and my own circle.

674
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,260
Chen An and Ben ben are both kind people.

675
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,580
You can't blaspheme their kindness,

676
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,650
just I don't let them

677
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,130
blaspheme your kindness.

678
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,650
How can you always take it for granted?

679
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,500
And speak so arrogantly.

680
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,130
I'm worried about you. Am I wrong?

681
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,610
How do yo turn it into

682
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,500
blasphemy against the kindness of others?

683
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,890
Yes, you Yu Zhouzhou has been popular since you were a child.

684
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,820
Everyone is around you.

685
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,410
You don't need my worry at all.

686
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,260
How can you still be as unreasonable as when you were a child?

687
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,820
Yes, no matter how popular I am,

688
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,300
I can't match you, Mr Lin.

689
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,340
The girls who chasing you all ran to the cinema.

690
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,690
How can you say that?

691
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,540
That was all a misunderstanding.

692
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,020
Sweet misunderstanding.

693
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,260
Zhouzhou, can we two

694
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,170
talk peacefully?

695
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,610
Less force and...

696
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:18,850
And what?

697
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,740
And insincerity.

698
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,930
I'm not insincere?

699
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,500
Yes.

700
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,440
You haven't told the truth

701
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,850
since we first met.

702
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,300
So are you going to start from an early age?

703
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,260
Yes.

704
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,650
You lied to me the first time we met.

705
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,980
From child to adult.

706
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,930
Do you remember when we graduated from primary school?

707
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,640
How hard did I want to make you to

708
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,540
write a classmate record for me?

709
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,540
But you sent me away with four words.

710
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,980
You also told me that we could go to the same junior high school.

711
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:48,890
Do you know the day when school starts,

712
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,300
I searched for your name all day,

713
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,060
do you know?

714
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,410
It turns out that you are so dissatisfied with me.

715
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,370
I...I'm not.

716
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,300
Those four words at that time

717
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,850
were the best blessing my grandmother told me.

718
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,640
I haven't written to anyone.

719
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,500
And what happened when we were in junior high school,

720
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
I also explained it,

721
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,020
I didn't mean to.

722
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,890
I didn't mean that.

723
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,690
Let's go to class.

724
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,610
Hey, Xin Rui, I've been looking for you.

725
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,820
-Hey, Chu Tiankuo. 
 -You are looking for me?

726
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:38,930
The class is begin.

727
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,770
Mr Wu. I'll have a quick chat with Xin Rui

728
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,740
about the student union.

729
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,690
Oh, please hurry.

730
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,260
Ok.

731
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,060
I'd like to invite you to be the anchor of the voice of the English program

732
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,610
in the school radio station tomorrow, is that okay?

733
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,930
Can I?

734
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,060
No problem.

735
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,300
Several classmates have recommended you.

736
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,100
Find yourself an article about reading

737
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,260
and just read it aloud.

738
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,100
All right.

739
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,130
Ah, yes.

740
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,540
Can I choose this background music by myself?

741
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,060
Yes, you can.

742
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:05,690
Thank you.

743
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,340
It should be me. Thank you.

744
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,370
Then I'll go in first.

745
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:09,780
Ok.

746
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,890
Xin Rui, your disc.

747
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,210
Oh.

748
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,250
I can't do everything as I wish,

749
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,170
how can I do everything I want comes true.

750
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,780
Please play the last song for me later, thank you.

751
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:50,850
Ok.

752
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,930
Are you ready for the English article to be read in a while?

753
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,410
Yu, let me listen to the CD.

754
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,060
Welcome to today's English broadcasting room.

755
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,060
-Thanks. 
 -It's okay.

756
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,540

757
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,170

The furthest distance in the world.

00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,370
