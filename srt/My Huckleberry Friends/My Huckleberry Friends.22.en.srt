Zhouzhou. This is for you.

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,020
Thanks.

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,570
I have been giving my own concert the whole night.

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,570
Can't you let me moisten my throat?

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,340
Come on!

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,730
You ruined my idol's song like that

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,090
and how dare you want some water! Get away!

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,180
You can't do that to me!

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,540
When you two were there listening to my song just now,

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,700
not only you were waving and screaming,

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,330
but also your tears and snot came down.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,500
Oh come on!

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,450
There is no way that listening to a fake Eason Chan can touch me.

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,130
Don't flatter yourself.

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,890
I am telling you. Mi Qiao.

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,290
Don't come to me ever again

24
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,460
if you run away from home next time.

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,060
What are you two doing?

26
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:11,570
Teasing the monkey in zoo?

27
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:14,060
I'd rather tease the dog.

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,170
Zhouzhou. Please use your magic

29
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,210
to turn her into a puppy.

30
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:26,890
Master.

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,460
My magic can no longer work.

32
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,890
Zhouzhou. You are being too modest.

33
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,380
You were such a tough girl before.

34
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,930
You were able to not only turn my dad into a turtle,

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,020
but also summon wind and call for rain.

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,420
Come on. Produce a rainbow for us.

37
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,210
Do you think that I am that stupid like you?

38
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,800
You don't remember it. It's...

39
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:44,780
It's this way.

40
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:47,890
Yes.

41
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,210
Turn into a turtle.

42
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,930
A giant tortoise.

43
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,890
I just remembered

44
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,780
that I lost something in the classroom.

45
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,100

46

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,530
Zhouzhou.

48
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,090
Bye.

49
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,330
Bye.

50
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:22,890
Hold on.

51
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,700
Take hold of me!

52
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,090
No. That's ok.

53
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,420
Take hold of me

54
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,300
or you would fall down.

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,090
It'll be ok.

56
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,730
Stop...

57
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,520
What's wrong?

58
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,940
Stop now or I'd jump off.

59
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,010
What... Hey, what's wrong with you again?

60
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,170
That...

61
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,650
Please go away.

62
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,940
I'd go home alone.

63
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,160
Mi Qiao.

64
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,890
I'm driving only 20 miles per hour.

65
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,700

68
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,220
No problem.

69
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,860
Director Pan simply has nothing else to do.

70
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,090
In such an early morning, anything should be better

71
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,220
than running laps.

72
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,370
We have to get up at six o'clock and come to school.

73
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,090
With no surprise, we'd fall asleep in the first class.

74
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,300
It's always like that he came up with some new idea

75
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,980
which lasted only a few days and then ended up in vain.

76
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,610
This time, I think

77
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,290
one week should be enough.

78
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,010
I think this time could be different.

79
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,610
It appears that Director Pan has been making strict check-up lately.

80
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,000
It seemed that someone sent him a letter of complaint

81
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,700
in which our grade was blamed for bad behavior trend

82
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,860
about unusual relationship between some certain boy and girl.

83
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,580
Who?

84
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,579
They are no one else but...

85
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,450
Zhouzhou. I bought you breakfast.

86
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,459
Be careful and do be careful.

87
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,420
Come and take some pancakes.

88
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,740
I don't want to eat.

89
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,530
You get up so early that you must have  taken little food,

90
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,700
not to mention that we need to run soon after.

91
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,090
I really don't want to eat.

92
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,580
My aunt made me eat several steamed buns this morning.

93
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,980
Well then, drink some bean milk. Here you are.

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,330

95
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,330
I haven't even had my breakfast yet.

Lin Yang.

97
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,860
I have been watching you the whole morning.

98
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,490
How dare you go to buy pancakes just after one lap

99
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,090
and disregard the school's rules and disciplines!

100
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,740
Do you have any respect for me?

101
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,620
Director Pan. It's me who ate all of them.

102
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,900
Yu Zhouzhou ate nothing.

103
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,250
Director Pan. We are wrong.

104
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,300
Good.

105
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,900
Zhouzhou. Continue to run with the team.

106
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,810
And you! Go to run backwards 10 laps!

107
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,620
Got it.

108
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,460
Come in.

109
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,300
Director Pan. Our class's coursework have been well collected.

110
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,420
Leave it here.

111
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,370
Well.

112
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,420
Some student sent me a letter recently

113
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,740
in which some issue was reported.

114
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,860
It's said that some senior two students are having intimate relationship

115
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,740
and they've been talking about something in campus,

116
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,760
which has nothing to do with study.

117
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,420
Is that true?

118
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,620
Has this person mentioned who he is?

119
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,770
That's not your business.

120
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,250
A mere verbal statement is no guarantee and I need to see for sure.

121
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,210
Well, please help me to ask around

122
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,180
and let me know right away in case of any news.

123
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,580
Yes. Director Pan.

124
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,930
Some leaders will come to visit in a few days.

125
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,980
The Zhen Hua School's climate of learning

126
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,700
has been praised for consecutive years.

127
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,490
It has to be maintained,

128
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,180
particularly for those honors classes where you're from.

129
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,200
It is unacceptable to screw it up. You got it?

130
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,930
Too much homework and there's no way to finish.

131
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,050
Supplement some protein.

132
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,050
You must be tired and seem have lost some weight in just a morning time.

133
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,620
I don't want it and you take it.

134
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,810
Have some more.

135
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:05,980
Pan...

136
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,250
I've had enough of you two.

137
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,050
You've got be kidding for just a piece of egg.

138
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,810
Isn't it gross?

139
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,770
Isn't it gross?

140
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,700
We'd take it if you two don't.

141
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,300
Exactly!

142
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,090
Dear guys...

143
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,180
It's for Zhouzhou.

144
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:20,530
Zhouzhou.

145
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,490
Let's hang out in my home after school this Friday.

146
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,420
My parents will be outside then for some trip organized by their company

147
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,210
and they won't be back until Sunday.

148
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,460
I won't go, for the final exam is coming.

149
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,370
I didn't even read the book.

150
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,650
In this case, let's come to my home and review the lessons first

151
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,570
and hang out after.

152
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,460
Sounds good. Go to do it!

153
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,050
We are so bored staying at home.

154
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,700
You're right!

155
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,180
Well. Mi Qiao should go too.

156
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,490
No problem.

157
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,700
Well. Didn't you say

158
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,140
that the newly bought projector in your home is quite fancy?

159
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:40,770
I want to see it.

160
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,490
Yes.

161
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:42,980
You want to watch The Grudge, right?

162
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,810
We can do it together with you.

163
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,300
Right.

164
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,860
The Grudge?

165
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,460
Any problem?

166
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,620
I'm good but I just think...

167
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,050
Yu Fei will come back this Friday

168
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,620
and we need to visit my grandma.

169
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,370
So I can't go.

170
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,740
Fine.

171
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,620
Why are you staring at me? Take your food!

172
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,740
I am... full.

173
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:07,980
Wait.

174
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,460
How come you are full with so much food left over?

175
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,730
It's a waste and every single grain is the fruit of hard work.

176
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,930
Go on.

177
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,740
What's going on? Are you waiting for someone?

178
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,740
Nothing. I'm just looking around.

179
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,770
We can almost conclude that it's located in the Southern Hemisphere.

180
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,490
The linear velocity at the equator is 1670 kilometers per hour

181
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,180
and it is 1447 kilometers per hours at 30 degrees.

182
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,700
The value from the figure is just between the two of them.

183
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,770
So it's most likely at low latitude of the Southern Hemisphere.

184
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,930
As a science student,

185
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,330
how come you master the geography so well?

186
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,370
It's probably the matter of gift.

187
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,810
There's an easier way to do with this question.

188
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,900
That's impossible!

189
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,460
According to Mr Zhang Feng,

190
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,040
there's only one solution for this question

191
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,650
and that is exactly what I'm doing.

192
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,930
Yu Zhouzhou. It's no need for you

193
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,090
to try to get your confidence back through math just because you've failed geography.

194
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,300
Instead of vanity, ability is the key for math.

195
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,930
Check. Is it correct?

196
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,700
That's correct.

197
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,770
Call me grandmaster.

198
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,040
Grandmaster Zhouzhou.

199
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,090
Grandmaster. As a student of arts,

200
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,179
how can you manage to gain

201
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,260
such an amazing expertise in math?

202
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,530
It could be anything but gift.

203
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,940
Well, for this question,

204
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,450
I've always got mixed up with the two places.

205
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,380
Could you explain it for me?

206
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,559
Let me have a look first.

207
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,740
I also need to see it.

208
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,770
What's wrong with you today?

209
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,210
Nothing.

210
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,620
You've been weird these days.

211
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,570
You don't even go home with me anymore.

212
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,570
There you are.

213
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,130
Director Pan.

214
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,860
You're studying, right?

215
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,260
I have difficulty in some questions

216
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,060
and I want Chu Tiankuo to help me.

217
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,490
Do you see Lin Yang and Yu Zhouzhou?

218
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,570
They're behind the shelf over there.

219
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,380
For the rumored letter of complaint in the school,

220
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,210
is it about us?

221
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,090
It's less likely for there's nothing going on between us.

222
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,380
Call me master and I'll explain it to you.

223
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,730
I'd rather figure it out by myself.

224
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,610
Forget it.

225
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,420
Actually, you don't have to call me master.

226
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,180
Director Pan.

227
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,860
Director Pan.

228
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,420
What are you two doing?

229
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:57,890
We are going over the lessons.

230
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,410
Going over together.

231
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,490
Get down to study and work hard.

232
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,500
Sure.

233
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,330
Yu. I have a question for you.

234
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,570
It's not for me. It is for one of my friends from outside the school.

235
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,890
This friend

236
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,060
is in good health usually and never get sick.

237
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,130
Except one time,

238
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,770
she was having a ride with someone

239
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,820
and it's a kind of ride that two persons sat really closely.

240
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,060
Then her heart started to beat fast,

241
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,620
though it's nothing like heart disease.

242
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,530
It seemed a bit...

243
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,740
A bit of blush and rapid heartbeats, right?

244
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,940
It seemed that something might have happened.

245
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,570
Mi Qiao. You really don't know the reason?

246
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,210
I don't.

247
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,760
Yu.

248
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,570
You really look pretty.

249
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,520
Stop it.

250
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,650
You are so pretty and nice.

251
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,860
Even I can't stop being attracted by you.

252
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,130
Sounds like that no one likes you.

253
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,820
No one indeed.

254
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,060
Wait.

255
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,090
Eason Chan, Iverson

256
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,690
and Nephrite, they all like me.

257
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,180
There's still another one.

258
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,380
Who?

259
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,940
Look, Yu. It's sun rain.

260
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:24,620
Look.

261
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,130
Isn't there nothing going on between us?

262
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,770
You don't have to wait with me for the bus.

263
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,130
Qianqian. Don't be mad at me and I didn't mean that.

264
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,740
I'm not mad at you. I'm just...

265
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,530
just wondering how you see me exactly.

266
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,770
Is that the same way as you see other girls

267
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,120
or a little bit differently for me?

268
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,010
Probably a little bit differently.

269
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,210
Just a little bit?

270
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,820
You are a little bit different in every way.

271
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,890
Putting numerous a little bit differences together

272
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,000
would be what you look like in my heart.

273
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,300
Let me send you back home.

274
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,130
Lin Yang.

275
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,260
I got to go.

276
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,060
Bye.

277
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,210
Mi Qiao.

278
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:21,860
You are late.

279
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,450
Zhouzhou already left with Lin Yang.

280
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,890
Did she get wet in the rain?

281
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,130
No. She brought an umbrella.

282
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,380
Why didn't you?

283
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,940
No need for such a light rain.

284
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,060
Sometimes I feel that you are not really like a girl.

285
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,740
Truly I am not. So what?

286
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,500
Don't move.

287
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,210
What are you doing?

288
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,690
What's the matter again?

289
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,330
What happened? You don't feel comfortable again?

290
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,060
No.

291
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,260
Um, Zhouzhou has left already

292
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,330
and you don't have to follow me anymore.

293
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,380
What's wrong with you lately?

294
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,500
Sometimes you were going well and sometimes you weren't.

295
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,010
I don't know.

296
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,620
Let's go to my place and take some BBQ.

297
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,500
I don't feel like it.

298
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,500
Or I teach you to play pool.

299
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,530
I'm not interested.

300
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,770
Fine, tell me what you want to do

301
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,180
and I will follow you anyway today.

302
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,930
How about

303
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,690
making an expedition?

304
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,770
Where?

305
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,260
I won't do anything illegal.

306
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,530
When I was a child, my dad told me

307
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,820
that there are treasures hidden at the end of rainbow.

308
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,330
It's just a trick that you dad played on a child like you.

309
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,330
Tell me.

310
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,210
Can a rainbow get down to the earth?

311
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,420
How can it have an end?

312
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,620
It's true. I've seen it with my own eyes.

313
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,450
So did you dig up the treasure?

314
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,730
I was just coming back to my senses

315
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,210
when the rainbow disappeared.

316
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,690
You really think I'm stupid?

317
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,940
If you do not believe, I'll go back to find photos to show you.

318
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,260
Okay, then do not take fake photos to fool me.

319
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,210
Once I give Huang Mao the photo, I'll know the truth.

320
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,860
You just don't believe me, do you?

321
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,300
No, this kind of science-based thing

322
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,380
can not be debated.

323
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,300
No education, no common sense.

324
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,330
I tell you, when the time comes, don't beg me to take you to dig for gold.

325
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,260
I won't share the gold with you even if I dig it up.

326
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,770
Who do you think is uneducated?

327
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,980
You are the uneducated one.

328
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,770
I'm talking about you, get lost!

329
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,860
A person who failed geology

330
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,180
is not qualified to brag.

331
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,610
Take out your exam paper, please.

332
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,260
The difficulty of the paper this time

333
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,090
still has some way to go before the college entrance examination.

334
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,740
Evaluate yourself

335
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,860

336
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,540
[Zhenhua High School, Second semester of sophomore year, Math Test (Liberal Arts) , 109]

337
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,130
What's worthy of praise is that

338
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,890
Ling Xiangqian and Yu Zhouzhou

339
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,860
have the highest score in our class.

340
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,130
They all got 145 points.

341
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,690
After class,

342
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,000
go and check their papers.

343
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,320
Learn more about their problem-solving ideas.

344
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,450
Some students

345
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,050
may have some great progress in other subjects.

346
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,740
But they will lose many points

347
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,740
in math.

348
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,690
This will be very disadvantageous in the college entrance examination.

349
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,530
Mathematics is not a subject for quick success.

350
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,500
We have to be more practical.

351
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,820
Improve yourselves day by day with diligence.

352
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,300
OK, that will be all for today.

353
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,820
For the rest of your class, study by yourselves.

354
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,450
That's OK if Benben doesn't believe me.

355
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,620
But that's not OK if you don't believe me.

356
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,770
That's impossible!

357
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,890
I'm telling you, Yu Zhouzhou, what will happen if I find it?

358
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,260
Nothing will happen.

359
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,500
If I find it, you will buy me kebabs.

360
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,690
OK, that's on me. Deal.

361
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,420
Wait for it.

362
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:09,970
Waiting.

363
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,180
That's impossible.

364
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,740
That's impossible.

365
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,010
Still denying it.

366
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,860
Come to my office during lunch break.

367
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
I've just found it.

368
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,690
I should have torn out that page.

369
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,300
I believe in you.

370
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,380
I believe in you.

371
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,690
Zhouzhou, just come with me.

372
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,860
Stealing books from Director Pan's office?

373
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,450
You are being more and more outrageous.

374
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,060
I'll tear out the most important page.

375
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,180
Director Pan will never find out.

376
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:49,690
I promise.

377
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,180
You can always buy another book.

378
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,380
I can't.

379
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,620
That book was published several years ago.

380
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,530
I have been looking for it for a long time.

381
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,130
When did you become so interested in geography?

382
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,060
I'm not interested.

383
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,300
I just want to fight about it.

384
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,420
Another bet with Ben Ben?

385
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,680
How do you know?

386
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:05,890
By the way, Zhouzhou.

387
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,290
You are on my side, right?

388
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,569
Xin Rui

389
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,020
Are you heading to the teacher's office?

390
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,540
Give the paper to Mr. Zhang for me by the way.

391
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,020
Thanks.

392
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,170
You didn't write your name.

393
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,140
You can write it for me.

394
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,870
[Lin Yang]

395
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,690
Zhouzhou, watch out for me.

396
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,800
I'll be back in three minutes.

397
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,170
OK.

398
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,290
If I get caught,

399
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,770
just abandon me and leave.

400
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,620
You've got more important tasks to accomplish.

401
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,620
Be quick!

402
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,620
In case Director Pan comes!

403
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:47,780
Go for it!

404
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,170
Go for it!

405
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,530
Guess who I am.

406
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,210
Lin Yang, stop it!

407
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,380
I'm doing business here.

408
00:17:59,400 --> 00:17:59,930
What business?

409
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,090
Look out for Mi Qiao.

410
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,620
What is Mi Qiao doing in there?

411
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,290
Stealing books.

412
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,260
What book?

413
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,050
Mr. Zhang.

414
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:07,690
Mr. Zhang.

415
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,740
What are you two doing sneaking around here?

416
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,210
I am accompanying Yu Zhouzhou to ask questions.

417
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,620
She's a liberal art student.

418
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,410
Do you come here with her to ask chemistry questions?

419
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,410
Nope.

420
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,050
Lin Yang,

421
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,660
you are not understanding the situation, right?

422
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,540
You two still have the courage to do this.

423
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,290
What is it?

424
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,980
OK, go back to your class.

425
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,860
Mr. Zhang, you can't go in now.

426
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,450
What's wrong?

427
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,290
Because

428
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,450
Mr. Wu is in there.

429
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,020
Yes.

430
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,490
Exactly, I need to talk to him.

431
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,210
Mr. Wu and Director Pan

432
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,140
are talking about something very important.

433
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,290
Then I'll wait here for them for a while.

434
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:51,800
Mr. Zhang,

435
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,810
about the math question that you talked about last time,

436
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,020
I think the steps are too complicated.

437
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,810
I have a quick solution.

438
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,500
Let's see the results.

439
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,090
What's wrong with you?

440
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,810
I don't really like to discuss about math questions with top students.

441
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,900
By the way, Yu Zhouzhou.

442
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:02,980
Come with me.

443
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,210
Take back the homework of your class!

444
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,620
I will also ask Mr. Zhang about Lin Yang's situation.

445
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,540
It seems that they were classmates since childhood.

446
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,380
So they are closer than other students.

447
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,900
You don't always have to be so nervous.

448
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,490
It clearly writes two students' names

449
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,410
in this report letter.

450
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,170
This seriously affects the learning culture of the school.

451
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,930
I don't think it's a fabrication.

452
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,620
I think,

453
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,450
the problem is not about those two kids.

454
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,570
But about the report letter.

455
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,620
I've always been teaching these students

456
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,330
to be honest and open.

457
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,690
If students have complaints,

458
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,170
why not bring those up on the table?

459
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,260
They can also talk to the teachers.

460
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,810
Why do they have to write an anonymous report letter?

461
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,020
How boring is that?

462
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,540
I have to look at the bigger picture.

463
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,210
I can't let a fish foul a pot of soup.

464
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,380
You have to cooperate with me on this.

465
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,560
No, I can't.

466
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,090
This is not the bigger picture.

467
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,530
I have to take care of my students.

468
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,930
I can't let them

469
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,610
be treated unjustly.

470
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,330
I have to talk with him.

471
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,740
At least make a promise to me.

472
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,930
Can't take it too far.

473
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,330
These two are top students.

474
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,380
You have to take care of them.

475
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,540
Can't let them choose the wrong way.

476
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,780
Wrong, how wrong will it be?

477
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,260
There aren't many wrong ways, idiot.

478
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,810
What's the matter with you?

479
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,330
Nothing.

480
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,620
The water is too hot.

481
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:40,740
Well,

482
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,570
I'm telling you, believing me is a safe bet.

483
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,330
Can't be wrong.

484
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,980
Something is wrong.

485
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,930
I have to find Mr. Zhang to talk about it.

486
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,050
Go ahead then.

487
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,620
Come out.

488
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,290
What are you doing?

489
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,140
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu.

490
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,490
Sorry for what?

491
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,210
What are you doing here?

492
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,410
Director Pan confiscated my magazine.

493
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,980
I want to tear one page out.

494
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,570
How dare you!

495
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,090
I'm scared to death, go to class now!

496
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,170
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu. Thank you.

497
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,380
Class dismissed!

498
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,040
Stand up.

499
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,330
Goodbye, teacher.

500
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,260
Master,

501
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,020
I'm looking out for you.

502
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,140
Who knows that I was called by Mr. Zhang to get the homework.

503
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:40,930
Master,

504
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,980
I think a ninja like you

505
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,450
will surely get out.

506
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,690
I didn't expect to meet Director Pan and Mr. Wu.

507
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,370
I deserve a thousand death penalties.

508
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,860
I'm doing this for you.

509
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,860
If I hadn't gone to read that report letter,

510
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,290
how would I have been blocked in the room.

511
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,210
The report letter has nothing to do with me.

512
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,500
I've seen the letter.

513
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,170
Someone report the relationship between you and Lin Yang.

514
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,380
Get prepared.

515
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,290
Zhou Zhou, Mi Qiao

516
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,660
Lin Yang got caught.

517
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,210
He was called to the office by Director Pan.

518
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,260
It's over.

519
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,330
It must be about the report letter.

520
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,320
I'll go to Director Pan to straighten things out.

521
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,570
Stop, on this point,

522
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,810
don't get in the way.

523
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,290
That's right.

524
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,570
Lin Yang asked me to pass on three words to you:

525
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,160
honesty and dependability.

526
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,090
He said that

527
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,290
things will be straightened out by me.

528
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,930
That's my man.

529
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,090
Reckless!

530
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,410
Don't hand yourself over, good lord!

531
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,020
That's right, wait for him to come back to get the story straight.

532
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,900
It's never too late to go in then.

533
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,410
What a mess!

534
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:39,740
Lin Yang,

535
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,740
one question, one answer.

536
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,570
When did you and Yu Zhouzhou meet?

537
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,020
We've known each other since we were kids.

538
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,280
Not only did I know her,

539
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,860
but also my parents.

540
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:49,620
She's more than an acquaintance.

541
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,330
She used to play at my house when I was a kid.

542
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,330
And at that time...

543
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,930
One question, one answer.

544
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,290
Don't answer questions that I never ask.

545
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,260
Have you ever

546
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,660
crossed over the boundaries of being classmates?

547
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,410
Like physical contacts.

548
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,780
Yes.

549
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,620
You see.

550
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,810
We have held hands.

551
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:12,930
When?

552
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:13,810
First semester of senior year.

553
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,020
Who gave you so much courage?

554
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,740
You.

555
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,290
Didn't you ask us to take portraits for the school

556
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,500
and put them on the school website?

557
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,020
I said I wouldn't like to do that, but the photographer beg to differ.

558
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,260
You also said we were both too shy and we almost got replaced.

559
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,810
How dare you blaming it all on me?

560
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
It was you.

561
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,740
When Yu Zhouzhou didn't want to take portraits,

562
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,900
it was you who encouraged her that

563
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,540
taking such a set of portraits

564
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,040
is simply a fulfilled dream

565
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,740
for every Zhenhua student.

566
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,050
Not that time.

567
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,050
Then that would be all.

568
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,380
Then I ask you one more question,

569
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,980
do you two talk on the phone a lot?

570
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,690
Will you buy it if I say

571
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,260
I haven't even gotten her phone number?

572
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,140
I won't buy it.

573
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,290
These are my contacts on the phone.

574
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,500
If you don't believe it, just find it out by yourself.

575
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,410
Did you delete it a long time ago?

576
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,090
You caught me off guard in the classroom.

577
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,140
Every move of mine is under your watch.

578
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,050
I don't really have the time.

579
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,380
That's true.

580
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,540
Those questions are just chasing shadows.

581
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,080
How about I ask you a question.

582
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,900
Who wrote the report letter?

583
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,500
You are the interrogator or I am?

584
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,500
I've answered everything that you just asked.

585
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,320
I'm not denying that I'm close with Yu Zhouzhou.

586
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,050
She's one of the top three students in liberal art class.

587
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,400
When I was getting scolded,

588
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,020
it's you who told me that good companions have good influence.

589
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,410
Always study and cooperate with

590
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,250
top students.

591
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,890
You mean I'm a total culprit?

592
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,740
It is I who let you guys cross over the boundaries?

593
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,290
Just think about it,

594
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,780
before you said those things,

595
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,170
what's the relationship between me and Yu Zhouzhou?

596
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,140
Not that close.

597
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
We are not even that close,

598
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,450
we are total strangers!

599
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,410
Lin Yang,

600
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,930
I have no solid evidence now.

601
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,930
But I hope that

602
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,170
you pay attention to the relationship between you and your classmates.

603
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,740
Especially between boys and girls.

604
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,920
You have to set boundaries.

605
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,010
Go back and write a guarantee.

606
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,770
Make it more profound and sincere. 5000 words.

607
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:18,690
I'll write 10000 words.

608
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,620
I'll write Yu Zhouzhou's guarantee, too.

609
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,210
Just leave her alone

610
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,540
Bye, Mr. Pan

611
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,890
Damn it!

612
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,260
Who on earth is so shamless

613
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,020
snitching on others?

614
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,730
I wish him lonely for the rest of his life

615
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,290
Don't say such words!

616
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,090
No way!

617
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,020
He just dares not to take the responsibility, doesn't he?

618
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,090
He is the one who I am scolding

619
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,090
Ok. There, there

620
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,780
No! I must find out who he is

621
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:43,810
Zhouzhou

622
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,260
Did Mr. Pan do anything to you?

623
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,690
He was trying to call me to account

624
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
But I perfectly solved the problems

625
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,050
Don't wait me up after school from now on

626
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,260
I think it is not good that

627
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,170
lately we are seeing each other so frequently

628
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,540
What did we do?

629
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,210
We did not ever affect others, nor did we affect our study

630
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,410
Why do we have to be so discreet?

631
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,980
Just stop following me

632
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,980
We are going to go find Benben today

633
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,740
I'll leave first

634
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,660
I'm coming, too!

635
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,450
Please don't!

636
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,410
And also don't buy me breakfast tomorrow morning

637
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,450
My big aunt is starting to blame me for eating less at home

638
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,620
I'm going

639
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:14,810
Oh, no

640
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,050
You and Lin Yang are completely seperated now

641
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,690
Lin Yang?

642
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,290
Zhouzhou, what happened to you and Lin Yang?

643
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,210
Because someone got in the way

644
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,810
Some boring people wrote a report letter

645
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,020
saying that Zhouzhou and Lin Yang are too close

646
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,900
which is interfering with everybody's study

647
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,660
Who was it?

648
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,450
How dare he pick on Zhouzhou? Does he want to die?

649
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:36,500
Yellow Hair!

650
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,260
Find a school uniform of Zhen Hua tomorrow

651
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:38,680
Ok

652
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,620
Find out who on earth this person is

653
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,540
Benben, it's nothing

654
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,690
And also Lin Yang

655
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,780
He promised me

656
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,730
If I had known it,

657
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,330
I should have been the one who protect you

658
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,780
You don't have to protect me for this kind of things

659
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,290
Did you tear off that page out of the magazine?

660
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:54,690
No

661
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,660
If it wasn't because of the report letter,

662
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,620
I would have brought it

663
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,920
What is on that page that is so improtant?

664
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,170
It's just some nonesense

665
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,900
Treasure is hidden at the end of the rainbow

666
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,020
Mu Rong Chenzhang, I won't let you off the hook so easily

667
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,400
Don't cry like a baby when I find evidence

668
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,380
Zhouzhou, you tell me

669
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,920
What's at the end of the rainbow?

670
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,740
The end of the rainbow?

671
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:20,690
The rainbow is formed by the refraction of light

672
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,380
I think light has no end

673
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,810
What could be at the end of the rainbow?

674
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,330
You heard that, Master Qiao?

675
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,170
I suggest you learn more from Zhouzhou

676
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,690
and stop all that imagination

677
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,210
Why won't you guys believe me?

678
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,410
I really saw it with my own eyes

679
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:35,900
We believe you!

680
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,570
Zhouzhou and I do believe in you

681
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,050
I don't feel like eating. I'm leaving

682
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,860
Wait. What's wrong?

683
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:44,740
What happened?

684
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,020
Are you stupid?

685
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,050
What did I say wrong?

686
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,020
You

687
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,020
I am leaving if you still don't ask me

688
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,540
Why on earth did Mi Qiao get angry?

689
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,260
The same thing happened last time

690
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,050
After you left, I offered to send her home

691
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,410
But she wanted to get off the minute she got on the car

692
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,690
saying she wanted to go home by herself

693
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,140
I asked her what happened but she just wouldn't speak

694
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,410
and ran away all of a sudden

695
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,690
What happened to her exactly?

696
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,090
I need to know what I have done to make her angry so that I can apologize

697
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,330
You seriously have no clue at all?

698
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,380
Seriously!

699
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,210
Last time when we went out, she was alright

700
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,570
But when we came back, she just turned into a diffirent person

701
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,930
Why are you girls all so emotional?

702
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,540
Benben, why do you care about Mi Qiao so much?

703
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,020
It's not that. I just don't want her to be angry

704
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,050
Got it

705
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,650
But everytime she gets angry, I feel suffocated

706
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,050
Something just doesn't feel right

707
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,330
Mi Qiao is a great girl

708
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,040
I know

709
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,930
If Mi Qiao likes something,

710
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,090
she would never stop liking it

711
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,170
Me, too!

712
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,780
So can I trust you with her?

713
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,330
Of course!

714
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,160
The rest is on your own

715
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,170
Zhouzhou

716
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
Could you please

717
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,050
tell me the way

718
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,050
to creat a rainbow without raining?

719
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,540
Without raining?

720
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:13,620
Zhouzhou

721
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,610
Mi Qiao

722
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,020
Got it

723
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,330
This is a special period. Sit still

724
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,210
I'll check for you

725
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,260
Why are you going?

726
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,170
Lin Yang, what is wrong with you?

727
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,810
Why are you yelling Zhouzhou's name all around?

728
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,860
Did the guarantee you wrote last time teach you nothing?

729
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,250
I'm just giving the math paper to Zhouzhou

730
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,210
These are all the simple algorithms

731
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,860
Mr.Zhang and I carefully discussed

732
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,740
They are much simpler than the ones Zhouzhou taught me last time

733
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,660
Good for you, Lin Yang. You do have such high IQ

734
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,490
and such low EQ

735
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,660
Why are you still struggling with simple simple algorithms

736
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,900
at this period of time?

737
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,050
You just had to drag Zhouzhou into the mire

738
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,280
Lin Yang, are you out of your mind?

739
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,410
What?

740
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,210
Did you write the report letter yourself?

741
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,140
Am I out of my mind?

742
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,290
The writings of Lin Yang on the report letter

743
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,970
are just the same as the ones on this

744
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,020
You didn't write down your name

745
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,860
Do it for me, please

746
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,130
Are you sure?

747
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,540
I'm pretty sure

748
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,570
I could still recognize them if they splitted into strokes

749
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,660
I'll go first

750
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:33,500
Ok

751
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,210
Goodbye

752
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:34,690
Goodbye

753
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,070
[Zhouzhou: Study hard and let's both show up on the ranking board of our grade!]

754
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,170
Lin Yang

755
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,290
Thank you for lending me this

756
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,140
It's ok. It's all yours

757
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,930
If you have nothing to say, I'll leave now

758
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:12,980
Lin Yang

759
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,660
Why didn't you

760
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,860
go to the cram school at last?

761
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,540
I went to the library to do the review with Zhouzhou

762
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,540
so I had no time

763
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,320
Right!

764
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,810
I know that you were the one who wrote the report letter

765
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,020
I will not tell Zhouzhou about this

766
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,090
But I hope it was the last time

767
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,500
Mi Qiao

768
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,740
Do you want roasted wings tonight?

769
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,020
No. Too spicy

770
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,980
How about ice-cream cones?

771
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,570
No. Too sweet

772
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,090
How about going to the end of the rainbow?

773
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,900
Aren't you the one who doesn't believe me?

774
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,930
Who said that?

775
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,330
Don't you only believe in Zhouzhou?

776
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,410
I don't study and I am all gluttonous and lazy

777
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,410
Why would you believe me?

778
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:11,920
I am done talking to you

779
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,210
I'm going home to eat all the yummy things my dad prepared for me

780
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,090
You wanted to find the end of the rainbow

781
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,080
I have already found it for you

782
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,260
You are the end of the rainbow

783
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,410
Stop doing that! Stop it!

784
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,930
Can't we just talk it out?

785
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,090
I am!

786
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,660
Then just don't!

787
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,500
Let me calm myself down

788
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:58,900
Are you all right?

789
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:02,540
Benben

790
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,980
I seem to be sick again
