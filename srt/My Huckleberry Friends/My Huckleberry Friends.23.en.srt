00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,520
Connect the two points of C and D

171
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,140
Look at the blackboard

172
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,810
Come on!

173
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,530
[What are you doing?]

174
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,420
[Xu Zhiqiang, Xu Zhiqiang, look at me]

175
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,900
Look, look here, look here

176
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,090
Vic Zhou

177
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,260
That's good

178
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:44,930
What are you doing?

179
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,380
[Go for it, Yu!]

180
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,210
Go for it

181
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,380
[You're so silly]

182
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,260
I'll help you, Fei

183
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,090
Three, two, one

184
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,130
Dominating the barbecue industry in Shanhai City

185
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,420
You

186
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,650
You're responsible for changing the board content in these two weeks, right?

187
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,130
It's been two weeks

188
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,210
and you haven't changed it for once

189
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,860
The school gives you the task

190
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,080
as a recognition and trust

191
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,690
Okay. We'll change it, alright?

192
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,500
It's okay you shoot this. But don't show it to others

193
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,890
[It's done]

194
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,740
[If there's nothing else, we'll leave now]

195
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,740
You are such a bully, aren't you?

196
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,420
I thought you would only bully us ordinary people

197
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,890
I didn’t expect you to be so conscientious on your work

198
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,250
The President of the Student Union is just a position

199
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,820
You have to do everything, and it's a thankless task

200
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,980
Then why are you still doing it?

201
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,090
It seems to me that you are quite interested in it

202
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,010
Are you going to interview me?

203
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,620
Interview?

204
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,450
I found that in the past few days

205
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,820
you always use this thing to shoot

206
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,860
What are you shooting?

207
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,200
Nothing

208
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,690
I just think that

209
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,180
it's interesting

210
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,090
to see how everyone looks in the camera

211
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,180
Can I see it?

212
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,060
You want to see it?

213
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,860
If you want to see the replay, you have to push up first and then

214
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,620
You're not an amateur

215
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,010
I know a little about it

216
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,940
Hey, are you okay?

217
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,570
Are you still our President Chu?

218
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,420
It's interesting

219
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,450
Is this your DV?

220
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,450
It's Benben's

221
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,730
He is the guy

222
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,690
who would set a barbecue stall in front of the school

223
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,060
He bought it in a second-hand store, and I just use it for fun

224
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,090
The video is quite interesting

225
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,260
If we watch it years later

226
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,380
we should be very impressed

227
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,290
I feel the same way

228
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,250
But the shooting style is a bit confusing

229
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,770
Do you know the documentary?

230
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,060
Documentary?

231
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,570
For example, Animal World is a documentary

232
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,940
I know that

233
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,740
In fact, there are many documentaries that are interesting

234
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:31,940
and informative

235
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,880
I think you can interact more

236
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,890
with the people being videoed

237
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,940
It should be interesting

238
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,170
Interact? What do you mean by that?

239
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,450
I mean you can ask some questions

240
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,570
I just watched it

241
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,260
and I should be the first one to to ask you a question

242
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
It seems so

243
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,060
I didn't expect you to be quite insightful

244
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,210
I love both movies and documentaries

245
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,180
President Chu has such an artistic personality

246
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,420
Then why is the school newspaper so dull?

247
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,890
Do you know the story of Einstein and the three stools?

248
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,010
In fact, we've made a lot of improvements

249
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,690
for the school newspaper that you read

250
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,740
Okay, President Chu cares all about people and is committed to them

251
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,880
which is very admirable

252
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,420
The next time you get any interesting video

253
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,260
remember to show me

254
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,740
In fact, I feel that there is nothing to shoot

255
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,980
Most of them are quite boring

256
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,530
Then you can shoot something that

257
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,690
you are interested in or curious about

258
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Interested?

259
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,940
Now we are in the

260
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,740
First Cafeteria of Zhen Hua

261
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,730
[The not-so-delicious food is provided here every day]

262
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,450
[to offer daily energy supply of students and faculties in Zhen Hua]

263
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,180
Now, let's interview a student at random

264
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,820
[Hello, excuse me]

265
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,180
[What are you eating?]

266
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,210
Who are you?

267
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,890
Okay, let's find another interviewee

268
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,420
[Hello, excuse me]

269
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,130
Judging from your body shape

270
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,450
you should be very knowledgeable about eating

271
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,330
Maybe a little

272
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,450
Are you from Zhen Hua Campus TV Station?

273
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,420
[I'm from the provincial TV station for a private visit]

274
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,130
[What do you think of the food in Zhen Hua?]

275
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,690
It's good. It's okay

276
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,770
I've been eating at the cafeteria in Zhen Hua for two years

277
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,380
I think the food in Window 2

278
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,940
is quite good

279
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,450
But every time I finish eating

280
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,570
I feel very thirsty

281
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,130
I think there may be too much gourmet powder in the food

282
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,740
Thank you very much

283
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,570
The information you provided is valuable

284
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,300
It's okay

285
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,440
-Well
-You are welcome

286
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,620
[Ma'am]

287
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:35,940
What do you want to eat?

288
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,850
[Why do you put so much gourmet powder]

289
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,890
[in the food?]

290
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,010
[Have you not considered the health of the students?]

291
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,330
What are you shooting? Which class are you from?

292
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,380
Please answer my question directly

293
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,130
[Stupid]

294
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,330
[Ma'am]

295
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,980
Yu

296
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,690
My dear Yu

297
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,210
You're so obsessed with it

298
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,650
I thought you were just playing on it for several days

299
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,860
and now you're doing interviews

300
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,090
You know what? Recently, I felt that using this to shoot

301
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,740
is too much fun

302
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,500
And you know what? I also interviewed President Chu

303
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,940
Chu Tiankuo?

304
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,330
Yeah, he's quite fond of movies

305
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,530
and he knows a lot about it

306
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,300
He also told me that

307
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,890
if I want to shoot properly

308
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,570
I should think about what I am most interested in

309
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,210
And that's why you chose to shoot in the cafeteria?

310
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,850
Yeah, I've always had a love for food

311
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,770
Let me see what you got

312
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,130
Look

313
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,330
Yanyi drew this

314
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,620
So good

315
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,010
[Look at the details. They’re brilliant]

316
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,820
[What are you looking at?]

317
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,890
[What are you looking at, Chen Yao?]

318
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,940
Mi Qiao, Zheng Yanyi drew this

319
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,420
Can you believe it?

320
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,300
Wow

321
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,650
It's not good for you to go through other people's things like this

322
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,860
It's not like that. It fell on the floor

323
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,420
I picked it up for him, and

324
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,330
What are you doing?

325
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,500
[Yanyi, your drawings are so good]

326
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,330
Give me that

327
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:58,940
Yanyi

328
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,620
Chen Yao found that your drawing book was on the floor

329
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,650
and she picked it up

330
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,620
We all think that your drawings are really good

331
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,420
Really?

332
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,300
Of course

333
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,530
Then don't tell the teacher

334
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,090
I drew these secretly

335
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,940
Secretly? Why?

336
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,450
My grades of the last exam dropped again

My mom beat me up

338
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,500
She said painting would influence my study

339
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,180
I am also always inattentive

340
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,180
After doing my homework for a while, I would start to draw something

341

What is doing homework?

342
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,890
Your drawings are much better than your homework

343

I think so too

You are not putting yourselves in my shoes

Finding a good job.

to become a cartoonist.

Drawing is not an honorable occupation.

If I gently push Yanyi from behind,

there will be a hurricane in the Chinese Cartoon industry,

I can't find my drawing book.

402
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,930
Maybe it's because your drawings are so attractive

403
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,140
that the book was taken secretly by your adorer.

How could it happen?

00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,450
You're always surreptitiously filming with your DV.

506
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,900
I'm not surreptitiously filming!

507
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,330
I'm conducting a secret investigation.

508
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,170
I tell you,

509
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,980
I have the interview room lent by President Chu.

510
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,690
How much benefit he gave you?

511
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,380
He is now President Chu, instead of a profiteer.

512
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,690
I changed my mind after interviewing him.

513
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,570
I thought Chu Tiankuo was not

514
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,050
in the same world with us before.

515
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,620
But now,

516
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,450
I think he is the same as everyone else.

517
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,570
What does this mean?

518
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,380
Zhouzhou,

519
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,410
why people don't do

520
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,930
what they think.

521
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,620
Oh, you're talking about the topic "myself in ten years".

522
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,130
How did you know?

523
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,660
This topic is known by everyone now in Zhenhua.

524
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,540
Everyone knows it since you ask whoever you meet.

525
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:39,570
Fine.

526
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,500
My dear Yu zhouzhou,

527
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,980
what do you imagine yourself to be like

528
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,930
in ten years?

529
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,380
I don't know what will I be like

530
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,090
in ten years.

531
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,210
I don't even care that so much.

532
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,290
I just hope there could be someone

533
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,160
that I want to spare no effort to protect.

534
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,500
What's the matter?

535
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,660
You're a slick person.

536
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,810
Bed in hotels is really comfy.

537
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,740
I just cleaned it up.

538
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,140
Get away from that bed.

539
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,780
What are you doing?

540
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,020
What do you think I'm doing?

541
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,540
Stop! I just swept the floor. Don't make it messy.

542
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,740
I see. I see. Don't shout at me.

543
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,260
What are you looking at?

544
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,170
It suddenly reminds me that people say

545
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,660
the way

546
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,980
Japanese check the cleanliness of the tubs

547
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,810
is scooping water from the tub.

548
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,020
Do you want to try as well?

549
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,050
Help yourself.

550
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:17,690
Go away！

551
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,050
What are you watching?

552
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,020
Nothing.

553
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,260
Are you done yet?

554
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,140
Are you Ok?

555
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,250
I have a backache.

556
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,660
At this young age?

557
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,090
You are Mu Rong.

558
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,740
Why are you content with wiping the tubs?

559
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,690
What's wrong with wiping tubs?

560
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,690
It's a part of our Hospitality Management.

561
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,660
Many people envy me!

562
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,690
Is Room 6059 ready?

563
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:10,900
The guest...

564
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,570
Room 6059 is ready.

565
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,860
The guest can get in the room now.

566
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,280
There're 2 hours left before clocking off.

567
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,090
Are you willing to wait for me?

568
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,660
I don't have much time to wait for you.

569
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,660
I am here to interview you.

570
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,020
To incognito travel and interview you.

571
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,980
Are you available for a while now?

572
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:24,970
Yes.

573
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,810
When did you start smoking?

574
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,090
What are you doing?

575
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,380
I don't want you to smoke!

576
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,020
Give it back to me.

577
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,780
Isn't it good to live in health?

578
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,080
Fine. Live healthily.

579
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,810
Promise me not to smoke anymore.

580
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,170
You have my word.

581
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,410
Since the cigarettes are thrown away, what are your here for?

582
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,140
I'm here to interview you.

583
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,210
Interview me?

584
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:04,660
Yes.

585
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,050
Go ahead.

586
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,780
What do you imagine yourself to be

587
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,570
in ten years?

588
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,740
Ten years later,

589
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,930
I'd like to be an excellent hotel manager.

590
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,540
That's it?

591
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:19,860
Yeah.

592
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,290
I thought you would say you wanted

593
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,450
dominate the BBQ industry of our province.

594
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,210
Hotel staff’s job is interesting, you know?

595
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,210
There're all kinds of beautiful hotels around the world.

596
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,800
Some are by the sea.

597
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,660
Some are on the grassland.

598
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,290
And some are even on cliffs.

599
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,260
There's a hotel in America

600
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,290
which locates inside a big farm

601
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,780
The rooms are like huge tents.

602
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,500
Some of the hotels are beneath the sea.

603
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,140
When you're sleeping,

604
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,440
you can see various fish

605
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,320
swimming around you.

606
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,260
That sounds interesting.

607
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:49,860
Yes, it is.

608
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,290
My dream is to live in

609
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,780
and work at all these hotels.

610
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,010
This will not only enrich my management experience,

611
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,410
while seeing more hotels,

612
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,260
but also experience the local customs.

613
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,330
Not bad.

614
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,260
I didn't expect you to be quite insightful.

615
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,380
Would you like to stay in all these hotels

616
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,010
together with me in the future?

617
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,900
I do!  I'd like to stay in all these interesting

618
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,690
I shall live in all grand hotels.

619
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
What the hell,

620
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,860
how can I be in hotels together with you?

621
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,090
But you just said it would be interesting.

622
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,540
I just, I...

623
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,140
What are you thinking about!

624
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,050
So, is this why

625
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,500
you chose to major in hotel management

626
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,450
from the beginning?

627
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:36,930
Maybe.

628
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,020
Really?

629
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,410
In my childhood, when I saw on TV those

630
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,020
who could afford to live in grand hotels,

631
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,290
I was so envious of them.

632
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,330
Really? So you're such a material guy.

633
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,690
Those grand hotels seemed to be so cosy

634
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,860
with comfortable beds,

635
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,980
and 24-hour hot tubs.

636
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,410
And their guests can even ring

637
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,290
for lots of tasty food into the rooms.

638
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:58,690
That's true.

639
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,540
Every time

640
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,810
my father hit me,

641
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,620
I  would hide myself somewhere.

642
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Then I entered into a vocational high school.

643
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,500
Seeing the major of hotel management,

644
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,980
I chose it without a second thought.

645
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:16,980
Benben,

646
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,620
I feel you have a clearer mind of the future

647
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,380
than many students in Zhen Hua High School

648
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,570
I do have no choice.

649
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,900
You are top students, men of tremendous promise,

650
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,330
while I'm merely a vocational school student.

651
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,500
So I have to plan earlier for my own future.

652
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,050
By the way, what about you?

653
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,050
Me?

654
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,140
What kind of person do you want to be

655
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,810
in ten years?

656
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,860
I...

657
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,330
" Murong Chenzhang, Murong Chenzhang,

658
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,890
where are you now? "

659
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,260
Alright, I'll be right there.

660
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,140
I have to go.

661
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,540
Never mind, I'll leave you to it.

662
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:53,680
Bye!

663
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,140
Bye!

664
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,540
Excuse me, are there any letters

665
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:00,780
for the Class three, Grade 11, please?

666
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,410
Yes, there are.

667
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,690
Your monitor has just took them away.

668
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,620
Okay, thank you.

669
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,540
Zheng Yanyi.

670
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:17,740
My letter?

671
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,450
Wow, Yanyi, have you got a pen pal?

672
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,620
No, I haven't.

673
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,090
QIYI Magazine,

674
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,740
does it refer to the QIYI Cartoon Magazine?

675
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,320
So great you are, Yanyi!

676
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,400
But I'm not sure why this letter is sent to me.

677
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,140
Maybe they happened to discover your talent

678
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,330
in drawing cartoons,

679
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,290
thus deciding to invite you to draw for them.

680
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,140
This is my drawing,

681
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,170
why is it sent back to me?

682
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,050
What did they say in the letter,

683
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,570
Yanyi?

684
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,380
Let me see, did they praise you?

685
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,090
Yanyi,

686
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,020
what's wrong?

687
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:12,930
Who did it?

688
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,620
Are you alright? Aren't you admitted?

689
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,780
Mi Qiao, did you do this?

690
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,260
I, I thought your drawings are really good.

691
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,570
It's their fault not to choose you.

692
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,260
I shouldn't have thought so highly of them.

693
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,740
Yanyi, you shouldn't be discouraged.

694
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,900
At least they recognized that

695
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,330
you do have the potential.

696
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,860
Will you please stop?

697
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,690
Oh, no, don't be angry,

698
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,450
I was just trying to help you.

699
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,780
If you don't have a try,

700
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:50,800
you'll never know whether you can make it.

701
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,140
Thanks for your help, okay?

702
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,450
I know I can't make it.

703
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,780
I could have dreamed about being a caricaturist.

704
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,410
But now,

705
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,930
I have even lost the chance to daydream.

706
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,050
Alright, I thank you Mi Qiao.

707
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,980
Now are you satisfied?

708
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:29,570
Mi Qiao,

709
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,050
I beg you to stay out of my business, please.

710
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,010
Fine, now I get it.

711
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,170
Your so-called dream is actually

712
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,330
the fear of failure.

713
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,690
You would always crouch in the corner.

714
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,210
You believe no try brings no failure, don't you?

715
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,330
Who are you to say so?

716
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Because I despise you.

717
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,170
If you dream about it, why don't you try it?

718
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,660
That's because you have no courage!

719
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,540
Mi Qiao,

720
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,610
are you all right? You look so sad.

721
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:34,740
No, I'm not sad.

722
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,330
Mi Qiao,

723
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,930
it's true that Yanyi somewhat lost his temper,

724
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,620
but he still needs your understanding.

725
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,780
After all, for someone,

726
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,370
dream is private

727
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,260
and just for occasional self-satisfaction.

728
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:52,930
Zhouzhou,

729
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,020
I'm actually not brave at all.

730
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,090
I don't think so.

731
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,250
Do you know why I asked everyone

732
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,980
how they think about their future in ten years?

733
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,170
Why?

734
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:04,660
That's because

735
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,810
I never dare to think about it at all.

736
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,690
I was diagnosed with congenital heart disease

737
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,929
when I was young.

738
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,980
Thus I had to face the reality

739
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,300
while other children of my age

740
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,100
even had no idea about death.

741
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,739
Alright, you are a better storyteller than me.

742
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,449
I swear to you, all I said is true.

743
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,370
To be honest, I'm really a timid guy.

744
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,690
I never dare to run when being happy,

745
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,610
nor do I have the courage to travel alone,

746
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,260
let alone imagining about my future.

747
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,409
Ten years!

748
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,739
Maybe in ten years,

749
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,980
I'll not be able to exist in this world

750
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,690
any longer.

751
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,100
I've had lots of wonderful dreams,

752
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
but I'm so afraid that one day,

753
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,300
I can probably do nothing to realize them.

754
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,580
Why didn't you tell me before?

755
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,580
Have you forgotten what secret means?

756
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,100
What does it mean?

757
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,690
Secret?

758
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,780
Secret means the maze in your heart.

759
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,540
You may never be able to walk out of it,

760
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,260
but you're always willing to keep running it.

761
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,450
I don't want to tell you where its exit is,

762
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,440
since I hope that you can always

763
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,780
be simple, happy,

764
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,650
and optimistic about the future,

765
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,300
my dear Yu Zhouzhou.

766
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,020
So now you know why I'm so angry.

767
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,290
All of you

768
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,450
have so promising a future,

769
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,540
yet choose to do nothing.

770
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,890
But there is so much I want to do

771
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,210
while so little time is left to me.

772
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,340
It's so unfair.

773
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,810
How I wish I could have a dream,

774
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,210
and then to realize it with my whole life.

775
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,060
Mi Qiao, believe me,

776
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,060
no matter how many years

777
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,650
or even how many days are left to you,

778
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,450
I'll always be with you,

779
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,060
and help you

780
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,740
to realize all of your dreams!

781
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,020
I believe you.
