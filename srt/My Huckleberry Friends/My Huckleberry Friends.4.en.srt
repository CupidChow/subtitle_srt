00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,620
I can't sleep well,

126
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,580

127

In fact, you don't have to work so hard.

129

Sleep early, get more rest.

130
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,650
I can't, I can not fall asleep.

131
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,860
I recently found a history lecture program,

132
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,130
Especially wonderful.

133
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,370
I can't sleep at night

134
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,700
without watching this program.

135
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,170
Director Pan, you see, 
 students are still waiting for me.

136
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,860
I have to come back.

137
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,090
Science has found that our body cells,

138

every seven years will complete a full renewal.

139
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,930
But this does not mean that after every seven years,

140
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,740
we will become a new self.

141
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,490
Look, this program.

142
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,980
You must see it!

143
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,460
I think many of you here

144
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,210
wish that every once in a while,

145
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,580
we could all be new self again.

146
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,490
Very photogenic,

147
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,810
quite photogenic.

148
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,810
So I want all our head teachers

149
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,140
to have a good learning from this show,

150
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,930
and it is better for the principal to see it too.

151
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,300
Pan, you're going a bit too far, aren't you?

152
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,250
You don't have to complain to the principal, right?

153
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,580
Now you are worried, ah?

154
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,810
Didn't you talk about the Daze Village Uprising?

155
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,180
If you don't take care of your students,

156
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,580
your class is going to uprise!

157
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,740

158

Stop pretending!

166
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,620
You can hide it,

167
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,460
or give it to someone else!

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,380
Here are the English test results for your class.

341
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,010
Take a look.

342
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,260
You want to talk about

343
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,820
these two Hongzhi students, don't you?

344
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,860
These two Hongzhi students,

345
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,420
we were hesitant to keep them,

346
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,500
saying that we would observe them
 for a period of time,

347
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,450
and if they couldn't study well, 
we would only keep one.

348
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,450
But look at their scores.

349
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,820
The scores of the two together

350
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,620
are not as high as the score of the bottom three.

351
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,730
They had just arrived
 and probably hadn't adapted yet.

352
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,930
Most of the students in Hongzhi class

353
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,300
have gone back,

354
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,450
they are afraid that they can't keep up 
 with Zhenhua's teaching,

355
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,980
which is not good for them.

356
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,940
These two children are hard-working,

357
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,690
Pan, give them a chance.

358
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,860
No, this year is different.

359
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,940
Why is it different?

360
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,380
Speaking of that, I'll get right to the point

361
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,410
and tell you the second thing.

362
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,090
Okay.

363
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,690
Given your current situation,

364
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,770
I don't think you're fit
 to be a head teacher anymore.

365
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,620
I've talked to Ms. Zhang, who teaches Chinese,

366
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,740
and she'll be the head teacher,

367
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,820
so you can be the subject teacher.

368
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,420
Are you kidding me?

369
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,130
Pan Yuansheng,

370
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,450
I've been a head teacher 
 since my first day at Zhenhua,

371
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,260
for 23 years.

372
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,420
But class 3 is a A class,

373
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,610
the school, parents, city education committee 
 are all paying attention to this class.

374
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,620
I do not allow the students 
to have any regression

375
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,530
But the learning performance 
 of the class 3 is still good.

376
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,530
It's not being affected now,

377
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,080
what about the future?

378
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,210
Can you guarantee it?

379
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,820
Wu,  I am for your own good,

380
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,060
for the good of the students.

381
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,620
I hope all things go well.

382
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,530
You have decided?

383
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,490
I have no other choice.

384
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,940
Can I force you to quit your job
 at the TV station?

385
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,089
You're going to be a super star, 
a famous scholar.

386
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,380
Ms. Zhang also agreed.

387
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:13,980
She agreed?

388
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,690
but she had one request,

389
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,540
she did not recommend 
 keeping the two Hongzhi students.

390
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,150
[Handheld Pancake  3 RMB]

391
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,569
I've told you so much,

392
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,290
what do you think?

393
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,020
Pretty good, fragrant and crispy.

394
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,380
Let me tell you, this store just opened

395
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,569
and the pancakes are super tasty.

396
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620
Auntie, give her one too.

397
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,170
Okay！

398
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,570
I'm going to talk to you about Xin Rui,

399
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,140
I didn't say pancakes.

400
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,620
Auntie,  put more onions and chili!

401
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,900
Mi Qiao!

402
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,620
I've already forgiven her.

403
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,050
What else do you want me to do?

404
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,810
I think she's quite pathetic,

405
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,080
we have to help her.

406
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,610
This thing is up to Director Pan,

407
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,410
and even if Director Pan wants her to stay,

408
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,690
it depends on whether Mr. Wu agrees or not.

409
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,050
Even if Mr. Wu agrees,

410
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,500
it depends on her own performance.

411
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,090
I've seen her grades,

412
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,170
other exam results are good,

413
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,810
but English is a little worse.

414
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,450
That is called a little worse?

415
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,980
She speaks English with an accent

416
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,380
that is worse than that of a London suburb.

417
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,540
So what should we do?

418
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,380
Okay.

419
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,210
I will think about it.

420
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,140
This pancake is on you.

421
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,770
I knew you were the best for me.

422
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,380
Don't shake me, you're shaking my soul out.

423
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,660
Auntie, add an egg for her!

424
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,370
Xu Zhiqiang, 
you're here to buy pancakes too, huh?

425
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,810
Good taste! Isn't it super delicious?

426
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,050
Yep.

427
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,410
Why did he leave?

428
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,650
Am I so annoying?

429
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,140
Aren't you tired of eating pancakes every day?

430
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,380
Let me tell you, I recently found out that these pancakes

431
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,540
are even better when they are cold.

432
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,930
Awesome.

433
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,010
President Chu!

434
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,620
Mi Qiao?

435
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,170
How are things going with our Anime Club?

436
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:05,930
There's been progress.

437
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,400
Really?

438
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,490
There's a vacant classroom next month

439
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,050
that can be used for your activities.

440
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,380
Next month?

441
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,290
Why don't you say next year?

442
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,930
Several clubs are waiting for this room,

443
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,570
do you want to wait a little longer?

444
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,980
Come on,

445
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,930
let me keep that classroom.

446
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,090
We'll just stay in the old little rundown house

447
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:23,930
for a while.

448
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,410
Let's put up a sign, right?

449
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,900
I was just about to tell you

450
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,330
that the old house is no longer available,

451
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,260
it's now reserved for the students 
 in the Hongzhi classes,

452
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
for English tuition.

453
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,900
What? Why?

454
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,980
By the way,

455
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,290
The school recently will check personal hygiene,

456
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,810
so don't eat unclean snacks like this

457
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,900
in the future.

458
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,800
What are you talking about?

459
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,860
Xu Zhiqiang, what are you doing?

460
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,810
What did you say? Say it again!

461
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,020
What did you say?

462
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,780
Xu Zhiqiang, what's wrong with you?

463
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,290
I said the pancake.

464
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,740
What's wrong with the pancake?

465
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,570
You're the cleanest, you're a young master, right?

466
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,740
Xu Zhiqiang, don't make any trouble!

467
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,900
Stay out of it, it's none of your business.

468
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,810
Xu Zhiqiang,

469
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,650
fighting is punishable by expulsion at Zhenhua!

470
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,660
I'm not from this school anyway.

471
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,050
What did you say?

472
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,410
I'm asking you,

473
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,540
why did you hit Chu Tiankuo?

474
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,850
No reason, I just don't like him!

475
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,540
Xu Zhiqiang, you're new here,

476
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,930
you may not used to it, 
 not comfortable with it,

477
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,620
it's no problem.

478
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,690
If there are problems and conflicts,

479
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,930
You can tell me about it.

480
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,170
I'm your headteacher.

481
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,860
This is how you solve a problem?

482
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,980
Stop acting. Sir.

483
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,210
I've heard it all.

484
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,540
What did you know?

485
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,050
I know you're going to be teaching director soon.

486
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,050
But for now I'm still your headteacher!

487
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,330
Mr. Wu, why are you still here?

488
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,540
Something happened in your class.

489
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,090
What?

490
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,290
You wanted my Walkman.

491
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,690
I lent it to you without hesitation.

492
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,380
Why didn't you ask me how to use it if you don't know how?

493
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,970
Now the tape is broken.

494
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,020
I'm sorry.

495
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,170
I'll buy another one for you.

496
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,140
My dad bought this for me in Hong Kong last month.

497
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,020
This is one is out of print.

498
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,930
Can you afford it?

499
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,570
Enough. Chen Yao, stop.

500
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,780
It's just a tape.

501
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,290
My dad is going to Hong Kong next month.

502
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:16,930
I'll tell him to buy anything you want.

503
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,090
We good?

504
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,140
You don't know what "out of print" means?

505
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,440
I want mine.

506
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,570
Chen Yao, I was listening to the tape as well.

507
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,540
It stuck in the middle of a song.

508
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,810
It was like this when we took it out.

509
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,020
Zhouzhou, what are you trying to say?

510
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,500
You're blaming on my Walkman?

511
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,160
We listened to it together.

512
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,290
I'll compensate you.

513
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,500
Chen Yao, I remember

514
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,050
that cassette store has one.

515
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,810
Looks exactly like yours. I'll buy you that one.

516
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,090
No big deal.

517
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,500
Why do you all act against me?

518
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,450
No.

519
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,020
We are from the same class.

520
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,810
Do I really look like those who care about the tape?

521
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,210
I mean,

522
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,980
Too many trouble had occurred

523
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,380
ever since they transferred to here from Hong Zhi.

524
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,050
Don't you find it annoying?

525
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,290
You'll rank the last if they weren't here.

526
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,780
You should be grateful.

527
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:10,780
Did I say something wrong?

528
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,380
What happened?

529
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,170
Nothing, Mr. Wu.

530
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,140
All settled.

531
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,930
Then go studying.

532
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,260
Go back to your seat.

533
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,540
How come it was settled?

534
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,930
I heard it all from the hallway.

535
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,210
Did I ask you?

536
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,780
I'm not done with you.

537
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,780
Sit down.

538
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,900
Ling Xiangqian, come with me.

539
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,920
Xin Rui.

540
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,810
We did our best.

541
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,090
We're looked down upon.

542
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,410
We should leave.

543
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,970
That cassette store doesn't have the tape,

544
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,860
you just wanted to help her, right?

545
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,900
You didn't listen to the song with Xin Rui together.

546
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,410
You wanted to help her.

547
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,210
We're the same.

548
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,810
I don't know why.

549
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,900
She reminds me of myself.

550
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,090
Seeing her cry, apologize,

551
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,900
and being watched by so many eyes

552
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,200
makes me want to help her.

553
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,900
Why would she reminds you of yourself?

554
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,330
How come I don't feel this way?

555
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,980
I can't wrap my head around it too.

556
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,170
Did something traumatic happen

557
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,570
when you were little?

558
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,530
Well.

559
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,730
Nothing happened.

560
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,050
What's the deal between you and Lin Yang?

561
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,290
What did he do?

562
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,090
It has nothing to do with him.

563
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,690
Okay, nothing.

564
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,540
Oh, bad news.

565
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,260
What?

566
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,570
The venue for the Cartoon Club is not available.

567
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,020
The warehouse was available.

568
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,540
But today I asked Chu Tiankuo,

569
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,540
he told me that

570
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,170
the warehouse is reserved for students from Hong Zhi.

571
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,660
Why always something in the way...

572
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,330
Don't be upset.

573
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,740
There will be a way.

574
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,980
I shouldn't have stopped Xu Zhiqiang

575
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,290
when he hit Chu Tiankuo.

576
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,930
What did they fight for?

577
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,930
I'm not sure either.

578
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,660
I was asking Chu Tiankuo about Student Council,

579
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,980
and he said the pancake I ate is unclean.

580
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,410
Because of what he said...

581
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,170
Spice?

582
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:26,810
Yes.

583
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,090
Yes.

584
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,810
How many eggs?

585
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,140
Don't go there.

586
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,410
He doesn't want us to know.

587
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,330
Let's go.

588
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,450
Are you tired?

589
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:49,900
Mi Qiao.

590
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,380
Yeah.

591
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,620
What are you thinking?

592
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,500
Nothing.

593
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,040
I should go.

594
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,570
Bye bye.

595
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,140
Bye bye.

596
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,140
I'm already here.

597
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,380
Where are you?

598
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,210
I'm in the Xiaowu Barbecue.

599
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,540
Near a dry clean store.

600
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,020
Look behind, look behind.

601
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,570
Behind.

602
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,970
Here.

Buy some flowers for your girl?

605
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,740
Lao Wu, since you're invited to a TV show,

606
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,020
I have to buy you dinner.

607
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,140
You did really great.

608
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,500
I have to say,

609
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,020
watching TV is pretty easy, right?

610
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,570
But recording a show

611
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,440
is much more complicated.

612
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,660
It's hard.

613
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,500
So you planning to continue doing this?

614
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,170
I know what you mean.

received great responses.

So they want to make a series.

618
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,170
I've asked you to dismiss me

619
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,020
as a headteacher.

620
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,930
And I don't want to be subject teacher either.

621
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,210
Otherwise, my heart can't take it

622
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,900

629

They said you live here.

Thank you for defending me today.

631

You've been sitting here all night just for this?

Why are you still here?

642
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,290
I had something to say to Zhouzhou

643

You're Qiangzi's classmate?

Yes.

You don't have to, mom.

It's fine, auntie.

I'll have it tomorrow morning.

00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,140
send them back?

655
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,050
You just said that you're leaving.

Why do you care?

657
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,170
To be honest,

658
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,860
I want to keep them.

The teachers worked there at the time were graduated from famous universities.

like those teachers looked at us.

his father and I felt

678
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,660
really proud.

679
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,210
We couldn't sleep for two nights.

680
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,080
I've ditched the house works

681
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,140
to sell pancakes here and take care of Qiangzi.

682
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,410
He rank the third in the class.

683
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm relieved.

684
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:09,140
Auntie, Xu Zhiqiang studies really hard.

685
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,290
Mr. Wu praises him a lot.

686
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,140
Really?

687
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,660
Yes.

688
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,740
I'm so proud of you.

689
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,930
Just don't act like your father, control your temper.

690
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,780
Don't be a troublemaker.

691
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,620
Auntie, relaxed.

692
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,380
Xu Zhiqiang is a good student.

693
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,290
I come here

694
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,770
because the closer I get,

695
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,780
the more I can look after.

696
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,210
Yeah.

697
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,660
It's been a long time.

698
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,980
His father sells pancakes alone is really tired.

699
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,540
Yes.

700
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,380
Qiangzi also said the classmates are nice.

701
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,210
I'm relieved.

702
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,090
Auntie, slowly.

703
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,260
Slow down.

704
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,860
I'll show you something.

705
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,140
Zhouzhou.

706
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,500
What are you going to do?

707
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,260
I'm going to

708
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,860
release my stress.

709
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,980
One, two, three!

710
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,410
You good?

711
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,690
Feeling better?

712
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,810
Better.

713
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
You sure got a way.

714
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,570
I used to do this a lot.

715
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,450
Push them over.

716
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,170
Then lift them up one by one.

717
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,500
Done the bad deed and sweats.

718
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,080
The stresses are gone in a blink of eye.

719
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,780
I feel like no matter what had happened,

720
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,780
I can start all over again.

721
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,660
It feels great.

722
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,660
Xin Rui.

723
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,260
Yeah.

724
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,780
You have to stay.

725
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,800
Only then you'll discover

726
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,380
how wonderful this place is.

727
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,410
Okay.

728
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,080
Say something happy.

729
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,810
Remember the self introduction we did?

730
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,780
We sang an English song.

731
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:31,780
Right.

732
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,440
We sang the heart out of ourselves.

733
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,860
The principal said to us

734
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,980
after we finished,

735
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,140
"your English suck,

736
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,540
how did you get in Zhen Hua?"

737
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,810
Mimicking me?

738
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,140
It's been over 20 years.

739
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,450
Right, 20 years.

740
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,260
Honestly speaking, Xiao Pan,

741
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,500
the two kids...

742
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,930
The deadline is English exam.

743
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,810
They pass, they stay.

744
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,930
Okay.

745
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,090
Still got time.

746
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,450
Cartoon didactic.

747
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,400
Introduced by Mr. Wu.

748
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,860
Learning English

749
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,810
while watching cartoons.

750
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,450
Sounds good.

751
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,140
It is introduced by Mr. Wu.

752
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,930
But the name,

753
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,620
it's changed, right?

754
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,330
What I said is Movie didactic.

755
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,860
Mr. Wu, it's the same.

756
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:29,680
Well.

757
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,770
You're using the venue of Cartoon club.

758
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,650
The elements of cartoon must be contained.

759
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,500
Okay?

760
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,170
Well, unsolicited promotion.

761
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,450
-Mr. -Let's get started.

762
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,660
We repeat

763
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,980
every sentence.

764
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,660
Zhouzhou.

765
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,260
Yes.

766
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,380
I can understand what's written in the book.

767
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,140
But the dialogue in the movie...

768
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,450
I can't understand.

769
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:54,930
Xin Rui.

770
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,970
I've seen your exam paper.

771
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,330
You did good on blank filling and reading.

772
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,450
But listening and writing are terrible.

773
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,930
And speaking.

774
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,140
I'll leave it here.

775
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,810
Today is in the weekend.

776
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,930
Pretend this place as an English corner.

777
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,860
Practice more on your speaking and listening.

778
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,410
Zhouzhou, start.

779
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,020
Okay.

780
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,410
Start.

781
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,210
如果这个世界对你不理不睬

782
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,090
你也可以这样对待它

783
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:27,930
那并不是

784
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,500
Okay.

785
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,770
This is it.

786
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,860
如果这个世界对你不理不睬

787
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,810
你也可以这样对待它

788
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,620
when

789
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,500
the

790
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,900
world

791
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,330
I can't speak fluently.

792
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,860
Slow down, don't hurry.

793
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,380
Okay.

794
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,740
when the world turns

795
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,530
Stop, stop, stop.

796
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,930
We're not like you.

797
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,020
The word "English"  makes...

798
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,050
ma... makes...me...

799
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,140
Makes you stressed out and stutter.

800
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,290
I'll say it for you.

801
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:05,980
Zhouzhou.

802
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,620
Yes.

803
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,690
Can I ask

804
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,260
what does it mean?

805
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,889
It's a classic dialogue in Lion King.

806
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,130
When the world turns its back on you

807
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,850
you turn your back on the world

808
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,449
Ah, it's the literal meaning.

809
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,100
It also has an extended meaning.

810
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,409
What's the extended meaning?

811
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,210
Oh god.

812
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,449
You can't even pronounce.

813
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:29,969
Let alone the extended meaning.

814
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,340
This is killing me.

815
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,170
What should we do now? Any short cuts?

816
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,130
No short cuts.

817
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,929
But there's another way.

818
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,300
We can try music didactic.

819
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,409
No wonder you host the forum.

820
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:45,929
Resourceful, Mr. Wu.

821
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,409
Shut up. This is the last one I can give.

822
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,540
That's how I learned English back then.

823
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,889
My oral English was even worse than yours.

824
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,650
But I like singing.

825
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,820
So I sang the words I want to say.

826
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,340
Mr. Wu, we can't even pronounce the words fluently.

827
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,340
Could this work?

828
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,850
You wouldn't know if you don't try.

829
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,690
Any English songs?

830
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,450
None? Are you kidding me?

831
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,580
There's one.

832
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,930
♫祝你生日快乐♫

833
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,530
♫祝你生日快乐♫

834
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,540
You did good.

835
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,260
Sang the words

836
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,060
with this melody,

837
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,210
will you?

838
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,610
Sir, stop.

839
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,850
It'll be too awful to listen to.

840
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,170
How could you know if you never try?

841
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,020
You'll know once you tried.

842
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,300
Actually we can sing it as well as we speak it.

843
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,130
How about I start first?

844
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,540
♫ happy birthday to you ♫

845
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,410
♫ happy birthday to you ♫

846
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,340
♫ When the world turns its back on you ♫

847
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:06,160
♫ you turn your back on the world ♫

848
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,780
Is it good? Give it a try!

849
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,370
