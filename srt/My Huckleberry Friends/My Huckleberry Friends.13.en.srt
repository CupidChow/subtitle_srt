4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,100
Two more words.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,020
The finals are around the corner.

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:26,530
I know

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,290
-Dude, could we not do this? - All teachers are trying to add more classes for you

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,210
Calm down.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,680
-The exams are one week away. -So, our history classes

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,610
are not going to torture you.

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,770
Sorry.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,180
However,

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,450
let me tell you

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,410
-Usually, after a teacher announces a good news -What's going on with you and Lin Yang?

15
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,980
there will always be a "but".

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,770
So don't get too excited.

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,250
-He didn't show up the whole day -Don't get too excited

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,530
not within my vision.

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,130
-This is not normal. -What follows

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,770
my "but”？

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,020
It would be abnormal.

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,380
-if he shows up every day. -So after the finals

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,770
we will have a parents meeting with parents

24
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,380
whose children didn't do well in the exam.

25
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,650
So you decide

26
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,410
if you want to prepare for it.

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,930
Don't "aw".

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,410
Ok. Class dismissed.

29
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,380
There is a meeting of the animation club after school.

30
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,289
Don't skip it.

31
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,060
I've got something else. Can't make it.

32
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,250
You keep disappearing right after school these days.

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,210
Where did you go?

34
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,420
Miqiao,

35
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,060
Did you go to the hospital the day before yesterday?

36
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,980
Me? Not possible.

37
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,810
I'm in good health.

38
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,850
Why would I go to the hospital?

39
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,160
Benben said you had a toothache.

40
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,100
Oh right. My molar

41
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,530
hurts again.

42
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,060
It feels like you are faking it.

43
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,660
No I am not.

44
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,660
It's alright. Go after school.

45
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,100
I'll be there for the animation club. No worries.

46
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,660
Are you hiding something from me?

47
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,140
Nothing. I swear.

48
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,420
[Episode 13 Boy crush's got a little secret]

49
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,250
Lin Yang

50
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,810
I don't feel well.

51
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,570
Go to the infirmary.

52
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,780
I've been there.

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,460
Still not well.

54
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,930
I'll fetch Ling Xiangqian for you.

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,250
Stop it.

56
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,220
My heart that's been abandoned hurts even more.

57
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,780
You have to be accepted first to be abandoned.

58
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,170
Hey.

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,940
I get so ill when I don't see my Qianqian

60
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,170
for a whole day.

61
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,810
Do you think playing hard to get will work or not?

62
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,450
Guess it will not work.

63
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,170
Zhouzhou

64
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,420
Sorry.

65
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,500
I got summoned

66
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,140
by Teacher Zhang to study physics in his office.

67
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,170
That's why I didn't go to you.

68
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,890
We can have lunch together tomorrow.

69
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,530
Or we can go to the library after school.

70
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:39,610
It's alright.

71
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,810
Just prepare for the competition.

72
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,420
Don't mind me.

73
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,730
Sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

74
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,730
Lin Yang. You don't have to do this.

75
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,140
I'll leave you here.

76
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,650
I waited for you till 12 o'clock

77
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,700
on Zhongxin Square that day.

78
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,810
I called you dozens of times.

79
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,340
And you didn't picked up.

80
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,060
If you don't want to come, just tell me.

81
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,090
No need to hide from me,

82
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,940
let alone lying.

83
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,370
Qianqian,

84
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,340
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,060
It's alright.

86
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,610
I never want to see you again anyway.

87
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,730
You can continue to study here by yourself.

88
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,480
A pair of seven.

89
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,050
No. No.

90
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,740
A pair of seven? Let me see.

91
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:24,980
A pair of K.

92
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,090
Go away.

93
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,300
Get me a bottle of beer.

94
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,810
There's no beer.

95
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,900
There's Beibingyang. Ten yuan a bottle.

96
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,300
Good.

97
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,570
Go or not?

98
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,770
I'll take it.

99
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,210
What's wrong, Lin?

100
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,580
Got upset

101
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,620
and come here to drink Beibingyang to express your anger?

102
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,210
I thought you got quite close

103
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,140
with Yu Zhouzhou these days?

104
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,300
Want it or not?

105
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:43,900
No.

106
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,860
No.

107
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,090
I think Zhouzhou likes Chen An.

108
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,250
I don't know him.

109
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,180
Zhouzhou said he's an important friend

110
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,930
that she's known since young.

111
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,420
But I've never seen him, too.

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,860
At the end of the last semester, Chen An came back from Peking University to give a lecture.

113
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,420
And Zhouzhou changed her major to humanities at the start of this semester.

114
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,980
It was the Silent Night the other day.

115
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,700
Chen An showed up to see Zhouzhou.

116
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,810
That's who she's been with for the Silent Night.

117
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,090
She promised me first.

118
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,490
And then she said something came up.

119
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,300
But she showed up at last

120
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,300
with Chen An by her side.

121
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,050
I'm fine if she didn't see you on purpose.

122
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,090
Zhouzhou's spending time with a stranger

123
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,650
all day long.

124
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,580
Don't tell me you are not worried about that.

125
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,250
He's no stranger than you.

126
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,740
Benben, could you leave your spite for me aside?

127
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,930
Benben?

128
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,300
You called me Benben?

129
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,530
What do you call me?

130
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,460
Boss Murong.

131
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,090
Boss?

132
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,900
Boss has to keep his words

133
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,080
instead of bragging.

134
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,490
And didn't you say that

135
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,700
we divide our domains

136
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,740
and you keep Zhouzhou safe outside school?

137
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,770
Now Zhouzhou disappears all day long.

138
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,330
Are you going to take care of it or not?

139
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,330
Yu Zhouzhou is not three years old.

140
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,620
I can't follow her all around every day.

141
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,300
But Chen An is so much older than her.

142
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,650
Compared with him, Zhouzhou is just a kid.

143
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,420
Tell me if you don't have the guts.

144
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,930
I'll cover Zhouzhou

145
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,050
both inside and outside school.

146
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,370
Also, remove your dirty stall right away.

147
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,180
I'll leave you if you are a dirty stall in disguise,

148
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,020
but you didn't even bother to disguise.

149
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,090
Zhouzhou makes friends with you for nothing.

150
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:07,980
Lin Yang.

151
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,770
You want a piece of me?

152
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,420
Want to fight? Fine.

153
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,490
But investigate who Chen An is first.

154
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,930
If something happens to Zhouzhou,

155
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,530
you'll get a piece of me.

156
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,980
We'll split up and search.

157
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,370
And do our duty.

158
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,210
Mind your tempo.

159
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,250
Do you think Mr. Gu will get mad

160
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,050
because I didn't practice for so long?

161
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,020
You can ask him yourself.

162
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,740
Mind your tempo.

163
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,450
Don't rush.

164
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,650
Mr. Gu.

165
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,740
Zhouzhou.

166
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,740
Come in. Come in.

167
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,980
Take a break.

168
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,330
You must be in high school now.

169
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,490
Grade 2.

170
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,250
In Zhenhua?

171
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,860
Humanities

172
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,810
like Chen An.

173
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,460
Still practicing?

174
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,210
Not as much as I used to.

175
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,250
But I did practice for a while

176
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,490
during the school arts festival not long ago.

177
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,180
Remember when you were graduating from primary school?

178
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,530
I asked you

179
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,860
if you want to keep practicing

180
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,290
and aim for the muscial middle school.

181
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,020
It didn't take a second for you

182
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,900
to say no.

183
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,900
Mr. Hu. I ...

184
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,180
You too.

185
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,420
You too?

186
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,490
I said no to Mr. Gu once, too.

187
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,770
Hey. No messing around.

188
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,810
I know. You are smart.

189
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,090
You've got great fingers.

190
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,250
It's normal to have your own plans.

191
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
I understand.

192
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,980
I

193
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,930
have a competition coming up.

194
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,570
I've been guiding their rehearsal every day.

195
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,330
I'm a bit tired.

196
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,770
If you have time, teach them something.

197
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,810
Mr. Gu, we...

198
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,180
You are the best students I've ever taught.

199
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,370
There won't be a problem.

200
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,740
Then you stay here.

201
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,700
I'll take Mr. Gu for a rest.

202
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,490
OK.

203
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,860
Mr. Gu, let's go.

204
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,210
Bye, Mr. Gu.

205
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,320
Teach them for a while.

206
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,500
You didn't change at all.

207
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,820
You should make the changes that Mr. Gu asked first.

208
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,180
Try it once again.

209
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,130
They seem obedient to you.

210
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,860
Maybe it's because I didn't treat them like children.

211
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,380
So harsh.

212
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,180
Adults like to tamper them

213
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,420
thinking that they are only children.

214
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,420
But if you say the right thing,

215
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,380
they'll make the right decision.

216
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:24,940
Oh, by the way,

217
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,570
why did you say no to Mr. Gu

218
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,740
and not go to the musical middle school?

219
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,890
Why did you?

220
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,500
It's not that I disliked cello.

221
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,530
But I didn't have passion for it.

222
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,130
And the road of musical middle school

223
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,820
seemed so predictable.

224
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,740
Even though I'm not sure about my future

225
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,620
back then,

226
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,300
but I do have expectations for it.

227
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,860
Is this your expectation?

228
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,420
Stop.

229
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,260
The cello is rushing.

230
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,210
You must be careful here.

231
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,880
The second and the third bar.

232
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,180
Be aware of the intensity.

233
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,380
And you have to listen to others.

234
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,570
You guys have to be harmonious.

235
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,820
After many years of being friends

236
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,090
I finally discovered...

237
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,620
You said we'd have a drink.

238
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,450
Drinks are disgusting and bitter. No good at all.

239
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,420
Great.

240
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,060
I should've sneaked some bottles

241
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,010
out from my dad.

242
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,570
People who get dumped in TV

243
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,620
are all drinking.

244
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,690
Why don't I have the guts to do it like them when I get dumped?

245
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,320
Lin Yang.

246
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,940
Do you think I'm a horrible man?

247
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
What aspects?

248
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,620
I'm serious.

249
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,010
Even though you are uglier than me,

250
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,410
and dumber.

251
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,170
you are not much worse.

252
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,210
I don't know if Ling Xiangqian likes you.

253
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,010
She likes a pussy like Chu Tiankuo.

254
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,180
It's normal for a general to lose a battle.

255
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,010
Please start all over.

256
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,130
Your quote is interesting.

257
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,300
What book is it from?

258
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,740
Xianjian.

259
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,690
No wonder it sounded so familiar.

260
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,180
You get dizzy from a coke?

261
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,060
No. No.

262
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,010
It's the first RPG that I played.

263
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,450
I was so envious of the characters.

264
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,420
I wished life could be like games.

265
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,820
You can save, and you can load.

266
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,980
I'd rather not.

267
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,130
Otherwise,

268
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,620
you'd keep saving in kindergarden.

269
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,490
Do you think I have to tolerate it?

270
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,330
I have to keep watching Qianqian and Chutiankuo

271
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,210
hang out and flirt with each other.

272
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,860
Of course not.

273
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,940
It will be early love if Ling Xiangqian and

274
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,130
Chu Tiankuo get together.

275
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,890
You can tell Mr. Pan that anonymously.

276
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,180
They'll have to break up.

277
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,420
That's not cool.

278
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,890
But if Ling Xiangqian doesn't like you,

279
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,730
she won't belong to you even after she breaks up.

280
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,260
What should I do then?

281
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,060
So the problem is not whether she is with somebody,

282
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,000
but whether she likes you.

283
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,860
What do you mean?

284
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,530
I mean that I don't have to care who Chen An is,

285
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,890
as long as Yu Zhouzhou like me.

286
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,500
Wow. Lin Yang.

287
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,180
A love expert.

288
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,980
Thanks. I taught myself.

289
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,330
We'll start tomorrow.

290
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,890
We'll rehearse 6:00 pm every night.

291
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,330
Remember to tell your families that.

292
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,450
OK.

293
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,530
If I leave school early tomorrow,

294
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,420
I'll go find you

295
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,860
and we can head there together.

296
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,180
My dad is on a business trip

297
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,890
so it's not very convenient for me in my house.

298
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,090
Don't come to me.

299
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,210
We can meet in the children's palace directly.

300
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,210
OK. See you in the children's palace.

301
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,640
Bye.

302
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,450
Bye.

303
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,790
[Chen Guofu: You have to show up for work in the company tomorrow.]

304
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,980
You read it so fast?

305
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,940
Yeah. Because the exam is coming.

306
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,570
You can come to me if you need anything else.

307
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,530
Good.

308
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,530
Oh, Xinrui.

309
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,570
Did you draw this?

310
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,180
Yeah, just scribbling.

311
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,060
I borrowed Slam Dunk from Miqiao before

312
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,980
so I thought I'd draw something.

313
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,260
Hey did you watch The National Competition?

314
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,690
Who's your favorite?

315
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,010
All of them.

316
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,010
I really think it's amazing.

317
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,680
very awesome.

318
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,740
Me too.

319
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,180
You draw so well.

320
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,380
I was so close to getting Mr. Pan to give me

321
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,530
Chen An's address so that

322
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,570
I could go to his home to learn from him.

323
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,650
Why didn't you ask for it?

324
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,690
Hey, leave it to me then.

325
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,690
Let me make a call.

326
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,570
It's put through.

327
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,650
Hello.

328
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,000
Is that Mr. Chen?

329
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,770
This is from China Post.

330
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,740
There is a parcel for you

331
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,820
but it fails to reach you after several attempts.

332
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,090
Could you please provide your address again?

333
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,300
The previous address?

334
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,980
Oh, it is Room 1624, Jiuxian Apartment.

335
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,130
The addressee is Mr. Chen.

336
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,060
It is from Beijing.

337
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,130
Please provide a new address for us.

338
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,980
Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay.

339
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,740
Goodbye.

340
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,180
Why did you give him my home address?

341
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,820
What about cosplaying Shaman King?

342
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,420
Veto. If we want to stun all

343
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,170
in the final association assessment,

344
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,210
we must take a master stroke.

345
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,530
How about Shaman King versus One Piece?

346
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,740
Mr. Pan won't like it for sure, okay?

347
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,060
Why don't we ask about

348
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,650
what show Mr. Pan's son prefers?

349
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,450
Good idea.

350
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,210
Great. This tough task is yours then.

351
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,860
Let's do Slam Dunk.

352
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,370
It's positive and energizing.

353
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,420
Emm, lovely idea.

354
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,980
Okay, let's pick Slam Dunk.

355
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,890
No problem.

356
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,380
Hi, Yu, you are here.

357
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,180
We are discussing the program for

358
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,380
the final association assessment.

359
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,860
Mi Qiao.

360
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,620
Thank you.

361
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,770
Do you like it?

362
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:36,980
By the way,

363
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,520
we are planning to do Slam Dunk this time.

364
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,450
How about joining us?

365
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,300
Emm.

366
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,650
Zhouzhou, would you like to join us?

367
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,890
To cosplay Haruko, okay? We need a heroine here.

368
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,450
You can do it.

369
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,380
I, I will play Rukawa Kaede. Right?

370
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,820
Yeah.

371
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,380
Who will be Sakuragi Hanamichi?

372
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,740
Sakuragi Hanamichi?

373
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:05,860
Freeze.

374
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,010
Promotion is not allowed inside. Go away.

375
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,450
I work here.

376
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,530
You work here?

377
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,500
For what company?

378
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,080
A real estate company.

379
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,420
What's the name, specifically?

380
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,620
The one on the 13th floor.

381
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,810
13th floor?

382
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,690
Little Duck?

383
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,090
Yeah, Little Duck.

384
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,690
That's a trading company. It's on the 10th floor.

385
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,130
Leave.

386
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,890
Sir, I'm here to look for someone.

387
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,090
Sure.

388
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,650
Let him come down to pick you up.

389
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,560
There is something wrong with my brother's legs.

390
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,320
He has got polio since he was a child,

391
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,500
but he still got into Beijing University.

392
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,060
Afterward, he has become a real estate agent.

393
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,860
Today he left something behind.

394
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,500
So, I must take him home.

395
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,860
Even the salesman likes to play the victim now.

396
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,500
Impressive.

397
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,530
Trying to sneak inside by all means.

398
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,330
I've been a security guard for over ten years.

399
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,300
You know what, my eyes

400
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,890
have never mistaken.

401
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,130
Leave now.

402
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,060
Majestic Park, rare and classic.

403
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,619
Hi. Thank you.

404
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,930
Majestic Park, rare and classic.

405
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,260
Majestic Park, rare and classic.

406
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,260
Hey, nice apartments.

407
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,410
If you are interested,

408
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,050
I can sign you up for this first.

409
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,260
No, I'm good.

410
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,530
Hello. Thank you.

411
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,140
I can't afford it, but my father can.

412
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,380
Give me your name card.

413
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,740
Sales Manager of Majestic Park Real Estate.

414
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,260
H'm, a manager is giving out leaflets.

415
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,330
Work must be done anyway.

416
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,020
That's true.

417
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,200
As a graduate of Beijing University,

418
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,730
aren't you feeling grieved?

419
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,660
Who are you?

420
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,330
It doesn't matter who I am.

421
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,260
I want to know who you are.

422
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,170
Hey, found you finally.

423
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,860
Sorry. Something is wrong with my son.

424
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,450
Let's go.

425
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,330
Where are you going?

426
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,740
The Cartoon Club has got a rehearsal.

427
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,620
I can't go today. I've got other plans.

428
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,290
Yu, we are performing tomorrow.

429
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,900
Ask Xin Rui to do it. Isn't she available?

430
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,560
No way. You must come.

431
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,410
I really can't.

432
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,540
Zhouzhou.

433
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,020
Yeah, I'm going. I'm going.

434
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,140
Humph.

435
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,810
Yu Zhouzhou, shame on you!

436
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,330
Where are you going after class every day?

437
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,380
You are so irresponsible.

438
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,410
Hey, what are you wearing today?

439
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,810
I think I look good in this suit.

440
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,650
How is it going?

441
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,900
How can you ask so directly?

442
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,810
Direct and neat.

443
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,780
If you hadn't stopped me,

444
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,980
I would have got the information out of him.

445
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,260
Easy. Easy. Easy.

446
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:50,900
Sit.

447
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,980
Don't gasp for breath. Here.

448
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,540
Have some of these.

449
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,930
What are you wearing?

450
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,260
What are you doing?

451
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,290
Did you meet Zhouzhou?

452
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,290
Nope.

453
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,050
It's been a few days.

454
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,450
Hey, Lin Yang.

455
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,450
Yu Zhouzhou has been acting so weirdly.

456
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,530
Aren't you curious?

457
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,410
No. I know whom she has been with.

458
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,210
Who?

459
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,740
A senior with whom she learned the cello at Children's Palace.

460
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,860
The guy who came to give a lecture last semester.

461
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,540
Prince Charming of Beijing University.

462
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,620
Prince Charming? No way.

463
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,450
He looks so plain.

464
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,260
Yeah.

465
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,690
What are you waiting for?

466
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,290
Adjust your tactics

467
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,680
and take Zhouzhou back now!

468
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,050
I'm not trying to get Zhouzhou,

469
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,320
but protecting her.

470
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,450
If anyone has ulterior motives about her,

471
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,930
I must finish him.

472
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,380
Especially you.

473
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,900
Benben, which side are you on?

474
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,020
I'm on your side anyway.

475
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,860
You are not on my side. Then...

476
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,540
Stop. Stop. Stop.

477
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,400
Unity. Unity first. Understand?

478
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,740
Now the case is that you two working together

479
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,620
are still no match for the guy of Beijing University.

480
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,380
Do you remember how Seiya and Ikki

481
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,660
defeated the Pope together?

482
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,290
Then I need to find out that guy's weakness first.

483
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,930
Yeah, you are right.

484
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,380
So what have you got?

485
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,980
The Prince Charming is giving out leaflets.

486
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,780
What kind of Prince Charming is that?

487
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,570
He is an ordinary man only.

488
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,780
Yeah, so I don't think Zhouzhou has feelings for him.

489
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,020
Oh right, Lin Yang.

490
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,740
You must come to the Cartoon Club activity tomorrow.

491
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,370
I've created an amazing opportunity

492
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,170
for you and Zhouzhou.

493
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,810
Are you sure Zhouzhou is going?

494
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,320
She has promised me anyway.

495
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,570
You mustn't stand me up. Did you hear me?

496
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,620
Rest assured. Wherever Zhouzhou is, there I am.

497
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,290
Lin Yang, cheer up.

498
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,090
Prince Charming of Beijing University is nothing at all.

499
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,210
In my eyes, you are the Prince Charming.

500
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,260
Mi Qiao.

501
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,020
How can you say that against your conscience?

502
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,160
Conscience?

503
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,410
Do I have it?

504
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,780
Our Cartoon Club, Roaming Cartoon Club,

505
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,020
is so awesome.

506
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,210
Mr. Pan.

507
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:15,930
You freaked me out.

508
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,380
What are you doing?

509
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,660
Mr. Pan, have you watched Slam Dunk?

510
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,010
A hot-blooded man's struggle.

511
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,330
It is very aligned with Zhenhua's school spirit.

512
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,020
Oh yeah?

513
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,660
Sure. Curiosity, diligence, integrity and positiveness.

514
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,260
But your hair is not of integrity at all.

515
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,090
Mr. Pan, rest assured.

516
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,560
I'm the character of the most integrity in the show. I mean it.

517
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,140
Hey, dude. Why are you hiding here?

518
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,140
Where is Zhouzhou?

519
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,330
I don't know. She just disappeared after class.

520
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,290
I still don't want to do this.

521
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,170
No way.

522
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,140
Mr. Pan is watching us.

523
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,020
I've asked someone to replace Zhouzhou's role.

524
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,850
Now you are up.

525
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,570
I'm only here for Zhouzhou.

526
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,410
Whatever. It's Zhouzhou's fault.

527
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,140
You must take the blame for her.

528
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,540
Wow. Lin Yang.

529
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,410
Look over here. Look over here.

530

Lin Yang.

531

 -Take a picture. Come on.

Well, Yu Zhouzhou.

540

I'm mad at you.

541
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,450
I've decided to unfriend you for one week.

542

543

I'm sorry.

544
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,380
What have you been doing after class?

545
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,380
What makes you abandon your wife and children?

546
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,210
Are you the wife or the child?

547
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,500
The child.

548
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,050
I promised my childhood orchestra teacher

549
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,210
to help him with the rehearsal,

550
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,290
so I can't go to the Cartoon Club.

551
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,290
Together with the guy of Beijing University?

552
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,140
You mean Chen An?

553
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,250
I don't know his name.

554
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,050
Do you have a picture of his?

555
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,620
Are you so curious about his look?

556
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,450
I'm just curious who

557
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,380
takes you away from me.

558
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,620
Okay. Okay. I'll take you to have a look.

559
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,440
You two look quite matched.

560
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,930
Come on.

561
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,740
You are mistaken.

562
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,380
Hey, didn't you say you never won any prize

563
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,020
when you were little?

564
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,500
Then why were you holding the Star Prize?

565
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,170
Yu Zhouzhou, you are such a liar!

566
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,020
It doesn't matter whether I won the prize.

567
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,050
It doesn't sound nice to the losers.

568
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,410
That's why I said it to you.

569
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,400
Don't talk to me that way.

570
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,450
I can't stand it.

571
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,930
Look at your eyes.

572
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,930
Tell me. Did you fall in love with him back then?

573
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,290
Every time I see Chen An's calm composure,

574
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,330
I feel that nothing is a big deal

575
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,900

whatever is intolerable to me.

578
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,200
So, since I was a child, I've kept telling myself

579
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,740
Yu Zhouzhou, you need to be like Chen An.

580
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,160
You need to be like Chen An.

It seems he's not only your crush.

583
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,210
He's much more than a crush to you.

584

Why are you here?

585
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,210
I…I just want to see you.

586
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,930
I haven't forgiven you yet.

587
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,660
I'm really sorry.

588
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,450
It's very lame for a gift.

589
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,290
I will give up sending you gifts next time.

590
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,860
I didn't say you can't give me gifts.

591
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,290
I have never given gifts to a girl before.

592
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,050

593

594

I thought, this is for someone you like.

That's why I…

596
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,620
Dumb-ass.

597
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,500
Do you still want a gift from a dumb-ass?

598

That's not what I want.

601

What you want is not important.

The important thing is, I know what is good for you.

It's funny you didn't care about all of these

Were you that desperate?

You have to tell Zhouzhou about it.

617

But it's too personal, isn't it?

618
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,900
What if Zhouzhou asked me how did I know?

619
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,020
Just tell her you ran into it.

620
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,050
It's fate.

621

Well, I'm gonna tell her.

622

I'm telling you,

Zhouzhou's feeling for him can't be that simple.

Okay, I'm gonna tell her everything.

626

Maybe you should think twice about it?

627

The thing is,

I think it's a little out of our hands now.
