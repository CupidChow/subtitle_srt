4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,580
Mi Qiao,

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,770
No matter how long you will live, ten years or twenty years,

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,530
ten days or twenty days,

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,290
while you're pursuing your dream in the following days,

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,820
I will always be with you.

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,610
We will help you realize it.

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,730
OK.

11
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,780
Zhouzhou, Mi Qiao.

12
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,980
Why did you cry so hard?

13
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,250
What happened?

14
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,840
Why are you always here?

15
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,210
This is the secret base for me and Zhouzhou.

16
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,980
Why did you have the nerve to exclude me?

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,490
Fine. I was the outsider.

18
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,490
I will leave you the place.

19
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,100
Don't listen to his bullshit.

20
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,810
I had thought that chatting with you

21
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,140
would make me feel better.

22
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,979
But I felt more awful after crying.

23
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,200
What is going on?

24
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,810
Lin Yang, I am telling you.

25
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,170
Here is the thing.

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,660
I have congenital heart disease.

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,979
Maybe I have to quit school.

28
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,890
If I am not in Zhen Hua anymore,

29
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,060
you should treat Zhouzhou better.

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,770
Did you hear me?

31
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,810
If you piss her off,

32
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,340
When I am in hospital, I will make a paper doll of your look,

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,340
and prick it every day.

34
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,420
Forget it, forget it.

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,140
What the hell is she talking?

36
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,300
She talked so much,

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,300
but which sentence coming out of her mouth told the truth?

38
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,860
She was telling the truth.

39
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,780
How could I be so careless?

40
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,700
I haven't found out this truth for such a long time.

41
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,650
There are many types of congenital heart disease.

42
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,730
Different type has different degree of illness.

43
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,340
Minor one is non-fetal.

44
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,700
But serious one may tell a different story.

45
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,450
What type of heart disease was Mi Qiao diagnosed?

46
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
I don't know. She didn't say anything.

47
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,700
That would be fine.

48
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,500
Mi Qiao is someone who likes to make a fuss

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
even though just being bit by a mosquito.

50
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,420
You don't understand her.

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,090
She is someone who will pretend to be hurt heavily

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,860
if you punch her.

53
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,290
But when she feel the real pain,

54
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,160
she would not say anything.

55
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,250
So

56
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,650
I really don't know which type of heart disease she has.

57
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,500
I know who knows the answer.

58
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,090
Who?

59
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,420
Your friend Benben.

60
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,250
He must know everything.

61
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,610
I am going to ask him.

62
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,130
Tomorrow is weekend.

63
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:03,980
I will go with you.

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,860
Alright.

67
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,700
you finished the bed-making test

68
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,780
15 seconds ahead of the time expected,

69
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,579
with a rather high quality.

70
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,530
Mu Rong Chenzhang,

71
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,340
You've passed

72
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,450
all the examination items.

73
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,890
Congratulations!

74
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,860
Thank you, Manager Lu.

75
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,450
There's still much for me to improve,

76
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,610
such as straightening up the angels of the bed sheet,

77
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
making sure that the side of bed sheet with stitches was placed face up

78
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,940
and the fold line was placed in the middle.

79
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,980
I didn't do a good job in these parts.

80
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,220
It doesn't matter. You are good enough.

81
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,250
You performed the best

82
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,340
among all interns.

83
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,700
Hotel management is a tough subject.

84
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,580
I didn't expect that you could

85
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,580
treat it with an earnest attitude.

86
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,529
We will put you on the top priority list of hiring.

87
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:18,810
This...

88
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,460
What's in your mind? Don‘t you want to work in our hotel?

89
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,620
This is not what I mean, Manager Lu.

90
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,860
Could I take it as a part-time job?

91
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,700
We are hiring assistant manager,

92
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,210
so working full-time is the basic requirement.

93
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,650
You might have to work overtime

94
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,020
if necessary.

95
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,090
I have a very important

96
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,010
sideline business.

97
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,930
What kind of sideline business it is?

98
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,330
It's kinda like catering business.

99
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:45,810
Alright.

100
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,330
I will give you a week to think about it.

101
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,010
If you think it over, you could call me.

102
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,020
We will welcome you anytime.

103
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:52,900
Thank you, Manager Lu.

104
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,370
Mu Rong Chenzhang, someone is looking for you in the lobby.

105
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,930
Why did you come here?

106
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,080
Every dog has its day.

107
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,050
You're right. If I hadn't attended Zhen Hua school...

108
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,170
If I had attended Zhen Hua school,

109
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,900
you wouldn't have been able to speak under the national flag.

110
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,900
Don't always have a row as soon as you met.

111
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,770
Did Mi Qiao tell you I am here?

112
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,330
It's your brother in yellow hair who told us.

113
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:18,850
Benben,

114
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,370
There's a secret between you and Mi Qiao.

115
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,180
I could understand that.

116
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,300
But this is an important thing.

117
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,460
How could you hide it from me?

118
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,740
I just started my internship a few days ago.

119
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,420
Sorry to forget to report it to you.

120
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,580
I didn't mention the internship.

121
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,700
I am talking about Mi Qiao.

122
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,300
Think again. Think about it!

123
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,580
What kind of big secret between you and Mi Qiao?

124
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,580
We didn't have any secret.

125
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,580
I am here to remind you again.

126
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,580
Has Mi Qiao told you everything?

127
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,210
She is unreliable!

128
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,250
Every day she reminded me of keeping the secret

129
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,420
and that don't be a traitor.

130
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,490
She is good, though.

131
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:55,980
She becomes Fu Zhigao,

132
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,930
and sold me out.

133
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,420
Look at him.

134
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,620
he confessed everything right after we asked him.

135
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:01,860
I told you that he must know the whole thing.

136
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,930
It's such a joke that he once spoke under the flag for he being so silly.

137
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,250
Zhouzhou...

138
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,210
Zhouzhou...Calm down.

139
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,860
Mi Qiao is the president of the Cartoon Club.

140
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,700
She is good at acting.

141
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,530
If it were not for me to debunk the whole thing by accident,

142
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
I wouldn't have known that much.

143
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,140
By the way, you know what kind of person Mi Qiao is.

144
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,610
She didn't want us to be concerned with her.

145
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,210
Do you think I will feel better for you saying that?

146
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,330
You tell me the truth.

147
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,860
How's she now?

148
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,460
Tell me!

149
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,370
Nothing serious.

150
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,300
She is living a happy life as we can see.

151
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,330
Skipped classes, attended live concert and...

152
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,420
She is living a hectic life like the electrocardiogram.

153
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,300
Rest assured.

154
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,010
Keep hiding the truth from me.

155
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,530
I won't believe in anything you‘ll say in the future.

156
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:45,860
Hello, uncle.

157
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,370
Alright. OK.

158
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,580
I will arrive soon.

159
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:50,900
What happened?

160
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,409
Mi Qiao felt sick again.

161
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,420
I have to help her go through the admission procedure.

162
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,810
In fact, she hasn't been living a good life in recent days.

163
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,180
She kept hiding her situation.

164
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,180
Please don't act so nervously.

165
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,810
I've already gotten accustomed to it.

166
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,620
I will speak with Director Pan tomorrow

167
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,810
and help you start with your schooling suspension procedure as soon as possible.

168
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,770
Are you silly?

169
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,530
If I suspend school, we won't be able to graduate together.

170
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,330
You're the only silly one here.

171
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,770
Which one is more important? Graduation or your physical health?

172
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,900
Ever since I was little,

173
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,370
hospital has become the place I constantly visited.

174
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,900
If I was as nervous as you guys do,

175
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,860
I would scare myself to death

176
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,520
before the heart attack.

177
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,050
Shut up. Don't say such ominous words.

178
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,420
Don't be so headstrong.

179
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,860
I read books of cardiology yesterday.

180
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,180
You must do the CRTD operation immediately.

181
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:38,620
That's right.

182
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,580
I won't do that.

183
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,700
Don't you know what kind of risks I might encounter during the operation?

184
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,370
What if I die on the operation table?

185
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,090
It's a small possibility event.

186
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,650
Possibility event?

187
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,900
Denominator is not the determinant of a number even though it is big.

188
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,300
What if I am the numerator?

189
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,770
Could you not...

190
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,620
What do you want to eat? We will bring it for you.

191
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,020
I have no appetite.

192
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,620
The hottest part of the summer is coming.

193
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,740
Why not eat dumpling?

194
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,020
Dumpling is good. I want to eat dumpling.

195
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,770
Who know how to make dumpling?

196
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,090
I don't know.

197
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,420
My stomach hurts...

198
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,580
everywhere hurts...my heart hurts and my waist also hurts...

199
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,860
Concerning the school ethos and school discipline,

200
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,300
we have a strict school management.

201
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,050
There should be a strict line between male students and female students.

202
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,980
Study atmosphere should be lively while sometimes should be seriously.

203
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:19,700
Good.

204
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,460
Good morning, teacher.

205
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,620
Zhen Hua deserves to be Zhen Hua.

206
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,860
The study atmosphere is good,

207
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,300
so is the school ethos.

208
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,810
Actually there're still a lot for us to improve our school..

209
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,580
We appreciate your suggestions.

210
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,810
On the other hand, we have a strict requirement

211
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,210
for our students.

212
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,299
We require them to stand upright and sit tight.

213
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,500
What are you doing?

214
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,380
Don't you see the leaders coming?

215
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,500
I'm sorry, Director Pan.

216
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,860
The next lesson is going to be an open class for three key classes.

217
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,890
School leaders will observe the class, so don't get things wrong.

218
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,130
Go ahead.

219
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,330
-This way, please.
 -For another thing...

220
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,090
Your eyes can't open. Stop rubbing your eye.

221
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,210
It will get more serious if you continue rubbing your eye.

222
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,740
Did the sand come out?

223
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,820
It's still there.

224
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,300
Do you guys know how to lift the eyelid?

225
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,570
If you don't, stop doing this.

226
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,050
Qianqian, Qianqian, did you feel better?

227
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,500
I've just paid a visit to the school doctor's.

228
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,300
But the school doctor wasn't in the office today.

229
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,420
How about cleaning your eye with cold water?

230
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,260
-Good idea. Use the cold water./N -Don't! stop doing this!

231
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,570
I heard that if sand gets into eye,

232
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,620
the worst-case scenario would be that one can be blind if the cornea gets damaged.

233
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,380
Don't do something stupid.

234
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,420
If so, I'd better take you to the hospital.

235
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,940
But school leaders are going to observe the class.

236
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,130
We still should go to the hospital.

237
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,860
You should go back to the class. I'll figure out the way by myself.

238
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,300
Qianqian.

239
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,690
Qianqian, please listen to me.

240
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,300
We should go to the hospital, should we?

241
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,740
Things would get worse if we continue to waste time.

242
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,500
What's wrong?

243
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,650
I've got sand in my eye.

244
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,130
Follow me. I have a solution.

245
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,620
Sit here.

246
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,060
Let me see.

247
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,130
I found it. Hold on.

248
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,970
Hold on a second.

249
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,940
How do you feel now?

250
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,080
I feel much better.

251
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,610
The open class is going to begin. Let's go back to the class.

252
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,370
Chu Tiankuo.

253
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,210
Could you stay with me for a while?

254
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,090
I don't know whether you have such a feeling that

255
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,090
when there's only one bar of power left,

256
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,690
you live your life gingerly

257
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,940
and feel powerless every day.

258
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,610
The once-mighty princess Qianqian

259
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,450
still sometimes feel powerless.

260
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,570
So

261
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,980
Could I borrow some power

262
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,010
from you,

263
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,530
my classmate Chu Tiankuo, who shines with boundless radiance.

264
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,860
I know that in all body parts

265
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,570
which express body language,

266
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,210
palm has the largest power.

267
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,060
Here, please come in. This is our classroom...

268
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:49,690
Director Pan,

269
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,450
we didn't lie to you.

270
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,450
She got sand in her eye.

271
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,180
You are still finding excuses to defend yourself!

272
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,380
Do you think I am a dupe？

273
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,650
Director Pan, we didn't lie to you.

274
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,370
Fine.

275
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,650
If you've got sand in  your eye,

276
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,820
why didn't you go to see the school doctor?

277
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,130
why didn't you come for me?

278
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,980
You've known that school leaders are going to visit our class,

279
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,570
and you have been preparing for

280
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,740
this open class for a week.

281
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,420
What's the relationship between both of you?

282
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,380
You dared to skip this important open class

283
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,330
and found a place with no other people

284
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,500
to pick the sand out of the eye.

285
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,420
Are you still trying to conceal your relationship?

286
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,300
I'll find out the answer on my own.

287
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,620
Both of you

288
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,420
call your parents

289
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,530
to my office.

290
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,330
Director Pan, even though you're going to punish me,

291
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,330
I won't confess the thing I haven't done.

292
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,570
How dare you talk back to me!

293
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,300
Ling Xiangqian, you're no longer the class monitor.

294
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,180
And you, you're no longer the president of the student union.

295
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,500
Director Pan,

296
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,370
you know this title can add marks to my college entrance examination.

297
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,130
I've been working so tirelessly to serve every student.

298
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,530
You're not supposed to

299
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,650
deprive me of this right due to this incident.

300
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,970
You've humiliated Zhen Hua!

301
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,380
How dare you still mention adding marks to the college entrance exam!

302
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,860
Fine. This is the deal.

303
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,300
Go back to the class.

304
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,450
Director Pan.

305
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,770
To be honest,

306
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,060
she asked me to stay with her.

307
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,570
I'm innocent.

308
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,370
Zhouzhou, calm down.

309
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,820
I'm going to testify for her.

310
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,560
I can prove that sand indeed got into her eye,

311
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,500
and I even attempted to help her.

312
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,180
Listen to me,

313
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,770
Director Pan is now outraged.

314
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,130
Besides, Ling Xiangqian and Chu Tiankuo

315
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,610
were found in the classroom of the Cartoon Club.

316
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,740
How could you prove this?

317
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,770
So should I watch her being treated unjustly

318
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,130
without doing anything?

319
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,380
You're already on the blacklist of Director Pan.

320
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,130
Talking to him at this juncture is equal to committing a suicide.

321
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,690
Is everything OK with Ling Xiangqian?

322
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,300
How is she now? You say a word!

323
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,130
I don't know. It's none of my business.

324
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,010
Director Pan,

325
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,450
you misunderstood her for what happened this afternoon.

326
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,850
I can testify for her.

327
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,090
Other students in her class can often testify for her.

328
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,330
It's a fact that she've got sand in her eye.

329
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,330
- I also went.../N -Stop mentioning it agian!

330
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,420
OK? Go home right now!

331
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,740
You can't punish Ling Xiangqian.

332
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,410
Why can't I punish her?

333
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,530
I have been in the same class with her since kindergarden.

334
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,500
I've known her so well.

335
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,300
She has a pure

336
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,650
and good personality.

337
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,210
I would never permit

338
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,440
anyone to tarnish her reputation.

339
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,570
Have you finished your words?

340
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,980
No, I haven't. Director Pan...

341
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,330
Director Pan, please listen to me...

342
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,620
Director Pan, Ling Xiangqian has had a pretty strict upbringing since she was little.

343
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,420
Her mother even quit her job

344
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,980
in order for her to attend the best university

345
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,820
to receive the best education.

346
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,620
Although she seemed to be superior in people's eyes,

347
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,380
she is very sensitive and

348
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,210
fragile deep inside her heart.

349
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,420
Her grade has already dropped.

350
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,980
If she gets punished

351
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,650
due to the thing she actually didn't do,

352
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,890
her whole life would be ruined.

353
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,260
You said she didn't do it?

354
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,420
No, she didn't do it!

355
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,330
They're not in that kind of relationship.

356
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,530
I saw what they did.

357
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,380
And they've already admitted.

358
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,420
You're still trying to argue with me!

359
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,620
I was too lenient with you guys!

360
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,650
Ling Xiangqian, do you think you can do whatever you want?

361
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,860
Do you think you're capable enough to do everything?

362
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,980
I've been wondering why your score kept falling!

363
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,890
Didn't you see that your classmates Xin Rui and Yu Zhouzhou

364
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,890
ranked the first in examination alternatively?

365
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,260
But how about you? Your grade hasn't been improved since it fell.

366
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,890
If Director Pan didn't call me,

367
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,420
I would have no idea about anything.

368
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,500
Mom, what did Director Pan tell you?

369
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,940
He told me everything!

370
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,330
You‘ll be recorded a demerit for punishment.

371
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,820
Your title as the class monitor will be dismissed.

372
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,300
And you're no longer entitled to the mark-adding policy of the college entrance examination.

373
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,500
But how about Chu Tiankuo?

374
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,300
He passed the buck to you!

375
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,180
I saw his parent today.

376
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,890
He looks petty.

377
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,210
A family that wouldn't educate the kid well.

378
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,740
Were you being possessed?

379
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,500
It's already like this,

380
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,570
so say whatever you want.

381
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,500
Aren’t you the victim here?

382
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,380
Do you ever know for these additional points,

383
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,770
how many connections I've made

384
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,010
and how many boots I‘ve licked?

385
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,940
For you to become a class leader,

386
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,500
I‘ve been networking all around.

387
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,450
Now it's all wasted!

388
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,740
It's just the additional points in Gaokao.

389
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,650
I can make up by completing one more major question.

390
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,820
Are you really able to?

391
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,260
Look at your ranking right now.

392
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,130
How can you be sure of that?

393
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,210
I owe you this, ok?

394
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,420
And I will pay you back!

395
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:31,980
You...

396
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,860
you owe me?

397
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,620
Isn't it your own future?

398
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,640
I'll make this clear, Ling Xiangqian.

399
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,330
You own no one but yourself.

400
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,450
Chu Tiankuo! Chu Tiankuo!

401
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,890
Chu Tiankuo! Chu Tiankuo, you get down here!

402
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,420
Chu Tiankuo!

403
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,210
Chu Tiankuo come out!

404
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,500
[The unlimited ocean is for fishes to leap, as the boundless sky is for birds to fly.]

405
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,490
Chu Tiankuo! Chu Tiankuo!

406
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,290
Come out!

407
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,450
Come out right now!

408
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,569
-Come out! /N -No manner at all.

409
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,450
We are not to be messed with.

410
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,930
How did he get into Zhen Hua？

411
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,450
Dad, can you  just leave me for a second?

412
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,980
Did Director Pan talk with you about this?

413
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,810
Rememeber what I said?

414
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,090
Whether it is Director Pan or Mr. Wu,

415
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,660
they will protect good students after all.

416
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,800
Zhen Hua always puts college enrollment rate first.

417
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,570
With good grades, you fear nothing.

418
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,620
Dad, can you please stop.

419
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,330
Jiang Chuan, Jiang Chuan?

420
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,860
Are you ok, Jiang Chuan?

421
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,570
You are here.

422
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,620
Come on,

423
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,260
have another shot with me.

424
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,160
You should stop drinking.

425
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,050
Are you drunk? This is non-alcoholic.

426
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,740
Lin Yang,

427
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,660
am I being useless

428
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,690
like a coward?

429
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,210
If I have insisted to bring Qianqian to the hospital,

430
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,260
none of these would happen, right?

431
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,170
Lin Yang, Director Pan said

432
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,860
Chu Tiankuo and she have admitted.

433
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,500
How can she just admitted？

434
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,540
I haven't admitted anything.

435
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,090
I haven't!

436
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,410
Jiang Chuan, stop drinking.

437
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,140
-Sing with me! /N -Jiang Chuan.

438
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,210
Just sing with me!

439
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,090
Mi Qiao is such a bold person,

440
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,570
but still afraid of operation.

441
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,020
I’m stumped.

442
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,170
I think she's just being pessimistic.

443
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,490
She needs some positive cues from us

444
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,290
to get through this.

445
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,810
Does it really going to work?

446
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,770
If you have faith, it will come true. Heard of that?

447
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,020
Faith can generate power

448
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,260
that to an extent

449
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,380
change the consequence of events.

450
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,090
That's why positive cues are crucial.

451
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,900
Be quick! I didn't ask you.

452
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,440
My grandma used to be pessimistic,

453
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,690
then our cues worked for her.

454
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,410
Follow me,

455
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,380
close your eyes and put your hands together.

456
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,620
Whatever I say,

457
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,410
you will follow in silence.

458
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,210
The almighty God,

459
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,780
all the luck of my life

460
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,690
is wrapped in this one dumpling

461
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,780
for Mi Qiao.

462
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,640
[Message: to Mi Qiao,  Leader Qiao,]

463
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,170
[Benben, Lin Yang and me put three pistachios in a dumpling.]

464
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,700
[Whoever eat it will have the the luck from three of us.]

465
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,010
[It will bring you luck! You must have it!]

466
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,900
You must remember this dumpling.

467
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,380
No one but Mi Qiao can have it.

468
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,660
Sure.

469
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,920
It looks like a fortune cookie.

470
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,210
So obvious.

471
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,010
Trust my vision.

472
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,170
If you don't pick it,

473
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,090
I won't pick it.

474
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,530
Later we will play dumb.

475
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,850
Then Mi Qiao won't know it's our plan.

476
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,050
Come here.

477
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,900
Why are you here with dumplings?

478
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,540
Did you not receive the text I just sent?

479
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,570
My phone was charging, so I missed it. What did you say?

480
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,620
This time, we...

481
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,090
Benben,

482
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,930
She will find out when she eat it.

483
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,450
Okay.

484
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,410
What are you whispering？

485
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,250
Let me tell you

486
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,130
about how amazing the filling

487
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,410
of the dumpling is.

488
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,090
It's minced celery and beef.

489
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,210
You will always remember that fantastic taste.

490
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,380
What's wrong?

491
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,020
I hate celery.

492
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,380
Mi Qiao, it's the beginning of dog days.

493
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,020
You never heard of "dumplings for the first dog day and noodles for the second"?

494
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,260
Zhouzhou and me were making this

495
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,280
for the whole afternoon.

496
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,690
You really don't want to try?

497
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,570
Wait a second.

498
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,450
Zhouzhou and me made these.

499
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,780
Anything to do with you?

500
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,770
I packed them

501
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,020
and I made the skins

502
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,860
I...

503
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,660
Look at the shape of it.

504
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,450
I lost appetite already.

505
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,410
Great that you lost it.

506
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,660
It's not even enough for three of us.

507
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,410
Come on, we three can take them all.

508
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,170
Come, it's so yummy!

509
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,860
Great!

510
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,020
Really good!

511
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,540
Yummy!

512
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,740
Don't exaggerate.

513
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:26,540
No, I mean it.

514
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,330
Hello?

515
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,250
Wait for me. I will be there soon.

516
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,290
Sorry,

517
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,170
there's something wrong with Jiang Chuan.

518
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,050
I really need to go.

519
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,260
Is everything alright?

520
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,900
Ling Yang, you forget the bag.

521
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:51,620
Thanks.

522
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,570
What happen to Jiang Chuan?

523
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,620
Because of Ling Xiangqiang,

524
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,090
Jiang Chuan has been in a bad mood.

525
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,380
I worried about him seriously,

526
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,170
so I have to go.

527
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
Can you talk to him?

528
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
It has been chaotic recently.

529
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,620
I don't want anything else to happen.

530
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,920
Wait a second.

531
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,140
We made dumplings for four.

532
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,440
You and Mi Qiao are not going to eat any more.

533
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,810
What do we do with such a large batch?

534
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,260
I'm counting on you.

535
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,380
You said it's yummy

536
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,290
so you can have more.

537
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,540
Bye.

538
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,780
Hey, come back!

539
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,500
Let's go.

540
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,260
Just go.

541
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,620
Look at the gravy!

542
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,200
I've never had dumplings so delicious.

543
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,140
If you don't eat now., there will be none left.

544
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,500
You're exaggerating.

545
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,140
Have you been starved for ages?

546
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,660
The elderly said:

547
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,380
"dumplings on the first dog day

548
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,740
keeps you away from prickly heat."

549
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,930
You are making it up

550
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,400
Isn't it "dumplings on the winter solstice day

551
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,810
keeps you aways from frostbite"?

552
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,380
Almost the same.

553
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,090
Should we keep a few

554
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:54,900
for your dinner?

555
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,930
Don't! It will not be tasty when it's cold.

556
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,570
Look at him,

557
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,660
so starving that he can't stop eating.

558
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,900
So it's up to you.

559
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,500
You can have all the prickly heat and frostbite.

560
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,740
I'll leave them to you.

561
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,170
Quick.

562
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,540
I'm too full.

563
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,410
I've had fifty dumplings.

564
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,780
I cannot...be happier!

565
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,330
I am not even half-full.

566
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,260
Zhouzhou, stop.

567
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,040
Leave the rest to me.

568
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,210
Mi!

569
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,290
Everyone is here.

570
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,620
The start of dog days is perfect for dumplings.

571
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,690
-Don't! /N -Don't!

572
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,330
Don't be afraid. I won't take all.

573
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,690
I can always buy more if it's not enough.

574
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,980
Such a crowd here.

575
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,090
Mi, come over with me.

576
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,780
To play chess? On my way.

577
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,410
Enjoy your mea. I will be back.

578
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,290
Dad, just go.

579
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,570
The half-full should continue.

580
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,020
I can help you.

581
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:57,570
Leave them to me.

582
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,620
Director, you can speak frankly with me.

583
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,810
How is Mi Qiao's condition?

584
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:06,930
No need to rush.

585
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,860
DCM usually shows repeated conditions.

586
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,260
She must stay hospitalised for a while.

587
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,890
It's better if you can talk her into CRTD.

588
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,930
But, it's almost the final exam.

589
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,450
Mi, these years,

590
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,900
Mi Qiao has been hopitalized more often.

591
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,210
She is not fit enough for attending school.

592
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,410
I suggest that she should stop schooling immediately.

593
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,780
Benben, I haven't had enough.

594
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,290
Can I have this one?

595
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,050
Nonsense.

596
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,740
You've had a lot.

597
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
But I want more.

598
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,620
No! Be a gentleman, okay?

599
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,930
Not for this dumpling.

600
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,140
Because it's so tasty.

601
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,980
No, Benben!

602
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:10,920
Stop fighting!

603
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,900
Since it's the last one,

604
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,860
rock-paper-scissors and the winner takes it.

605
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:16,860
Let's play.

606
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,170
Rock-paper-scissors!

607
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,690
Didn't see this coming, did you?

608
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,290
"The mantis preying on a cicada is unaware of the oriole behind it."

609
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,260
Thanks for letting me to have the last one.

610
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,090
There's something in it.

611
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,780
Pistachios!

612
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,020
Symbol of luck?

613
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,450
I got it.

614
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,540
You were fighting

615
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,090
for pistachios.

616
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,900
You two are so unlucky.

617
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,020
I only ate two

618
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,380
and got the lucky one.

619
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,330
So silly you are.

620
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,170
What's wrong? Why are you leaving?

621
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,410
Take these tablets to help you digest.

622
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,050
Over sixty dumplings.

623
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,500
My stomach is going to explode.

624
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,290
Such a good actor you are.

625
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,020
Same to you.

626
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,800
How do you know Mi Qiao would eventually

627
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,170
have that dumpling?

628
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,810
Because I know her well.

629
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,090
Previously, I always thought

630
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,540
that I can do anythign for Mi Qiao.

631
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,410
Yet, I just realised

632
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,410
that I can do nothing.

633
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,090
Zhouzhou, you've being doing great.

634
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,740
The almighty god must understand it.

635
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,860
Fortunately, Mi Qiao finally ate that dumpling.

636
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,690
I hope that she'll feel lucky and

637
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,170
be brave to have the surgery.

638
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,680
If Mi Qiao can get better,

639
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,770
it's worth to feel that I'm about to burst.

640
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,670
[Zhouzhou: Leader Qiao,
Benben, Lin Yang and I put three pistachios in a dumpling.]

641
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,970
[The person who eats it will have all of our good luck.]

642
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,230
[This really works! You have to eat it!]

643
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,320
Director, I thought we've agreed that

644
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,050
Mi Qiao won't take a gap year

645
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,090
until she has to.

646
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,620
But we're in this situation now.

647
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,140
Mr. Mi, how is it going?

648
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,140
How many games did you win the director today?

649
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,540
I'm the clear winner.

650
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,500
I thrashed him and

651
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,740
won all the games.

652
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,930
Awesome!

653
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,540
Of course.

654
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,330
You're so smart.

655
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,780
Your dad is definitely smarter than you.

656
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,500
Alright, I'll turn off the light. You go to sleep first.

657
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,540
Dad, do you have anything to tell me?

658
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,810
No.

659
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,660
I have something to tell you.

660
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,780
What?

661
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,140
I want to take a year off from school.

662
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,690
Why?

663
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,330
It's ok to let my classmates study first.

664
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,980
With the high IQ inherited from you,

665
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,860
I can catch up with them anyway.

666
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,020
What about CRTD?

667
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,900
If the doctor thinks I should do it, I'll do it.

668
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,210
It's settled.

669
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,050
This is the gap year file.

670
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,050
Take care of yourself.

671
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,290
Director, thank you.

672
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,210
Thank you, director.

673
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,260
Thank you? That's it?

674
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,050
Come here.

675
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,210
You've been a troublemaker

676
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,900
all the time.

677
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,330
For several times, I wished you could leave the school.

678
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,450
Suddenly, you're going to take a gap year.

679
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,050
I even feel a bit sad.

680
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,140
Director Pan, I was naughty before.

681
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,260
I always got you in trouble.

682
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,930
When I come back, I'll change my behavior and

683
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,810
show you a different Mi Qiao.

684
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,140
I want you to be

685
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,020
exactly the same as you are now.

686
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,280
Don't replace and lose the original Mi Qiao.

687
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,210
I thought I could leave

688
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,410
Zhen Hua High School happily.

689
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,210
I don't...I don't expect that...

690
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,450
Well. Take care of yourself and come back soon.

691
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,010
I won't get used to the life

692
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,170
without the troubles you bring.

693
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,140
Go.

694
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,450
Director, see you.

695
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,560
By the way, director Pan,

696
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,860
I will leave the peach wood sword for you.

697
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,090
It can be used for exorcism and scratching.

698
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:39,570
Bye.

699
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:41,660
Bye.

700
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,660
Qiao, when will you be back?

701
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,090
Don't cry.

702
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,930
We'll visit you after the exam.

703
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,620
Ok. Come to see me and we can play together.

704
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,290
What's wrong with you?

705
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,290
Leader Qiao just retreat for a while.

706
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,570
She's not going to leave us forever.

707
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,980
That's right.
I'm now in the cool down time before the ultimate skill.

708
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,780
You guys just wait for me to come back.

709
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:14,930
And you.

710
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,380
Alright, see you guys.

711
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:30,140
-Bye.
-Bye.

712
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:53,980
Guys,

713
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,050
all good things must come to an end.

714
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,140
Cheer up! Cheer up! Ok?

715
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,900
Come on. Give me five!

716
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,020
High five!

717
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:03,860
Yeah!

718
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
Come on.

719
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,210
Don't be like this.

720
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,330
Cheers!

721
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,690
That being said though,

722
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,660
you're really going to leave this time.

723
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,500
How can we be happy?

724
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,980
Fei, what's wrong with you?

725
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,200
Boss was recruited as an exception this time.

726
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,610
He is now a trainee lobby assistant manager in a hotel.

727
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,860
This is a good thing. We should be happy.

728
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,540
Look at him. Like a sissy.

729
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,090
You're macho.

730
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,440
Stop. How do you know I'm in a hotle?

731
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,290
The whole vocational high school knows that.

732
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,140
In the hotel management program,

733
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,980
you're the only one who is employed.

734
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,540
Really?

735
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,330
Of course.

736
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,410
Cheers! Wish you guys also have a great future!

737
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,650
Thank you, boss.

738
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,810
By the way, I wrote a poem last night.

739
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,020
Let me read it out for you.

740
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,970
From Dongwu to...

741
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,500
The sea of clouds and the end of the world...

742
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,330
You can't recognize the poem you wrote.

743
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Don't interrupt me.

744
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,810
I can remember the last two sentences.

745
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,290
Go ahead.

746
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,370
Tonight, I held a lantern to send you away.

747
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,820
There always has been a reason to drink.

748
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,020
Cheers!

749
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,100
-Wonderful poem!
-Great!

750
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,340
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

751
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,880
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

752
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,280
[Today's special menu
friendship]

753
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,850
Hello, Mr. Lu, this is Murong Chenzhang.

754
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,300
Yes. I've thought it through.

755
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,929
Sorry. I can't accept the offer.

756
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,690
Because I have a more important thing to do.

757
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,210
Yes. I've decided.

758
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:45,060
Thanks for your recognition. Bye.

759
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,690
Come on. Let's drink.

760
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:53,929
Let's drink.

761
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,060
-Come on.
-Cheers!

762
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,410
Let's go. We've worked hard for a yaer.

763
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,250
There's nothing left for you.

764
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,740
Let's calculate how much we earned.

765
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,780
You two can spilt the money.

766
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,980
I tell you the number. You do the calculation.

767
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:18,530
Ok.

768
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,210
Purchasing costed 6,800 yuan.

769
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,210
6,800.

770
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:28,260
The taxes we paid is 960 yuan.

771
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,260
960.

772
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,740
The first half of the year was the low season.
We earned 4,500 yuan.

773
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,600
4,500.

774
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,020
The next half was the peak season.
We made 2,200 yuan.

775
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,170
That's all?

776
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,650
Yes.

777
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,890
How can the profit in the peak season
be less than in the low season?

778
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,580
After knowing each other,

779
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,020
they came to eat and drink without paying.

780
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,850
Just forget about

781
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,850
the free food and drinks they had.

782
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,060
Even for beer takeaway,

783
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,210
they didn't return bottles.

784
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,610
Negative profit.

785
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,370
Negative? Did we lose money?

786
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,020
We lost money?

787
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,340
That'll be complicated.

788
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,450
If profitable, I won't take any money.

789
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,650
But for the loss...

790
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,450
Right. You know.

791
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,880
Let's go back.

792
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,850
Boss,

793
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,210
did you know at first that we would lose?

794
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,580
So, you set a trap for us.

795
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,890
I didn't.

796
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,340
Boss, you can't be like this.

797
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,500
For our barbecue stall,

798
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,090
you only paid for a grill.

799
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,650
We covered all the rest.

800
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,210
Yes.

801
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,850
And then you want us to compensate for the loss.

802
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,540
-You know what?
-Think about it.

803
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,580
Each of us make up for 25% of the loss.

804
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,450
You take 50%.

805
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,210
Yes.

806
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:24,980
Deal.

807
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,020
-I think it's reasonable.
-No way.

808
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,090
Done.

809
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,740
Let's go back and discuss later.

810
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,580
-It's decided.
-No way.

811
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,170
Let's go.

812
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,160
Why not?
