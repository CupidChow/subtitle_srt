00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,620
OK

174
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,900
But we have to wait until we check the laboratory test report

175
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,210
-OK 
 -Alright

176
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,800
I know I know

177
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,930
-Let's go 
 -Let me carry it

178
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:25,980
Let's go

179
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,210
Ling Xiangqian is not here

180
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,970
Leader Mi Qiao is not here

181
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,580
Just talk to me if you need help

182
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,050
What's wrong with Mi Qiao

183
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,210
I heard that she was alone in the club yesterday

184
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,490
She asked for a leave

185
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,180
She had asked for a leave for many times recently

186
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:50,490
Alright

187
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,580
So, Animation Club is not closed

188
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,810
But it has combined with Games Club and Travel Club in the senior grade 1

189
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,690
Temporarily we share the classroom of the Animation Club

190
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,460
What? Cease to exist except in name

191
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,740
What's the difference to close up

192
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,700
You guys had club events yesterday

193
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,050
I know

194
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,420
Mi Qiao takes it to heart

195
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,180
So I tried to persuade the director Pan

196
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,650
At lease it keeps the name

197
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,090
I know

198
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,700
Leader Qiao it's my fault, please punish me

199
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,250
I am tired, bye

200
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,250
You look energetic, sleep enough?

201
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,020
What's wrong?

202
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:32,940
It's alright

203
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,860
OK, then I will go back

204
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,620
Ben Ben can stay here with you

205
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:38,980
OK

206
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,450
I will be relieved if he is here

207
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,650
OK, dad, go home and have a rest

208
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,650
You didn't sleep well

209
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,420
OK

210
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,300
I am also relieved when he is here

211
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,330
Bye Sir

212
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,130
Bye Dad

213
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,410
How could you two big guys being so slow

214
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,620
There is a long queue

215
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,980
Let me see the time of concert

216
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,180
Let's go in a while

217
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,980
No, I promised your dad to wait

218
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,620
until your laboratory test result comes out

219
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,180
You are a traitor. You betrayed too

220
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,940
Traitor? Too?

221
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,260
I just received a call

222
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,380
Our Animation Club has been combined with two small clubs in grade 1

223
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,740
As the Club leader, I can do nothing except staying here

224
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,500
And now you are unified with my dad

225
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
How could it be called unified with him

226
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,500
You bought the tickets. We can't ask for refund

227
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,300
What if we couldn't buy the tickets tomorrow

228
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,130
or couldn't arrive on time

229
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,820
What if my dad knew it

230
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,770
My life has been wasted by you

231
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,770
Your dad, what do you mean?

232
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,330
My dad is always worried about me

233
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,740
If he knows that it is crowded in the concert

234
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,860
he would not allow me to go

235
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,010
Don't worry

236
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,690
I will make it once I promised you

237
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,010
I will persuade your dad

238
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,010
And you will go to the concert

239
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,300
Really?

240
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,050
Was the wind too strong to blow you

241
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,420
laughing like an idiot

242
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,500
I am happy

243
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,330
Why

244
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,740
You don't know

245
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,060
I was on the back of the canteen

246
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,890
and have followed you for many times

247
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:02,890
I know

248
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:03,980
You know?

249
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,770
I could see you even in 2 kilometers away

250
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,890
Your face showed you were sneaking

251
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,330
Anyway I was thinking that

252
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,620
we ate together in the canteen

253
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,180
My pal Lin, can you dream bigger

254
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,210
At least it is what I think about now

255
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,530
At least? Now?

256
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,260
Stop talking nonsense. What do you want to eat?

257
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,200
Madam, I'd like a Sweet, Sour Pork Tenderloin and a Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs

258
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,210
and Sugar with Tomato

259
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,500
-OK 
 -That's too sweet

260
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,300
How did you think of giving me such a gift

261
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,530
It just happened when I saw you

262
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,640
watching that news of army retirement

263
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,770
You were sad like a little girl

264
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,300
I wanted to ask you if you like it

265
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,770
But you left before I could ask

266
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,860
Sorry, I was just

267
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,940
Being angry about me?

268
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,940
No No

269
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,260
How could I be angry about you

270
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,770
I just saw that you liked it so much

271
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,250
And I thought

272
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,740
I could send you a book about him

273
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
And I searched a lot

274
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,570
Only to find out an autobiography which was just published

275
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,620
And I was free then

276
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,300
So I just translated it conveniently

277
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,570
The whole book! Translated conveniently

278
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,000
I pissed Mi Qiao off because of this

279
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,740
Mi Qiao

280
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,640
In order to keep the Animation Club

281
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,330
Mi Qiao organized an event

282
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,530
But no one was there

283
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,740
I was working on translating the whole week

284
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,940
I didn't help her

285
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,300
And she asked for a leave today

286
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,060
She didn't answer my phone

287
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,130
Then let's help her

288
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,500
when she comes back

289
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,380
Let us

290
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,180
When did you become so warm-hearted

291
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,650
Your business is my business

292
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,450
I am always like that

293
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,060
Can you do me a favor?

294
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,330
It is just in a sudden

295
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,820
Go running after eating can cause

296
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,650
gastroptosis

297
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,450
Not everyone eats as much as you do

298
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,210
You almost lick the dish

299
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,330
We can't waste any food

300
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,420
The PE General Exam is around the corner

301
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,740
I am so worried about the long-distance running

302
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,370
I have to hurry up and practice

303
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,420
Practice now, isn't it too late?

304
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,740
Haven't you heard that saying

305
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,450
Trying to sharpen your spear up at the last moment before the battle won't get you a sharp spear, but it will be shiny at least, which is better than nothing

306
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,850
You are just like Mi Qiao

307
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,820
talkative and persuasive

308
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,980
Look how do I surpass you

309
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,010
Gastroptosis

310
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,860
I told you don't eat that much

311
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,740
No

312
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,420
No I can't do it

313
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,330
You are weak

314
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,690
Was the sprint more than 100 meters?

315
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,740
Don't sit down after running. Walk slowly

316
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,890
Why are you laughing

317
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,080
Nothing

318
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,820
Are you laughing at me because I can't run further

319
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,530
No

320
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,210
Don't we look like

321
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,450
a couple in an old age by walking like this

322
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,650
Give me a break

323
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,300
I have to sit for a while

324
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,560
You can't be like this

325
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,570
How about this

326
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,380
I will accompany you to practice long-distance running every morning, afternoon and evening

327
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,010
from now till the Physical Exam

328
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,490
I take back my words. You don't need to help me to practice

329
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,770
Let me just fail it

330
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,120
Slacking off, aren't you?

331
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,570
The exam is important

332
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,090
If you failed it

333
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,860
you would not be able to graduate

334
00:12:59,380 --> 00:12:59,820
Go on

335
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,380
You are taking the opportunity to retaliate

336
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,420
It's alright, alright, you can leave hospital now

337
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,260
Bullshit

338
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,010
It's so late

339
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,940
And we can't buy the tickets now

340
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,820
How could we go to the concert?

341
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,300
Wanna go for a road trip?

342
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,740
A road trip?

343
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,450
Right, I have a motorcycle

344
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,330
Do you mean the one you stole from your dad?

345
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,570
And he beat you for this

346
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,690
Don't worry about him. He can't defeat me

347
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,500
That's great

348
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,300
I have been craving for this for a long time

349
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,010
And how could you deal with your school classes and your father?

350
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,740
It's easy in terms of school

351
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,210
I will just say that I am still unwell

352
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,690
Teachers know my situation anyway

353
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,570
They won't ask too much

354
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,330
My dad

355
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,490
Just leave him a message

356
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,060
We must do it before telling him in such a case

357
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,560
Actually your dad

358
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,420
I am telling you

359
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,180
Don't tell my dad in any case

360
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,180
Keep the secret. You hear me?

361
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,940
OK OK OK, keep the secret

362
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,300
After I finished translating the autobiography of Reggie Miller

363
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,570
I was very happy

364
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,820
Of course you were

365
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,940
You translated it for me

366
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,620
Lin, how could you be so shameless

367
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,060
Yes I am, and I can be even more than that

368
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,180
When I finished reading

369
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,980
I know why you like him

370
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:05,890
Right

371
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,770
And he was so charming in the competition

372
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,980
No matter who was his competitor

373
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,410
he could always do better than others

374
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,420
I remember you told me a sentence before

375
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,690
The real heroism

376
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,210
is the one who has understood the essence of life

377
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,690
and still loves life

378
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,860
I told you the sentence when we studied together

379
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,210
after my Senior High School Entrance Examination, didn't I?

380
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,530
You still remember

381
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,010
I know that after I read the book

382
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,060
Miller had problems with his legs

383
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,860
He had to rely on leg supports to walk

384
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,450
That's why he was so withdrawn

385
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,050
That was why he grew up to be such an extraordinary person

386
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,980
The real version of Forrest Gump

387
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,890
In the translated version I gave you

388
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,130
there is a paragraph later that I added by checking the information myself

389
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,010
Which one?

390
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
You should understand

391
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,420
I don't mean to refuse to accept God

392
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,380
I just don’t accept this world created by God

393
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,620
I am not to agree to accept it

394
00:14:59,170 --> 00:14:59,980
That's great

395
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,210
Derivative work

396
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,740
Lin Yang

397
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,650
Do you know why I trust Chen An that much?

398
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,740
When I graduated from elementary school

399
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,450
It was in this park

400
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,980
Brother Chen An taught me the protagonist game

401
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,330
Protagonist game

402
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,570
It's like imagining yourself as a hero who can call the wind and call the rain

403
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,860
Even if you are seriously injured and vomit blood at the mouth

404
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,420
There will be the day when you success

405
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,090
I relied on this to persevere at that time

406
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,420
So it was all because of this

407
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,820
You got such good grades at that time

408
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,860
You gave up on the top junior high school and went to the thirteenth high school

409
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,860
What is Miller's autobiography called?

410
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,820
I Love Being the Enemy

411
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,330
Right

412
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,450
I couldn't accept the world

413
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,050
which I was living in at that time

414
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,090
When I was young, because of my family stuffs

415
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,210
I suffered a lot

416
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,530
Just because of this protagonist game

417
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,740
It offered me a way

418
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,730
a reason to cheer up

419
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,930
So since you didn't like this world

420
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,980
And didn't want to accept it

421
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,650
Then you just created another one for yourself

422
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,530
And imagined to fight to create a new way in this world

423
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,380
So I kept fighting to Zhen Hua High School

424
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,530
If

425
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,890
I mean if

426
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,570
you chose to study in the same junior school as mine

427
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,500
Maybe

428
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,690
Maybe nothing would change

429
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,420
Maybe I would stay frustrated

430
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,260
It would be

431
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,740
But  it’s useless to think about it now

432
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,860
At least all these sufferings have gone

433
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,260
But Zhou zhou, you are really into imagination

434
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,530
The storyline was just nonsense

435
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,420
It may be only you who can do it seriously

436
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,420
In fact, this protagonist game

437
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,810
not only helps me

438
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,570
but also helps another one

439
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,530
Who is that?

440
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,650
(Xin Rui, believe in yourself, sooner or later you will be as good as them)

441
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,640
[Xin Rui, believe in yourself, sooner or later you will be as good as them]

442
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,530
At that time she was bullied, I thought her life was too miserable

443
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,180
Her condition looked worrying

444
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,020
So I told her this protagonist game

445
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,140
I thought with a purpose

446
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,540
life can be easier

447
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,780
That is why in just one semester

448
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,250
she made such amazing progress

449
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,210
Didn't you have a crush on her?

450
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,569
I had a crush on her?

451
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,210
Didn’t you even give the CD you burned by yourself to her?

452
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,810
Why are you laughing?

453
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,930
I was wondering why you seemed so irritated at that time

454
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,260
It was because of this CD

455
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,140
No, I wasn't. I just happened to ask

456
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,050
I didn't realize you also care about me

457
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,330
Shame on you!

458
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,660
Zhouzhou

459
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,140
What's up?

460
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,620
Actually, if you have to fight against the whole world

461
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,620
I will choose to stand by your side

462
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,400
Thank you

463
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,770
Right, remember to get up early tomorrow, we should go jogging

464
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,140
Then I would rather you don't stand by my side

465
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,570
I have done the math

466
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,490
if we go at a regular speed

467
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,690
we only need to leave half a day in advance to go to the concert

468
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,450
Half a day

469
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,810
We can ride through this way

470
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,660
There is a gas station here

471
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,050
and here we can have a rest

472
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,140
and have something to eat

473
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,020
That is really good

474
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,260
I don't know you are just like Zhang Fei doing his embroidery work

475
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,500
What is that mean?

476
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,450
I'm complimenting you that although you seem slapdash, you actually do things carefully

477
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,380
That's true, I am adept with both the pen and the sword

478
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,540
Let's see what you have prepared

479
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,740
Let me show you

480
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,330
Oh no, we are going to a concert

481
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,860
not escape from famine

482
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,900
You have no idea

483
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,560
We have to prepare for everything

484
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,930
Then what's this for?

485
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:41,930
You see

486
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,540
When I combined it with this flashlight

487
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,570
does it look like a cross?

488
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,800
If we come across zombies along the way

489
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,210
we have to use cross to defend against them

490
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,660
Then this is for casting out Satan

491
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,450
Very good, you are already on the way

492
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,980
The child is worthy to be taught

493
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,450
Come on, we are to see Eason Chan

494
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,970
not to Resident Evil

495
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:05,780
I don't care

496
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,160
whether they are ghosts or zombies

497
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,810
they can't stop me from meeting Eason

498
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,260
Why you like him so much?

499
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,410
The doctor gives me power

500
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:14,980
Doctor?

501
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,410
It's a nick name for Eason

502
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,330
Sometimes I really don't understand girls like you who worship stars

503
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,330
I remember the day I started to love Eason

504
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,450
It was when I first came out of the emergency room

505
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,260
My dad was freaked out

506
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,450
he had stayed up all night

507
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,380
The moment I came out of the emergency room

508
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,690
I saw him crying for the first time

509
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,210
I never thought about a man can cry like this

510
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,690
I told him to go home and get some sleep

511
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,980
He insisted on staying with me

512
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,450
Mi Qiao! Mi Qiao

513
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,040
What?

514
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,290
Everything is fine, it's just I woke up and didn't see you

515
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,570
I was too nervous

516
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,900
I hope I didn't scare you

517
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,210
No, you didn't

518
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,020
During those days, I lay on the bed

519
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,860
and I hated myself

520
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,380
I found myself so annoying

521
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,690
Why I was sick

522
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,410
Why I made my dad worry

523
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,560
And my disease is hard to treat

524
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,930
I didn't know how long my dad had to be in this panic

525
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,090
At that time, I even thought

526
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,210
I might as well committed suicide

527
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,690
Because waiting for death is the most tormenting

528
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,660
I even laughed when I saw the first line

529
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,980
It felt like talking about me

530
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,020
The song is mainly about

531
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,330
a walk-on who seeks joy amidst sorrow

532
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,330
the tone is also very cheerful

533
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,490
After listening to it

534
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,410
my mood has improved a lot

535
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,170
What happened then?

536
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,260
Then

537
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,050
I decided to enjoy my life

538
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,930
This world is so wonderful

539
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,410
with so many beautiful songs

540
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,690
and so many delicious food

541
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,170
Why am I wasting time

542
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,380
to worry about something that will inevitably come

543
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:24,980
That simple?

544
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,740
Or what?

545
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,450
For example, you get some enlightment

546
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,260
and realize life is just like a show. You know just to sublimate the story

547
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,450
I don't know about sublimation

548
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,500
I just think life is wonderful

549
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,330
It's worthwhile to live another day

550
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,410
I truly believed so

551
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,380
and that is also what I told my dad

552
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,660
So what did your dad say?

553
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,020
He thought this was great

554
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,410
He felt relieved I can think like this

555
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,890
It seems that our trip

556
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,570
is also a pilgrimage

557
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,690

It's worthwhile to live another day

563

There is no time to be sad

564
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,740
I should hurry up. Eat more food and play more

565
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,660
I feel relieved if you really think so

566
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,620
So if one day I am dead

567
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,970
You shouldn't feel sad

568
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,280
You see I have really took an advantage

569
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,930
Right?

570
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,050
Sure, I won't feel sad

675
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,450
Lyrics?

676
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,680
This song is talking about me

677
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,740
I wrote these lyrics

678
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,020
You wrote it?

679
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:30,620
Yeah

680
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,330
Lei, you are quite well-educated

681
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,260
Oh no, not that well-educated

682
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,740
I am just the porter of culture

683
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,050
The most interesting thing while

684
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,740
you are traveling, do you know what it is?

685
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,290
What?

686
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,690
You see, although I have been to many places

687
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,050
and have seen a lot of beautiful sceneries

688
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,660
But I think the most interesting thing

689
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,570
is about women

690
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,140
Like our sister here

691
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,980
Oh no, I am flattered

692
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,850
But usually I travel alone

693
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,570
Not like you

694
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,260
You are a couple. You travel together and take care of each other

695
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,330
You misunderstood.

696
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,500
She is not my girlfriend.

697
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,260
Yes. I am too good for him.

698
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
I will never be attracted to him.

699
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,690
This is nice.

700
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,490
Look how innocent and simple you are.

701
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,780
I really envy you guys.

702
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,900
I had a great time talking with you.

703
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:16,780
How about

704
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,260
I take a photo of you two?

705
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,860
I publish my own travel notes each year.

706
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,900
I will put your photo

707
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,810
in this year's travel notes.

708
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,690
What do you say?

709
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,690
Sounds great!

710
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,380
Come on!

711
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,440
I don't look good in pictures.

712
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,050
Don't worry. Come on, lad.

713
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:29,900
Come on.

714
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,140
Be quick.

715
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,400
I think you look great.

716
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,050
Come on.

717
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,330
Put down your bag.

718
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:33,780
That's right.

719
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,690
-Just put it down.
-It's so heavy.

720
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,020
Leave it to me.

721
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,620
Go on.

722
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,260
That's right.

723
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,450
Is here OK?

724
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,530
Let me see.

725
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:43,930
You are too close to me.

726
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,210
I want the sea to be your background.

727
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,050
That's right. Go further.

728
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,020
-Keep going. -Do you mean the sea over there?

729
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:48,690
Yeah, over there.

730
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,290
All right.

731
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:49,900
Yes. Go further.

732
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,740
I think the view is better there.

733
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,810
Yes. The sea view looks better.

734
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:54,980
How about here?

735
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,660
Just a second.

736
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,980
Well.

737
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,290
It's not bright enough.

738
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,500
The sea looks prettier over there.

739
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,090
Go over there.

740
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,020
Do you mean we should turn left?

741
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,260
Yeah. Turn left.

742
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,570
OK.

743
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,740
The sea looks so comfy.

744
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,740
Is there an island?

745
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:15,740
It seems so.

746
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,540
If only we could go fishing there

747
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,050
and make roast fish for dinner.

748
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,690
We have to go if we get a chance.

749
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,090
Where is he going?

750
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,330
Maybe he has to go pee?

751
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,540
Unlikely.

752
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:40,620
Stop!

753
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,540
Get on!

754
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,930
What's going on? Hurry!

755
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,260
Hurry!

756
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,810
You are such an idiot!

757
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,290
What are you dong?

758
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,620
You are so stupid.

759
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,780
I didn't mean to.

760
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,450
I just want to help you save some money.

761
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,930
Do you even know how to save money?

762
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,560
You can't even tell the difference
 between gasoline and diesel!

763
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,260
Enough! How should I know?

764
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,500
If you hadn't chatted with him,

765
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,620
we would never have run into this trouble!

766
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,290
That Lei disguised himself
as traveler and writer.

767
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,250
I knew there was something wrong with him.

768
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,050
You knew?

769
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Then why didn't you say anything?

770
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,170
He fled just when I wanted to nail his lie.

771
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,290
You piss me off!

772
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,290
If you hadn't mistaken diesel for gasoline,

773
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,860
I could have started my moto.

774
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,090
You can never catch him up with your lame moto.

775
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:37,900
Lame moto?

776
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:39,900
If you hadn't let him take photos,

777
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,380
we wouldn't have been fooled.

778
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,280
I

779
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,780
I just want to take a photo with you.

780
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,900
How could you blame me for it?

781
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,410
Shut up! Leave me alone!

782
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,380
How could you yell at me and scold me?

783
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,780
I have a heart problem and you know that.

784
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,210
How could you do this to me?

785
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,450
Don't cry. It's all my fault.

786
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,290
It's my bad.

787
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,620
I shouldn't have chatted with strangers.

788
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,410
I shouldn't have left the bag behind.

789
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,050
I shouldn't have let you go refuel my moto.

790
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,410
It's all my fault.

791
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,260
Yeah, it is!

792
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:19,980
Please don't cry.

793
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,930
This book doesn't make any sense.

794
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,690
Look at all this nonsense.

795
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,290
Lin Yang, look at the grass over there.

796
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,620
Is it green or red to you?

797
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,050
Do traffic lights look all the same to you?

798
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,380
And how about the Chinese bridal veil?

799
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,170
Is it read or green to you?

800
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,450
What kind of bridal veil is green?

801
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,410
Is it that funny?
You don't need to laugh so hard.

802
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,780
Now you know how I felt
when you looked down upon me.

803
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,090
Sit down.

804
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,690
This is part of the physical examination
 this afternoon.

805
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,410
What should I do?

806
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,090
Memorize the pictures.

807
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:03,810
326

808
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:06,780
What's this?

809
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,260
ABC

810
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,280
[New Color Vision Testing Chart]

811
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,210
Turtle. Rabbit. 69.

812
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,020
Tiger. Elephant. 376.

813
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:22,890
Zhouzhou, test me.

814
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,260
OK.

815
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,020
Page 28.

816
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,780
Page 28 is the number 36.

817
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,540
Page 29.

818
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,090
Page 29.

819
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,930
A cow? No, a horse.

820
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,290
Pig.

821
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:36,980
How could you call me a pig?

822
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,020
I mean the color vision chart.

823
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,540
You are doing good enough.

824
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,660
You just need to memorize them all
 before the physical examination this afternoon.

825
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,660
How come I never knew
I have color weakness?

826
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,810
Don't worry. I will never despise you for this.

827
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:53,860
Stand still.

828
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,980
Don't stand on your tiptoes.

829
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:06,810
Up.

830
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,120
No, no, no. Right.

831
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:12,530
It's water.

832
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,540
Left. Down.

833
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,060
It's also water.

834
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,820
It's still water.

835
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,449
Bro, do you get a cold or something?

836
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:32,409
Hello.

837
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,130
Page 5, right?

838
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,060
Number 26.

839
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,020
Look closely.

840
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,210
Doctor,

841
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,980
do you have the chart published in 1998?

842
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,060
This version is published in 1980. It's out of time.

843
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,340
What are you talking about?

844
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,100
Can you tell what's on this picture or not?

845
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,780
I can tell.

846
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,400
69?

847
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,100
No, no. 96.

848
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,850
Chicken?

849
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,100
No, no, no. It's a duck.

850
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,020
I know this one.

851
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:37,840
It's a monkey.

852
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:38,930
No, no.

853
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,100
Are you having fun?

854
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,580
You are really good at acting.

855
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,970
I have noticed you for quite a while.

856
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,980
You two. Come with me.

857
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,450
I am thirsty.

858
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,580
What are you doing?

859
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,600
Stop it. You make me feel even more thirsty.

860
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,260
I have an idea.

861
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,260
You know what?

862
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,930
There are lots of plum trees in the front.

863
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,020
The juicy plums can quench the thirst.

864
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,660
Stop fooling me with this old story.

865
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,980
I read about it long ago.

866
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,410
What are you doing?

867
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,850
I am too tired to go on.

868
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,610
Hurry.

869
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,580
If only I could take a gulp of water right now.

870
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,300
Ready, set...

871
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,210
What should I do? I am so nervous.

872
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,340
Yanyi, why do you drink so much?

873
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,210
What if you get a nosebleed?

874
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,580
I am fine. I am just a little nervous.

875
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,260
Why are you eating so much?

876
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,930
You even had to take off clothes
before measuring your weight.

877
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,610
But I need energy now.

878
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,730
I am fine with putting on a little weight.

879
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,850
How could you be so relaxed?

880
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,410
I know I cannot pass.

881
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,300
So I have applied for a make-up test.

882
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,890
Gather around!

883
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,540
I am sorry for dragging you into this.

884
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:15,920
Never mind.

885
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,170
It's just a self-reflection report.

886
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,540
I am good at writing.

887
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,500
Are you OK with it?

888
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,690
I am fine.

889
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,060
I never plan to be a pilot or anything.

890
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,500
OK. Get ready for the next round.

891
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,370
You six.

892
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,650
You there, put on the number tag.

893
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,650
Get ready for the test.

894
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,450
All the training is for today. Let's do this.

895
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,650
Do you have no common sense at all?

896
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,370
Don't have breakfast before running.

897
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,210
Lin Yang, I don't feel like running.

898
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,610
I want to apply for a make-up test.

899
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,340
I am not feeling well today.

900
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
I want to practice a few more days.

901
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,170
Then I will take the make-up test too.

902
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,610
Why do you have to do everything with me?

903
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,060
Because only in this way can I feel assured.

904
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,980
I will help you if you feel you can't go on.

905
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,170
Aren't you afraid that the judge may scold you?

906
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,260
Do you forget what I have promised?

907
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,060
Even if the world is against you,

908
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,100
I will still be on your side.
