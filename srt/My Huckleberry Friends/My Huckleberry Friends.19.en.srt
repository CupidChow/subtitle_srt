4
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,280
I win

5
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,980
No, we can't just compete on speed,

6
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,820
we have to compete on accuracy.

7
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,410
That's for the next round.

8
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,180
I win this round. Listen to me.

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,770
You've already won such a big cone,

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,930
Why don't you get enough?

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,130
You asked me out in the summer holiday,

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,860
claimed that you were going to preview the curriculum of senior 1,

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,180
and then we had a competition.

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,330
Now you've lost and you didn't admit.

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,290
Okay, okay, okay. I'll do whatever you want.

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,450
That's more like it.

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,459
I'm not going to listen to Clayderman's play.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,020
I'm too sleepy.

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,810
Let me play something to cheer you up.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,380
This is too noisy.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,810
This band is particularly lovely.

22
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,780
The singer is only a few years older than us.

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:19,660
Is he from China?

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,289
Beijing, I think.

25
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,610
I remember reading an interview

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,600
that when the singer was in primary school,

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,570
the head teacher told his parents:

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,340
"Your son has see through the vanity of the world."

29
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,250
So you like this band

30
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,780
because you've seen through the vanity of the world?

31
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,370
I think I've experienced more

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,210
than people of the same age.

33
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:44,450
I'm reminded of the saying that

34
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,060
there's only one kind of heroism in this world,

35
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,280
that's to love life

36
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,740
even after you've seen the truth of it.

37
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,610
Do you love life?

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,490
I'll play you another song.

39
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,930
If you listen to the slow songs of The Flowers,

40
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,090
you'll love them.

41
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,130
Does it sound good?

42
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,610
Yes.

43
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,970
I think I love life.

44
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,340
I've been through so much pain,

45
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,450
and I always think everything is going to get better.

46
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,890
There will always be good songs,

47
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,860
tasty food

48
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,780
and lovely people.

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,579
So am I a lovely person?

50
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,720
Go away!

51
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,140
It's great

52
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,060
that we can finally go to Zhen Hua High School together.

53
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,700
Maybe we can even be divided to the same class.

54
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,860
Let's check the accuracy rate first.

55
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,090
Let me take a look first.

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,300
Don't look.

57
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,250
Let me take a look.

58
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,650
Don't look. Turn around and write yours.

59
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,450
Okay, okay, okay.

60

63
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,730
Uncle.

64
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,890
Something has happened to Grandma.

65
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,370
We can't go back now.

66
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,940
What happened to my grandmother?

67
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,140
Let me tell you.

68
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,610
Zhouzhou, it's okay. It's okay.

69
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,980
Your grandmother‘s blood sugar was low and

70
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,700
she passed out.

71
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,140
Luckily she was sent to the hospital in time.

72
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,500
She's fine now.

73
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,890
But she needs to stay in hospital for a few days

74
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,980
to be kept under observation.

75
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,810
I'll go there.

76
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,780
No, we're all here.

77
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,579
You just cook yourself some food to eat at home,

78
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,250
or go to the restaurant downstairs and eat something.

79
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,250
OK.

Happy birthday to you.

84

Yangyang, after this birthday,

85
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,209
You'll grown up.

86
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,810
Dad, that's what you said last year.

87
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,420
Besides, my birthday is a week away.

88
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,330
Yangyang, we are going business travel tomorrow.

What do you want?

91
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,650
We'll buy it for you.

92
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,330
Really?

93
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,860
Actually if you can agree me

94
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,050
to have a birthday party of my own,

95
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,740
I think it's the greatest gift of all.

96
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,300
The kid has grown up and doesn't need our accompany anymore.

97
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,140
No, Mom, what are you talking about?

98
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,090
Come on, cut the cake.

99
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,020
Come on, you cut it.

I've just finished my porridge, I am unable to eat anymore.

It's okay, we'll eat together.

103
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,210
Zhouzhou,

104
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,020
you're becoming more and more like your mother.

105
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,090
Grandma, I've had a lot of homework lately.

106
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,860
Last time I saw you was also in a hurry.

107
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,300
I haven't talked to you for a long time。

108
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,240
What's wrong?

109
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,650
After I came back from the beach last time，

110
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,700
I went to see my father.

111
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,300
When he was pursuing your mother,

112
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,580
I told your mother to reconsider.

113
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,620
But your mother...

114
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,930
The god of destiny makes fools of the people

115
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,810
Zhouzhou,

116
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,050
do you still blame your father?

117
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,330
I used to blame him.

118
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,330
But after I saw him that day,

119
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,930
I was quite happy

120
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,490
I felt that in the corner of the world,

121
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,900
there is another person who cared about me.

122
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,090
But this kind of concern is different from that of teacher, friend,

123
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,050
and that of aunt and uncle.

124
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:09,970
Although，

125
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,250
I don't think we'll see each other again.

126
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,140
Zhouzhou,

127
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,010
if you can think like that,

128
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,020
grandma is relieved.

129
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,420
You've suffered so much since you were a child.

130
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,090
I'm afraid you won't be able to bear it.

131
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,460
Mi Qiao,

132
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,460
have you ever given a boy a present?

133
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,700
No. What's up?

134
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,700
Nothing.I was just checking.

135
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,180
Although I don't know what to buy for a boy,

136
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,210
but if it is Lin Yang's birthday,

137
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,370
he'll be happy with anything you give.

138
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,620
Who says I'm getting Lin Yang a present?

139
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,330
Look, look, look,

140
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,650
you can't hide anything.

141
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,530
I've heard from several dudes that

142
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,650
on the weekend, Lin Yang

143
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,040
called some friends to celebrate his birthday at home.

144
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,810
He called me too, but I wasn't available.

145
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,860
He also called you, right?

146
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,420
-No. - Yesterday was the  final battle for  "Reggie" Miller.

147
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,770
-No, or not yet? - Miller was red-eyed after the game.

148
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,890
-I don't know. I'm just asking. - He hugged with the coaches and teammates.

149
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,300
-The players of Pistons came up. - You said if he asked me to...

150
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,650
-Hugging and greeting the most famous shooter in the history of the NBA. -I'd have to bring a gift as a courtesy.

151
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,490
-After that, Miller went around the court. - Still.

152
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,580
--You can send anything you want. -Thank you to the fans at the Conseco Center.

153
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,250
-Unfortunately, he hasn't won a championship ring in his 18-year career.-No.

154
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,900
Miller leaves the court with a loss.

155
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,370
This 39-year-old man cried, and the fans also cried.

156
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,770
-The day has come. - Goodbye, Miller Time.

157
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,650
We said we'd go to watch Miller's game after university graduation.

158
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,370
That's just great.

159
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,250
He's retired before we got there.

160
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,650
From now on,

161
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,930
no more Miller,

162
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,740
no more NBA.

163
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,090
Come on.

164
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,050
Jiang Chuan,

165
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,020
what will you give me for my birthday?

166
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,180
I'll treat you with magnum.

167
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:57,900
Get out!

168
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,330
I've given you a pair of Adidas on your birthday.

169
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,810
Yes, Adidas with four bars.

170
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,240
There was opening glue at the shoes within a day.

171
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,770
It's a pair of shoes at least.

172
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,050
If you give me any damn CDs or cassettes,

173
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,900
I'll never see you again.

174
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,290
Okay, don't worry.

175
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,700
This year, I'm going to surprise you with something big.

176
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,810
I'm off.

177
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,140
Give you,

178
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,420
Thank you.

179
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,860
You're welcome.

180
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,620
My reading on the broadcast,

181
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,420
did you hear it?

182
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,059
I used the song you recommended

183
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,330
as the background music.

184
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,330
I heard it.

185
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,650
Your pronunciation has really improved.

186
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:37,929
Thank you.

187
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,690
Lin Yang，

188
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,820
It's your birthday at the weekend, isn't it?

189
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,880
You have already know that?

190
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,940
Can I come?

191
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:47,980
Are you coming?

192
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,210
To thank you for taking care of me all this time,

193
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,530
I've got a little present for you.

194
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,890
I didn't take care of you, actually.

195
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,740
Then I can come to your birthday party, right?

196
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,180
Yes, yes, of course.

197
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,730
See you there then.

198
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,530
See you then.

199
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,820
Zhouzhou, these braised chicken legs are really good today.

200
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,620
Why don't you have one?

201
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,570
No.

202
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,740
Zhouzhou, I think you're in an urgent situation now.

203
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,060
What's wrong?

204
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:22,940
I have told you

205
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,060
to keep an eye on Xinrui.

206
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,330
In my opinion, in both relationship and study

207
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,890
you're being crushed by Xin Rui

208
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,380
Look, Xin Rui rank first in the exam.

209
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,770
She was on the campus broadcast.

210
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,940
And haven't you noticed she's getting closer to Lin Yang lately?

211
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,170
Whether she was close to Lin Yang or not,

212
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,130
what does it matter to me?

213
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,530
If it doesn't matter, why don't you eat the braised chicken leg?

214
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,170
You, you, you chew slowly.

215
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,130
This is a chicken leg, not Lin Yang.

216
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,160
[World Sports]

217
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,090
Hello, is there a book about this?

218
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,420
Why don't you ask the information desk over there?

219
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,500
OK.

220
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,450
Hello,

221
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,690
do you have any books about this?

222
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,010
Sorry, no.

223
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,260
Thank you.

224
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:23,890
Lin Yang.

225
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,890
Lin Yang, can I ask you something?

226
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,070
What kind of birthday gifts have you received for your birthday?

227
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,690
What's the most impressive one?

228
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,890
You don't have to prepare gift for me.

229
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,740
Actually, I'm just curious.

230
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,690
I haven't received any birthday presents.

231
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,570
You've never had a birthday?

232
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,820
I used to celebrate my birthday when I was a kid. I don't remember.

233
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,620
Male chase female likes climbing a huge mountain.

234
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,090
Female chase male likes eating a piece of cake.

235
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,210
Lin Yang has cozen up to you,

236
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:55,890
but you ignored him.

237
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,450
The next minute, Xin Rui has already stood in frond of him.

238
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,090
You're so silver-tongued，

239
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,650
why did you score so low in your essay?

240
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,180
Li Bai wrote hundreds of poems after drinking wine,

241
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,090
I have to be inspired to come up with these words.

242
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,940
Look at them.

243
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,300
You'd better mind your own business.

244
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,530
Is the Cartoon Club in trouble again lately?

245
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,570
It cannot be called as trouble.

246
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,500
It's just those kids in senior 1

247
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,620
have started a bunch of clubs

248
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,890
which are threatening us.

249
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:20,940
So what will you do?

250
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,010
I will never attack unless attacked.

251
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,620
If someone attack me, I will hold a modest attitude.

252
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,090
What if they attack you again and again?

253
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,620
Then I'll cut the weeds and dig up the roots.

254
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,090
Hello, uncle.

255
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,380
Zhouzhou, is Yu Fei here yet?

256
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,530
Not yet.

257
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,890
You've been busy this week.

258
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,500
your aunt and me

259
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,860
have too many things lately.

260
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,690
You have to take care of Grandma.

261
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,570
It's ok, I'd like to spend more time with her too.

262
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,740
Later, Yu Fei will be there.

263
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,530
He will take care of grandma instead,

264
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,620
If he went there,

265
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,770
You can come back.

266
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,940
I understand. Thank you, Uncle.

267
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,890
I'll hurry him up.

268
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,640
Oh, I know.

269
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,090
I'm already at the hospital.

270
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,010
It's true. Why would I lie to you?

271
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,980
I've seen Zhouzhou.

272
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,090
Zhouzhou.

273
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,210
Zhouzhou.

274
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,740
Keep your voice down.

275
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,640
Say hello to your uncle.

276
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,980
Hey, uncle, brother Feifei is here.

277
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,810
Do you hear me?

278
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,500
Grandma's asleep. I'm hanging up now.

279
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,300
My father is so annoying that

280
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,090
he keeps asking me to

281
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,170
learn from you all the time.

282
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,450
How am I going to get along in this family?

283
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,860
Where are my things?

284
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,380
What?

285
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,060
Didn't we have a deal?

286
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,450
I asked my friends to find several foreign language shops in Beijing

287
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
to buy it, and had it sent to me in a hurry.

288
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,170
Well, Zhouzhou,

289
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,010
now you can see the original version.

290
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,860
Thank you, brother Fei Fei.

291
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:03,680
That's enough!

292
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,770
If you keep doing that, I'll get goose bumps.

293
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,530
Are you looking for me?

294
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,330
Call Mi Qiao for me.

295
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,300
If you're in class 3, you're looking for either Xin Rui or Mi Qiao.

296
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,330
Chairman Chu is really busy.

297
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,570
If you weren't in class 3,

298
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,090
I'd have asked them to come and find me themselves.

299
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,290
Mi Qiao.

300
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,620
Why did Chairman Chu have time to come and observe the conditions of the people?

301
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,860
There's something I need to talk to you.

302
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,210
Stop.

303
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,500
I guess it's good news.

304
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,860
It is about the Cartoon Club.

305
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,090
You are a bully!

306
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,760
Is there no room for a little Cartoon Club

307
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,180
in such a large Zhen Hua High School?

308
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,980
Where's the conscience? Where's the justice?

309
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,890
I didn't say I was going to withdraw.

310
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,060
Thank you, thank you.

311
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,380
Thank you, thank you, Chairman Chu.

312
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,260
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

313
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,570
Recently, there are too many clubss in school and they did not develop well.

314
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,690
Many clubs have been occupying classrooms for a long time without organizing activities.

315
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,620
The school has decided to cancel and merge a number of them.

316
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,620
Your club is now the first on the blacklist.

317
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,260
I'm here to remind you out of kindness.

318
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,980
Thank you.

319
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,330
You're welcome.

320
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,450
Bully.

321
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:43,940
Step aside.

322
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,740
Zhouzhou,

323
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,680
The Cartoon Club now faces its greatest danger.

324
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,760
I could hear your last roar in the classroom.

325
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,080
Can you give me some ideas?

326
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,940
I think what Chu Tiankuo said

327
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,980
means that as long as we are striving,

328
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,090
the Cartoon Club still has a chance.

329
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,980
It's not that serious, is it?

330
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,860
It is serious!

331
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,620
If we keep this up, the Cartoon Club will soon be shut down.

332
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,980
Okay, I'll help you think about it.

333
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,210
But I might not have much time these days.

334
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,380
Why have you been reading the English-Chinese dictionary lately?

335
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,980
You haven't been irritated by Xin Rui's English in the broadcast, have you?

336
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,770
Yeah, I've got to work harder.

337
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,180
Otherwise I will face my greatest danger.

338
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,980
Do you want to see your best friend

339
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,620
worried and distraught?

340
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,890
Wait, I'm going to ask a question.

341
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,690
Yu Zhouzhou.

342
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,940
Remember to eradicate the root of the problem.

343
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,180
Who can I eradicate?

344
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,690
-Mi Qiao. - Yanyi.

345
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,450
I knew you were the backbone of the Cartoon Club.

346
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,890
No, I left my bag here.

347
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,890
Let me get it.

348
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,010
You're here now. Don't rush off.

349
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,740
What are you doing?

350
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,650
To do some activities.

351
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,330
What activity? Just two of us?

352
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,180
I have an appointment with Xin Rui to help me with my paper.

353
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,060
I've got to go.

354
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,980
Xin Rui?

355
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,770
Didn't you ask Zhouzhou before?

356
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,770
I'm very impressed with Xin Rui.

357
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,210
She's gone from not being as good as me to being better than Zhouzhou.

358
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,380
If she can do it, I can do it too.

359
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,210
Xin Rui is also a member of the Cartoon Club.

360
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,130
He can check the questions here.

361
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,300
Studying in the animation association?

362
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,860
I got to go now.

363
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,210
I'm gonna make a big move.

364
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,300
Lin Yang,

365
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,820
you invited all of us to celebrate your birthday in your home.

366
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,940
It's for saving money, isn't it?

367
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,090
Fine, you said that.

368
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,860
Then don't play the game console.

369
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,980
No. I'm sorry, bro.

370
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,690
Bro, don't be mad.

371
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,890
It depends on your behavior.

372
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,620
Lin Yang, your parents really believe you.

373
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,860
After we "disreputable gang" throw a party,

374
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,170
your house will be in a mess.

375
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,540
Yeah. You "disreputable gang" will just leave

376
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,280
after having fun and enjoying yourselves.

377
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,619
I'll be left to clean the house, sheding tears in silence.

378
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,290
So you must present me some decent gifts

379
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,140
to repay my painstaking work.

380
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,810
I wanna give you a heads up

381
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,900
that I will buy the most extraordinary

382
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,490
gift for Lin Yang.

383
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,290
I'm sure you'll never guess.

384
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,050
Whose new album was issued this year?

385
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,740
It doesn't have to be a new one.

386
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,260
Maybe he'll give Lin Yang an old one.

387
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,160
What do you mean, liang?

388
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,170
The birthday gift that you gave Lin Yang every year

389
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,620
was either a CD or a tape.

390
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,140
And they were all pirated, which cost no more than 15 yuan.

391
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,450
You really look down upon me.

392
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,930
Lin Yang, just make a judgement.

393
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,860
Every year the money you spent on my gift

394
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,050
was even less than that I spent on a meal.

395
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,540
Don't pretend to be generous, man.

396
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,570
Fine, good for you.

397
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,260
Who's it?

398
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,260
One eight six zero.

399
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,020
Your eyes tell me two words:

400
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:14,930
desire.

401
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,780
Your eyes also tell me two words:

402
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,050
disappointment.

403
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,500
Don't talk like me.

404
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,020
No. It's obvious that his expression

405
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,930
tells us he is waiting for someone's message.

406
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,650
Enough. That's enough. Don't pull his leg.

407
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,080
Lin Yang,

408
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,900
how about you inviting her to your birthday party?

409
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,450
She'll bring you a gift.

410
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,860
Just for a gift?

411
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,260
Just for a gift.

412
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,260
Zhou...

413
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,050
I'll celebrate my birth this weekend.

414
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,080
Celebrate your birth?

415
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,540
I'll celebrate my birthday.

416
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:57,930
Congratulations.

417
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,210
You'll come or not?

418
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,380
Are you inviting me or pushing me?

419
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,770
I'm inviting you.

420
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,020
Then just try it?

421
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,090
I'll throw a birthday party this weekend at home.

422
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,690
If you are available,

423
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,660
I hope you can come.

424
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,320
But I don't know if I have time or not.

425
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,170
Fine.

426
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,330
Even if you promise me, you'll go back on your words anyway.

427
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,860
What do you mean?

428
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,690
You are always acting like that.

429
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,860
Granny,

430
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,740
just tell me if you want to do something.

431
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,210
What's the matter?

432
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,900
Nothing.

433
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,860
It suddenly occurs to me that

434
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,020
the one who will marry you must be a lucky man.

435
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,690
You are such a caring girl.

436
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,290
Granny.

437
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,090
You've been quiet busy with study recently.

438
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,260
Not very busy. I'm reading a extra-curricular book.

439
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,140
Anyway, your eldest uncle and aunt will come here after a couple of days.

440
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,090
And the nurses can take care of me.

441
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,860
I'll be fine by myself.

442
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,330
I want to keep your company, granny.

443
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,740
Class,

444
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,690
that's all for our course.

445
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,450
I hope what you got in the class

446
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,660
can help you in your future study.

447
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,410
Goodbye, class.

448
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:55,900
You still here?

449
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,540
I'd like to stay here a little longer.

450
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,380
Can you stay with me?

451
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,140
I think maybe I should go...

452
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,170
Well, I'll accompany you for a while,

453
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,690
considering the heavy traffic.

454
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,410
Last time, you went to my home and said a good word for me.

455
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,500
After that, my mother even changed her attitude towards me.

456
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,500
Thank you.

457
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,050
You're welcome.

458
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,330
I think I just told the truth.

459
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,090
Do you carry the CD player? I'd like to listen to some songs.

460
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,380
Actually, I used to borrow Yu Zhouzhou's CD player.

461
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,730
You know my mother. She'll never buy me one.

462
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,810
When I wanna listen to the song

463
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,660
you recommended,

464
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,650
I'll go to the Xinhua Bookstore and use the CD player there.

465
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,860
Why? Doesn't Yu Zhouzhou lend you her CD player?

466
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,370
Since last examination,

467
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,410
she hasn't talked to me much.

468
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,620
And she treats me unnaturally.

469
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,740
But I'm too embarrassed to ask her the reason.

470
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,210
No, she will never behave like that.

471
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,660
I think you must have misunderstood Yu Zhouzhou.

472
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,140
I've never seen her envy anyone since childhood.

473
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,810
You know her very well?

474
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,900
We've known each other since we were kids.

475
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,260
I guess I'm the one who knows her best in the world.

476
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,210
Wanna enjoy the song?

477
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,500
No, thanks.

478
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,330
I feel, recently,

479
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,500
you two don't get along so well.

480
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,810
But it's just a wild guess.

481
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:58,900
You also feel that?

482
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,330
It's true.

483
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,020
Is it because last time I was in the cinema...

484
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,410
If only I hadn't been there.

485
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,330
No.

486
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,410
It has nothing to do with you.

487
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,690
It's between her and me.

488
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,690
You are very nice,

489
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,020
so I'm sure you are not the wrong side.

490
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,850
No, it's my fault.

491
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,210
If I had made concessions on words,

492
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,450
the silent treatment would have ended already.

493
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,980
You've been thinking about her.

494
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,540
Perhaps it's not enough.

495
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,290
Everytime I see her,

496
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,140
as if a button in my head is pressed.

497
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,210
Then I talk and behave without thinking.

498
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,660
I always let her down.

499
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,410
Yes. It's my fault.

500
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,450
I'm sorry.

501
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,140
I was talking nonsense just now.

502
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,660
Tomorrow is your birthday. Will she come to your birthday party?

503

I don't know, either.

Zheng Yanyi,

506
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,570
don't you want to stay in the Cartoon Club, do you?

507
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,210
I haven't finished my homework.

508
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,540
I mean, seriously,

509
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,140
taking part in activities of the Cartoon Club is too time-consuming.

510
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,500
I didn't do well on last examination.

511
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,740
I truly can't go there.

512

Xin Rui,

513
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,010
I informed you of the activity in the Cartoon Club previously,

514
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,690
so can you come？

515
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,780
I'm going to Lin Yang's birthday party tonight.

516
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,050
Didn't he invite you?

Is it today?

519
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,090
I...I'm sorry. I forget it.

520
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,930
I have a last-minute family thing.

521

Well, I’m sure to participate in the activity next time.

522

Zhouzhou, I know you are very busy,

but I really don't have enough people to help me.

Could you please come to help me? Just a minute.

525
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,730
I really can't go there.

526

I'm staying with my grandma.

527

Are you staying with your grandma or going to Lin Yang's birthday party?

528

I'm not sure I can go to Lin Yang's birthday party.

529

My eldest aunt won't be here until very late.

Visiting grandma, studying and going to Lin Yang's birthday party.

There are three excuses in total, and you used two of them.

Don't tell me that you are still studying when staying with your grandma.

533
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,170
You guessed it.

How can you know?

535

You are really a nuisance.

Nothing.

You're just here to make fun of me, aren't you?

She's having the infusion,

00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,140
and it's about to finish.

612
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,540
Oh, I'm sorry,

613
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,020
something has held me up,

614
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,900
I'll be there in one hour.

615
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,810
It's OK, no worries.

616
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,540
No worries?

617
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,980
I think you are eager to see her arriving.

618
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,540
No I'm not.

619
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,620
It will take a long time

620
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,210
to finish the infusion.

621
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,900
Just go if you need to do something.

622
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,570
There is a beeper here,

623
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,740
I can call the nurse with it
 if I need help later.

624
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,770
It's OK, let me stay with you.

625
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,140
Let me have a guess,

626
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,450
you wish to meet a person

627

who can bring sunshine into your life.

628

Though I seemed to be muddled,

630
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,620
I know everything clearly.

631
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,170
I'll call the nurse then.

632
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,260
OK.

633
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,900

Now we come to the part of giving presents.

You really know me well, Jiang Chuan.

638
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,170
Lin Yang, happy birthday!

639
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:08,860
Thank you!

640
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,930
What is this?

641
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,500
Just open it and have a look.

642
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,140
OMG, how exquisite!

643
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,020
It can play music!

644
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,330
Why didn't you give me something like 
this in my birthday?

645
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:16,860
That's none of your business!

646
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,090
-Marvelous! 
 -Do you like it?

647
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,920
Splendid! Thank you, doll.

648
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,810
Here, Lin Yang, take a look.

649
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,980
What is this? A notebook?

650
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,500
Open it!

651
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,450
This is the signature of Wang Zhi.

652
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,570
I stood in the training center for the entire afternoon

653
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,290
with this notebook.

654
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,020
How come I feel this signature

655
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,540
comes from your handwriting?

656
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,780
But I'm sure this notebook can prove 
 my sincerity, right?

657
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,160
Yes.

658
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Dose it matter who wrote this signature?

659
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,570
No. I appreciate your kindness.

660
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,740
OK, now,

661
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,620
Here is your present.

662
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:47,810
What's in this?

663
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,020
Have a guess.

664
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,530
A vest?

665
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,290
Try again.

666
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,050
A culture T-shirt?

667
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:51,980
Try harder!

668
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,620
A  genuine basketball shirt of Reggie Miller?

669
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,440
Isn't this awesome?

670
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,320
It is! I love you! Here.

671
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,810
I love you too.

672
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,450
Now, listen, Lin Yang,

673
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,090
don't say me like that from now on.

674
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,860
It really cost me an arm and a leg.

675
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,900
Later, when my birthday comes...

676
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,540
No problem.

677
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,440
I just can't understand you boys,

678
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,980
why are you willing to spend so many
 money on this?

679
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:13,500
You will never be able to understand it.

680
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,900
Xin Rui, how about your gift?

681
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,140
I'm sorry Lin Yang,

682
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,500
I come here in such a hurry and I didn't
 get any time to prepare the present.

683
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,450
It's OK,

684
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,810
The party almost started when I told you.

685
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:24,980
Now,

686
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,690
Shall we have a toast?

687
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,540
Here, cheers!

688
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,330
Cheers!Cheers!

689
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,290
Happy birthday!

690
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,900
Thank you guys, happy birthday to me.

691
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,620
Be careful on your way back!

692
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,090
I...I'll send Qianqian back home then.

693
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:42,410
OK.

694
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:42,980
I don't remember I asked for it.

695
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,290
Bye!

696
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,010
Lin Yang, I'll leave then, happy birthday!

697
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:45,930
Thanks, Bye!

698
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:46,450
Good bye!

699
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:49,900
Lin Yang,

700
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,090
-I... 
 -Happy birthday! Happy birthday!

701
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,170
-Thanks.
-We'll leave then.

702
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,020
It's quite late now, can you send Xin Rui back home?

703
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,620
No problem. Let's go, Xin Rui,
 I'll send you home.

704
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,380
Shall we play the game again the other day?

705
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,660
Don't use the "Lakers" next time.

706
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,500
You can not win me anyway.

707
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,860
All right. Happy birthday!

708
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,900
Bye! Bye！

709
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,160
Xin Rui, hurry!

710
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,210
Coming!

711
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,020
I seemed to forgot something in Lin Yang's House,

712
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,780
I'll take it back, 
 so would you go home first?

713
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,900
Let's go there together then.

714
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,090
It's OK, I can get it myself. See you!

715
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,090
Hello?

716
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,290
Are you in your house?

717
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,450
Yes, why?

718
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,930
I'm at the steps under your home,

719
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,330
can you come down here?

720
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,660
I was in my home just then,

721
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,140
but now I'm on my way to the karaoke bar.

722
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,930
Maybe I'll stay there for the whole night.

723
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,330
In that case, I could only give you my 
 wishes on the phone.Happy birthday.

724
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,380
Isn't it more appropriate to say this 
directly?

725
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,330
Didn't you...you lied to me!

726
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,040
I saw them off and I took a walk just then.

727
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,860
Happy birthday!

728
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,500
Thanks, I really like it.

729
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,780
That's it? You didn't even look at it.

730
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,820
Whatever it is, as long as it is from you, 
I will cherish it.

731
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,889
The Anime Club is something 
I was longing to accomplish,

732
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,409
I just hate to see it perish silently.

733
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:57,740
Let it go,

734
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,100
as many things in life will leave us.

735
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,850
This won't work for me.

736
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,650
You know what?

737
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,890
Death may seem to be something
 far away for you guys,

738
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,890
but for me,

739
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,410
it's rather close.

740
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,580
Maybe it would happen ten years later,

741
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,060
maybe it's around the corner.

742
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,170
Pooh!

743
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,740
We are in a nice barbecue shop 
 with blooming business,

744
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,060
just put death aside, it's quite unlucky.

745
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,170
Say it: I'm sorry for saying it.

746
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,780
It's hard for others to think in my shoes.

747
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,210
I'm the one who will

748
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,690
persist till the end if I wish to do something.

749
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,540
As long as there is a slim chance of success,

750
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,370
even though it will cost all my effort,

751
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,120
I'll still go for it.

752
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,300
They said this is impulsive and childish,

753
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,890
but I just hate to wait.

754
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,300
I'm afraid my hesitation will
 leave me with regret.

755
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,020
Come on! It's such a sentimental time, 
 show something!

756
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,610
I added too much salt in this 
 and it's terribly salty.

757
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,540
Since I'm in good mood,

758
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,100
do you have something really eager to do?

759
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,650
Tell me, you can keep your dream

760
00:35:58,930 --> 00:35:59,890
and I'll help you to make it come true.

761
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,570
A concert of Eason Chan.

762
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,060
I'll die for it if I could go there and watch it.

763
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,850
Why did you say this again?

764
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,170
I hate to hear the word "death" from you.

765
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,210
You know what's in my mind?

766
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,690
There is no such thing as
 "dying without regret",

767
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,100
because death is the most tragic regret.

768
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,610
We should live it and take it with

769
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,580
passion and confidence.

770
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,540
We don't owe anybody anything.

771
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,580
In that case, can I start with
 the ticket of a concert?

772
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,210
Is it expensive?

773
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,450
Yes, quite expensive.

774
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,170
I don't think there are any concert recently.

775
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,500
There is one in the neighboring city 
a few days later.

776
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,450
Well then, this is real generousity.

777
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,260
I said we are going!

778
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,920
Easy, my beer is about to spill!

779
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,020
You come back so late.

780
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,410
Are you insane? Can't you be gentle?

781
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,980
Damn it!

782
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,580
You worthless wretch!

783
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,820
You haven't done any housework, 
and now giving me your attitude?

784
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,170
Who are you slamming at?

785
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,410
Leave me alone! I'm about to burst.
