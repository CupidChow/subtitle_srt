[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,130
I called Benben.

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,370
He said he was with you guys.

4
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,420
No. We haven't seen him for a long time.

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,900
After Mi Qiao died,

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,050
he said he wanted us to leave him alone.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,530
Every time we went to him, he was sleeping.

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:31,820
He never came out.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,220
Right.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,450
Benben!

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:39,860
His phone is off.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,860
It can't be!

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,380
- Boss!
- Boss, open the door!

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,060
Boss!

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,410
Is he out?

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,700
Not very likely.

17
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,610
Wasn't it stuck here

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,700
last time when I sent him home?

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,690
It's been quite a long time.

20
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,120
Back off.

21
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,220
What are you doing?

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,250
So noisy!

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,780
It's so stinky!

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,420
We'll get something to eat for Boss.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,530
Benben, get up!

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,170
Let's go out to eat something.

27
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:32,780
I'm not hungry.

28
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,570
Mi Qiao wouldn't want to see you like this.

29
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:54,570
Get up.

30
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,530
Let's go out to eat something.

31
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,840
I have no appetite.

32
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,730
Zhouzhou, I'm fine. I won't commit suiside.

33
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,579
I know.

34
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,450
I just don't want to do anything.

35
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,650
I find everything boring.

36
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,490
Do you remember telling me

37
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,010
that bruises will disappear one day.

38
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,500
But I don't want her to disappear.

39
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,800
[Episode 26
What's the color of your dream?]

40
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,140
You two, hand out the books.

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,610
Ok.

42
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,650
Class,

43
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,410
it's a guide to choosing college and major.

44
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,720
You don't have to read it now.

45
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,010
You can skim it later when you have time.

46
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,090
When you come to school next week,

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,090
tell me your general goal.

48
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,940
I don't think you can figure out

49
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,300
what are the majors on the book

50
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,530
in a short time.

51
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:53,860
So

52
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,220
our priority now

53
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,250
is still learning.

54
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,210
Everyone's grades

55
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,860
can still be improved.

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,780
When you get better grades,

57
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,650
you can choose any college you like.

58
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,370
Good.

59
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,300
Incredible.

60
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,210
Why are you here?

61
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,240
Those teachers in our office

62
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,330
are so tense

63
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,140
that they can't even take a joke.

64
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,180
I came here to relax

65
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,090
and to have a taste of your tea by the way.

66
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,920
But I didn't expect a concert.

67
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,860
Wu, back in the day,

68
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,250
when we first became headteachers,

69
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,700
you were in charge

70
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:48,900
of the only arts class of Zhen Hua,

71
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,650
and I was in charge of the science classes.

72
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,370
When students became seniors

73
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,620
and we were under pressure,

74
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:54,890
we would go to the rooftop

75
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,530
to give a shout.

76
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,770
We would encourage each other and give advice.

77
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,300
It felt good. I miss those days.

78
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,740
Pan,

79
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,810
you are using the past to fool with me.

80
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,700
As the saying goes,

81
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,800
a woman cries when she worries,

82
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,210
while a man will sing.

83
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,860
Are you in trouble again?

84
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,700
Fine. Let me tell you the truth.

85
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,530
I've made a commitment to the leaders.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,330
The number of students admitted to PKU or THU

87
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,580
will be at least 15, or even better 20.

88
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,620
The recommended students are not included.

89
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,330
Think about it.

90
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,460
It won't work at this time

91
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,930
no matter how hard you push them.

92
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,300
Instead, I think

93
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,580
we should make them relax.

94
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,420
There are many choices

95
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,530
other than PKU or THU, right?

96
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,700
Why do you disagree with everything I say?

97
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,770
I'm not disagreeing with you.

98
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,300
It's just that the life of students

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,490
is a choice of their own. Right?

100
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,460
You can't control it.

101
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,930
You are now being irresponsible.

102
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,090
Fine. Stop criticizing me.

103
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,530
I remember years ago,

104
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,930
you wanted to enter a college for music,

105
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,370
but ended up going to a teacher-training college

106
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,180
regardless of the effort you made.

107
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,620
You've achieved a lot over the years,

108
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,650
but can you say

109
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,860
that you have no regrets?

110
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,140
Lin Yang,

111
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,930
does he look like Lu Xinghe in our class?

112
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,250
What's so interesting about it?

113
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,700
The TV is not for free.

114
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,020
Make it quick if you want to buy things.

115
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,490
What's the difference with two more people?

116
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,700
We are not using extra electricity.

117
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,980
You students

118
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,760
pretend to buy things to watch TV all the time,

119
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,980
and leave when the programme is over.

120
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,090
How am I going to sell things?

121
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,140
Okay. Please don't watch it

122
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,130
when I'm on television.

123
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,700
You talk big, don't you? Do it then.

124
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,930
- The check, please.
- Why should I...

125
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,330
What's it?

126
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,240
I don't like that boy.

127
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,330
But you seem to be a nice guy.

128
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,810
Look at his dream.

129
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,620
Saving Chinese music

130
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:21,770
and becoming a singer like Jay Chou!

131
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,700
It's so exciting!

132
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,140
Why are we nothing like him?

133
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,650
He's a good singer and has a good look.

134
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,050
What do you have?

135
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,330
You'd better be more practical.

136
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,370
"Be more practical."

137
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,090
You'll be recommended, right?

138
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,770
Qianqian will go to a key college as well.

139
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,370
I'm the only one taking Gaokao

140
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,210
and I don't even know if I can survive.

141
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,140
You don't have to go to the same place, right?

142
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,370
Nothing has been decided yet.

143
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,090
If we are really going to different places,

144
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
there will be no hope for me.

145
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,580
Really?

146
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:58,370
What?

147
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,930
Haven't you asked

148
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,420
to which college Yu Zhouzhou wants to go?

149
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,860
Not yet.

150
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,620
Right.

151
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,050
It's no use

152
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,770
thinking alone here.

153
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Maybe she doesn't even want to go to Beijing.

154
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,370
It's not very likely.

155
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,180
How can you be so sure?

156
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,530
Which is more important, you or her future?

157
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,580
Why didn't you bring the book?

158
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm close to remembering

159
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,330
all the majors and past admission scores

160
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,050
in the book.

161
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,770
Which one do you want to know? I'll tell you.

162
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,700
You've decided to go to Tsinghua?

163
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,650
What about the major?

164
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,530
Not yet.

165
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,299
But I'm interested in several majors.

166
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,980
Civil Engineering or Biomedical Engineering.

167
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,820
So you want to do related work in the future?

168
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,940
At least I don't resent it.

169
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,650
It seems interesting to me.

170
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:43,860
Good.

171
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,940
Which college do you want to go?

172
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,260
I don't know.

173
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,860
At least you want to go to Beijing, right?

174
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,940
I don't know about that neither.

175
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,500
Where do you want to go then?

176
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,210
Lin Yang,

177
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,260
I really have no idea,

178
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,060
and I don't know what to do in the future.

179
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,050
You guys are doing the cleaning?

180
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,250
It's our Boss, not us.

181
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,500
We don't know what happened with him.

182
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,570
He's become a extremely tidy person.

183
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,010
He's cleaned all the bathrooms in the dorm.

[Vocational and Technical School of Shanhai City
Boys' Dorm]

185
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,500
Every day he mops the corridor three times

186
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,300
and the floor of the room tens of times.

187
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,370
He won't let us help.

188
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,820
See? These mops are already worn out.

189
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,740
These are the things

190
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,260
Mi Qiao left at the anime club.

191
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,420
I've brought you everything.

192
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,010
Zhouzhou, tell me,

193
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,860
can people meet after they die?

194
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,330
If it were possible,

195
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,860
I would have already gone to meet my mom.

196
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,980
I was joking.

197
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,420
Zhouzhou,

198
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,180
I've been trying really hard,

199
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,820
but I'm still suffering a lot.

200
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,740
Why does time pass so slowly?

201
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,740
I feel that my life is over.

202
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,420
Benben,

203
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,180
give time itself some time.

204
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
I miss her so much.

207
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,260
Uncle,

208
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,380
our teacher asked us

209
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,740
to talk with families

210
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,820
to decide

211
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,090
for which college and major to aim.

212
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,770
Judging from your current grades,

213
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,330
you can have a go at PKU.

214
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,010
Isn't there a recommendation quota next term?

215
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,620
You can give it a try.

216
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,770
Your aunt and I won't force you.

217
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,690
It depends on whether you like it or not.

218
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,320
Is it actually that good to go to PKU?

219
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,690
Of course.

220
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,820
So many people wish to go, but they can't.

221
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,650
Can your brother Feifei have this aim?

222
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,440
No. It will be a dream.

223
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,300
Look, the boy is so funny now.

224
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,860
It's good to be young.

225
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,690
Do whatever you want to do.

226
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,130
Yanyi, are you sick?

227
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,300
Zhouzhou, I seem to be really sick.

228
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,620
I can't sleep all night.

229
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,060
I feel nauseous

230
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,940
every time I see those numbers and characters.

231
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,650
I often sit at the desk

232
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,500
until one or two in the morning,

233
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,010
but I can't turn a single page.

234
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,650
Why is it that no matter how hard I learn,

235
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,740
my grades are still the same?

236
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,130
Zhouzhou, what exactly am I suppose to do?

237
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,820
I really don't know what to do.

238
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,010
I even feel sick

239
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,010
at the sight of Zhen Hua's gate.

240
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,380
I don't want to go to school any more.

241
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,420
I don't want to take Gaokao. I'm scared.

242
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,450
If you don't want to go to school,

243
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:10,980
then don't go to school.

244
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,180
Go home to sleep, paint or play games.

245
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,820
But if I miss one week's lessons,

246
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,080
I will fall behind again.

247
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,060
You've been like this for two days.

248
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,740
It's no use sitting here.

249
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,060
Yu Zhouzhou,

250
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,330
I want to ask you a question.

251
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,420
What do you want to do when you grow up?

252
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,820
I don't know.

253
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,130
What am I going to do if even you don't know?

254
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,650
You can paint.

255
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,820
I've promised my parents

256
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,980
that I won't paint until after Gaokao.

257
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,690
You can paint even if you have to take Gaokao.

258
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,500
Why not take the entrance exam for art college?

259
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,850
I've thought about going to art college.

260
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,980
But...

261
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,620
But what if I fail the exam?

262
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,260
There will be no turning back for me.

263
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,570
Beijing Technology and Business University,

264
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,450
Finance.

265
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,650
Can you tell me why you chose Finance?

266
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,860
Its admission score was the lowest last year.

267
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,300
Do you know what Finance is about?

268
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,130
No.

269
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,650
Zheng Yanyi,

270
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,620
look at your current grades.

271
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:36,740
Which key college do you have

272
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,060
100% confidence to be admitted to?

273
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,860
Mr. Wu, I will work hard.

274
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,090
I will work really hard. I...

275
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,620
Not everything can be achieved

276
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,940
only by working hard.

277
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,130
Do you understand, Yanyi?

278
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,130
Have you thought about

279
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,090
taking the entrance exam for art college?

280
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:51,860
Yes, I have.

281
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,450
Then why didn't you write it?

282
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,620
My family won't allow me.

283
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,690
They say it's a shame for a honors class student

284
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:00,860
of Zhen Hua to take the exam for art college.

285
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,300
Nonsense! Who said that?

286
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,380
Many painters and singers

287
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,560
are quite successful.

288
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,650
It's true that some who can't study well

289
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,450
see the exam for art college as a shortcut.

290
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,180
But you are different. You love painting.

291
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,090
I've seen your painting.

292
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,450
Why don't you cherish

293
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,410
your own talent?

294
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,530
Mr. Wu, you don't know

295
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,130
that my art skills

296
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,300
are in fact not as good as what you think.

297
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,410
If a night pearl wants to see its own light,

298
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,290
it has to be on a dark night

299
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,800
when you are hardly able to see things.

300
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,290
The light of the night pearl will be blinding.

301
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:06,780
Mr. Wu...

302
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,170
Why didn't you fill in the major?

303
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,930
I haven't decided which one to choose.

304
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,450
Then can you tell me

305
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,970
why you chose PKU?

306
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,490
Because PKU is good.

307
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,090
Yu Zhouzhou,

308
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,440
Others saying PKU is good

309
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,810
doesn't necessarily mean that it suits you.

310
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,500
You have to know where you want to go

311
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,690
and what you want to do in the future.

312
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,170
I don't know.

313
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,810
I'm not discouraging you from going to PKU.

314
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,210
PKU is good.

315
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,380
I've been telling you

316
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:47,930
not to know nothing but study.

317
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,020
You have to know what you are studying for.

318
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,930
At least you should find a reason

319
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,620
to convince yourself.

320
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,610
If you get admitted to PKU in the future,

321
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,370
which I believe you can,

322
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,810
and find out it's not the college you want,

323
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,980
what can you do?

324
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,410
You don't even know who to blame, right?

325
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,450
Okay.

326
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,450
I'll give you one more week.

327
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,570
Think about it.

328
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:10,740
Okay.

329
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,200
Stop what you're doing now.

330
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,740
I have something that I want to tell you.

331
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,140
I've already seen

332
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,290
your targeted schools in the volunteer forms that you handed in.

333
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,860
I am very dissatisfied.

334
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,090
The purpose of asking you to fill in the  volunteer forms

335
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,540
is to let you think about

336
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,440
what kind of major will you pursue in the future.

337
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,260
As a result,

338
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,860
you just fill in them casually to perfuse me.

339
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,210
I tell you,

340
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,770
even if you are admitted to a prestigious university

341
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,450
that everyone envy in the future,

342
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,570
you would not only fail to learn well

343
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,160
but also learn very tired

344
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,780
if you didn't choose the major you like.

345
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,170
This is a real waste of time,

346
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,570
and a waste of your youth.

347
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,690
That's right. Our current education

348
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,540
just blindly requires you to study hard,

349
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,800
but does not require you

350
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,050
to think about why you should study hard.

351
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:22,810
Of course.

352
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,570
We can't change this situation for the time being.

353
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,810
However, I hope you will seriously think about

354
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,920
what kind of people

355
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,290
you want to be in the future.

356
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,200
Class,

357
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,660
in my view,

358
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,450
all of you are individuals who are full of energy,

359
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,410
full of vitality

360
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,050
and of cool personality.

361
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,330
I believe that

362
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,330
your dream is definitely not a single color.

363
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,290
I hope that after the self-study class,

364
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,780
everyone take your volunteer forms back,

365
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,610
rethink about your target schools,

366
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,860
and think about them carefully.

367
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,410
You should give them to me after filling them out.

368
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,410
Good morning.

369
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,090
Yu Zhouzhou,

370
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,660
I heard that you are going to apply for Peking University.

371
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,900
Will you change your targeted school

372
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,980
after being criticized by teacher Wu?

373
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,570
I don’t know. I didn’t think about it quite well.

374
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,170
Don't change, please. Didn't we decide we would go to Beijing together?

375
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,410
When did I agree with you?

376
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,740
Didn't we agree tacitly?

377
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,020
What if I can't pass the exam?

378
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,260
If you can’t pass the exam,

379
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,540
who else in our school can pass it?

380
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,780
-Lin Yang, thank you. -Zhan Yanfei.

381
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,140
Zhan Yanfei. What's wrong? Zhan Yanfei.

382
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,570
Zhan Yanfei. Are you fine?

383
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,450
Little swallow.

384
00:21:59,540 --> 00:21:59,810
What happened?

385
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,570
Little swallow.

386
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,450
I don't know. She fainted while running.

387
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,260
Hurry up. Take her to the infirmary.

388
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,890
Let's go. I'll carry her on my back.

389
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,570
Let's go.

390
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,370
Dr., how is she?

391
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,740
She has low blood sugar.

392
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,140
she will be fine after injecting a little glucose.

393
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,690
It is possible that she went for a run without eating.

394
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,450
Take good care of her.

395
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,860
She is in very bad health now.

396
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,780
It’s cruel for you

397
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,890
to run without eating.

398
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,140
I remember.

399
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,540
Why are you doing so?

400
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,620
Even the doctor said taht

401
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,290
it's dangerous to exercise without eating.

402
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,780
Why are you doing so?

403
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,290
I'm about to take the art exam.

404
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,570
The teacher said that I have a nice voice,

405
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,860
but my external image is not very good.

406
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,900
Even so, you can't use such an extreme method.

407
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,140
You can take your time.

408
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,050
I don't have much time.

409
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,900
I only have this chance.

410
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,380
If I failed this time,

411
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,410
I would probably have to give up completely.

412
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,450
I'm coming. I'm coming.

413
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,740
Hurry up. Hurry up. Take a bite.

414
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,780
I. I will not eat.

415
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,450
Take a bite, please.

416
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,170
You can't risk your physical health

417
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,660
just for the sake of the image.

418
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,210
Exactly.

419
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:16,850
How dangerous it is.

420
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:18,900
Zhouzhou.

421
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,450
I'm not for the image.

422
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,900
I'm for my dream.

423
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,860
Actually, I think you are quite healthy. That's true.

424
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,210
Look at the present hosts

425
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,900
who are as thin as bamboo poles.

426
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,090
How blant they are just standing there.

427
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,380
I. I don't mean that.

428
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,860
I mean you are not fat at all.

429
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,900
Really. Not at all.

430
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,040
Thank you.

431
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,770
Little swallow. No matter what you are like,

432
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,260
you will always be Little swallow in our hearts.

433
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,200
Qianqian.

434
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,690
What are you doing?

435
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,260
Have you filled out your volunteer form?

436
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,980
I handed it in, but it was returned.

437
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,780
Why?

438
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,690
Teacher Wu said we didn't write it seriously.

439
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,400
Do you seriously think about it? Where do you want to go?

440
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,620
Anywhere except Beijing.

441
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,690
Me too. Me too.

442
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,210
I also don't want to go to Beijing to study.

443
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,210
I really envy you. You all have your own dreams,

444
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,170
and places you want to go.

445
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,210
How could you not?

446
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,930
Everyone told me that

447
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,170
you should go here and there,

448
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,860
but I really don’t know where to go.

449
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,210
I now feel that

450
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,210
a university close to home is also good.

451
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,860
Southern universities are also fine.

452
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,780
I prefer warmer places.

453
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,410
No. Yu Zhouzhou.

454
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,330
Don't cheat me.

455
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,260
I've told you about my goal in the beginning.

456
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,450
You don't have to go to Beijing for me.

457
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,660
Didn’t you also want to go to Beijing

458
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,620
for senior Chen. For senior Chen An in the beginning.

459
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,140
Yes. But I don’t even have this reason now.

460
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,410
Can't you go to Beijing for me?

461
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,050
No. No. I mean that

462
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,020
it would be nice

463
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,620
if we go to college together.

464
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,540
After all, we have been classmates for so many years.

465
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,620
Lin Yang, this is not the high school entrance exam.

466
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,170
I know,

467
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,980
but I don’t think there's any difference.

468
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,290
Even so, you can't be so rash to make a decision

469
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,450
just bacause of me.

470
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:41,980
Zhouzhou.

471
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,850
If you decide where to go, please tell me.

472
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,050
I can also go to the south,

473
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,140
and I also like warm places.

474
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,410
Yanyi. Don't you continue to take the selft-study class in the evening?

475
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,810
Zhouzhou. I'm going to the sophomore class tomorrow.

476
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,980
So suddenly?

477
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,210
It’s too late for me to take this year’s art exam,

478
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,080
and I'm also not ready.

479
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,810
So I decide to repeat a year in school

480
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,210
to start learning to draw again.

481
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,170
Really?  That's awesome.

482
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,320
Actually, I may not be suitable for studying by nature.

483
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,540
Teacher Wu finally persuaded my parents

484
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,280
who decide to give me one year more

485
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,980
to let me try to draw seriously.

486
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,170
I am really happy for you.

487
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,380
Actually, but for you and Mi Qiao,

488
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,260
I wouldn’t be able to make this decision.

489
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,900
We all think that you can draw very well,

490
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,020
and we all think that you are very talented.

491
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,050
Alright.

492
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:00,540
This is for you.

493
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:07,420
[forever together Friends MYZ]

494
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,540
So when I see you next time,

495
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,620
I may be your junior.

496
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,780
Yanyi. You're the most brilliant people that I've ever met.

497
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,690
It is you and Mi Qiao who give me the courage.

498
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,090
Thank you.

499
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:22,930
Fighting.

500
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,930
Goodbye. Zhouzhou.

501
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,860
Yanyi. Goodbye.

502
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,410
Goodbye. Yanyi.

503
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:29,740
Goodbye.

504
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,040
Goodbye.

505
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,020
Goodbye.

506
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,780
Goodbye.

507
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:42,690
Goodbye.

508
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,050
Fighting.

509
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,020
Goodbye.

510
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,930
Little swallow. Fighting.

511
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,930
Thank you. Zhouzhou.

512
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,380
Jiang Chuan. Are you going to take the exam as well?

513
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,140
No. Yes.

514
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:27,810
No.

515
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,290
What exactly are you going to do?

516
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,800
I'm going to do something amazing.

517
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,010
You will know soon.

518
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,020
Zhouzhou. Could tell me about the grammar of this question?

519
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,330
Whose text message are you waiting for? You are so absent-minded.

520
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,330
I'm waiting for the text message of Little swallow.

521
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,660
She took the art exam today.

522
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,780
I don't even know how her exam result is.

523
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,500
It’s okay. No matter what the result is,

524
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
she’s very brave.

525
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,290
Yes. She is much better than me.

526
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,210
Haven't you figured your targeted school out yet?

527
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,740
I feel that I am so bored.

528
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,010
I don't even have any hobby.

529
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,020
Don't you like cartoon?

530
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,380
How about you learn to draw as well?

531
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,170
I have no talent for drawing at all.

532
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,410
That's true. The autobiographical illustration that

533
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,930
you gave me is too ugly.

534
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,050
If you don't want it, give it back to me.

535
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,900
Nobody said I don't want it. I like ugly illustration.

536
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,050
But this is an objective evaluation.

537
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,410
You can learn translation.

538
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,050
The translation you gave me

539
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,210
is much better than others.

540
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,780
Really?

541
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,140
Yes.

542
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,530
Hello, Xiao Yan.

543
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,380
Hello, Zhouzhou. I'm at the gate of your school.

544
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,500
Can you come out?

545
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,140
Why are you here?

546
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,090
I'm here to say goodbye.

547
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,500
Where are you going?

548
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,690
You are going there.

549
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,620
Mi Qiao ever said that

550
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,660
the rainbow has its own end.

551
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,020
I thought she was joking.

552
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,860
Later, I realized that

553
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,920
I was too short-sighted.

554
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,090
I also want to see what it looks like at the end of the rainbow.

555
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,920
How long will you be there?

556
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,570
I don't know.

557
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,140
Maybe a month. Maybe a year.

558
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,660
It is also possible that I will never come back.

559
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,980
Mi Qiao is a person who can't have nothing to do.

560
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,690
There are so many places that she has never gone to.

561
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,410
She is unwilling to be like that.

562
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,410
I have time, so I will help her to achieve her dream.

563
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,330
Ok.

564
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:12,890
Zhouzhou.

565
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,780
Thank you.

566
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,810
We should all grow up well.

567
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,280
Lin Yang.

568
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,370
Take good care of Zhouzhou in the future.

569
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,050
Still, if she is not happy,

570
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,690
I will come back to beat you

571
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,200
even in the Himalayas.

572
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,170
Don't worry.

573
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,380
I won't give you the chance to come back.

574
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,650
The barbecue stalls are still in the dormitory.

575
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,810
If you have nothing to do,

576
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
you can set up the grill again.

577
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,540
In case

578
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,900
I come back someday,

579
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,810
I can know where to find you.

580
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,740
Goodbye.

581
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,740
I am leaving.

582
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,090
Don't miss me too much.

583
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,900
My father passed away early,

584
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,170
so I was raised by my mother alone.

585
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,570
My family also owed a lot of money,

586
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,690
so my mother hoped that one day.

587
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,290
Brother,

588
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,140
excuse me.

589
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,740
Is this a singing competition?

590
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:32,450
What's wrong?

591
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,900
What are you reciting?

592
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,140
Is it your first time to participate in this competition?

593
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,170
Alright. I've been here several times.

594
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,260
You'd better prepare a manuscript and memorize it quickly.

595
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,970
I don't have to prepare. I'm all set.

596
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,740
So you came here prepared too.

597
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,210
Then why were you acting stupid?

598
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,620
We'll see which one of us has it worse.

599
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,540
Having it worse?

600
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,170
Jiang Chuan.

601
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,050
Cheer up!

602
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:57,860
Where's Jiang Chuan?

603
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,330
Come on!

604
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,210
I'm here!

605
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,050
My father died young,

606
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,450
and my mother was left alone.

607
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,140
The program time is limited,

608
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,860
speak less and just sing, okay?

609
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:09,400
Don't be nervous.

610
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,000
[Happy Boys Studio 1]

611
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,580
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

612
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,820
I'm contestant number 222. My name is Jiang Chuan.

613
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,090
I'm 17...17 years old.

614
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:31,100
Why do you come to the contest?

615
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,540
I'm here for a girl.

616
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,170
I wish she could see me on TV.

617
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,060
We've known each other since we were very young.

618
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,120
We went to the same kindergarten,

619
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,060
primary school and middle school,

620
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,370
and now we are in the same high school.

621
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,050
She's the most beautiful one in my life,

622
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
and also the most pretty one.

623
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,500
But in her eyes,

624
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,540
I am very ordinary and humble.

625
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,060
Let's sing first.

626
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,610
Sir, I still have one last sentence.

627
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,850
Ling Xiangqian, although in your life

628
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,580
there are people better than me,

629
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,540
I will always stand by your side,

630
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,580
to protect you for a lifetime.

631
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,580
What song will you sing?

632
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,930
I am ugly, but I am gentle.

633
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,300
Let's go get something to eat.

634
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:52,730
I'm not hungry.

635
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,020
But I'm hungry.

636
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,690
I'll treat you to McDonald's.

637
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,540
Hamburgers, french fries, chicken wings, whatever you want.

638
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,400
Really? So I'm leaving?

639
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,780
I can get you what you want.

640
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:10,740
No.

641
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,020
I'd like to have two hamburgers.

642
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,740
I don't want to go through this again.

643
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,170
I want to eat whatever I want.

644
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,170
I don't have to run when I'm not in the mood.

645
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,640
I don't want to listen to everyone to tell me,

646
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,410
little swallow, you used to have a lot of good,

647
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,850
how do you become like this?

648
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,020
I don't care how thin they are or how beautiful they are.

649
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,260
I just want to be myself

650
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,890
instead of little swallow.

651
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,580
But, Zhouzhou,

652
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,020
I'll never get another chance.

653
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,330
What's wrong now?

654
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,610
I can't work out this geography problem again.

655
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,050
I don't think you were thinking about it at all.

656
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,810
You're right.

657
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,300
One by one, everyone found

658
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,410
what they wanted to do.

659
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,640
Benben and Yanyi are gone,

660
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,850
I suddenly feel so lonely.

661
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,820
You still have me.

662
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,930
Then help me with this problem.

663
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,260
We learned it in grade 1 of high school, about the deflection force of earth rotation.

664
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,020
Master Lin, with your theoretical knowledge of physics,

665
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,930
please help me work it out.

666
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,540
I forgot all about it.

667
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,540
What the hell is this deflection force?

668
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,300
What's the use of you?

669
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:56,780
I know!

670
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,740
The Municipal Science Museum happens to have

671
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,100
a simulation system for georotational force.

672
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,540
Check it out. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

673
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,120
Don't bother.

674
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,450
How did you learn politics?

675
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,690
Grandpa Deng has said that

676
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,610
practice is the sole criterion for testing truth.

677
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,170
We have nothing to do in the afternoon, so we should eat quickly

678
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,260
so as to have a look around after eating.

679
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:10,690
Okay.

680
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,370
Why are there no people?

681
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,540
Who would be as idle as the two of us?

682
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,210
Where do you think the project is?

683
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,200
I haven't been here for a long time.

684
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,610
Take your time and look around.

685
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,290
Fine.

686
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,450
In the course of operation,

687
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,890
you should look closely at each other

688
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,540
to stay relatively still,

689
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,850
which will reduce vertigo.

690
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,650
Zhouzhou,

691
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,540
Look at me when you get dizzy.

692
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,370
I will.

693
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,500
Lin Yang,

694
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,450
look at me.

695
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,850
Where're you, Zhouzhou?

696
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,810
I'm right in front of you, open your eyes.

697
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,060
I can't find you.

698
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,370
Open your eyes! It's fun!

699
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:13,980
Zhouzhou,

700
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,450
Zhouzhou, look.

701
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,850
How's that? Isn't it better than your brother Chen's

702
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,930
secret forest?

703
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,170
Why are you holding a grudge?

704
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:06,920
I'm not.

705
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,410
Meanie.

706
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,300
Yu Zhouzhou.

707
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,250
You have a big face taking pictures lying down.

708
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:19,850
Lin Yang!

709
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,930
This place is fun.

710
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,340
Why haven't you brought me here before?

711
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,890
This is just to help you with the problem.

712
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,490
What were we looking for again?

713
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,690
Zhouzhou, promise me one thing.

714
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:35,690
What's that?

715
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,100
There are two months left. Don't hesitate.

716
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,780
Stick to one goal and never waver.

717
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,570
But I don't know what I want to do.

718
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,300
My dad told me when I was a kid that

719
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,090
if you don't know what you want,

720
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,450
you should try to be the best at everything

721
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:50,980
and wait for the best opportunity.

722
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,410
Now the best opportunity is in front of you

723
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,210
and it's time to make a choice.

724
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,690
I don't know

725
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,170
if I can learn my major well in the future

726
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,500
or like it.

727
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,060
But we are still young

728
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,360
and have so much time to try.

729
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,300
Maybe others just tell you,

730
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,260
how good the school is,

731
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,980
how great the major is,

732
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,930
but about whether it's really good or not,

733
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,780
we need to experience

734
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,740
to have our own understanding, right?

735
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:17,570
Zhouzhou,

736
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,450
I want to go to college in the same place with you.

737
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,370
Because you are a part of my dream.

738
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:27,690
Lin Yang,

739
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,980
I might know what my dream is.

740
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:30,770
What is it?

741
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,300
To ask you to delete that picture.

742
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,850
Okay, I'll help you make it happen.

743
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,610
But I had already sent it to Jiang Chuan.

744
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,690
Lin Yang!

745
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,930
Yu Zhouzhou, I was looking for you.

746
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:57,730
Hello, Mr. Wu.

747
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,050
Mr. Wu.

748
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,580
Lin Yang, I want to talk to Yu Zhouzhou,

749
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,690
you can go back to class.

750
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:03,300
All right.

751
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:05,820
Hiding from me?

752
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,780
No.

753
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,260
Tell me about it. How are you thinking?

754
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,450
I've thought about it. I still want to go to Peking University.

755
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,890
Good. It's good to stick to your own ideas.

756
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,290
Can you tell me your reason?

757
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,210
Because I made a promise.

758
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,260
Yu Zhouzhou, Yu Zhouzhou.

759
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,580
I've been talking to you for nothing.

760
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,820
Mr. Wu.

761
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,340
In fact, since my childhood,

762
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,500
I have always wanted to be a warrior, a great scientist.

763
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,580
But I don't know from when,

764
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,200
I became a student who only knows learning

765
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,930
and trys very hard to get a high score.

766
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,780
This is the tragedy of our education.

767
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,300
But you shouldn't...

768
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,610
But things are different now.

769
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,200
Because someone told me that

770
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,610
I'm a part of his dream.

771
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,740
So I want to help him to finish this dream,

772
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,890
one day I will have my own dream.

773
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,580
Mr. Wu, you can rest assured.

774
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,100
I'm sure I'll spare no effort.

775
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,300
Maybe I'll be able to tell you the answer in the future.

776
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,850
I'll be waiting for your answer, okay?

777
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:15,370
Go back to your class.

778
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,410
Goodbye, Mr. Wu.

779
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,650
Auntie.

780
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,100
Did your shopping today? Come.

781
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,740
Please change to channel 7 first.

782
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,690
No problem, so be it.

783
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,100
What did you bring us here for?

784
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:41,450
Today,

785
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,780
I think you are all very tired of studying,

786
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,340
so I just let you all come here for a break.

787
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,340
Who would be resting here?

788
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,880
Is it a treat?

789
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,580
Help yourself to anything.

790
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,340
It's my treat today.

791
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:52,610
I have so many papers left undone.

792
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,210
I'm going back.

793
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,980
Qianqian, one more minute, just one more minute.

794
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,890
Jiang Chuan, you're not really on TV, are you?

795
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,020
Just stay tuned.

796
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,980
I'll show you the most handsome I've ever been.

797
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,090
Jiang Chuan, isn't that you?

798
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,410
He's actually on TV.

799
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:17,980
Not bad, Jiang Chuan. When did you go?

800
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,930
Can't help it. I was chosen.

801
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,100
I'm contestant number 222. My name is Jiang Chuan.

802
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,370
I'm 17...17 years old.

803
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,610
What song will you sing?

804
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,740
I‘m going to sing the song called

805
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,210
I am ugly, but I am gentle.

806
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,450
You're going to sing, aren't you?

807
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,650
Okay, thank you.

808
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,130
You sing beautifully, Jiang Chuan.
