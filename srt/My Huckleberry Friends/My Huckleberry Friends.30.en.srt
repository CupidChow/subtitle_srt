4
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,730
Hey, Xie.

5
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,090
You are opening so late.

6
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,250
I went to Beijing to pick a friend up yesterday.

7
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,410
She just returned to China.

8
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,560
Wow, girlfriend?

9
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,500
It probably needs to take me

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,570
an entire year

11
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,180
to pick all them up one by one.

12
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,500
Stop bullshitting.

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,810
I've been visiting your place for around six years.

14
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,020
There were no girls around you.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,420
Not even a female dog was around your place.

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,890
Well,

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,340
the proprietress of the next door dumpling restaurant

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,420
seems have a crush on you.

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,420
Always give you dumplings at night.

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,170
Stop.

21
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,700
But you have no responds to her.

22
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,660
Are

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,410
you...?

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,170
Am I what?

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,740
I'm a person that

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,250
very open at this.

27
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,380
All love is equal.

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,140
Have you ever watched Ghost?

29
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,700
What?

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,690
Hurry up.

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,850
Clean up after you finish.

32
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:45,610
I'm going back to sleep.

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,380
You just open.

34
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,100
Not in the mood, I suddenly want to close.

35
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,610
Who's this?

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,700
Uncle, are you still opening?

37
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,530
No.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,780
Uncle, your stove has not been turned off yet.

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,340
Just make us something to eat.

40
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,579
Who are you calling uncle?

41
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,860
Are you after 85‘？

42
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,060
Nonsense, what kind of vision.

43
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,170
Sorry, elder uncle.

44
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,980
No time to talk, I'm going to slepp.

45
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,170
Then we are staying here and having some chit chat.

46
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,340
Up to you.

47
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,579
If we still cannot have any great shows

48
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,410
at this Art Festival,

49
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,420
our anime club should just disband.

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,360
Please come up some more ideas, president.

51
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,980
We are the smallest club at Zhen Hua,

52
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,780
it's not easy to live between the cracks.

53
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,650
I cannot carry all the dumb teammates.

54
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,250
Are you from Zhen Hu

55
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,420
anime club?

56
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,170
Why you asking?

57
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,980
Zhen Hua still has an anime club?

58
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,860
Uncle, I asked you to prepare some food,

59
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,340
you said you need to sleep.

60
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,860
Now, we are here to chat,

61
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,940
you get up and blend in.

62
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,090
Let's go.

63
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:23,980
Wait,

64
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,140
what do you want to eat?

65
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,700
The hardcore food, roasted chicken wings.

66
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,420
Having chicken wings in the early morning.

67
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,530
What's your name?

68
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,500
I cannot just call you big niece.

69
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,500
Let me introduce.

70
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,700
We are the most famous club at Zhen Hua,

71
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,860
anime club.

72
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,860
This is the establisher of the club, Chen Xiaoxiao.

73
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,730
Please give round of appluse.

74
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,810
Birds of a feather flock together.

75
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,600
Anime club‘s members are smug as always. Establishing the club?

76
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,170
Right, no one before or since.

77
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,340
That's not true.

78
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,340
The anime club was exciting ten years age.

79
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,450
No way.

80
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,700
I have asked,

81
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,090
we are the creators of the club.

82
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,050
Believe it or not.

83
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,090
Are you also from Zhen Hua?

84
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:09,570
No.

85
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,610
How could you know there was a anime club ten years ago?

86
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,530
Who told you that?

87
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,370
Who's the president of the club?

88
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,579
Why you have so many questions>

89
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,860
Finish the meal quick, I need to go back to sleep later.

90
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,209
Ah,

91
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,180
you are so irresponsible for your words.

92
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,620
Negate others casually.

93
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,020
Did you know how much efforts I put for the anime club?

94
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,490
Did you know how difficult to create a club?

95
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,090
I don't know, I just know that you are surely not the first one.

96
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,620
Little sister.

97
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,020
Don't want to eat anymore. Let's go.

98
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,740
You didn't pay yet.

99
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,460
Boss, when did you come back?

100
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,370
Not even noticed us.

101
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,210
We are still waiting for you to discuss the new business?

102
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,490
What business?

103
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,330
I've told you last time,

104
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,700
Yu and I bought a place

105
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
and want to make it a hotel.

106
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,410
You are majored in that field,

107
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,810
just come and help us to do the management.

108
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,920
I got no time,

109
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,130
my barbecue restaurant is busy enough.

110
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,650
What are busying for?

111
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,300
You just open a few hours a day.

112
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,650
I thought the money you made

113
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,300
was not enough for the electricity fee of the sign outside your restaurant.

114
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,210
Okay, okay.

115
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,250
Anything else?

116
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,770
No. Bye. I'm going to sleep.

117
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,740
Hello? Boss, consider it.

118
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,300
Hello?

119
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,020
Elder uncle.

120
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,460
Who are you calling elder uncle?

121
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,580
Don't messing around.

122
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,900
Uncle, this is the money I owe you.

123
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,460
I have no change.

124
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,650
How about roast some more skewers for you?

125
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,140
Uncle, can you do me a favor?

126
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,900
Here is your money back, leave now.

127
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,700
I didn't even say anything.

128
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,620
I don't want to listen, leave.

129
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,580
Uncle, can you tell me

130
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,250
who's the first president of Zhen Hua anime club?

131
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,050
My friend.

132
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,460
Then you must know a lot of stories of the anime club.

133
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,020
Tell me some.

134
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,810
Let me use the experience for reference.

135
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,810
The life-and-death

136
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,370
of the anime club is in your hand.

137
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,900
Life-and-death?

138
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,300
It doesn't matter

139
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,580
whether the club exist.

140
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,020
Of course not, that's all my hard work.

141
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,330
In addition, there are

142
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,330
two faithful club members.

143
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,980
I need to be responsible for them as a president.

144
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,650
The annual art festival is about to come.

145
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,300
Our club prepared a stage drama,

146
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,580
but Pan said it's not meaningful.

147
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,250
It was eliminated directly.

148
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,210
If we still do not have a good program,

149
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,420
our club will be banned.

150
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,420
What's your drama's name?

151
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,250
The Close Contact between GG Bond and Bramble.

152
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,810
Truly getting worse.

153
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,860
What did you say?

154
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,420
I said, you should have a drama with cutral background.

155
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,210
Let director Pan know that

156
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,250
anime club's drama can be educational.

157
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,970
You know principle Pan?

158
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,740
Uncle, please.

159
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,050
Tell me what should I do.

160
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,860
The one who created Zhen Hua anime club

161
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,980
must be a super-powered person.

162
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,420
The anime club encountered the same problem

163
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,650
ten years ago.

164
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,810
How they solved it?

165
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,130
Had a historical stage drama.

166
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,860
Cosplayed as Historical characters.

167
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,760
Skillfully by nominal.  Entrainment of private goods.

168
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,050
Super-powered person was smart.

169
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,460
How could I didn't come up with it?

170
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,860
Uncle, I'm leaving.

171
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,330
Uncle, come down to watch us rehearsal.

172
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,050
Uncle, we bring you breakfast.

173
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,140
Come down to eat.

174
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,900
You will get sick if you don't eat breakfast.

175
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,770
Boss Sun orders me to burn those ships.

176
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,890
To see my majestic hair and heroic appearance.

177
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,370
The enemies turn to ash before my smile fades away.

178
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,900
Oh No! What should we do?

179
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,500
Zhou Yu is burning our ships again!

180
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,740
Steal my nuts, eat my honey.

181
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,380
I need to count moon on the boat.

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,210
Stop. You are Cao Cao now, not Bramble.

183
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,380
Cao Cao is from Qiao village,

184
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,090
Why you have Dongbei accent now?

185
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,370
Come here.

186
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,210
Why you touched my stuffs without permission?

187
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,300
Leave and do what you should do.

188
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,210
Go away.

189
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,570
School didn't give us an rehearsal space.

190
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,980
Why cannot we rehearsal here?

191
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,210
I have no obligation to do so.

192
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,650
Why you so mean？

193
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,570
At lease you are a friend of the founder of anime club.

194
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,940
You treat her inferiors like this,

195
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,740
your friend will be mad.

196
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,300
You.

197
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,380
I won't take your place for nothing.

198
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,260
I can fan the fan for you.

199
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,260
Uncle, we are hungry.

200
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:15,820
I only have instant noodles.

201
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,010
Instant noodles, convenience noodles are my favorite.

202
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,420
Okay,

203
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:19,980
no problem.

204
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,570
I don't know you can make something else.

205
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,890
Aren't you only make one kind a day?

206
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,330
Eat it or not.

207
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,260
Move that box of inventories to the warehouse quickly.

208
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,850
Hurry up.

209
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,300
Wipe the two characters clean.

210
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,690
The color doesn't look right.

211
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,010
Harder, harder.

212
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,890
Hurry up.

213
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:39,940
Boss.

214
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,130
Boss.

215
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,090
Long time no see, brothers.

216
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,450
This is a nice place.

217
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,650
Boss, see.

218
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,690
I just hung up the paint today,

219
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,530
and put a God of Wealth underneath tomorrow.

220
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,770
It would be perfect.

221
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,500
You guys are great,

222
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,450
Much better then me.

223
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,530
Boss, we've figured everything out.

224
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,450
When you come back,

225
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,620
Three of us can manage the hotel well,

226
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,980
and open more hotels as chain store.

227
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,620
It will be a industrial empire.

228
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,090
I don't have much savings.

229
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,890
Spent most of them these years.

230
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,940
Don't worry, we arranged everything for you.

231
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
You just need to come back.

232
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,450
What can I do?

233
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,820
There is nothing

234
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,890
Murong Chenzhang cannot do.

235
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,010
It was the past.

236
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,210
Brother, I think...

237
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Okay, stop it.

238
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,690
Keep working,

239
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,820
I need to go.

240
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,650
Hurry up,

241
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,130
I'll send you back home after you finish.

242
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,770
Also, don't come here every day.

243
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,010
You come to my place everyday,

244
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,210
do you have time to study?

245
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,010
No, this is my spare time.

246
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,980
It wiill not effect my study.

247
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,770
Well, you don't look like a student with good grades.

248
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,210
There is no different between study or nor.

249
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,130
Uncle, are you form Zhen Hua?

250
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,490
Is anyone from Zhen Hua has this kind of job?

251
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,130
Why do you know our school so well?

252
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,380
I have several friends graduated from Zhen Hua.

253
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,300
Are they also from the anime club?

254
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,170
Are they friends with the super-powered person?

255
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,490
Yes.

256
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,860
Where is the super-powered person?

257
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,010
Does she still into Cosplay?

258
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,770
Can I meet her in person?

259
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,290
No idea.

260
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,180
You don't talk anymore?

261
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,570
Aren't you friends?

262
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,330
She...

263
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,770
What about her?

264
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,940
Nothing. I wasn't serious.

265
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,420
All you have to do is to study and prepare for your exam.

266
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,010
Don't let your parents worry about you.

267
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,380
Stay away from those messed up matters.

268
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,690
Finished it up. I will

269
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,450
This isn't a messed up matter.

270
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,530
If Senior Mi Qiao heard you said that

271
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,130
she will be upset.

272
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,260
The one she likes isn't what you right now.

273
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,530
Alright Uncle, see you.

274
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,500
I will come for you again.

275
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,180
All the girls keep crying when watching this film.

276
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,980
Except you, eating.

277
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,380
I'm crying.

278
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,620
This place is very hard to find.

279
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,770
Here is the only place that still plays old films.

280
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,090
Can you play slight more attention?

281
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,940
Why you decided to watch this one?

282
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,940
Is being said that this film is very touching.

283
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,300
Is it?

284
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,120
I don't get it.

285
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,010
Comics? So random.

286
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,860
So boring.

287
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,770
Why you so boring today?

288
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,380
Where is your little girl?

289
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,690
Never thought you so attractive.

290
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,890
Stop it. She is in high school.

291
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,010
Not open today

292
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,080
No food for you.

293
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,530
Give me a bowl of instant noodles too.

294
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,620
No noodles.

295
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,180
What a partial person.

296
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,210
Oh,

297
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,570
I have a question that I aways want to ask you.

298
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,420
We are friends for a long time

299
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,450
but I rarely see you laugh.

300
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,330
Every time I mentioned about you girlfriend

301
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,530
You never say anything.

302
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,770
You just to go bed.

303
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,770
Have you been stimulated?

304
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,690
She's dead.

305
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,770
Congenital heart disease.

306
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,300
Didn't make through her 18th year.

307
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,090
After she was gone, I went to a lot of places.

308
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,440
The scenery she wanted to see.

309
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,010
The food she wanted to eat.

310
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,610
Meaningless.

311
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,620
She is gone.

312
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,210
You have to live for yourself, right?

313
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,570
What are you doing?

314
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,090
Come come come.

315
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,210
What are you doing?

316
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,250
So serious.

317
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,570
Xin Rui, give me a smile.

318
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,130
How pretty.

319
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,500
Have you ever imagined what you will be like ten years after?

320
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,820
Hello?

321
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,500
Hello Benben.

322
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,210
Zhouzhou.

323
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,620
What's going on?

324
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,650
Nothing,

325
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,410
Just want to call you.

326
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,380
Are you alright?

327
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,089
I'm fine, truly.

328
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,410
The shop is quite busy

329
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,170
I will visit you in Beijing after things are slowing down.

330
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,650
Welcome, just call me when you arrived.

331
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,140
Benben, I'm very very happy today.

332
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,570
Thank you.

333
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,050
Get to know you and Zhouzhou,

334
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,290
Is the happiest thing in my life.

335
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,500
What am I taking about?

336
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,170
Restart again

337
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:52,980
Benben

338
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,170
After the surgery

339
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,980
Can we go to Qinghai?

340
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,980
I heard there is a salt lake,

341
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,980
It looks like a mirror.

342
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,090
After the rain falls, the rainbow will form a circular ring.

343
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,660
Very pretty.

344
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,920
Seriously, we go together. Deal?

345
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,050
If

346
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:20,930
If

347
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,810
If. I mean only if,

348
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,900
If the surgery failed,

349
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,450
Don't give yourself a hard time.

350
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,690
For me. I will visit my mom first.

351
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,170
Scouting the right path.

352
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,810
Buy a land, house, and pay my loans before you arrive.

353
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,290
When you here decades later,

354
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,050
you must rent the house.

355
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,290
I can take you to do the fun things.

356
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,370
You know, I'm very curious person.

357
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,260
If I'm not around,

358
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,450
you must treat yourself well.

359
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,740
To see the all the scenery I didn't see.

360
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,900
To eat the all the food I haven't taste.

361
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,450
Therefore, I have no more regret.

362
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,900
Benben, do you know?

363
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,380
Ever since I met you,

364
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,450
I started to love and miss this world badly.

365
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,980
I started to become very greedy.

366
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,980
I wish I can live for one more day.

367
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,930
Another more.

368
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,860
More and more.

369
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,260
I was thinking sometimes,

370
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,810
If I never met you, would I be freer?

371
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,410
But I'm not regret.

372
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,380
Not even a slight.

373
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,930
Hello? I'm outside your hotel.

374
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,620
Come out to welcome me.

375
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,090
Shut up, just do it.

376
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,540
Coming back to business?

377
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,380
If I'm not back,

378
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,980
I'm afraid your hotel will close in a month.

379
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,290
A statue of the God of fortune?

380
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,810
The statue must be Guan Yu.

381
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,860
Boss lets go.

382
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,170
Just a meal,

383
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,900
all we need is to make a reservation.

384
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,900
Why we here to see the restaurant in advance?

385
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,250
This will be our last meal before we go to Australia.

386
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,860
It has a specific meaning.

387
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,500
Saisai,

388
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,690
is that all about?

389
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,090
Chen An

390
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,540
There is a thing I didn't tell you in adcence.

391
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,170
I asked your father to join us in tomorrow's diner.

392
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,570
He is your father no matter what.

393
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,210
Please reconciliation.

394
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,500
Why didn't you tell me in advance

395
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,450
Since he cannot go to Melbourne

396
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,650
for our wedding,

397
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,290
I wish meet him before the wedding.

398
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,780
I wish to get his blessing.

399
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,930
I haven't seen him for many years.

400
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,930
I heard his business was failed, he moved,

401
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,740
that woman was gone.

402
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,690
I don't even have his number.

403
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,860
How could you find him?

404
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,020
From your junior Zhouzhou.

405
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,370
She found him for us.

406
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:52,900
Will my father come？

407
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,080
At lease you will come, right?

408
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,920
In facts, I want to see him for many times.

409
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:07,330
Merely don't know what should I say when I meet him again.

410
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,410
So I booked the restaurant on the top floor.

411
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,280
The place close at 9,

412
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,020
I booked at 8:30

413
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,620
If there isn't anything to talking about,

414
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,020
At lease we can see some scenery toegther.

415
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,290
So you asked you father out at the day of graduation ceremony.

416
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,140
Right.

417
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,980
That's the only time I connected with him.

418
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,810
I asked him to attend my graduation ceremony

419
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,410
So I can reconcile with him.

420
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,450
But I regret after I contacted him

421
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,280
After feeling regret, I wanted to contact with him even harder.

422
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,500
In the end, I just madly wanted to know.

423
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,090
Would he come?

424
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,620
I want to know if he cares about me, his son.

425
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,020
Seems like Zhouzhou is right about you.

426
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,780
You are really a contradictory person.

427
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,570
But I remember you didn't wait for him on that day.

428
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,050
We went to the bar together.

429
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,930
I didn't dare to wait for him then.

430
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,370
I was afraid if he wasn't coming.

431
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,980
I was afraid if he didn't forgive me.

432
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,930
So I just waiting for him for half a hour.

433
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,780
Perhaps the flight was delayed?

434
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,810
Perhaps he had come.

435
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,380
I've always been so comforting myself this way.

436
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,020
The flight can be delayed,

437
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,740
but if in one's heart,

438
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,090
he still cares about he, he will never be late.

439
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,980
Almost 9,

440
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,170
10 years has passed,

441
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,680
I cannot even recall his voice.

442
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,260
The only thing left was when he called my name.

443
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,450
He taught me to play Contra when I was a kid.

444
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,860
He said, Chen An shoot! Chen An get down!

445
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,170
Chen An jump!

446
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,540
He said, Contra is just like father and son.

447
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,380
Fighting side by side.

448
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,260
Never thought even the Contra

449
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,140
has a ending.

450
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,900
Hello, check.

451
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,050
I'm sorry Mr. and Miss.

452
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,410
Our elevator is now under maintainance.

453
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,380
It will be good for use in 5 minutes.

454
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,780
Please wait for 5 minutes.

455
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,260
If not, you have to use stairs.

456
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,210
Fine.

457
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,380
Last 5 minutes.

458
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,250
We apologize

459
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,930
for wasting your precious time.

460
00:25:59,170 --> 00:25:59,930
Disappointed？

461
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,450
He didn't show up.

462
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,690
It's a good thing. I cannot keep live in my imagination.

463
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,380
I heard from Zhouzhou that your father hurt his leg.

464
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,020
And it's serious.

465
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,380
I want to buy a walking stick

466
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,930
in Australian.

467
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,740
Why doesn't Zhouzhou tells me?

468
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,260
I asked her,

469
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,740
She was afraid that you were indifferent to it.

470
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,980
She's afraid of seeing your ruthless expression

471
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,450
That's her style.

472
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,090
She is that kind person.

473
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,810
I will pick a walking stick myself.

474
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,090
What's wrong?

475
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,660
How long has the elevator been repaired?

476
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,090
About 40 minutes.

477
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,810
Is it only accessible by stairs?

478
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,780
Yes, Sir.

479
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,380
Thank you.

480
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,540
Not big deal.

481
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,170
So exhausted.

482
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,570
I said no rush.

483
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,810
You will go to Australian tomorrow.

484
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,560
If I'm not transfering in Beijing,

485
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,690
I wouldn't have a chance to see you.

486
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,170
I will come back.

487
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,450
You will get married

488
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,290
to the girlfriend you mentioned last time, right?

489
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,660
Never thought you will care this kind of things.

490
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,620
You never had a girlfriend before

491
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,980
and you were together for 2 years.

492
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,330
Consider of your age,

493
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,690
I think naturally,

494
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,780
You will get married.

495
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,210
"I never had a girlfriend before".

496
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:23,930
You are investigating me.

497
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,020
Your college classmate

498
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,500
is my instructor.

499
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,930
I asked him something about you,

500
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,140
It didn't against the law.

501
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:33,900
Not against the law.

502
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,140
It's normal to break up.

503
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,860
In facts, when you fall in love,

504
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,860
the heart is no longer feels empty.

505
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,570
But time passing by,

506
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,570
once that excitement faded out

507
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,140
the heart feels even more empty.

508
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,210
I said I'm a mortal too.

509
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,860
Don't look at me like I'm an angel falling to the ground.

510
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,900
This is nothing. I'm always like this.

511
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:07,020
You know, I broke up because

512
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,500
I realized there are some untouchable things in everyone's soul.

513
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,540
She has hers and I have mines.

514
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,500
Very your style.

515
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,900
However, I'm getting marry for real.

516
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:21,980
Congratulations.

517
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:23,740
And thank you.

518
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,210
For being a part of my life.

519
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,980
Congrats, for being so lucky.

520
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,720
[Golden Chicken Feather Award for Best Director Steve Ye]

521
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,260
Lin Yang not coming to pick you up?

522
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,330
Senior An.

523
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,020
If you need any help in the future

524
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,140
always let me know.

525
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,210
You too.

526
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,090
Remember to say hello to sister Saisai.

527
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,330
Then we go.

528
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:06,410
- See you - Alright

529
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,680
Bye bye

530
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:30,980
You didn't tell me that

531
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,330
You are going to Senior Chen An.

532
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,050
I've told you.

533
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,780
When we were having meal on that day.

534
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,620
Really?

535
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,900
In the matter of meeting the person you like,

536
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,090
the person you liked

537
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,500
I don't think I'm that carelessness。

538
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,620
In fact, that doesn't count as like.

539
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,570
It's more like a fascination toward an idol.

540
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,900
Feels like he is a God.

541
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,050
But right now I feel,

542
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,170
He is just one of us.

543
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,500
We are all mortals.

544
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,900
But a little bit special.

545
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,860
There a student from Zhen Hua called me another day.

546
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,210
Said want to record a return visit of Zhen Hua's graduates

547
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,020
Then I will pretend to be a journalist to interview you.

548
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,210
Let's have a rehearsal.

549
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,900
We are honor to have

550
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,260
a Honored graduate Yu Zhouzhou to join us today.

551
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,500
Dear Yu Zhouzhou,

552
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,380
How do you evaluate yourself in high school?

553
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,210
I felt when I was in high school,

554
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,260
I'm a quite timid person.

555
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,930
Cannot accept my mother's death.

556
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,170
Cannot face my father.

557
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,900
And a guy call Lin Yang.

558
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,570
So I can only choose to escape.

559
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,260
Lucky he kept trying to wake me up,

560
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,290
and eventually help me out.

561
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,770
Even is quite annoying,

562
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,140
But thank him anyway.

563
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,290
Good. Let's jump to the second question.

564
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,260
What's your feel towards Lin Yang?

565
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:05,900
What a person.

566
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,920
What kind of journalists are you?

567
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,170
You only ask the questions you concern.

568
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,290
Can you be a little bit more serious?

569
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,500
This is an interview.

570
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,540
Can you think of

571
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,780
our long timed relationship

572
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,020
and be responsible to Zheng Hua's school motto.

573
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,170
Answer truthfully.

574
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,780
This is Zhen Hua's interview. Anything to do with you?

575
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,290
Come on, see the camera.

576
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,170
Camera at this way.

577
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,500
I have known him for more than 20 years.

578
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,090
Honestly, I'm not sure my feeling about him.

579
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,370
What are you talking about?

580
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,290
I'm not done yet.

581
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,090
Until last year when malaria broke out in Africa.

582
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,570
I was forced to stay there.

583
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,170
I was so afraid.

584
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,900
Afraid of missing the chance to make farewell with him.

585
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,260
Alright, due to the time

586
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,050
our interview with Ms. Yu Zhouzhou

587
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:50,810
is over.

588
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,980
Next, we invited

589
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,410
the man behind Ms. Yu Zhouzhou, Mr. Lin- Lin Yang

590
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,860
Mr. Lin, what kind of feeling you have?

591
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,020
I think there is a sentence fits this moment,

592
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,740
Love is like fly a kite.

593
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,490
When Yu Zhouzhou wanted to feed lions in Africa,

594
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,020
I will respect her opinion for sure.

595
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,020
As long as she remembers me,

596
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,620
knowing my existence, that's enough for me.

597
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:12,900
Congratulations!

598
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,900
Just as the moonlight eventually flies through the clouds.

599
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,930
Great, that's the end of our interview today.

600
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,170
Thank you for watching.

601
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,210
Let's go.

602
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,900
This interview doesn't count.

603
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,090
Why am I feeling a little nervous?

604
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,140
Right, what if Ling Xiangxi runs away?

605
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,020
Bullshit.

606
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,170
Can't you just say something nice?

607
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,020
That's why I'm pushing you.

608
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,260
Get your marriage license today.

609
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,610
No, my mom calculated the date.

610
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,540
An ordinary day doesn't work.

611
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,090
Must be the luckiest day.

612
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,260
Do you have time to pick a date?

613
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,650
Hurry up!

614
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,080
Don't give her the chance to regret!

615
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,660
Why are you sound like I'm a liar?

616
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,450
We love each other, fully voluntary marriage.

617
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,140
Unlike you.

618
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,170
What about me?

619
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,380
You and Yu Zhouzhou

620
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,050
How many years have you wasted?

621
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,740
We are tried as the audience.

622
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,300
Our relationship is far beyond a normal couple.

623
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,580
Not the superficial love.

624
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,409
"Not the superficial love".

625
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,130
Does she ever said she loves you?

626
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:17,850
No.

627
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,690
You chasing her and saying you love her.

628
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,610
Did she ever reply?

629
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:23,690
No.

630
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,969
So, "Hurry up"!

631
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,929
"Don't give her the chance to regret!" Right?

632
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,780
Ling Xiangxi asked me to try it on.

633
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,010
So I did.

634
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,300
Lin Yang, does Zhouzhou pretty?

635
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,610
I think my wife is more pretty.

636
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,340
Zhouzhou

637
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:03,890
Will you...

638
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,780
Nevermind.

639
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
What do you want to say?

640
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,820
I just want to say... you so beautiful today.

641
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,890
So Senior Zhou, you have been to Africa.

642
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,210
Nothing to jealous about.

643
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,930
Yes I did go to Africa but almost lost my life.

644
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,100
Amazing.

645
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,450
No wonder Director Pan always compliment in school.

646
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,020
You are the legend of the school.

647
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,130
Director Pan.

648
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,740
In the art festival he asked me to

649
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,580
record the interview of the alumnus.

650
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,890
We will play it on the big screen at the festival.

651
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,500
Showing it to all the student in school.

652
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,060
Who else is in the interview.

653
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,450
Geng Geng, Yu Huai, Sheng Huainan, Luo Zhi,

654
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,300
Chu Tiankuo, Jiang Chuan.

655
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,170
Basically all the people I can find.

656
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,020
Except Senior Mi Qiao.

657
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,210
But her legend is still be told in school.

658
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,780
May I see it?

659
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,500
Of course.

660
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,890
Why do I want to study in Zhen Hua?

661
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,020
In fact, I just want to go to school with my other two friends.

662
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,300
Back then, I was a more pure person.

663
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,400
Do whatever I want to do.

664
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,450
Feels more happy.

665
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,100
I... I have a boyfriend now.

666
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,100
Do you have someone in your high school,

667
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,260
The one you like but didn't really like you.

668
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,130
Perhaps it's better in the childhood.

669
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,090
I thing present is more important than the past.

670
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,690
I am very appreciated of the days in Zhen Hua

671
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,690
If I can go back to my 17,

672
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,580
I want to appreciate a girl.

673
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,020
That girl let me know that I can do it.

674
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:38,930
What's wrong?

675
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,260
Did you eavesdrop on me outside the door?

676
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,570
No, it's an individual interview.

677
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,500
No family member.

678
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,890
Don't eavesdrop mine tomorrow.

679
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,060
I won't for sure.

680
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:52,980
Me either.

681
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,250
So you didn't hear anything, right?

682
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:59,410
You don't trust me?

683
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,880
I told you, when I arrived,

684
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:03,890
your interview was over.

685
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,850
Aren't you talking about your

686
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,690
big plan for Anime Club with Chen Xiaoxiao?

687
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,370
What happened?

688
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,890
Did you said something I cannot know?

689
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,170
So you nervous now.

690
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,370
No.

691
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,740
Yu Zhouzhou, you are not honest.

692
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,290
Eyes are flickering.

693
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,540
What did you say?

694
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,010
Nothing.

695
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,130
So let me guess.

696
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,170
Did you say that

697
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,020
there was a sun always shining on you.

698
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,290
Without him,

699
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,490
you will never become who you are now.

700
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,850
It's a little too much to compare me to the sun.

701
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,500
I admit I'm indeed very shining and warm,

702
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,820
my appearance and intelligence above average...

703
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,370
Lin Yang

704
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,410
When I wore the wedding dress,

705
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,020
what did you wanted to say?

706
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,540
I do.

707
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,260
I do.

708
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,930
I was lost.

709
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,780
Until I realized,

710
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,820
each relationship is mix with various kinds of emotions.

711
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,060
But those aren't matter.

712
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,690
Without you,

713
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,410
I wouldn't exist.

714
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,540
Lin Yang, I love you

715
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,690
The ring is on,

716
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,300
you cannot take it off.

717
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,930
I was thinking sometimes, my life after I grew up

718
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,690
felt like a spinning top.

719
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,780
Spinning round and round then back to the beginning.

720
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,020
And those waves like old times

721
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,690
were scouring everyone of us.

722
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,340
However, I think the one who live in my old times

723
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,260
is the best of me.

724
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,370
Because there was a sun,

725
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,450
always shining on me in my life.

726
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,740
Hold your hand, until we gone.

727
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,060
We only completed the first half of the sentence.

728
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,130
An emperor will be overthrow.

729
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,740
The fourth queen will lose her place.

730
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,170
But that doesn't matters.

731
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,890
Even millions of soldiers are chasing,

732
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,640
The fourth queen still holds the emperor's hand,

733
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,340
runaways fearlessly.

734
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,780
There are many years before we get old.

735
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:39,580
In those many years, there will be many changes.

736
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,020
Many happiness and many sadness.

737
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,980
For the last half of the sentence,

738
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,340
it will happen someday in the future.

739
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:06,800
