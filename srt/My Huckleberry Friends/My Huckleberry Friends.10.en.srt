00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,060
I'll do it right away.

We'll find a good photographic studio

92
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,610
to take some portraits

93
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,610

Let me think.

97
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,090
You can organise an activity.

In the blog of our school website,

99
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,860
you can have a vote for Zhen Hua's ambassadors.

100
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,170
Ask all the students to leave a comment in the post.

101
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,810
The two students with the highest number of votes, male and female,

102
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,420
will have their portraits taken by the school,

103
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,980
and then we will put  their photos

104
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,580
on our homepage.

105
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,700
So not only do you have a candidate,

106
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,649
but the blog will also be popular.

107
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,050
Right?

108
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,360
Can the people elected by the students be reliable?

109
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,860
I think it'll be more reliable than your choice.

110
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,900
Who is the page for?

111
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,420
For students, right?

112
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,300
The students' aesthetic is the most representative.

113

Good job, Wu.

115

We'll do it as you say.

This stupid Benben!

117
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,250
He lifted me off his back during the performance,

118
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,740
and if I haven't reacted quickly, the performance would have been ruined.

119
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,770
A month of my hard work almost went down the drain.

120
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,140
But that's not the version I heard.

121
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,050
He said that not only did you go into the men's bathroom

122
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,050
and make him get naked,

123
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,700
but you locked the door and made him catch a cold for days.

124
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,490
Anyway, I'm not done with him on this matter.

125
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,930
So what are you going to do about it?

126
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,530
The two of them? Leader Mi Qiao

127
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,180
and Leader Mu Rong, how else can they handle it?

128
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,140
Yan Yi gets me.

129
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,810

130
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,770
Help me invite him.

131
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,530
Two weeks later at the top of Kunlun, it's a fight to the victor.

133
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,330
What I'm best at, of course!

134
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,140
Have you heard?

135
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,210
Director Pan started a vote on the school blog.

136
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,370
What vote?

137
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,450
To choose Zhen Hua's ambassador.

138
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,810
The students with the highest number of votes will have their portraits taken,

139
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,370
and their photos will be put on Zhen Hua's website.

140
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,210
What ambassadors selection?

141
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,050
It's just the school choosing the school Mr. and Miss in disguise!

142
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,050
Why didn't you three respond?

143
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,020
People are going crazy in class 5.

144
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,580
They said they would go and vote as soon as class was out.

145
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,370
With those ugly people in their class,

146
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,140
I feel that they have no chance.

147
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,450
They might not have anyone, but our class does.

148
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,620
Any two of us in our class could wipe out the whole year.

149
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,420
Anyway, I think there's a popular choice at this table right here.

150
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,530
Who?

151
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,140
What are you talking about?

152
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,460
Zhouzhou, what are you smiling at?

153
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,740
With your baby face,

154
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,300
seems like you've been looking like that since you were eight.

155
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,740
If you want to be the ambassador of a kindergarten,

156
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,570
I approve.

157
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,930
If you can do this, I can too.

158
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,180
Who are you talking about just now?

159
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,460
Club leader Qiao!

160
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,180
Our Club leader Qiao has height

161
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,890
and good looks, too.

162
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,140
And she's also the leader of the Cartoon Club!

163
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,530
Stop! Are you teasing me?

164
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,250
If they are looking for the leader of Zhen Hua,

165
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,460
I would join.

166
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,300
The ambassador, someone with my looks?

167
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,420
Oh my god, I can't bear to look at it.

168
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,810
I'm full, I'll go first.

169
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,620
I'm not full, but I've laughed enough.

170
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,460
I'm leaving.

171
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,740
Don't go!

172
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,740
If you be selected, you'd officially be the school beauty of Zhen Hua.

173
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,700
Why can't you take it seriously?

174
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,620
By the way, I'm not going.

175
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,620
I'll listen to you.

176
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,980
I'm not going to keep talking, you're a gossip!

177
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,460
Eat your food.

178
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,330
Yan Yi,

179
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,800
do you think I can participate?

180
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,460
Really?

181
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,860
If your mother saw her precious son's photos

182
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,530
on the Zhen Hua's admissions website,

183
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,530
she must be smiling all over the face,

184
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,140
boasting to everyone,

185
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,770
Oh, this is our Yangyang!

186
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,250
Aren't you going to try for this that will bring such glory to your family?

187
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,090
I'm not interested.

188
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,690
It's better to leave the opportunity to those

189
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,900
who need to prove themselves

190
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,180
I don't need these gimmicks.

191
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,700
This is not a gimmick,

192
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,650
it's a glory.

193
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,770
You've been nagging me all morning,

194
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,210
what's your motive?

195
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,140
I have a sort of bad premonition,

196
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,740
if you don't participate,

197
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,460
I'm afraid Qianqian and that boy will participate together.

198
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,130
Then they will be the school's official Mr. and Miss,

199
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,890
a perfect couple made by the heaven.

200
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,530
And then I have to look at their portraits and force myself to smile.

201
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,520
Isn't that cruel?

202
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,770
Chu Tiankuo is so popular,

203
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,050
I'm in it for nothing.

204
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,810
What if I get chosen,

205
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,460
I'll take the portraits with Ling Xiangqian,

206
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,090
don't you feel awkward?

207
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,530
You can participate with Yu Zhouzhou!

208
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,580
Don't you know her personality?

209
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,860
Every time she comes across something good, she gives away.

210
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,900
When have you seen her

211
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,050
show any interest in these showy things?

212
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,650
It's not the same this time,

213
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,580
everyone is a little vain.

214
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Which girl would resent being pretty?

215
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,940
I know her very well.

216
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,179
She won't participate.

217
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,059
I can't help you this time.

218
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,679
Stop talking nonsense!

219
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,260
One Warcraft game card!

220
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,260
You'd better do it yourself.

221
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,060
Are we still friends?

222
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,500
Two! Two cards, okay?

223
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,060
Childish.

224
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,980
Quoting material. Summarizing material.

225
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,620
Once the central argument has been made,

226
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,320
then we analyse and prove it.

227
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,820
Analyzing the meaning of this part

228
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,090
is actually answering a question.

229
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,860
Why we say that? Actually

230
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,010
when you answer this part...

231
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,770
What happened?

232
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,330
Blood! Teacher, Xin Rui is bleeding!

233
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,260
Xu Zhiqiang, did you do it?

234
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,180
Yu Zhouzhou, take her to the infirmary!

235
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:37,860
Let's go.

236
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,940
All of you, sit down. What happened?

237
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,650
The corner of the right eyes is scratched. There's no danger.

238
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,320
It's lucky that this is just a superficial would.

239
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,090
You need to be more careful in the future.

240
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,260
Teacher, this won't leave any after-effects, will it?

241
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,530
It's fine, there might be a tiny scar.

242
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,260
This should be a reminder to you.

243
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,060
How did you fall like that during class?

244
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,890
Does this still leave a scar?

245
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,210
It's okay, I'm used to it.

246
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,880
Remove the bandage after a week.

247
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,180
Be more careful in the future.

248
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,300
If it had been a few millimetres to the left,

249
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,730
then it would have been dangerous.

250
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,330
It's done. Go back to class.

251
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,570
Thank you, teacher.

252
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,770
Thank you, teacher.

253
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,010
Xin Rui, let's go slowly, it's okay.

254
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,420
Zhouzhou,

255
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,130
I don't want to go back now.

256
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,380
Then where do you want to go?

257
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,940
Anywhere,

258
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,890
just not the classroom.

259
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,210
Actually me neither.

260
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,860
Do you feel better?

261
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:40,860
Zhouzhou,

262
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,090
Why do bad things

263
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,450
always happen to me?

264
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,500
Why am I so useless?

265
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,010
People always look down on me

266
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,170
and laugh at me.

267
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,740
Even my mother. My mother...

268
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,570
Let's play a game.

269
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,010
When I was young,

270
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,940
a big brother taught me about this game.

271
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,180
It's called "Game for protagonists".

272
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,650
I'm too stupid.

273
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,740
I thought when I became the group representative

274
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,290
and learned the cello,

275
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,380
they would say I was multi-talented.

276
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,420
But now I know,

277
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,330
none of those actually work.

278
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:47,820
Zhouzhou,

279
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,650
let's play a game.

280
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,620
Let's play "Game for protagonists".

281
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,210
Game for protagonists?

282
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,860
He told me, just imagine yourself as the protagonist,

283
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,690
even if you are despised by others and ridiculed

284
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,690
or even framed,

285
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,290
even if one day you suddenly fall off a cliff

286
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,570
and no one knows you are dead or alive,

287
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,860
but there'll always be a cave at the bottom of the cliff

288
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,010
and there'll be always secret books inside the cave.

289
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,570
By the time you reappear in the world,

290
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,530
there will be no one who can beat you.

291
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,860
Does this game really work?

292
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,330
It does!

293
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,210
When I was in middle school, I decided that

294
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,130
I would leave my familiar places

295
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,890
and say goodbye to my good friends.

296
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,180
The aim was to give myself a new start

297
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,820
in an unfamiliar environment,

298
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,980
free from anyone's interference.

299
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,500
Why?

300
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,060
Why do you want to work so hard

301
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,860
to prove yourself in a new environment?

302
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,180
Maybe it's just to see how much one is capable of.

303
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:20,770
Zhouzhou, I always think you're like a white swan

304
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,620
and seen as the central figure.

305
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,290
I was never a white swan.

306
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,180
I'm an ugly duckling.

307
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,130
And I'm not interested in becoming a white swan.

308
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,980
I'm just holding my breath to tell myself

309
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,530
that un ugly duckling can one day,

310
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,860
turn into a heroine

311
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,940
through their own efforts.

312
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,500
See? Don't I look like an oversized heroine?

313
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,180
I don't know if getting better grades

314
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,060
will make you happy.

315
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,180
But at Zhen Hua,

316
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,130
it might be your only way.

317
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,380
But I'm lagging behind too far,

318
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,060
I don't know how to make up for it.

319
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,940
I'll help you.

320
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,650
Zhouzhou,

321
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,210
can someone like me be a protagonist, too?

322
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,890
You're a protagonist already!

323
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,690
From now on, we're from the same faction.

324
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,010
Thank you for your help, heroine.

325
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,770
The green mountains will never change, the blue rivers will forever flow,

326
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,500
and when we meet in the future, let's take a friendly drink!

327
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,650
Oh, come on!

328
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,300
Fasten it.

329
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,450
What happened to your eye?

330
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,890
I hit myself by accident.

331
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,770
Oh my god, you have to be careful!

332
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,380
Don't end up failing at your studies

333
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,010
and injure yourself,

334
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,210
then I'll have to pay for a large amount of medical expenses,

335
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,330
and then how will our family survive?

336
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,980
Don't think your injury will save you from working,

337
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,569
come out  now and help me.

338
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,810
We have a customer buying cigarettes.

339
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:26,900
Coming.

340
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,980
Zhouzhou,

341
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,570
I and your aunt went to a shopping mall yesterday,

342
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,930
and bought you a new piece of clothing.

343
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,980
Try it on.

344
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,570
Come, try it.

345
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,260
Thank you, uncle, aunt.

346
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,140
You're welcome.

347
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,090
What, don't you like it?

348
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,810
I like it very much.

349
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,860
I told you that Zhouzhou likes this type of clothes

350
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,440
with cartoon patterns.

351
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,140
Let me tell you.

352
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,140
Your uncle chose a piece of clothing with lace surrounds,

353
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,450
but I told him it was not suitable.

354
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,210
Zhouzhou, you have a baby face.

355
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,800
What I chose for you suits you best.

356
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,380
If you wear lace clothes, you will look older than your age.

357
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,850
Right, your aunt is really thoughtful.

358
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,500
From now on, she is responsible for buying

359
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,540
clothes for you.

360
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,380
Although she looks ordinary,

361
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,740
she knows how to dress well.

362
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,860
Ok, I'll go to my room to try it on.

363
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,860
Thank you, uncle, aunt.

364
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,010
You mean who looks ordinary?

365
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,930
Sorry.

366
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,500
Your dad hit you again?

367
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,380
Don't mention it,

368
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,570
and please take me in for another night.

369
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:39,410
[Actually, the best ambassadors of Zhen Hua High School have to be Yu Zhouzhou and Lin Yang.]

370
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,530
Jiang Chuan,

371
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,780
did you release the post?

372
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,540
The masses have sharp eyes.

373
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,500
The masses think you are suitable.

374
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,380
I'm only one of the masses,

375
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,140
speaking up for them.

376
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
Don't joke with me,

377
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,090
only several people supported your post.

378
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,090
Others will consider me crazy.

379
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,490
All right.

380
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,450
Don't blame me.

381
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,980
I regretted.

382
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,010
I thought you and Zhouzhou, a perfect match,

383
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,540
would make a hit on Tieba

384
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,330
and outshine Chu Tiankuo and Qianqian.

385
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,290
Who knows the post was sunk

386
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,540
and you are no match to them.

387
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,160
This is really embarrassing.

388
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,330
How am I going to explain to Zhouzhou?

389
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,050
I'm telling you, delete the post before tomorrow morning.

390
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,500
How come only several people supported the post?

391
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,140
What happened to your aesthetic standards?

392
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,570
What about baby face? Baby face is adorable.

393
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,020
In ten years,

394
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,570
other people's faces will tell their ages,

395
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,930
but you will look like wearing a natural veil.

396
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,780
How mysterious.

397
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,780
Don't comfort me.

398
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,690
When I explained the game for protagonists to Xin Rui today,

399
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,500
there's one moment that I felt I lied to her.

400
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,620
It's like a green leaf

401
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,500
telling others about how to blossom.

402
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,450
I have never been the protagonist in the school.

403
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,450
Ling Xiangqian is the monitor in the class,

404
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,380
and Mi Qiao is the backbone in the association.

405
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,740
Even Lin Yang, whom you hate the most,

406
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,860
has always been leading me in many ways.

407
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,050
They are protagonists.

408
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,660
I'm just a witness.

409
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,780
Zhouzhou, I'm still confused.

410
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,850
Will you fight for the ambassador

411
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,540
of Zhen Hua High School?

412
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,570
I've made up my mind.

413
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,380
I will do it.

414
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,380
Even if I fail,

415
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,970
there will be a moment for me being the protagonist,

416
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,170
even though it's just a moment.

417
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,500
Zhouzhou, are you still on the phone?

418
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,780
Better sleep early.

419
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,210
I'm going to my bed now.

420
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,620
Zhouzhou,

421
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,780
I will always support you.

422
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:42,930
Thanks.

423
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,740
Right,

424
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,900
Mi Qiao let me tell you that

425
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,290
she will battle with you.

426
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,290
She's so narrow-minded and still holds a grudge.

427
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,210
Tell her I'm okay with it anytime.

428
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,090
Even medicine men, musicians and handicraftsmen do not think it disgraceful to learn from each other.

429
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,090
Reading articles?

430
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,620
When one of the literati and officialdom calls another man his "teacher"and himself his "student",

431
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,660
I'm asking you.

432
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,450
People will get together and invariably laugh at him. If you ask them why they are laughing, they will say...

433
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,930
Don't waste your time.

434
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,260
You'll still be one of the bottom rankings no matter how much you read.

435
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,290
Actually,

436
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,900
you are a poor guy.

437
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,860
It is clear that the tradition of learning from the teacher can no longer be restored.

438
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,740
Medicine men, musicians and handicraftsmen are despised by the gentlemen.

439
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,020
I checked in the morning, the post is still there.

440
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,850
Do you know why I didn't delete it?

441
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,210
This IP address logs in on Tieba each day,

442
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,050
and pays much attention to things related to Yu Zhouzhou.

443
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,930
Meanwhile, it voted

444
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,330
in my post.

445
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,050
Cut the crap.

446
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,930
Later, I asked for help from my cousin

447
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,290
who works in a telephone office.

448
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,860
He looked it up for me.

449
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,050
Guess where the address is.

450
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,620
Where?

451
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,860
Home of Yu Zhouzhou's uncle.

452
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,170
That means...

453
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,170
That means Yu Zhouzhou

454
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,900
has been paying attention to the ambassador thing,

455
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,290
and voted for herself.

456
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,610
Technically, she voted for you and herself.

457
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,740
This is Yu Zhouzhou wanting to participate,

458
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,050
and you won't say otherwise, right?

459
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
Are you sure about that?

460
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,290
If I say I'm 100% sure,

461
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,690
will you take actions immediately?

462
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,780
Of course!

463
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,090
If I and Yu Zhouzhou were chosen as the ambassadors,

464
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,620
that means

465
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,860
we would take advertising photos together.

466
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,560
We haven't taken photos together yet.

467
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,410
Not to mention the photos will be put on the website of the school.

468
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,400
In the future, when people think of Zhen Hua High School,

469
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,450
they will think of Lin Yang.

470
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,690
When they think of Lin Yang, they will think of Yu Zhouzhou.

471
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,250
-Sorry to interrupt. 
 -When they think of Yu Zhouzhou...

472
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,330
I remember last night someone yelled at me

473
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,500
to delete the post.

474
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,570
I have to delete it.

475
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,980
Don't delete it.

476
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,690
I have to.

477
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,860
Dude, my apologies.

478
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,660
Fine, one point card of the World of Warcraft.

479
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,560
Come on!

480
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,290
Two cards.

481
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:21,740
You're blackmailing me.

482
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,410
Then three cards.

483
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,170
Sit down.

484
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,980
Let's figure out a way

485
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,160
to increase votes.

486
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
I have thought about it.

487
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,690
Director Pan said it was a fair competition.

488
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,690
But there is a bug existing in Tieba's voting platform.

489
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,620
One ID can only vote for once.

490
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,280
If you want to increase votes,

491
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,620
you just need to register more IDs.

492
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,660
Don't sleep tonight.

493
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,380
Why?

494
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,930
Increasing votes for me.

495
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,770
What a coincidence.

496
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,210
I'm looking for this book.

497
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,050
It's borrowed every time it was returned.

498
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,210
Would you mind telling me

499
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,980
what kind of person do you want to be?

500
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,570
Let me tell you a story when I was a kid.

501
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,170
When I was in the fourth year of primary school,

502
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,900
I was chosen as the representative of outstanding students in the city

503
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,140
to participate in a laptop launch event.

504
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:27,090
I wore a shirt with a tie

505
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,570
and was surrounded by flashlights,

506
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,680
with journalists carrying their cameras and microphones.

507
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,290
You have been an excellent student since you were little.

508
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,570
Everything was perfect on that day,

509
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,500
until the organizer asked me to

510
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,980
typewrite "shining" (meaning Shan Liang in Chinese pinyin) on a computer.

511
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,140
I spent two minutes

512
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,450
typewriting nothing at all.

513
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,810
The journalists were gone.

514
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,900
I felt everything belonging to me

515
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,780
had left me.

516
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,260
I was depressed all day long.

517
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,660
You were too hard on youself.

518
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,780
I learned to type when I was in the third year of middle school.

519
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,660
Now I understand

520
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,410
what has been haunting me is not a failure,

521
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,500
but my obsessiveness of being a shining star.

522
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,210
Your endeavor is meaningful only if you are shining.

523
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,500
But endeavor itself is very meaningful.

524
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,740
Everyone has his own understanding.

525
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,930
My grandfather picked the name for me.

526
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,980
I still didn't understand the meaning of "Tiankuo"

527
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,620
when he passed away.

528
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,410
One day, I found a couplet

529
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,930
left by him,

530
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,500
saying "The sky is unlimited for birds to fly at ease, as the ocean is boundless for fish to leap at will."

531
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,290
That's when I understood that he wanted me to become a strong man,

532
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,290
like fish and flying birds

533
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,860
in boundless ocean and unlimited sky.

534
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,140
You are the kind of person that I can only

535
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,930
watch from a distance, but can never become.

536
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,500
I think we are the same.

537
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,170
How could it be possible?

538
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,810
To be honest,

539
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,500
being the monitor is my mom's arrangement.

540
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,570
She talked with Mr. Wu,

541
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,380
in order to make sure that I have the attention and care

542
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,410
of the school and teachers.

543
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,530
Competing for the President of the Student Union was also my mom's idea.

544
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,410
In fact, I never set goals for myself

545
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,930
and I have no desire to be something.

546
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,380
I just want to be what I can be.

547
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,290
The class will soon begin, let's go back.

548
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,570
-One more thing. 
 -One more thing.

549
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,410
You first.

550
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,330
After you.

551
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,540
About the ambassadors of the school,

552
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,810
we are in the leading position in terms of votes in the post,

553
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,010
and I'm willing to take photos with you

554
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,210
and put them on the school's website.

555
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,090
I was just going to talk about this.

556
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,210
Even if we were chosen,

557
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,690
I don't want to go.

558
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,450
Why? This is what our classmates want.

559
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,780
That's what they want,

560
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,780
not mine.

561
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Don't you like the feeling of being in the spotlight?

562
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,900
Maybe.

563
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,450
But I heard that you love taking photos.

564
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,210
Those are for myself.

565
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,540
I'm used to being myself.

566
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,050
Please don't follow me.

567
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,280
No, if we were chosen,

568
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,690
you can't stand me up and refuse to take photos.

569
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,290
You and I should be ambassadors together.

570
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,410
I'm not willing to put my photos with other girls

571
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,290
on the website.

572
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,540
Lin Yang,

573
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,570
please have some self-knowledge.

574
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,140
Our current votes

575
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,540
won't make it in the top three.

576
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,040
You think it's easy to be chosen?

577
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,090
I mean if.

578
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,010
There are more than ten hours from the deadline of signing up.

579
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,900
Any miracles are likely to happen.

580
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,810
Fine, if the miracle you said happens,

581
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,690
I will go with you.

582
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,450
Do I have your word?

583
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,380
You have my word.

584
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,170
How is it going?

585
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,260
Everything is in order except the east wind.

586
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,740
Don't laugh so soon.

587
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,810
Do you know how many votes you need

588
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,660
to catch up with Qianqian and Chu Tiankuo?

589
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,660
Hundreds.

590
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,690
See you at the internet cafe downstairs at 22:00.

591
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,570
What do you mean?

592
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,260
Borrowing the east wind.

593
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,170
The boy is too tired.

594
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,250
He slept soundly.

595
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,810
Don't wake him up.

596
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,900
What took you so long?

597
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,020
I have registered dozens of IDs.

598
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,450
Let's get started.

599
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,050
Uncle, haven't you went to bed?

600
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,170
I have to be your reliable backup.

601
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,090
Well, let me bring you a cup of milk.

602
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,410
Then quickly go to bed after drinking it.

603
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,260
Okay!

604
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,690
The miracle still hasn't happened yet.

605
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,020
Our votes have overtaken theirs.

606
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,260
There are five miuntes left before the deadline,

607
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,090
We've got 30 more votes than them. Got it!

608
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,540
Come on! Let's have some breakfast.

609
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,210
Don't you guys think that

610
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,980
Zhouzhou and Lin Yang are indeed awesome,

611
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,620
outstripping Ling Xiangqian and Chu Tiankuo at the last second.

612
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,090
Anyway, I think Zhouzhou is the prettiest one.

613
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,930
I firmly voted for Zhouzhou and Lin Yang.

614
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,280
So did I.

615
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,690
Have you guys noticed that

616
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,740
Zhouzhou is actually the type that the more you look, the more attractive she is.

617
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,530
But don't you feel weird?

618
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,740
Ling Xiangqian was far ahead last night.

619
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,050
How could Zhouzhou overtake her in votes overnight?

620
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,740
Ling Xiangqian,

621
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,780
I am so sorry.

622
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,690
Lin Yang must have dishonestly increased the number of votes.

623
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,380
We were short a lot of votes last night.

624
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,170
It was impossible to catch you up overnight.

625
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,380
I am gonna tell Director Pan that

626
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,660
our votes cannot be counted.

627
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,140
Frankly speaking,

628
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,570
even though Lin Yang didn't rig the vote, I still don't wanna do that.

629
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,980
I am sick and tired of standing under the spotlight,

630
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,540
being gossiped by other people.

631
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,930
Don't tell Director Pan,

632
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,260
for the sake of me.

633
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
Also, please thank Lin Yang on behalf of me

634
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,290
for helping me find a way to avoid facing that situation.

635
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,620
Zhouzhou, Director Pan is calling you.

636
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,140
Director Pan is calling you.

637
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,410
Zhouzhou, please don't abandon me.

638
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,740
Hey, who asked you to dishonestly arrange the votes?

639
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,210
This is cheating. Shame on you!

640
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,810
Who cheated?

641
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,780
I just legitimately took advantage of the rules.

642
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,370
Director Pan said that one person can only cast one vote.

643
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,410
Not really, he said that only one vote per ID.

644
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,260
If the law doesn't forbid us to do so, this would accordingly be freedom.

645
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,810
Plus, I excel at doing that, so people can't discover it.

646
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,860
The total number of students in our school is only just over 1,500.

647
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,860
But the votes of the top two were over 2,000.

648
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,930
Do you think Director Pan's IQ is the same as yours?

649
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,050
Do you know why I asked you to come here?

650
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,330
You probably have known that.

651
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,740
Not really, I don't know why.

652
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,930
Schoolmates have voted you two

653
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,380
as great ambassadors of Zhen Hua.

654
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,290
And you will represent the school to take photos,

655
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,980
which will be put on the homepage of the admissions website.

656
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,140
Ah, I see, that's it.

657
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,570
Bravo, Lin Yang, Yu Zhouzhou.

658
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,020
You two not only have good images and grades,

659
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,140
but also are popular among schoolmates.

660
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,780
I think you guys deserve the fame

661
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,900
to represent Zhen Hua.

662
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,570
Director Pan,

663
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,540
I want to tell you something.

664
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,930
Go ahead.

665
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,330
Actually, I am not supposed to be the ambassador.

666
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,020
How come?

667
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,210
Director Pan, this is because

668
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,330
Yu Zhouzhou has long been unconfident

669
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,540
about her apperance.

670
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,450
She thinks she has a baby face which is not photogenic.

671
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,930
So she is afraid that she would spoil the image of Zhen Hua.

672
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,140
Yu Zhouzhou, you cannot think like that.

673
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,970
There's nothing wrong with having a baby face.

674
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,570
I think having a baby face is pretty good.

675
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,930
Vivacious, adorable and energetic.

676
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,860
This election is different from those before.

677
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,260
It not only represents the approval of school,

678
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,650
but also the embodiment of your own values,

679
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,840
which is super meaningful.

680
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,650
Although you can only stay in Zhen Hua for

681
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,409
three years.

682
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,409
You would leave a glorious and impressive

683
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,130
mark for Zhen Hua.

684
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,409
Think about it carefully.

685
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,500
After many years, you would click on this photo, seeing

686
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,810
the young boy standing on the other side of success,

687
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,170
wearing the school uniform with

688
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,370
flowers bloomimg behind him.

689
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,060
That's so nostalgic.

690
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,580
Director Pan, I am so touched by your words.

691
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,690
I have been regretting that

692
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,100
I didn't take this kind of photo when I was young.

693
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,300
What are you guys waiting for?

694
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,780
Okay, it's settled!

695
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,570
Hurry up and prepare for it!

696
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,540
Okay! Thanks, Director Pan.

697
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,210
No worries.

698
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,540
See you, Director Pan.

699
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,810
Pretty good!

700
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,530
Isn't it just one election?

701
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,930
Come on! Stop it.

702
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,260
They must have cheated in this election.

703
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,740
I have to ask Director Pan for an explanation.

704
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,370
Can I ask you a question,

705
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,100
which has made me wonder for a long time.

706
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,130
Go ahead.

707
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,130
What's the reason why you are so desperate to win?

708
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,370
is it because you can stand for Zhen Hua to take photos

709
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,690
or you want to take pictures with me?

710
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,690
If you choose the former reason, you can throw this away.

711
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,260
If it's the latter one,

712
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,820
you can follow the above address to find me.

713
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,840
Please getting closer, you two.

714
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,100
Keep going.

715
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,260
Hands, hands, your hands.

716
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,340
Don't be shy.

717
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:01,610
Good.

718
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,300
Lovely.

719
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,440
Great.

720
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,500
Don't be shy.

721
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,300
Change to another pose.

722
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,650
Good.

723
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,170
Come closer.

724
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,930
Look at each other.

725
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,300
Cool! Okay.

726
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,610
Keep moving.

727
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,020
The facial expression.

728
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,340
Great!

729
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,740
Here I am!

730
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,820
Come on in!

731
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,650
Let's watch this lens then.

732
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,890
And we will get started after I saying three two one.

733
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:22,770
Got it!

734
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,690
Three two one!

735
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,300
The boy, can you hold the girl's hands?.

736
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,410
Holding hands, please.

737
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,840
Not just crooking fingers.

738
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,780
Don't you know what holding hands means?

739
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,650
What age is it now!

740
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,410
Holding hands!

741
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:10,690
Great!

742
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,650
So perhaps everyone would feel that

743
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,200
the whole world could play a supporting role for themselves?

744
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,500
One Two Three.

745
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,370
This photo doesn't look good. What were you doing?

746
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,850
I like this one, how about you?

747
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,850
Did you really hold hands with Yu Zhouzhou?

748
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,020
Not just simply holding hands.

749
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,500
Do you know what being close within arm's reach and feel each other's breath mean?

750
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,410
So you had so-called zero distance with her.

751
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,740
Most importantly,

752
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,890
The photo which I was in close contact

753
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,300
with Yu Zhouzhou will be put on the official website of Zhen Hua.

754
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,930
This photo will be praised by junior fellow students

755
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,690
from generation to generation in Zheng Hua

756
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,020
and be passed on from generation to generation,

757
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,370
acting as a symbol of Zheng Hua.

758
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,490
[Zhen Hua High School]

759
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,410
Hey, look at this.

760
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,080
[Zhen Hua High School]

761
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,500
Is this what you called zero distance?

762
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,740
I think you two are almost worlds apart.
