4
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,490
Mi Qiao.

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,340
Yu! You came!

6
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,970
Yu, I miss you so much!

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,130
I miss you, too.

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,170
You know me so well.

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,020
I'm so fed up with staying at the hospital.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,090
You look well.

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,380
Better than at school.

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,930
Sure. I eat well and sleep well every day.

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,340
I don't have to be tortured by Columbus,

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,250
Napoleon or the gunshot of Lexington.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,860
By the way, it's the first week of senior year.

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,500
How does it feel?

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,410
Nothing different from last year.

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,340
The countdown has begun since 900 days ago.

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,890
And we've in the final stretch for 500 days.

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,090
What's this?

21
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,500
A mail from a magazine on holiday.

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,019
It was sent to the class,

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:05,980
so I brought it to you.

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,020
What are you doing?

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,060
Holy moment.

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,780
Dear Zheng Yanyi,

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,460
after reviewing,

28
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,890
we decided to try to serialize your comics.

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,140
Thanks for your contribution.

30
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,570
Really?

31
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,250
Yanyi's comics have been accepted.

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,740
When did you contribute for him?

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,490
Last time I... I'm telling you...

34
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,380
I copied his comics

35
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,740
and sent them to several other magazines.

36
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,490
When the east is dark, the west is bright.

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,850
He would be so happy to know it.

38
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,930
I'm calling him right now.

39
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,250
No. No. No.

40
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,289
He didn't even see me off last time.

41
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,740
Still angry with him?

42
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,850
He regretted it after you left.

43
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,060
He stared at the window alone

44
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,930
as if in a trance.

45
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,979
It took him several days to get better.

46
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,250
Here I am.

47
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:57,979
Make some room for me.

48
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,290
You came here seven days a week.

49
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,530
Even more frequently than the doctors.

50
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,930
What? I'm not welcome?

51
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,610
Then I'll leave.

52
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,530
Wait a second. Leave the food.

53
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,650
Weren't you officially employed by the hotel?

54
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,700
Why do you look so idle?

55
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,300
Still in internship. I have nothing to do.

56
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,140
Now that I have free time,

57
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,140
I might as well come here and have a sleep.

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,810
Somebody boasts himself too much.

59
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,650
Somebody said he won the first place

60
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,730
in hotel management examination,

61
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,420
and was exceptionally accepted,

62
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,450
and was the cream of the crop

63
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,520
and paragon in the vocational college.

64
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,530
Is there any evidence? Are you lying?

fill the kettle with water for me.

Hurry up!

72
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,370
Isn't it busier in internship?

73

Stand still!

What's wrong? Aren't you working in the hotel?

87

Why do you wear like this? Where's your outfit?

88
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,700
The training starts next week.

89
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,420
Bullshit!

90
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,579
Last week you said the training had started.

91
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,250
You also asked me for money for outfits.

92

That's a big lie!

It looks like Chen Yao.

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:00,780
OK.

100
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,130
Don't run! Stop!

101
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,220
-Stand still, bastard. I'll kill you.
-Stop.

102
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,530
Enough.

103
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,420
Yes. I lied to you.

104
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,890
I was not employed.

105
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,420
Look at yourself.

106
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,700
Don't you feel ashamed to command me?

107
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,050
Don't tell me what to do.

108
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,930
Could you let me do whatever I want?

109
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,530
The roads are under my feet.

110
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,300
I can choose anyone I want.

111
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,900
Stop bossing me around.

112
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,180
Growing up,

113
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,020
you've never won a prize.

114

As long as you can achieve something,

115
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,460
I will...

116
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,740
I will never drink any more.

117
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,180
Truth or Dare, no laughing version. Action!

118
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,650
You're not looking at me. Don't cheat.

119
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,650
Hurry up. Look at me.

120
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,020
Break!

121
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,700
You lose! You lose! You lose!

122
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,810
Truth or Dare? Pick one.

123
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,900
Dare.

124
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,300
Don't tease me next round.

125
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,490
OK. I won't.

126
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,740
Hold this bottle,

127
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,700
and say affectionately:

128
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,860
Lin Yang, I like you so much.

129
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,580
And then, have a kiss.

130
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,300
Hurry up!

131
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,860
Shh! Don't laugh.

132
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,980
Do you want to be heard by the nurse?

133
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,770
Hurry up! Hurry up!

134
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,770
Don't laugh!

135
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,530
What's the problem?

136
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,050
You are shy.

137
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,020
What's the point of being shy?

138
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,330
Hurry up! Hurry up!

139
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,250
No, I can't.

140
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,330
Stop. Stop.

141
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,140
What's wrong?

142
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,250
I'm fine. I've been like this recently.

143
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,700
A little movement makes me out of breath.

144
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,930
I'm fine. I'm fine.

145
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,210
By the way,

146
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,700
don't show Yanyi his comics.

147
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,020
Why?

148
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,650
Don't you know him?

149
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,300
Pisces. Short of confidence and security.

150
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,300
If you show him his comics,

151
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,860
he will be happy for at most a week.

152
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,180
He'll still troubled by history and politics.

153
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,250
He never sees his value.

154
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,140
Then when should I show him?

155
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,530
In his most difficult time.

156
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,020
Well, you know.

157
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,050
The light of a pearl can only be seen

158
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,860
on a dark night,

159
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,370
like, pitch-dark.

160
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,020
Let his own light blind his eyes.

161
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,090
Yanyi is a little fool.

162
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,140
I can help him.

163
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,860
But what about the other one?

164
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,020
The other fool is even dumber than him.

165
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,770
He gave up his internship

166
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,930
and stayed with a patient like me everyday.

167
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,490
It's a great loss for his career.

168
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,930
What he did just shortened my life.

169
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,250
Don't say that!

170
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,640
Yu, what should I do?

171
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,460
Do you want him to go back to work?

172
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,020
Definitely no.

173
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,650
His father has already hurt him.

174
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,330
I can't hurt him one more time.

175
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,080
Now that he would like to do that for me...

176
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,490
Fine, I'll take it.

177
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,740
I need an attendant.

178
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,770
Let me get you some medicine.

179
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,740
No, no. Stay here.

180
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,850
I don't want to take medicine.

181
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,490
As long as you are here, I am fine.

182
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,590
[Episode 25 A Dream of Youth ]

183
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,210
Mr. Wu.

184
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,620
Where's your class?

185
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:09,860
Having P.E. class.

186
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,020
It's been a week since senior year started,

187
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,180
and your class still have P.E. class?

188
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,130
Yeah.

189
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,530
I asked them to do some exercise

190
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,250
and get some air.

191
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,530
It's not good to stay here all day long.

192
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,290
And it's also on the class schedule.

193
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,570
Wu, you are such an honest man.

194
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,740
Thank you.

195
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,050
Following the schedule

196
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,810
made by the school for students

197
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,299
is the basic responsibility

198
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,299
of every headteacher.

199
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,419
Don't you understand my irony?

200
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,419
Come on. Stop writing.

201
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,890
Let me tell you how to have P.E. class.

202
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,010
Do you know how many students

203
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,130
stay up at night till 12 o'clock?

204
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:46,810
Yes.

205
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,330
They study so hard against the clock.

206
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,260
At this critical moment,

207
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,450
you ask them to have P.E. class.

208
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,010
What if they have no time to study?

209
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,260
How can you bear to do it?

210
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,170
Fine. Fine.

211
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,260
What you're saying is like I...

212
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,690
How about this way?

213
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,380
They can have P.E. if they want,

214
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,530
but if they don't, I won't force them. OK?

215
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,940
I love your idea.

216
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,650
That's more like it.

217
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,530
Mr. Wu, Director Pan,

218
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,090
P.E. teacher lets us have a rest,

219
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,010
so I come up to take a book for revision.

220
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:15,940
Bye, teachers.

221
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,620
You see? I knew it!

222
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,180
What are you doing there?

223
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,530
I'm seeing if anyone cheats in the exam.

224
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,890
You're violating their privacy.

225
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,090
What are you doing here?

226
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,180
As a headteacher,

227
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,320
you protect them too well.

228
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,740
They are your students, and mine too.

229
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,450
I did it for their own good.

230
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:53,770
What's more, Class 2 has had a class meeting

231
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,940
at the beginning of this semester.

232
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,090
When will your class have one?

233
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,690
Come here. Let me teach you a lesson.

234
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,860
There's a saying in On War by Cao Gui:

235
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,820
A battle depends on the ardour of soldiers.

236
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,330
The first drumming cheers them up,

237
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,850
The enemy's ardour runs out and ours is high.

238
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:11,360
while the third devitalizes them.

239
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:11,350
the second weakens them,

240
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,130
You should beat the drum at the right time.

241
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,570
If you drum too early, you'll lose ardour early.

242
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,450
Don't teach me history here.

243
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,450
In terms of history, I'm no worse than you.

244
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,980
In terms of management, I'm much better.

245
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,770
OK, fine. What have you found?

246
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,060
It's alright. Looks like an honors class.

247
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,940
Do whatever you should do.

248
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:36,650
You...

249
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,530
You're making troubles for me.

250
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,940
Wu, what's this?

251
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,300
Explain to me.

252
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,450
It's said that you are the most talented

253
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,570
manager in Zhen Hua High School.

254
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,740
In my view, you're just a shape without soul.

255
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,180
Citing historical allusions in front of me?

256
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,500
A shape without soul?

257
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,620
Let's see who is a shape without soul!

258
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,010
Mr. Wu. I was wrong.

259
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,890
Nice writing!

260
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,420
How about this way? You go back and

261
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,260
let me keep it for a few days.

262
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,820
No, Mr. Wu.

263
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,890
I borrowed the book from other class.

264
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,060
Last time Mr. Zhang took one from me.

265
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,940
Nobody will dare to lend anything to me.

266
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,130
You are classmates.

267
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,420
How can they act like this?

268
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,620
But if I were your classmate,

269
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,980
I dare not lend anything to you.

270
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,370
How about this way?

271
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,620
You read a paragraph for me.

272
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,620
If you read well,

273
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,130
I'll give it back to you.

274
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,500
The book taken by Mr. Zhang...

275
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,690
I'll also give it back to you.

276
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,330
Really?

277
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,300
Yes. Read this paragraph.

278
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,090
The one where Zi Han gives up Liang Chen

279
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,060
to Zi Xuan.

280
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,820
It's a nice writing.

281
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,420
Han decided to give up Liang to Xuan.

282
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,690
Liang told Han how much he loved her.

283
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,500
Liang looked up and cried:

284
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,890
Lord! We have committed to each other

285
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,730
and vowed to marry each other.

286
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,650
Can you read with more emotion?

287
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,330
Read again.

288
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,620
Han decided to give up Liang to Xuan.

289
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,690
Liang told Han how much he loved her.

290
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,770
Liang looked up and cried:

291
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,090
-Lord!
-Just give it back to me.

292
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,330
Can you just have more emotion?

293
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,570
Mr. Wu, please don't torture me.

294
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,860
I'm not torturing you.

295
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,060
Then give the book to me.

296
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,450
Don't.

297
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:46,820
Go on then.

298
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,570
Go on!

299
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,300
Han decided to give up Liang to Xuan.

300
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,570
Liang told Han how much he loved her.

301
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Liang looked up and cried:

302
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,890
Lord!

303
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,260
We have committed to each other.

304
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,250
and vowed to marry each other, haven't we?

305
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,820
But the short-lived vow is

306
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,260
just like a shooting star in the dark.

307
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,010
Once uttered, it melts in the warm heart.

308
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,060
Bravo! Bravo!

309
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,740
Just like that!

310
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,380
Then it would be great.

311
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,940
What do you mean, Mr.Wu?

312
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,500
Boys and girls,

313
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,530
this meeting should've been held long ago.

314
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,680
Other classes have had one.

315
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,650
I think you've all known

316
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,330
what this meeting is about.

317
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,260
Mr. Wu, isn't it just a pep rally?

318
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,620
Give a pep talk,

319
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,300
and sing a pep song.

320
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:54,770
Cliché.

321
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,690
Yes. It's exactly what the meeting is about.

322
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,650
But as for how we'll hold it...

323
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,690
We're going to make something new.

324
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,740
So I asked class leaders to buy some fruits

325
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,860
and melon seeds.

326
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,180
We're going to have a tea party.

327
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,500
What do you think?

328
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,450
Great!

329
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,180
Come on. Help yourselves.

330
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,420
Well. Let's start.

331
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,690
Xu Zhiqiang,

332
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,940
you've jumped from No.42

333
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,820
to No.41 in this exam.

334
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,330
Please say something about that.

335
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,380
Well, I'm grateful to my teachers

336
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,090
and parents,

337
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,130
and Mi Qiao, who didn't attend the exam.

338
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,930
Why are you laughing?

339
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,810
I don't think it's embarrassing.

340
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,180
I learned a truth

341
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,010
from CS:

342
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,260
I can live without bullet-proof armor

343
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,690
or AK47, and it's fine

344
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,180
if I only have one last drop of blood.

345
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,260
However, as long as I can breathe,

346
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,650
I can win with one shot and turn the tables.

347
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,740
There is a saying that

348
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,180
It's a fact down the ages that success lies

349
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,180
not only the talent, but also the fortitude.

350
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,180
Thank you.

351
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:19,730
Bravo!

352
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,380
Who's next?

353
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:30,890
Chen Yao,

354
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,860
why are you crying?

355
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,260
Mr. Wu, can I say something?

356
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,690
Of course.

357
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,520
Firstly, I'd like to apologize to everyone.

358
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,860
I dragged our class down again in last exam.

359
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,330
Actually,

360
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,690
I didn't put much effort in study.

361
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,890
I didn't read books until exams came.

362
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,530
I used to cram for exams.

363
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,530
I thought I could get some scores in this way.

364
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,420
Without me,

365
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,060
our class would have surpassed the others.

366
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,570
You know what? Once I went to get some water

367
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,820
and Mr. Wu was standing in front of me.

368
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,130
I found his hair in the back totally grey.

369
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,740
I felt terribly sorry for him.

370
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,450
Stop. Stop.

371
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,300
Don't mention my hair.

372
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,050
I don't have much black hair.

373
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,330
When other classmates were giving speeches,

374
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,010
I saw you writing something in the notebook.

375
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,330
What's it about?

376
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,980
I wrote something to encourage myself.

377
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,980
Really?

378
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,090
Can you share it with us?

379
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,260
Chen Yao,

380
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,130
you should get up before 6 o'clock every day.

381
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,380
You shouldn't take a nap.

382
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,770
You should recite the text even till late night.

383
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,440
You can't sleep until you finish.

384
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,770
You shouldn't eat too much at lunch.

385
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,500
Because when you're full, you'll fall asleep

386
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,500
and nobody can wake you up.

387
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,940
If you feel painful,

388
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,620
you should bear with it.

389
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,940
One day your efforts will pay off.

390
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,690
What's more, I think

391
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,010
what I should chase

392
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,690
is not those superstars,

393
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,410
but the better version of myself.

394
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,290
Can anybody

395
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,540
give Chen Yao a hug

396
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,380
and give her some power?

397
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,570
Anyone else?

398
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,850
I love watching Slam Dunk.

399
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,680
Everytime when I want to give up,

400
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,860
this comic keeps me moving on.

401
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,860
I like Hanamichi Sakurag.

402
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,570
I want to be someone like him.

403
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,920
But I can't.

404
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,560
There's a character called Yanyi.

405
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,530
He is just a marginal figure

406
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,500
and never has a chance to take the field.

407
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,540
We are the same.

408
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,540
We spare no efforts to take notes,

409
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,690
for fear that we'll miss a point.

410
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,980
But we always end up being at the bottom.

411
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,330
Actually,

412
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,170
I always look down on myself.

413
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,260
But what Chen Yao said gives me power.

414
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,050
Everyone is studying hard.

415
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,090
I have no reason to complain.

416
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,540
I want to let you know that

417
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,620
I, Zheng Yanyi,

418
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,690
am not a marginal figure.

419
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,020
I can do whatever others can do.

420
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,570
That's right.

421
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,280
You may see a problem as a big deal now.

422
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,740
But a few years later, you would find that

423
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,170
it's just one station of your life,

424
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,290
but definitely not the only one.

425
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,380
I know you study really hard for the Gaokao.

426
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,690
It's a victory for whoever makes it till today.

427
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,620
There are

428
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,780
300 days ahead.

429
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,540
It'll be harder for you.

430
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,860
But after that,

431
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,260
there is a brighter future

432
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,140
awaiting you.

433
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,040
I hope that years later,

434
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,380
our class will not only be defined

435
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,050
as a class led by Wu Wenlu,

436
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,780
but a class where Chen Yao, Zheng Yanyi,

437
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,020
and Xu Zhiqiang

438
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,980
used to spend time together.

439
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,140
Everyone here

440
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,900
will be a spokesman for

441
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,450
2003 Arts Class 3.

442
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,140
Well, thanks for

443
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,450
acting with me just now.

444
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,980
Your eyes are red from crying.

445
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,050
Come on. Wipe the tears away.

446
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,890
Let's return to the previous talk.

447
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,660
Here you are, these two books.

448
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,260
Sir, I won't read this kind of books any more.

449
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,170
You keep it please.

450
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,320
Actually, I was not acting just now.

451
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,330
I'm already the Chen Yao in the book.

452
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,370
When I meet the problem I can't solve,

453
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,810
I will bite the bullet and never give up.

454
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,210
This is more interesting than the romantic fiction.

455
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,500
Thank you, sir.

456
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,980
OK, you can leave now.

457
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,280
Yes, sir.

458
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,290
Wait a second. The book...

459
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,690
You need to return the book.

460
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,570
You said that you borrowed them.

461
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,290
In fact, I bought these books myself.

462
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,570
Come on, Qiang.

463
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,930
You and I pick the Terrorist Forces to rush them.

464
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,500
Is it really interesting to play CS everyday?

465
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,260
The Iceworld is good.

466
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,170
But the Dust 2 is really boring.

467
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,780
Come on. Come on.

468
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,020
Have a good time.

469
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,810
Nowadays, the university students

470
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,140
can join the army before 24.

471
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,330
As for the senior high,

472
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,900
people can enter it before 21.

473
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,170
That's how it stipulate.

474
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,140
You are just in this age group.

475
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,170
Hello.

476
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:33,540
Hi.

477
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,050
We're from military registration station.

478
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,810
Are you from Zhenhua？

479
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:39,740
Yes.

480
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,450
Forget about it.

481
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,900
What do you mean?

482
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,050
We are there to suffer. You can't bear it.

483
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,450
Dad.

484
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,050
How is her stomach recently?

485
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,130
She told me two days ago that her stomach goes wrong.

486
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,740
Maybe an indigestion.

487
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,210
Be careful of her diet.

488
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,780
Do not eat strong food.

489
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:07,980
It will cause angina.

490
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,210
Your daughter has a good personality.

491
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,620
She brought so much fun to the ward these days.

492
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,080
But she is too active.

493
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
That's bad for her recovery.

494
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,410
Half a month later, she will have an operation.

495
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,450
From now on,

496
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,780
Don't let her walk around.

497
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,740
Look at this.

498
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,810
Please take it seriously.

499
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,690
Okay.

500
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,620
Mi Qiao isn't here.

501
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,860
How dare you take the Cartoon Club flag off?

502
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,410
I've already talked to Mi Qiao.

503
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,690
This classroom is left unused for too long.

504
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,290
Many associations are waiting for this room.

505
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,380
Calm down, Yanyi.

506
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,260
I don't care.

507
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,980
Mi Qiao is in hospital and

508
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,450
you come here to take off our flag.

509
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,500
What do you mean?

510
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,140
The Cartoon Club is phantom for long.

511
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,290
You leave the seat unused and don't allow others to sit.

512
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,090
Too imperious.

513
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:05,930
What the hell?

514
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,380
You...

515
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,620
What do you mean by imperious?

516
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,620
Why are you here, Mi Qiao?

517
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,020
Such big event as Cartoon Club dismissing

518
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,450
deserves a ceremony.

519
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,780
Look at you, guys.

520
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,170
Cheer up!

521
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,850
Leaving is for a better reunion.

522
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,090
Dismissing is for another gathering someday.

523
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,140
Let me keep this flag.

524
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,400
By the day I return,

525
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,140
I will hang it up again.

526
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,260
It's a deal. We are waiting for your return.

527
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,610
Let's go.

528
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,050
Du Fu and Li Bai

529
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,810
saw famous mountains and great rivers together.

530
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,570
They visited all their friends.

531
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,050
They slept in one bed when drunk. They walked everywhere hand in hand in daytime.

532
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,020
They looked for Bei Guo in the seclusion.

533
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,680
Later, Li Bai was framed. He stayed away from officialdom.

534
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,050
One day, when he was drunk,

535
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,450
Li Bai wanted to pick up the moon in the water

536
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,280
and fell into it.

537
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,690
Wait a minute.

538
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,010
What do you want?

539
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,620
I am Du Fu. Thank you for saving my life.

540
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,050
The silver saddle shines. The white horse rustles like a meteor.

541
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,650
He can kill one guy in every ten steps. No one stop him within a thousand miles.

542
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,980
After finishing the mission, he leaves without a sound and hides like nobody.

543
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,050
Listen!

544
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:17,860
I declare that

545
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,490
Zhenhua High School Roaming Cartoon Club

546
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,260
dismiss today.

547
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,690
Mi Qiao.

548
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,020
Leader.

549
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,330
Mi Qiao.

550
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,500
Oops.

551
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,740
Dad.

552
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,780
When did you leave？

553
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,740
Dad, our Cartoon Club was...

554
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,250
I'm asking the time you left.

555
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,260
Two o'clock.

556
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,740
When were you in the emergency room?

557
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:27,900
Three days ago.

558
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,540
Did you think you were Nezha？

559
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,900
Did you think you were invulnerable？

560
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,260
Dad, our Cartoon Club dismissed today.

561
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,020
Cartoon Club, Cartoon Club again.

562
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,780
You have taken a year off from school. Can't you take a good rest?

563
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,090
Don't think about the school stuff only, OK?

564
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,090
How did this happen?

565
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,380
Anything wrong?

566
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,020
It's okay, dad.

567
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,540
The air is dry and crisp,

568
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,690
so my nose bled a little.

569
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,370
It's normal for others to bleed

570
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,740
because of the dry weather.

571
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,140
But you are different.

572
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,900
You may suffer from arrhythmia and

573
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,330
the blood-supply goes wrong.

574
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,330
Dad, haven't you said that

575
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,570
if only I am happy

576
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,090
I am allowed to do anything?

577
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,050
But you should have a sense of priority.

578
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,500
Now is different.

579
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,380
The Doctor said that

580
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,330
you're not allowed to walk around before the operation.

581
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,410
Dad, I am sorry.

582
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,540
I won't infuriate you anymore.

583
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,210
There is five minutes left.

584
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,250
Students who haven't finished the composition,

585
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,330
hurry up.

586
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,570
Xin Rui. Xin Rui.

587
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,330
Xin Rui.

588
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,090
I'm going to take the physical examination for conscription tomorrow.

589
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,010
-Can you hear me? -Don't be disturbed.

590
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,690
-Focus on the examination. Pay attention to the questions. -Xin Rui.

591
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,290
Xin Rui.

592
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,410
Xin Rui.

593
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,280
Madam, I want to hand in my paper.

594
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,780
Try to get a higher score.

595
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,570
I'll come  back for you.

596
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,500
Hurry up. Adopt half lie in the location.

597
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,740
Mi Qiao. Wake up. Mi Qiao.

598
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,450
Mi Qiao. Mi Qiao. Mi Qiao.

599
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,660
It's OK. It's OK.

600
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,500
Are you OK?

601
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,410
I'm fine.

602
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,970
Lean on this for a moment. I will call the doctor.

603
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,780
It's too stuffy in the hospital.

604
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,410
Take me out please.

605
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,810
But the doctor doesn't allow you to walk around.

606
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,210
The doctor only says that I shouldn't walk around,

607
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,930
but not go out, right?

608
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,330
Are you OK?

609
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,370
I am fine.

610
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,570
This is good. Let's get one.

611
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,450
Okay.

612
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,660
Mi Qiao, are you OK?

613
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,570
I am fine.

614
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,660
Come on, put your arm on my shoulder.

615
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,260
Why？

616
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,140
Put your arm on my shoulder.

617
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,370
What？

618
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,330
Hey, what do you want?

619
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,170
Don't move. Let's go.

620
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,290
Don't, don't be so fast.

621
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,140
Slow down. Slow down, please.

622
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,980
I want this. This one.

623
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:16,860
This?

624
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,280
OK.

625
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,740
I want this.

626
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,450
OK.

627
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,810
This one. Get one for me.

628
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,260
This one?

629
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,260
Come on.

630
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:29,850
This one.

631
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,980
Back. Go back

632
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,930
Chips. Chips.

633
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,500
Here. Two.

634
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,380
One more chocolate.

635
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,900
Has the doctor agreed?

636
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,740
Doctor doesn't allow me to walk around.

637
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,450
As I've already broken the rule,

638
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,090
why shouldn't I enjoy myself?

639
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,380
This one.

640
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,140
I want this lion mask.

641
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,280
This one. This one.

642
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,140
You want the mask? This one?

643
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,090
When I am cured,

644
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,980
I'll organize to rehearse the Wonderful Wizard of OZ.

645
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,020
I'll play Dorothy.

646
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,500
Then I will play the Lion.

647
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,330
You play Dorothy's dog.

648
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,740
The dog is named Toto.

649
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,500
Toto is Dorothy's favorite.

650
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,170
Oh.

651
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,260
Mi Qiao, look.

652
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,020
We bought so many today.

653
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,620
You can't eat them all. What a pity.

654
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,140
It's OK. I'm happy to see them.

655
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,020
What else do you want today?

656
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,410
I'll satisfy you at once.

657
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,380
I want to...wear a dress.

658
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,860
How is this？

659
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,210
Better than the jeans.

660
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,580
Such a sweet talker.

661
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,679
Mi Qiao.

662
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,500
Why didn't you wear dress before?

663
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,100
I always thought that dress is too gorgeous

664
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,929
to wear for the noisy girl like me.

665
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,500
And the dress was made for the beauty.

666
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,370
It's none of my business.

667
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,170
I have some words to say, but I don't know whether I should speak it out.

668
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:39,409
Just say it.

669
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,580
Forget about it. I'm afraid that you will be too proud.

670
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,300
Well, I will take it off.

671
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,020
Wear it. It's beautiful on you.

672
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,690
I like it.

673
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,540
Here we go.

674
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,370
This is your stop. Let's get off.

675
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,020
Fine.

676
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,410
The one with the shopping cart, you come back here!

677
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,540
Uncle, I promise we'll get it back to you!

678
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,650
