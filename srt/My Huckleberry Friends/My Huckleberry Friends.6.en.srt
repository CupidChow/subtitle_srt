5
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,340
Don't chase me anymore.

6
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,610
I won't give you the Martial Arts Cheats.

7
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,560
Me, heroine Yu, have never thought of today.

8
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,930
Who are you?

9
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,610
Yu Zhouzhou.

10
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,840
That's not what I am asking.

11
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,700
Then what's your question?

12
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,289
Where are you from?

13
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,460
Home.

14
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,530
Lin Yang.

15
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,930
I asked Miss Yu

16
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,780
for the spare balloons.

17
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,340
We went for it together.

18
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Shut up.

19
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,530
Lin Yang, we are waiting for you. Come on.

20
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,700
Wait.

21
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,570
What are you doing?

22
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,380
Now you are my forth imperial concubine.

23
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,660
That's for the queen.

24
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,100
I don't agree. 
How could you have a forth imperial concubine?

25
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,490
I am the king.

26
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,740
Guards. Banish her to the Cold Palace.

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,780
Catch her.

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,060
Are you revolting me?

29
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,729
Run.

30
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,140
You two go chase them.

31
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,060
Which one is for the king?

32
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,880
The yellow one.

33
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,300
You have been stuck.

34
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,370
What a useless king you are!

35
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,500
Zhouzhou.

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,010
Mama.

37
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,940
Yu Zhouzhou.

38
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,890
Will you come here tomorrow?

39
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,060
Okay, I will come.

40
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,810
Then I will wait for you right here.

41
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,370
It's a deal. You can't break your words.

42
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,340
Come on. Get on the bike.

43
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,140
Yes.

44
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,140
OK

45
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,410
Where have you been?

46
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,140
You got so sweating.

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,060
Zhouzhou.

48
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,810
Go get your grandma a glass of water, okay?

49
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,500
Grandma.

50
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,420
Here you are.

51
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,650
Grandma, don't switch channel.

52
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,300
I am watching.

53
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,090
Grandma, what happened just now?

54
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,220
Xiao Qing

55
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,730
was sleepy, so she fell asleep.

56
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:27,980
Zhouzhou.

57
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,140
It's almost dinner.

58
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,650
Don't eat too much snacks.

59
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,740
I am not.

60
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,740
Leave her alone.

61
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,810
She must be playing by herself in the room.

62
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,460
How could you again come in by crossing over the balcony?

63
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,020
Benben.

64
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,010
My father beat me again.

65
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,650
You father is so cruel.

66
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,090
But I am no match for him in fighting.

67
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,140
I will definitely beat him well when I grow up.

68
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:15,900
Benben.

69
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,370
Zhouzhou.

70
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,020
Yes.

71
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,810
Have you seen Benben?

72
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,650
No.

73
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,460
What a brat! I will give him a good beating when I find him.

74
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,250
Zhouzhou.

75
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:47,740
Yes.

76
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,740
Tell Benben to come home early if you see him.

77
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,360
Okay.

78
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,300
It's pork joint.

79
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,980
Do you wanna eat?

80
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,650
Yes.

81
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,740
Follow me.

82
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,980
Wow, the hill looks really steep.

83
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,330
There must be many treasures on it.

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,770
If we clime up the hill, we can have them all.

85
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,860
Help! The mountain collapsed.

86
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,300
Zhouzhou, stop it.

87
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,900
I am kind of feeling like throwing up.

88
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,090
The matter we talked about last time is done.

89
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,180
If you are available, you may come outside.

90
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,250
I have something to discuss with you.

91
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,330
It's for Zhouzhou.

92
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,530
It's him again.

93
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,370
Mr. Outsider.

94
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,810
Come on. Let's take a look.

95
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,250
Wow, it's the new arrival of game console.

96
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,770
What is the Mr. Outsider?

97
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,810
Mr. Outsider comes a lot.

98
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,020
He just stood outside the door every time he came.

99
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,050
And auntie didn't tell us his name.

100
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,810
So we call him Mr. Outsider.

101
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,580
Zhouzhou told me that.

102
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,330
Yes.

103
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,370
Zhouzhou.

104
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,700
Go play with Benben in the room.

105
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:30,930
All right.

106
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,650
Come on.

107
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,210
Why did he come again?

108
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,860
Didn't I tell you to stay away from him?

109
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,420
How could we explain if people around sees him?

110
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,650
I know.

111
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,420
This time.

112
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,810
He came for Zhouzhou's school matter.

113
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,620
You said that

114
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,770
you would be responsible for the decision you made.

115
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,900
He has nothing to do with Zhouzhou.

116
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,020
I do want to get him out of our lives.

117
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,250
But,

118
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,860
I don't want to encumber Zhouzhou.

119
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,580
If Zhouzhou is not able to go to school,

120
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,010
I will teach her.

121
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,900
I want to go to school.

122
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,860
I want to go to school, too.

123
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,130
I am coming.

124
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,050
Waiting for someone?

125
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,450
No.

126
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,690
Are you still thinking of your forth imperial concubine?

127
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,450
She's definitely not coming.

128
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,570
You know nothing.

129
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,610
Come on. Don't be mad.

130
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,820
Come to my house to play games.

131
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,500
No.

132
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,650
Class, in our last lesson...

133
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,260
Come in.

134
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,450
Come.

135
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,850
Class, let me make an introduction of

136
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,170
our new fellow.

137
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,820
Lin Yang.

138
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,180
-She's a bit late for registration.
-See, your forth imperial concubine. She's here.

139
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,530
That's why she just arrived.

140
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,330
Now we will have her to make a self introduction.

141
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,570
Introduction?

142
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,380
What's your name?

143
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,130
I am Yu Zhouzhou.

144
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,210
That's all?

145
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,530
Okay. Let's give a warm welcome to Yu Zhouzhou.

146
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,260
Zhouzhou, we have just finished the seat arrangement.

147
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,500
You could just sit there for the moment.

148
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,260
Okay, let's start lesson.

149
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,690
Stand up.

150
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,740
Salute.

151
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,090
Good day, teacher.

152
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,420
Good day, class. Sit down, please.

153
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,080
Here is a good news.

154
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,940
All of our class have passed

155
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,130
investigation for joining the Young Pioneers.

156
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,560
Hand this out.

157
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,420
Tomorrow we will have the otah-taking ceremony.

158
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,380
From tomorrow, all of us will be

159
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,740
the honourable young pioneers.

160
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,650
The red scarf represents a corner of the national flag.

161
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,740
It was dyed with our martyr's blood.

162
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,380
Therefore we must show our respect to the red scarf.

163
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,940
After we officially join the Young Pioneers tomorrow,

164
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,420
we shall wear the red scarf

165
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,180
everyday in the school.

166
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,260
Remember?

167
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,650
Yes.

168
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,290
Right. Zhouzhou.

169
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,300
Because you have just arrived,

170
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,330
you missed the application in this semester.

171
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,060
We will apply for it in the next semester, okay?

172
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:02,940
Yes.

173
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,420

As you guys can see,

345
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,690
there are two children.

346
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,020
Leave here. Stop being onlookers.

347
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm sorry. I really don't know this before.

348
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,570
Here you are. I didn't lick this part.

349
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,210
I don't mind if you did.

350
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,540
Don't stay here.

351
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,140
There are kids inside.

352
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,540
You say. How to deal with this?

353
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,020
-Benben 
 -You seduce my husband into going here every day.

354
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,170
What does coquettish mean?

355
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,330
I think it means beautiful.

356
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,620
Then I'm coquettish.

357
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm more coquettish.

358
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,050
Why didn't they like my mom?

359
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,540
She is so beautiful.

360
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,330
Is it because you don't have a dad?

361
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,020
Everyone has his dad and mom.

362
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,610
You aren't alone. I don't have a mom, either.

363
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,660
But someday I will find her.

364
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:07,680
Yep.

365
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,450
She would come here, wouldn't she?

366
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,450
Lay off!

367
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,810
Look over there!

368
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,080
Why are you so late?

369
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,900
The map you drew is too difficult to understand.

370
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,690
I'm happy you could come.

371
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,210
Your turn. Go!

372
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,290
Stay here.

373
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,290
How many numbers should I count?

374
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,080
From one to one hundred.

375
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,740
One, two, three, four, five, six...

376
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,290
Ninety-three, ninety-four, ninety-five, ninety-six...

377
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,330
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred.

378
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,330
Uncle

379
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,620
Today we invite many old comrades. Be more careful.

380
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,900
Yes, I will. Director Zhou, don't worry.

381
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,170
What's the matter with you?

382
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,620
That uncle is my friend.

383
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,680
But it seems he doesn't know me.

384
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,140
Uncle Zhou?

385
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,620
Do you know him?

386
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,920
I'm thinking about whether he is...

387
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,500
What?

388
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,140
Nothing.

389
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,540
He, he is my friend.

390
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,160
Then I can take you to see him.

391
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,810
Okay.

392
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,090
Lin Yang

393
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,020
Zhouzhou

394
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,020
The game is still under way.

395
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,210
Do you continue?

396
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,860
Lin Yang. Zhouzhou.

397
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,500
He is over there.

398
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,260
Uncle

399
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,740
Uncle

400
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,620
Uncle

401
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,930
Comrades, dear colleagues.

402
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,260
Today Director Zhou has come to

403
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,570
the dancing party for retired staff.

404
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,620
Let's welcome him to deliver a speech.

405
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,780
Please welcome with applause.

406
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,620
Give the game machine back to me.

407
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,090
Who are you?

408
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,970
My dad bought it. You aren't entitled to play.

409
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,290
Give it to me.

410
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Give it to me.

411
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,170
It's mine.

412
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,410
Give it to her.

413
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,570
Why?

414
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,690
My dad bought this.

415
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,690
You shouldn't play.

416
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,090
My mom said you are the daughter of a bad woman.

417
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,810
Never dream of taking my dad away.

418
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,330
It can't be powered up.

419
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,930
You can play mine.

420
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,570
I will give it back to you after having it repaired.

421
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,570
Thank you.

422
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,380
Adults are troublesome.

423
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,140
I won't let anyone insult you anymore

424
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,330
Yangyang, did you really beat your schoolmate?

425
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,740
Speak!

426
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,770
Don't blame him.

427
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,530
He is a good boy, which I know.

428
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,050
This time.

429
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,290
He must have been abetted by other kids.

430
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,540
What do you mean?

431
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,660
It's OK that you hold against me.

432
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,860
But don't get kinds involved.

433
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,210
When the above behave wrongly, the below will do the same

434
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,740
This little girl is good at play her hands.

435
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,570
Several days ago she even burst into my husband's institution.

436
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,290
Not inferior to you at all.

437
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,810
In those years, all I wished was to stay away from you.

438
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,900
It was you who kept an eye on us.

439
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,210
Her being able to study at this school

440
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,020
must have been arranged by my husband uopn your request.

441
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,810
Miss, this girl doesn't have registered residence.

442
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,210
According to the rules, she couldn't study here.

443
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,770
Enough! Can't you just be quiet?

444
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,810
Children's conflicts are easy to deal with.

445
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,330
But the conflicts among adults

446
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,660
are beyond our capacity.

447
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,980
Zhouzhou, Yangyang.

448
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,980
Apologize to Zhou Shenran, quickly.

449
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,620
Then we will end this conflict.

450
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,660
Yes, yes, yes. Make an apology. Hurry up!

451
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,290
I'm sorry.

452
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,280
Speak!

453
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,620
I'm sorry.

454
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,560
Excuse me.

455
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,740
I didn't do anything wrong.

456
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,500
Can you see what she said?

457
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,780
She didn't admit her mistake at all, did she?

458
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,620
I'm sorry.

459
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,620
Fine. Now that they have apologized,

460
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,090
you don't need to blame.

461
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,690
They're all kids and this isn't a big deal.

462
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,170
I'll go back to work.

463
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,930
What's the point of apologizing?

464
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,380
What if your daughter still

465
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,050
insult my son later?

466
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,050
What do you want?

467
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,540
Send her to another school.

468
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,010
Originally she shouldn't show up here.

469
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,900
I've told you many times.

470
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,450
Why can't you remember?

471
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,620
Look at my eyes and repeat

472
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,020
"I won't play with Yu Zhouzhou anymore". Now!

473
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,290
I won't play with Yu Zhouzhou anymore.

474
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,260
Louder.

475
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,450
I won't play with Yu Zhouzhou anymore.

476
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,730
Time for dinner. Zhouzhou.

477
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,140
I have no appetite.

478
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,810
Mom, why was I wrong?

479
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,450
You didn't do anything wrong.

480
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,140
It was those adults' faults.

481
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,380
I want to transfer to another school.

482
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,020
If you do,

483
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,500
how about your friends here?

484
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,980
I don't need any friend.

485
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,290
It's adequate for me to have you and grandma.

Yes.

Yeah!

There will be a day

496
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,050
when you grow up and could understand that

497
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,540
grandma and I

498
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,980
would leave you one day.

499

It's really you!

I'm Lin Yang. Can't you remember?

506
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,970
We haven't seen each other after graduating from primary school.

507

You become so tall!

508

00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,780
In this summer vacation during free time

514
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,620
we can hang out together.

515
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,050
No, I didn't.

516
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,090
Zhouzhou

517
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,810
Is this your classmate?

518
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,570
Aunt, I'm Lin Yang. Do you remember me?

519
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,170
Yes, I do. You are so tall.

520
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:48,660
By the way.

521
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,290
This is Uncle Qi

522
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,980
Nice to meet you.

523
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,050
Me, too. Have some beverage?

524
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:52,860
Thank you.

525
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,170
Zhouzhou, it's yours.

526
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,020
Thank you.

527
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Well,

528
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,980
Will you spend more time with Lin Yang,

529
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,090
or will we...

530
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,170
I'll go home with you.

531
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,170
See you, Lin Yang.

532
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,170
Oh, see you.

533
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:03,780
See you.

534
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,320
Goodbye.

535
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,020
See you.

536
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,450
Lin Yang looks more high-spirited and vigorous now.

537
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,740
Yes.

538
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,740
What's the matter with Lin Yang that day?

539
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,410
What?

540
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,570
I care for Zhouzhou, as you can see.

541
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,140
I think Lin Yang

542
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,280
cares about Zhouzhou.

543
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,330
How can you find this?

544
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,090
Young boy like him

545
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,050
is easy to be understood.

546
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,980
He was Zhouzhou's schoolmate at primary school.

547
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,980
They were huckleberry friends.

548
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,050
And he was willing to stay with Zhouzhou.

549
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,660
However, due to some reasons,

550
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,730
they didn't play with each other as they used to.

551
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,780
Here comes a question.

552
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,800
Think about it. Zhouzhou has changed greatly in those years,

553
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,050
and he could recognize her at first sight.

554
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,620
You really have obeserved a lot

555
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,570
and analyzed reasonably.

556
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,300
When you were young,

557
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,500
you must have cared about other girls.

558
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,820
Everyone has a memorable youthhood.

559
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,600
Be careful!

560
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,020
Are you OK?

561
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,650
I'm fine.

562
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,210
You're back.

563
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,980
Your mother pricked her finger.

564
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,820
Do you have any bandage at home?

565
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,340
Yes. It's over there.

566
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,500
I'll find it for you.

567
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,159
I'll bandage her wound.

568
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,540
Eat more eggs.

569
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,060
OK

570
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,500
Hey, there.

571
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,340
Hello, aunt.

572
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,610
I'm Lin Yang. Is Zhouzhou there please?

573
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,450
OK. Hold on please.

574
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,640
Zhouzhou

575
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,210
Uh huh

576
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:02,780
A call looking for you.

577
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,650
Who?

578
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,580
Lin Yang

579
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,890
Hello

580
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,610
Zhouzhou

581
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,210
Yes

582
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,130
Can you come out this afternoon? I have something important to do.

583
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,780
How can you find this phone number?

584
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,690
Is there anything I can't do?

585
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,120
Ignore this.

586
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,650
Let's meet at our primary school two o'clock this afternoon, ok?

587
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,640
I won't go.

588
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,020
Or I can go to your home.

589
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,740
Do you still live in the same place as before?

590
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,370
Why do you come here?

591
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,650
I have a game machine which I gave to you, right?

592
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,330
Do you still keep it?

593
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,540
I'll fetch it this afternoon.

594
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,450
What game machine?

595
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,340
It's decided then.

596
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,260
Don't you eat?

597
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,980
After a while.

598
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,610
So many years have passed.

599
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,930
Why did you still want it?

600
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,980
I've tried. It can still be played.

601
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,170
I had promised to give yours back after repairing it.

602
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,130
Have a try.

603
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,610
Thank you.

604
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,610
Wow!

605
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,010
I haven't played Pokémon for a long time.

606
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:07,980
Zhouzhou.

607
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,770
Uh-hum

608
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:09,780
Let's try once together.

609
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,340
Okay.

610
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,610
Why  are you still so bad at playing this?

611
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,980
I'm giving way to you

612
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,340
After all these years

613
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,210
these games are still the most interesting

614
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,130
Zhouzhou

615
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:31,610
Yes

616
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,340
I'm so sorry

617
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,300
For what?

618
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,780
You changed school because of me 
when we were kids

619
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,540
I also promised my mom to never see you again

620
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
They are long time ago

621
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,170
I've forgotten them. How do you remember them?

622
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,540
Have you forgiven me?

623
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,850
I've grown up now

624
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,020
and I can make some decisions by myself

625
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,210
without my parents' permission

626
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,340
Zhouzhou, take out the trash

627
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,340
Well, okay!

628
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,160
Of course I forgave you

629
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
But I can't make decision without 
my mom's permission

630
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,440
Zhouzhou

631
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,880
Yes

632
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,820
Can I ask you to play with me again?

633
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,370
Yes

634
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,170
What are you doing? Zhouzhou

635
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,610
Uncle Qi

636
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,200
Where are you going?

637
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,100
Lin Yang asked me to go swimming with him

638
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,840
Get in, get in

639
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,540
I can drive you there

640
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,690
No, thanks. I can wait for a bus

641
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,580
It is coming soon

642
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,890
I have something to say

643
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,010
Get in. I'll drive you there

644
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,370
Where do you go swimming?

645
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,580
At the seaside

646
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,450
What do you want to tsay?

647
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,130
I want to propose to your mother in few days

648
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,450
I know it's not a good time to tell you today

649
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,130
You might feel sudden

650
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,540
It's okay. If my mom says yes and so will I

651
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,820
I couldn't be happier!

652
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,130
But

653
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,500
But?

654
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,740
Don't make me  call you dad suddenly

655
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,500
I can't do it  for now

656
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,850
Well, that is okay

657
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,100
You can call me whatever you like

658
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,130
Oh, by the way

659
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,980
My mom is usually easy-going

660
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,980
but you have to make efforts on the proposal

661
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,100
Otherwise she won't say yes

662
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,450
Well, it makes sense, Zhouzhuo

663
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,120
Let's go to the seaside

664
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,020
Okay

665
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,060
Can you swim? Zhouzhou

666
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,170
No, I can't

667
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,740
Why not?

668
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,170
Nobody taught me when I was a kid

669
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,500
Let me introduce her to you

670
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,650
You've met before

671
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,690
My fourth concubine, Yu Zhouzhou

672
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,100
Now I remember

673
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,020
Qianqian

674
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,370
you banished her to the cold palace. 
Do you remember?

675
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,060
Jiangchuan, you!

676
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:55,980
Look! I drew it for you

677
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,580
You are so childish

678
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,450
Here, you can draw it

679
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,610
Well, fine

680
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,500
Lin Yang, you...

681
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,130
I really don't want to finish our holiday

682
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,410
I wish that summer vacation will last forever

683
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:51,780
Zhouzhou

684
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,020
Have you seen the student list?

685
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,260
Yes, I have

686
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,820
We are not in the same class

687
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,610
What does that matter?

688
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,690
Well, let's go out again in several days

689
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,980
Didn't you just go out few days ago?

690
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,340
But this time

691
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:07,610
Just you and me

692
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,820
Aquarium?

693
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,210
The tickets for the first week were sold out, 
were they?

694
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,370
I have some soicial connections

695
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,170
I'm not quite used to wear this dress

696
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,650
Can I change it?

697
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,500
No, it's beautiful

698
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Zhouzhou, what do you think?

699
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,450
It's beautiful!

700
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,410
It looks like it was made for you

701
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,130
You have good taste, young man

702
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,450
Let's go!

703
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,690
Okay, try to smile naturally

704
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,540
Smile more naturally

705
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,740
Good!

706
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:50,890
Bridegroom, please

707
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,020
I wonder that if I will be as handsome as him

708
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,450
when I get married

709
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,370
Don't think too much!

710
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,060
Excuse me

711
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,540
can you take a picture

712
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,690
for all of my family?

713
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,540
Okay, thank you

714
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,610
Well, Zhouzhou, come here, come

715
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,060
Let's take a family photo!

716
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,100
Come, stand behind me

717
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,980
Alright, look at the camera

718
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,300
Okay, smile

719
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,060
Ready? Three, two, one!

720
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:21,980
Zhouzhou

721
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,650
Dinner will be ready soon. 
Come out and have dinner!

722
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,490
I'm coming!

723
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,980
Right. Zhouzhou

724
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,060
I've taken care of everything

725
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,060
We'll set off on Saturday

726
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,580
Where are we going?

727
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,650
Didn't we say we were going to Thailand?

728
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,820
This is gonna be our honeymoon

729
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,020
Should I go with you?

730
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,930
Of course

731
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,540
You have to carry our bags 
and take pictures for us

732
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,340
Oh

733
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,890
What's the date on Saturday?

734
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,300
I think it's 17th

735
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,160
Yes, it's 17th

736
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,690
17th

737
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,300
I'd rather not go then

738
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,410
I was kidding

739
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,780
We won't let you carry the bags

740
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,400
No, I mean

741
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,930
Lin Yang asked me to

742
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,580
go to the aquarium with him on Saturday

743
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,450
It's an eternal problem

744
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,020
If Lin Yang and your mom fall into the sea

745
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
who will you save first?

746
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,820
That's enough

747
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,820
I'll absolutely save your mom

748
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,890
Stop it

749
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,980
Zhouzhou, call Lin Yang right now

750
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,540
and tell him you can't go to the aquarium 
with him

751
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,930
He still has time

752
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,640
to go with someone else

753
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,740
But It's not easy for us to travel abroad

754
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,690
How can we go there without you?

755
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,500
Well, alright

756
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:26,450
Go ahead

757
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,610
Those tickets

758
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,260
cost all of my gift money

759
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,300
I got them through my father's 
social connections

760
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,210
I'm sorry. I didn't mena it

761
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,410
You can ask Jiang Chuan to go there

762
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,100
It's not appropriate for two men to 
go to aquarium

763
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,020
I just want to go with you

764
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,060
Lin Yang

765
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,930
This is Uncle Qi

766
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,740
You can go to the aquarium on 17th

767
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,850
I'll go to the travel agency and

768
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,820
put off our travel

769
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,260
It's okay

770
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,300
Thank you so much

771
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,100
Well, this is it

772
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,060
You're young. I can understand

773
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:12,780
Right?

774
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,130
I was young, too

775
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,780
That is how you spoil her

776
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:16,930
Thank you so much

777
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,780
You helped me

778
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,980
I will help you, too

779
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,580
Help each other. That is great

780
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,780
Anyway, I'm losing my place

781
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,210
in this family

782
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,260
You are still the one who have the final say 
in our family

783
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,780
Have dinner

784
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,020
Come, Uncle Qi

785
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,980
Try some vegetable

786
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,060
Thank you

787
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:02,890
Hello?

788
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,980
Is that Zhouzhou?

789
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,410
Come to the hospital

790
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,370
Your mom and Mr. QI

791
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,340
had an accident

792
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,300
Zhouzhou, Zhouzhou, listen to me!

793
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,540
Your mom had a car accident

794
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,500
in front of the travel agency

795
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:45,450
Zhouzhou, Zhouzhou

796
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,730
Zhouzhou

797
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,850
Zhouzhou

798
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,170
Clam down

799
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,340
Zhouzhou

800
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,600
Zhouzhou

801
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,160
Zhouzhou

802
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,930
Get up, get up

803
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,450
Let's go

804
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,060
Go, go

805
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,100
Go, let's leave here

806
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,610
Listen to me, let's go! Leave here

807
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,500
Zhouzhou, listen to me, Zhouzhou

808
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,530
Zhouzhou, there, there

809
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,400
Go, go, go!

810
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:51,930
Zhouzhou

811
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:52,930
Zhouzhou

812
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,650
How is the situation?

813
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,490
Hurry up, hurry up!

814
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,170
Come on

815
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,500
Zhouzhou

816
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,340
Zhouzhou

817
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,650
Finally, it's all over

818
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,850
Okay, thank you

819
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,020
Zhouzhou

820
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,020
Let's go

821
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:32,580
It's all right
