4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,610
Something is wrong with you.

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,570
What’s going on?

6
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,220
You didn’t even mention Yu Zhouzhou this holiday.

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,220
You had a fight?

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,570
You talk about Ling Xiangqian every day.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,340
Does she care about you?

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,130
Don't you think it's a bit unreserved for us

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,130
to be glued to their hips every day?

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:48,660
Stop.

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,860
Others are unreserved.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,250
You are shameless.

15
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,610
Besides, I didn't do that.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,090
I’m telling you, Jiang Chuan.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,180
Don’t mention the word Yu Zhouzhou

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,380
in front of me again.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,880
Okay.

20
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,660
Zhouzhou, you’re here.

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,810
It doesn’t work.

22
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,610
I’m warning you.

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,420
Don’t mention the word Yu Zhouzhou

24
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,530
to me.

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,289
I've made a clean break with her.

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,610
Yu...

27
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,490
Don’t mention her!

28
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,010
Here comes the fish.

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,240
Okay, the meal is ready.

30
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:32,979
Enjoy your meal.

31
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,930
Yu. Zhou. Zhou.

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,210
Who ordered these?

33
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,600
I see,

34
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,210
it seems

35
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,810
that you’re missing someone.

36
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,700
I just ordered it randomly.

37
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,060
You can order a Yu Zhouzhou at random.

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,060
Boss, change it to rice for me.

39
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,660
No more rice, only porridge.

40
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,060
Don't leave.

41
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,810
Don't be angry with two bowls of porridge.

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,889
I’m not kidding with you. I’m serious.

43
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,650
Okay. I know. I know.

44
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,250
We don't eat these, okay?

45
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,530
Let's eat GuoQiao rice noodle.

46
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,450
Why do my eyelids keep twitching?

47
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,060
It appeals to you more than a comic, doesn't it?

48
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,940
Oops, if I were you,

49
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,300
I will give Lin Yang a phone call,

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,450
or at least send a text message.

51
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,170
But what do I send?

52
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,160
How are you? What are you doing? Have you eaten?

53
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,890
Just say something. Is it hard?

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,240
But is it too pretentious?

55
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,780
It's reasonable that a girl should behave herself,

56
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,730
but it is different this time.

57
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,780
Lin Yang made a lot of phone calls

58
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,170
because of you running away from home.

59
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,860
He called me a lot.

60
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,220
I tell you.

61
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,890
This time you owe him a lot of favors.

62
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,940
Do you know?

63
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,730
I know I owe him,

64
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,300
but I don’t know what I owe him, how much I owe him.

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,370
You owe him one sentence,

66
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,700
I’m fine and don't worry.

67
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,940
I won’t run away from home again.

68
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,970
Come on, I’ll dictate, you write..

69
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,780
You just send what I say. Come on!

70
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,780
All right.

71
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,980
Oh, forget it.

72
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,700
If Lin Yang don't think so,

73
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,170
it seems like I am too self-absorbed.

74
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,700
A girl is susceptible,

75
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,730
so what if she makes a fool of herself?

76
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,810
How humiliating!

77
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,780
I know I owe him,

78
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,340
so I will make it up to him.

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,170
I will treat him better and better.

80
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,010
Right?

81
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,140
That's more like it.

82
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,060
Remember your words.

I have been waiting for that movie for a long time.

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,730
I invite you to see.

86
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,140
The only time I went to the cinema was

87
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,650
when I was six years old,

88
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,450
and I only watched for ten minutes.

89
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,730
Why?

90
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,610
No reason.

91
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,940
You do not like to go to the cinema?

92
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,290
I’m afraid of the dark, okay?

93
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,140
With my company, what are you afraid of?

Yo, you’re texting Yu Zhouzhou.

96
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,850
I want to delete all the previous text messages, okay?

97
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,300
Well, I’d like to see if you delete.

98
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,420
Delete. You are really stalling.

99
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,370
Press this to delete.

100
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,140
I know.

101
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,770
- What? 
- I’ll delete them for you.

102
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,580
Give me. Give me.

103
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,620
Let’s do it this way. We both delete for each other.

104
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,580
Just as you do not want to delete your messages,

105
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,620
I also do not want to delete my messages.

106
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,740
I tell you.

107
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,930
Ling Xiangqian sent me a good night message.

108
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,090
I don’t even dare to delete.

109

But I am impressed by your courage today.

110

Halfway through high school, nothing to show for it.

116
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,210
What are these?

117
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,300
Ten or so of them are 'Jiang Chuan, you...'

118
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,300
The words are the same, but the tone and sense of voice are different.

119
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,770
Look carefully.

120
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,740
Some are smiley faces.

121
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,330
Some are exclamation marks.

122
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,900
Some are angry faces.

Hey, look at this.

124
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,900
She acted like a spoiled brat to me.

125
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,330
You are impossible.

126
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,700
How many text messages can you store on your phone?

127
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,930
Two hundred.

128
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,020
Just filled up yesterday.

129
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,770
You’re trying to get me to clear your memory,

130
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,330
aren’t you?

131
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,300
Change back. Change back.

132
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,090
Delete. Delete. Delete. I will really delete. I will really delete.

133
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,900
I count one, two, three. We both delete together.

134
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,930
Okay.

135

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,050
Okay.

137
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,300
Come on!

138
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,740
Let's forget them.

139
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,620
Let's become a new man and study hard.

140
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,740
Go. Let's watch a movie.

141
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,700
There's a romantic movie today.

142
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
I’m not going to go.

143
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,090
I have to go to cram school then.

144
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,490
Haven’t you received your exercise book yet?

145
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,900
Oh, the teacher said it will be available in the next class.

146
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,580
Thank you!

147
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,490
You are so careful.

148
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,700
It’s the first time I’ve seen someone marked so neatly

149
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,730
I have a poor memory,

150
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,650
so I write to deepen the impression.

151
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,370
Hey, these two strokes are drawn by Yu Zhouzhou, right?

152
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,330
How do you know?

153
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,050
I can recognize her sloppy handwriting

154
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,490
wherever I see it.

155
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,370
I always get these types of questions wrong

156
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,460
She helped me out yesterday.

157
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,180
But you can recognize such a small word?

158
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,240
I just asked,

159
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,490
but I didn't expect it to be her handwriting.

160
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,980
I'd like a large bucket of popcorn,

161
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,740
two boxes of potato chips and two grilled sausages.

162
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,210
Hey,

163
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,900
are you going to see the film or have dinner?

164
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,460
I haven’t ordered enough.

165
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,090
I'd like...

166
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,050
Hey, Zhouzhou, let me invite you to have a big meal.

167
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,770
Don't see the film.

Don't spoil the fun, we're all here.

00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:17,810
Get out of the way.

338
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,560
No way.

339
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,500
You must give me an explanation.

340
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,690
What did you mean during the exam?

341
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,900
I couldn't work out the question you asked me.

342
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,569
You couldn't work out?

343
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,859
You didn't even take a look

344
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,170
and you knew that you couldn't work out.

345
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,050
Don't fool me.

346
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,770
Other students lingered away their holidays

347
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,500
while you studied for your whole holidays.

348
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,450
Your paper was full.

349
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,660
You didn't skip any question.

350
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,920
I had to tell you my anwers once I knew?

351
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,740
It's cheating.

352
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,690
Cheating? Sounds like you never cheated.

353
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,080
Before we transferred to Zhen hua High School,

354
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,050
You often gave me your answers.

355
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,140
The past is only the past.

356
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,020
We've studied in Zhen Hua for a semester.

357
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,330
I can't always side with you, right?

358
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,660
Starting to show off flowery language, huh?

359
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,540
Xin Rui, I have to remind you

360
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,410
don't think that having taken some remedial lessons

361
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,210
and flirted with that guy from Class 2 for days,

362
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,290
so you can forget who you are.

363
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,410
You are no more than a poor transient student.

364
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,020
Don't expect that you'll be like others in Zhen Hua.

365
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,740
Thank you,

366
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,290
but your reminder only applies to yourself.

367
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,050
Lin Yang!

368
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,780
Hold on! Hold on!

369
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,540
Don't forget the promise between us.

370
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,170
Do you think that everyone's just like you?

371
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,050
When will you ask him out?

372
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,290
If you hangs tough, don't utter a word when she calls you.

373
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,410
-I will ask him when he sees me. 
-It's just a poor lie that reveals the truth.

374
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,570
Only you can come up with this idea, you idiot!

375
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,330
That chap must have seen you.

376
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,930
He is just putting on an act.

377
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,290
-Wait. I'll call him. 
-You lose five shots.

378
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,540
Come here, Lin Yang.

379
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,540
Hi, Yu Zhouzhou, Mi Qiao.

380
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,450
What a coincidence!

381
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,740
What a blank-slate actor, calling you Yu Zhouzhou.

382
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,210
When did he ever call your full name?

383
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,780
What's the matter?

384
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,050
Will you be free this Saturday?

385
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,780
Ah, I'm not free on Saturday or Sunday.

386
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,410
Are you sure? Do not regret!

387
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,500
Of course I am.

388
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,290
My mom enroll me for remedial class, I have to take that.

389
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,450
What will you do after class?

390
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,690
After class, I'll attend self-sudying class, eat and sleep.

391
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,660
You live a regular life, huh?

392
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,380
I was so wayward, and my life was so irregular before.

393
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,560
Turn over a new lead in the new semester, right?

394
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,900
What about next week?

395
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,290
Let's go, Zhouzhou.

396
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,540
I haven't finished yet.

397
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,660
Don't you find that he is abshing us with his words?

398
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,090
Now I realize that

399
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,740
for Lin Yang, the more pleasing you are,

400
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,900
the more posing he will be.

401
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:31,860
Listen to me. Don't look around,

402
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,690
Three, two, one.

403
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,620
Zhouzhou, Mi Qiao,

404
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,090
our workload this semester is heavy.

405
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,570
If there's nothing much,

406
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,010
we'd better study hard.

407
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,810
Let's go.

408
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,810
Lin Yang, well done!

409
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,660
I thought your efforts would be in vain.

410
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,540
Good job, good job!

411
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,740
Last class,

412
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,090
those who couldn't recite A Happy Excursion all stand up.

413
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,370
As usual, you go first.

414
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,500
In the northern ocean there is a fish called the K'un.

415
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,330
I do not know how many thousand li in size.

416
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,780
This K'un changes into a bird, called the P'eng.

417
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,810
I don't know how many thousand li its back in breadth.

418
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,980
OK, just stop here.

419
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,450
Sit down please.

420
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,890
Next,

421
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,080
you start from the third paragraph.

422
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,330
If there is not sufficient depth,

423
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,660
water will not float large ships.

424
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,900
Upset a cupful into a hole in the yard, 
 and a mustard-seed will be your boat.

425
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,810
Try to float the cup, and it will be grounded, 
 due to the disproportion between water and vessel.

426
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,930
So with air. If there is not sufficient a depth, 
 it cannot support large wings.

427
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,900
Good job.

428
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,690
Next...

429
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,810
And for this bird, 
 a depth of ninety thousand li is necessary to bear it up.

430
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,810
Then, gliding upon the wind, with nothing save the clear sky above, 
 and no obstacles in the way,

431
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,540
it starts upon its journey to the south.

432
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,210
Well done. Sit down.

433
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,290
Next one.

434
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,740
Ms, he has recited all the texts.

435
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,620
Next passage, A Letter to His Majesty, read it.

436
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,500
OK.

437
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,170
What's wrong with you?

438
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,690
I didn't require you to recite the text.

439
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,500
You can't even read it？

440
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,740
Ms, I...

441
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,260
Sit down. As long as it is my class,

442
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,410
I won't call your nameany more.

443
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,080
Mi Qiao!  Mi Qiao!

444
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,140
Xin Rui

445
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,840
[ 3 Xin Rui 109.5]

446
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,490
Eh, Yu No.2

447
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,090
Your ranking as forever No.2 has been shaken.

448
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,570
See, now you are down to No.3.

449
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,680
[ 3 Yu Zhouzhou 111 109]

450
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,930
How can you laugh so happily with nothing to worry?

451
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,930
Xin Rui has made such big progress.

452
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,810
She's been lacking confidence.

453
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,860
The truth is that she can do this,

454
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,140
so I'm happy for her.

455
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,690
Yu Zhouzhou, you little girl.

456
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,090
I have to remind you seriously

457
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,210
that the places for students in art class 
 who will be recommended for admission to school are limited.

458
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,660
You are now in a critical situation.

459
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,900
Then what can I do?

460
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,540
It's their ability to get good scores.

461
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,570
I surely hope that I can be recommended,

462
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,900
but I can't pin my hope on others getting worse in their studies

463
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,810
and getting lower and lower scores, right?

464
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,740
Zhouzhou, my little girl,

465
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,850
Why are you so kind?

466
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,810
So cheesy!

467
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,370
Qianqian, wait!

468
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,500
Just hear me out.

469
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,860
Stop following me, will you?

470
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,540
Qianqian, I know you're in a bad mood.

471
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,740
Why am I in a bad mood?

472
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,290
Why am I not good? I am good!

473
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,090
You don't have to hide your emotion.

474
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,980
You just didn't do well in the exam for this time.

475
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,330
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

476
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,050
You're only 0.5 points lower then No.1.

477
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,740
Jiang Chuan, don't pretend that you know me well,

478
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,090
OK?

479
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,080
Do you know what I'm thinking?

480
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,170
My life, my objectives,

481
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,980
what I have to face every day when I open my eyes,

482
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,920
do you really know?

483
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,900
It's just about 0.5 points anyway.

484
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,540
Besides, is there any difference between No.1 and No.2?

485
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,330
Let me ask you. 
 Who's the first person that set foot on the moon?

486
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,260
Armstrong!

487
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,780
Then who's the second?

488
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,280
His assistant!

489
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,620
What's his name?

490
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,980
Beats me.

491
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,010
That's the difference between being No.1 and No.2.

492
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,090
No.2 will always be the background figure for No.1.

493
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,020
They are top losers.

494
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,780
Qianqian!

495
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,020
If you continue to

496
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
push yourself too hard,

497
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,810
You'll be crushed before Gaokao. Do you understand?

498
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,090
Eh, you just failed!

499
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,090
Knock it off!

500
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,980
Will wonders never cease?

501
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,570
How could you do so well in the exam?

502
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,780
Next one.

503
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,410
Immersed in the enlightment of Your Majesty's just and wise rule,

504
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,690
I was first recommended as xiaolian by Perfect Kui,

505
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,450
and then, Cishi. Then, Ci

506
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,540
Next one.

507
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,090
Next one.

508
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,380
and then Cishi Rong of the District recommended...

509
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,140
Why are you skipping me?

510
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,860
and then as xiucai Cishi Rong of the District.

511
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,330
I declined both offers on the ground that 
 I had to look after my grandmother.

512
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,780
Then your imperial edict came, offering me the position of langzhong, 
 and later further granting me the imperial favor that I,

513
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,170
your humble servant, was appointed as xianma to serve his Highnes.

514
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,740
Even if I should have my head cut off, 
 I could hardly express my gratitude for your Majesty's great favor.

515
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,570
I have written to Your Majesty a letter declining this offer.

516
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,020
Ms, could you ask me questions on your class in the future?

517
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,500
Well down. Sit down.

518
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,860
Students, look at Xin Rui.

519
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,210
She has a very good attitude towards learning.

520
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,050
-Such an aggressive aura. Is she a witch or something? 
-everyone should learn from her.

521
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,570
In contrast, those who are lazy with poor self-discipline in learning...

522
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,170
The seat is taken.

523
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,090
I'm coming to tell you that I've got my exercise book today,

524
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,980
so I'll sit here.

525
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,090
Oh, I see.

526
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,860
By the way, I saw your grades on the board.

527
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,980
You've made great progress.

528
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,020
I happened to know the answers this time.

529
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,620
Probably next time, I won't be so lucky.

530
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,570
Luck favors only the prepared mind, right?

531
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,260
Thanks.

532
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,690
No worries.

533
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:23,740
Lin Yang,

534
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,410
thank you for helping me get my seat back

535
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,690
Not at all, you also saved seat for me.

536
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,370
Not a big deal.

537
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,930
Are you free this Saturday night?

538
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,620
I have two movie tickets.

539
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,500
I don't know whether you like to see movies or not

540
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,260
Oh, I like movies,

541
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,620
but I have something to do this Saturday night

542
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:47,930
Bad timing.

543
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,380
That's OK, I'll take a rain check.

544
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,620
Sorry.

545
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,330
Finally it's weekend. I'm dead beat!

546
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,740
Eh, Lin Yang hasn't texted you yet?

547
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,050
Do you think that he has decided not to talk to me any more?

548
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,380
I don't think that boy will hold grudge for long.

549
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,410
I'm afraid that his heart was broken this time.

550
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,900
I'm to be blame for my inattentiveness

551
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,900
If I knew that he cared about me that much,

552
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,210
I should've called him back earlier,

553
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,740
and our relationship would not be like this.

554
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,980
No worries. You have enough time to make up for that,

555
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,330
though the movie will be no longer showing.

556
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,540
This Saturday is the last day.

557
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,090
It's a pity that you'll miss a good movie.

558
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,980
Then I will watch it alone.

559
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,290
What...

560
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,810
You've run this kebab stand for a while.

561
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,780
This is the first time that you provide some fabulous dishes.

562
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,810
Then just eat more.

563
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,380
Xiaoyu, give her another handful of kebab.

564
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,980
-No problem, boss 
-Xiaofei serve the drinks, the Beibingyang.

565
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,740
Hey! It's just a movie.

566
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,010
You can tell Zhouzhou by yourself.

567
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,140
I'm afraid she's not willing to.

568
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,690
Considering your close relationship,

569
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,570
even if she doesn't want to,

570
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,810
she won't refuse anyway.

571
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,860
That's my greatest worry.

572
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,810
She doesn't want to go, but she can't refuse.

573
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,800
It's so embarrassing.

574
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,450
Both of you are to be blame.

575
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,930
Why did you egg me on inviting her to watch movies?

576
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,860
Doing something for nothing.

577
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,810
Sorry.

578
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,620
It's on Saturday night.

579
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,330
If she doesn't want to go,

580
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,810
then just give it to others.

581
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,020
Lucky for you.

582
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,660
Zhouzhou is so anxious to see this movie.

583
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,090
Look, I will tell her about this.

584
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,330
She must be willing to go.

585
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,450
Your words, not mine!

586
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,260
Cut the crap! Be assured to go!

587
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,290
It's infallible. Nothing to worry about.

588
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,050
Alright!

589
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,020
Xiaoyu, hurry up and serve the dishes!

590
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,980
I finally realize that

591
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,570
you want to watch love film with her in the name of friendship.

592
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,860
Stop eating if you keep talking nonsense!

593
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,660
Eh...I was wrong. I was wrong.

594
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,330
I offended you.

595
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,620
Leave these dishes to me.

596
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,050
What do you mean?

597
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,140
I just focused on the ball rather than the person.

598
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,170
Your skill sucks.

599
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,930
Stirring me up, huh?

600
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,690
You wanna fight with me?

601
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,980
Go ahead!

602
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,140
Such a coward!

603
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,620
If you're tough, go fight with Chu Tiankuo face to face

604
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,170
instead of taking your anger out on the ball, on me!

605
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,320
Is this your best shot?

606
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,330
You aren't a coward?

607
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,780
Yu Zhouzhou, your crush,

608
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,900
has been staying with that guy from Peking University, 
 and ghosting you every day.

609
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,410
You can't even ask her about anything.

610
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,290
You are so great, Lin Yang.

611
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,050
Who the hell knows where they go?

612
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,400
What did you just say?

613
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,660
Lin Yang, it's retreatism.

614
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,210
You're numbing yourself.

615
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,380
Stop talking about the pot calling the kettle black!

616
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,900
Listen, I give up!

617
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,380
I can't live my life without Ling Xiangqian.

618
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,800
Ling Xiangqian can't live her life without me, either.

619
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,890
No matter what kind of relationship she has with Chu Tiankuo.

620
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,260
I'll be with her unswervingly.

621
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,500
I fell good and I feel comfortable.

622
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,780
I don't care how others see me.

623
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,740
Borrow me your phone.

624
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,210
I'll text Yu Zhouzhou,

625
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,810
asking her out to clarify the matter about Chen An.

626
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,780
You don't have a phone?

627
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,980
You're talking nonsense! You deleted her phone number.

628
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,400
I don't believe you can't remember

629
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,840
the phone number of Yu Zhouzhou.

630
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,890
You're pretending you can't remember.

631
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,640
[Lin Yang: Can we go to the movies  tomorrow night? By the way, I want to ask you something.]

632
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:31,780
Hello?

633
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,810
Hello, Mi Qiao.

634
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,860
He asked me out to a movie tonight.

635
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,500
I already knew it after school yesterday.

636
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,570
This guy clearly said let me take a message,

637
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,400
then he went into action himself.

638
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,330
Ah? He told you?

639
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,290
Quite!

640
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,050
He is shy like a big girl.

641
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,690
That's not like him.

642
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,450
Ah, yes.

643
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,290
The tickets for tonight are at 6:40.

644
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,620
You go early so as not to keep him waiting.

645
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,160
He hasn't even bought the tickets.

646
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,540
How do you know that?

647
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:58,540
Wait.

648
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,260
Who asked you out?

649
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:01,930
Lin Yang!

650
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,140
Hello? Hello?

651
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,410
Mi Qiao, are you still listening?

652
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,980
To answer my phone, please!

653
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:24,930
Where is your boss?

654
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,050
He said he go shopping for clothes at mall.

655
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,690
Why can't his phone be get through?

656
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,810
The electricity was like dead by noon.

657
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,410
Gosh,  something big will happen.

658
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,660
What's the matter?

659
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,540
I don't know.

660
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,740
Zhouzhou.

661
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:45,780
You must have been waiting for a long time.

662
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,740
What are you doing here, Ben ben?

663
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,540
Ah? Didn't Mi Qiao tell you?

664
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,450
What should Mi Qiao tell me?

665
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,730
You become funny for two days to see

666
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,260
You look like quite the thing.

667
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,210
If Mi Qiao didn't tell you, how would you come?

668
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,050
Hey, Zhouzhou!

669
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,540
Lin Yang, how do you come so late?

670
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,050
Oh, I was just arrive

671
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,810
and saw Ben ben is here too.

672
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,660
What a coincidence! Do you go to the movie, too?

673
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,020
Ah, no.

674
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,380
If you don't, why do you have the tickets?

675
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,810
I've been a scalper lately.

676
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,570
It is a coincidence to meet you guys here.

677
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,210
Why are you so hesitant?

678
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,740
What did you say about Mi Qiao just now?

679
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,900
Mi...Mi... Mi Qiao.

680
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,770
Mi Qiao was also asking me for tickets.

681
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,500
The movie is really popular recently.

682
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,900
It's hard to get a vote.

683
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,290
Hey, Mi Qiao, come here.

684
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,450
I found the ticket you asked for.

685
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,380
Ben ben invited me to a movie.

686
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,170
What a coincidence to meet you here.

687
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:39,810
Isn't it? Ben ben.

688
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,290
Yes.

689
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,740
You two people one says to be a scalper here,

690
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,280
one says to be invited for a movie here.

691
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,740
Can you rehearse your lines in advance?

692
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,740
Come back again after rehearsal.

693
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,340
I kept last two tickets after scalping.

694
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,540
And invited Mi Qiao.

695
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,450
What's wrong?

696
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,290
You justify yourself.

697
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,690
It's none of your business.

698
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,050
The movie is about to begin.

699
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:58,810
Chat later. Yes, yes, yes.

700
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,040
Go.

701
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,410
Go go go.

702
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,020
Fine.

703
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,410
when did they become so close?

704
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,290
I don't know.

705
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,090
Don't know what these guys are keeping from me.

706
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,140
Oh, my!

707
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,900
Ben ben said that this movie is popular.

708
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,930
What if there is no ticket left.

709
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,050
Hello!

710
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,080
Hey, although you have my word for it,

711
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,740
and it is my fault,

712
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,090
your phone was dead at the key point.

713
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,410
Look, I've been looking for you all afternoon.

714
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,810
My legs are getting thin.

715
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,540
Don't be angry anymore.

716
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,470
I'm just afraid that you are embarrassed

717
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,570
when you meet them here.

718
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,090
I specially came here to stop you.

719
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,860
Can you say a word?

720
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,050
I'm wondering why the relationship between

721
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,320
Zhouzhou and Lin Yang develop so fast?

722
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,140
Are you jealous?

723
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,540
Don't talk nonsense.

724
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,920
Thank you Master Qiao for saving my life.

725
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,380
Bye bye.

726
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,450
Hey! Are you leaving without watching the movie?

727
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,210
It's boring to watch a movie by myself.

728
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,930
Am I not human?

729
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,170
I heard that

730
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,449
there are war scenes in the movie.

731
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,330
Can your little heart stand it?

732
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,340
Don't stick it.

733
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,489
Cut the crap and buy the popcorn.

734
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,820
We only have one last ticket for this movie.

735
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,300
Okay, forget it.

736
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,610
Only one ticket left.

737
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,060
That's fine, we can see it next time.

738
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,260
Hello, I bought an extra ticket.

739
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,580
Can I have a refund?

740
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,980
What did you want to say to me just now?

741
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,780
Oh, nothing important.

742
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,980
Why are you so hesitant, too?

743
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,340
You can say what you want to say.

744
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:52,500
Hmmm...

745
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,340
It's about you and Chen An.

746
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,020
Can you just forget about him?

747
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,580
Thanks.

748
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,980
Why can't I mention him?

749
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,100
Hey! That student!

750
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:03,820
Are you calling me?

751
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,610
Yes. Someone just refunded a ticket.

752
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,580
So we have two now.

753
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,540
The problem is there is a seat between them.

754
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,410
Is that alright?

755
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,260
Yes, sure.

756
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,250
How much are they?

757
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,850
Sorry.

758
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,540
Lin Yang.

759
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,450
It's okay.

760
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,340
Can you hurry up? We can't see the movie.

761
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,820
What a coincidence.

762
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:55,850
I'm sorry.

763
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,410
I wouldn't have come if had known.

764
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,740
Blame me for not being clear.

765
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,780
Can't you buy two small buckets?

766
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,850
It's so embarrassing.

767
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,780
But the others are all buying the big one.

768
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,370
You hold it or I hold it.

769
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,130
Oh, come on. Just give it to me.

770
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:27,850
I'll tell you.

771
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,580
The last time I saw a film was

772
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,850
when I was six years old.

773
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,340
And I only saw it for ten minutes.

774
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:33,980
It is the first time

775
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,450
that I watch a movie with a girl.

776
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,130
I do it gladly.

777
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,500
Same here.

[Lin Yang: Do you mean Chen An? How can this be the same?]

784
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,500
The girl is crying in the movie.

785
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,740
And you just keep eating.

786
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,690
What's there to cry about?

787
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,980
I know the plots already.

788
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,260
Have you ever seen it?

789
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,410
Sort of.

790
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,020
Then you just said you never watched a movie

791
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,850
since you were six.

792
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:57,930
There is no truth in your mouth.

793
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,410
All words are true.

794
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,780
Hey, I'll throw it for you, I'll do it.

Zhouzhou, let me get you home.

798
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,210
I can go home by myself.

799
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,890
The movie is pretty good, thank you.

800
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,370
Do you have a fight?

801
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,130
I have no idea, either.

802
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,580
Because of me?

803

Oh, no, no.

804
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,100
Maybe I'll get you home...

No, thanks.
