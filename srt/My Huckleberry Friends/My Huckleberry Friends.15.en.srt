Please don't call us teachers

the Chirldren's Palace to teach students

52

and was taught well by Mr.Gu

teaching Xiaoming only in the futrue?

58
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,980
Sorry, Sir, I'm still in high school

59
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,700
I'm afraid I don't have too much time to do it

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:42,690
Well

61

Would you mind teaching him?

I stay here just for the Spring Festival

68
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,010
Maybe I won't come back after the Spring Festival

Xiaoming's father

80
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,300
He must want you to teach Xiaoming

81
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,450
as a good example

82
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,770
But what you said just now

83
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,140
must make his father feel useless

84
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,850
for treating us like that

85
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,090
Maybe he even thought he shouldn't do it

86
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,170
That's okay. I didn't want to come

87
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,980
But he insisted

88
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,890
What happened?

89
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,650

93
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:02,780
Where's daddy?

94
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,450
I don't know. Maybe somewhere to play

95
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,980
Aren't you studying now?

96
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,340
I can do it later

97
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,180
Why? What happened?

98
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,140
Mom

99
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,210
I'm your daughter, right?

100
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,300
You are asking bullshit

101
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,050
If you were not my daughter,
 I would have dumped you

102
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,900
You can only waste my money

103
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,020
I was just asking

104
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,770
Benben, I set off this kind of 
double-bang firecraker when I was a kid

105
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,900
I'll take twenty of it, please

106
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,650
No, thanks

107
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:43,930
Why not?

108
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,980
We've already got a lot

109
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,300
Well, you don't understand

110
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,530
We bought petard just now

111
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,370
But this is the double-bang firecraker

112

What's the difference?

113
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,530
Well, what else do you have?

114
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,140
There are firecrackers look like 
frisbee and mouse

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,980
It can run all over the ground when it is lit.
 That one.

116
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,250
Can I try it?

117
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,180
You foolish! These firecrakers are for sale

118
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,050
How can you set off them?

119
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,770
Who are you with?

120
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,180
That is great! That one!

121
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,450
I want it! I want it!That one!

122
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,860
You can play with him

123
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,740
Play with the kids over there

124
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,330
I want that, too. I'd like that.

125
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,370
Please, I'll take twenty of that

126
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,580
You can send this food to my home later

127
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,490
Then

128
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,210
keep the firecrakers

129
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,300
I'll meet you tonight

130
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,020
Oh, god

131
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,930
I've been doing things for you for the whole day

132
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,490
Please, let me have a rest

133

Can you go out with Zhouzhou toninght?

134
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,620
Well, she's been really busy these days

135
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,700
She went to see Chen An as soon as she could

136
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,930
I couldn't find her

137
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,020
Did Chen An not leave?

138
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,330
Of course not. Nobody would leave 
 on Chinese New Year's Eve

139
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,250
Hello?

140
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,740
Hello? Is that Zhouzhou? Where are you?

141
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,300
Why do you call me? I'm not home

142
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,050
My mom let me do shopping for the Spring Festival

143
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,580
Have you bought anything?
 Let's go shopping together

144
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,420
I'm afraid I can't. I have something to do

145
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,580
Well, Zhouzhou

146
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,010
Go out and play with me 
if you are free during the Spring Festival

147
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,770
Zhouzhou, what happened?

148
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,410
I have something to do now. Bye

149
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:01,850
Byebye

150
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,860
There is a cello over there

151
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,140
Let's play it for a whlie

152
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:11,650
Okay

153
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,020
What's wrong?

154
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,170
I'm not in the mood

155
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,180
Because of your father's message. Right?

156
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:46,900
Zhouzhou

157
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,460
Don't you think we are like?

158
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,980
Your father abandoned you and your mother

159
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,860
My father was dating his present wife

160
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,240
when my mother had serious illness

161
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,410
I still don't want to go home 
 even after all these years

162
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,700
His present wife doesn't want to see me

163
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,370
I don't want to see her, either

164
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,620
She had a son. He is in junior school this year

165
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,140
He's still a child

166
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,770
But She began to worry that

167
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,090
I would fight with her son for property

168
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,610
No way. It's so...

169
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,330
So, I think it has already happened

170
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,700
Just cut all the connections

171
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,770
This should be the last time I go home 
 for the Spring Festival

172
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,090
Chen An, he is your father

173
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,330
You've lived together since you were a kid

174
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,760
Zhouzhou, do you hate you father?

175
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,740
I remember the first time

176
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,250
I didn't listen to my mother

177
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,050
Maybe it's just the first time in my memory

178
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,580
My mother and I were in a shopping mall

179
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,620
Then I saw a man buy his child

180
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,480
a bottle of Xi'le

181
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,180
That was a kind of canned beverage
 in small plastic bottle

182
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,020
I know it. I used to love it, too

183
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,290
I wanted it at that time

184
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,460
So I asked my mother to buy it for me

185
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,580
I remember it was expensive

186
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,980
She was looking for a job

187
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,980
and was stressed out

188
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,900
I was crying. I wanted her to buy it for me

189
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,370
She had no choice and bought one for me

190
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,490
You were naughty when you were a kid

191
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,050
Because it tastes great

192
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,300
I still remember that taste even now

193
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,170
Sweet and creamy

194
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,800
I used to sip it at that time

195
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,890
I could keep sipping it for the whole day

196
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,860
I was wonder that

197
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,059
why I did't have a dad

198
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,010
I couldn't understand the gossip
 from my neighbors at that time

199
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,770
When I grow up, I was always thinking that

200
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,740
what it would be like if I had a dad

201
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,570
I would blame him

202
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,740
for leaving my mother and me

203
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,770
But now I think

204
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,760
the greatest influence that my dad had on me

205
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,450
is that day

206
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,180
when I asked my mother for Xi'le

207
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,010
Maybe I was thinking that

208
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,620
other kids could get Xi'le from their dad

209
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,260
I didn't have a dad, so I couldn't get it

210
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,130
It is ridiculous, right?

211
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,770
After being absent for so many years

212
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,420
it's useless to meet again

213
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,130
Hello, welcome!

214
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,090
Thanks

215
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,570
Hurry up!

216
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,380
Why do we have meals with them again?

217
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,010
They are waiting for us

218
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,130
Director Zhou is going to be transferred

219
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,730
So we have a meal and celebrate the New Year with them

220
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,820
Is Zhou Shenran in your school?

221
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,250
Oh god! Zhou Shenran

222
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,060
He is annoying

223
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,500
Yangyang, don't be childish!

224
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,530
So, you mean that it's better not to see him

225
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,650
If I were you, I wouldn't go to see him

226
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,980
And if it was two weeks ago

227
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,010
I would strongly advise you not to do it

228
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,090
How about now?

229
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,530
I have helped Mr. Gu teach students recently

230
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,380
So I played the piano again

231
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,010
I suddenly found that I haven't played 
 the piano for a long time

232
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,890
but I really like it

233
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,210
You played it very well

234
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,770
But what's the point?

235
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,770
There is no point for me to play the piano

236
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,970
I can't make a living by playing it

237
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,690
I can't be a talented musician, either

238
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,980
Zhouzhou, I know there is no point

239
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,980
to see your father

240
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,500
It also will give him

241
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,010
a kind of psychological comfort

242
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,130
As if he could make up for everything 
 with a few words

243
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,010
Is it so easy?

244
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,210
But if going to see him

245
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,690
can make you feel relieved

246
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,420
Just do it

247
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,090
I know

248
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,770
Let's get started

249
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,080
- Cheers! 
- Happy New Year!

250
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,260
Happy New Year!

251
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,770
Well, let's enjoy it!

252
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,740
This restaurant is really popular

253
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,980
You must have reservation two weeks in advance

254
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,050
during the Spring Festival

255
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,770
That's really kind of you

256
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,260
By rights, I should have treated you

257
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,420
Right

258
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,440
Not at all

259
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,420
It's what we're supposed to do

260
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,860
First, let's toast to

261
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,650
the promotion of Director Zhou

262
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,300
Director Zhou is tranferred to Beijing

263
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,860
which is a big step in life

264
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,560
That's right. That's right

265
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,560
You're really moving up

266
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,740
Thank you. Thank you

267
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,650
Thank you. Thank you

268
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,260
Thanks

269
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,210
To be honest

270
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,450
Things in Beijing are complicated

271
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,180
I don't like it

272
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,450
In my opinion, it's better to go to Beijing

273
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,890
After you get settled in

274
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,090
you can take Ranran to Beijing

275
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,260
You don't have to think about him

276
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,690
What are you talking about?

277
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,060
Enjoy the meal, enjoy it

278
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,650
But Ranran, what's wrong with your eye?

279
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,330
Did you fall down?

280
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,210
It was Yu Zhouzhou

281
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,060
She sent someone to hit me

282
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,940
Yu Zhouzhou

283
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,380
Yu Zhouzhou, that little bast...

284
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,290
I don't know how she can meet 
a bunch of bad friends

285
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,260
The only thing they did is bullying Ranran

286
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,330
But someone still keep thinking about her

287
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,300
Someone was looking for trouble

288
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,940
But still blame on other people

289
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,690
Yangyang, shut up

290
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,330
Where are you going?

291
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:40,890
Restroom

292
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,180
He is just a child

293
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,260
Don't care about what he said

294
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,690
He is young. I can understand it

295
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,130
Well, Ranran, enjoy the meal

296
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,980
I'll go to the restroom, too

297
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,060
Enjoy it. Come on

298
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:06,890
Uncle Zhou

299
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,300
Yes

300
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,530
Lin Yang

301
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,380
You and Zhouzhou are friends, right?

302
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,650
Yes, uncle Zhou. I hit Zhou Shenran but...

303
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,450
Do you have her number?

304
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:26,650
Yes, I do

305
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,650
Well, look

306
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,500
Is it this one?

307
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:30,980
Yes, it is

308
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,090
What's the matter?

309
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,330
I think you have heard about us

310
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:39,730
Yes

311
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,180
Before I leave here

312
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,500
I still want to see her

313
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,060
But I sent her a message

314
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,180
She didn't text me back

315
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,450
I wonder that

316
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,290
if she didn't want to see me

317
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,680
It's okay. You can go back

318
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,140
Uncle Zhou

319
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,650
I'll try to persuade her

320
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,980
I'll let her see you before you leave

321
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,980
You will leave after the New Year, right?

322
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:16,820
That's right

323
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,650
When I get settled in

324
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,380
I will take my son and my wife there

325
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,620
How did they go to restroom

326
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,620
for so long?

327
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,260
Daddy, I also need to go to the restroom

328
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,060
Okay

329
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,330
We will wait for you here

330
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:32,740
Okay

331
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,570
Yangyang, don't bully Ranran

332
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,690
You're two years older than him

333
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,330
I know

334
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,170
It's okay

335
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,330
Ranran is spoiled by his mother

336
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,010
Ranran is just unlukcy

337
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,940
He was bullied by Yu Zhouzhou in childhood

338
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,010
I think that it's okay for little boy

339
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:56,860
to have a rough time

340
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,890
But she shouldn't bully him all the time

341
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,210
I heard that Yu Zhouzhou is in this school

342
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,180
She and Yangyang is in the same class

343
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,570
Right?

344
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,010
I'm not sure

345
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,530
I only know few people in his class

346
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,650
Ranran is still a child

347
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,740
I worry that Yu Zhouzhou will bully him

348
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,860
They are still children. 
They can't understand many things

349
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,130
That's why they need education

350
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,650
All right. Let's go

351
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,690
Mommy, Yu zhouzhou you mentioned...

352
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,770
Yu Zhouzhou? Call her bastard

353
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,060
Bastard

354
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,260
Today I saw her in school

355
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,450
Did you see her?

356
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,810
How did you know which one is her?

357
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,690
At the flag-raising ceremony

358
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,300
tha headmaster praised her

359
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,380
for getting a prize at a story contest

360
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,090
What?

361
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,890
Ranran, study hard

362
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,560
I'll ask teacher to skip a grade for you 
 next semester

363
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,500
But I just knew my classmates

364
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,620
What? Do you have any friend now?

365
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:07,770
No

366
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,890
Ranran, you can't let me down

367
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,010
You have to do better than Yu Zhouzhou

368
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,450
You have to be better than her in everything

369
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,770
You have to leave her behind you forever

370
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,380
Do you understand?

371
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,570
Yes

372
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,890
What are you doing here?

373
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,060
I couldn't find you anywhere these days

374
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,330
I came to meet you, but you were not home

375
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,290
So I waited for you

376
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,300
Lin Yang

377
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,620
I really don't have time to

378
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,690
go shopping with you

379
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,820
What have you been up to?

380
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,450
Do I have to tell you?

381
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,420
I'll go upstairs if you have nothing to say

382
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,060
You're too busy to see you father, right?

383
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,530
Who told you?

384
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,160
My family had a meal with Zhou Shenran's family

385
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,690
Your father asked me your number

386
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,010
He was afraid the number was wrong

387
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,900
Would you mind staying out of my business?

388
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,780
I've been a little confused recently

389
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,290
Your father will go to Beijing

390
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,980
He maybe will never come back

391
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,170
Are you sure you don't go to see him?

392
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,290
But he has never fulfilled the duty

393
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,930
of being a father

394
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,090
Zhouzhou, Have you heard of 
Water Margin Character Cards?

395
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,170
That's a set of cards for collection. 
You can find it in crispy instant noodles package

396
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,260
I wanted the card of Lin Chong 
more than other cards

397
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,170
But I just couldn't get it

398
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,850
Later, my classmate who 
didn't like card collection

399
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,570
got one

400
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,780
He said he could sell it to me for twenty yuan

401
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,690
But a packet of crispy instant noodles 
costs only fifty cents

402
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,410
It was too expensive. So I refused

403
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,140
After that

404
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,810
I spent more than twenty yuan 
buying instant noodles

405
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
But I couldn't get one Lin Chong card

406
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,330
I still regret it

407
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,780
So do you mean that going to see my dad for me

408
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,620
is like collecting Water Margin cards for you?

409
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,740
I mean that don't let yourself regret

410
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,980
Lin Yang, you don't understand

411
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,290
At least, he is your father!

412
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,620
I'm really sorry about your mother

413
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,020
I still want to make amends

414
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,210
That's enough

415
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,380
Oh my god!

416
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:31,780
Oh my god!

417
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,090
How dare you! How dare you!

418
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,090
I'm warning you. If you break the car

419
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,020
you can't afford it

420
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,780
Murong, come out if you can

421
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,090
Don't hide in the car

422
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,740
We do this all for the child

423
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,780
You don't have to be like this

424
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,690
Get out! It's none of your business

425
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,280
Well, come out!

426
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,210
Come out!

427
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,860
You! Come out! Come out!

428
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,660
Dad, you are drunk again

429
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,930
What did you call me?

430
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:15,900
What happened?

431
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,330
Did you throw those things at the door?

432
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,020
No

433
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,050
No

434
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,330
I'm not your dad

435
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,450
Your dad

436
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,810
Your dad is going to take you away

437
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,690
Did they come here again?

438
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,660
Thank you

439
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,170
Not at all

440
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,860
He has been given up alcohol for long time

441
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,620
It seemed that my birth father came here today

442
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,380
So he...

443
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,930
Let's go set off fireworks when it gets dark

444
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,380
I'm gonna go out

445
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,860
Where are you going?

446
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,090
It's Chinese New Year Eve

447
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,410
I'll be back soon

448
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,660
Come back early

449
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,810
We're going to pick up 
your grandmother afternoon

450
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:12,980
She's been talking about you

451
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,540
Okay

452
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,090
I have something to do now

453
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,860
I have to fetch a document in company

454
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,900
I have already mixed the stuffing 
for the dumplings

455
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Wait for me to make dumplings together

456
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,210
Stop!

457
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,290
I don't allow you to see her, the bastard

458
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,930
Welcome back

459
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:50,780
I was right

460
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,740
On the Chinese New Year Eve

461
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,860
what can you do outside alone?

462
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,450
Where are my aunt and my brother?

463
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,090
They went celebrate the New Year with her mother

464
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,170
There are just two of us 
to celebrate the New Year this time

465
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,450
Call her back

466
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,570
I have something to discuss with you

467
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,320
Why are you looking at my phone?

468
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,380
I'm your wife

469
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,290
Why can't I look at it?

470
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,450
Why does the bastard have your number?

471
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,620
She is my daughter

472
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,410
Why can't she have my number?

473
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,800
But Ranran is your son

474
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,140
It's the Chiese New Year's Eve. 
I don't allow you to see her

475
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,210
I have to see her this time

476
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,620
No. I'll say it again

477
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,020
No. I don't allow you to see her

478
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,140
I will go to see her today

479
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,570
Zhou Guoshu, if you go out...

480
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:54,980
Mom

481
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,570
Ranran, have you finished your homework?

482
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:01,900
Mom

483
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,740
Your dad went out

484
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,740
He'll be back soon

485
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,540
When he come back, let's cook some dumplings

486
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,440
Is that okay?

487
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,210
You're home

488
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,690
This is for Zhouzhou

489
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,620
Thank you for Zhouzhou's school

490
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,290
I'll take good care of her

491
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,380
I hope that you won't bother her any more

492
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,660
You can leave now

493
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,980
Zhouzhou

494
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,620
How is your school life?

495
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,850
Do you feel stressed?

496
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,260
A little. It can't be easy

497
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,860
to study in Zhen Hua Middle School

498
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,050
Well

499
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,260
Which university do you want to atten in?

500
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,660
What will you major in?

501
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,980
I haven' decided the major yet

502
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,500
Maybe I will choose universities in Beijing

503
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,320
Bejing is a good place

504
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,330
Did you ask me out

505
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,860
for something?

506
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,500
Nothing

507
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,050
Today is the Chinese New Year's Eve. 
I just want to see you

508
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,500
All these years

509
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:03,780
you and your mother suffered a lot

510
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,050
And Ranran

511
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,260
he made a lot of trouble for you at school

512
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,290
I really don't want you two to be like this

513
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,540
There are something

514
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,330
I didn't do well

515
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,660
However

516
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,730
Ranran won't give you any trouble

517
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,570
After the New Year

518
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,860
I will be transferred in Beijing

519
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,290
Ranran will be in Beijing, too

520
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,090
If there are no special circumstances

521
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,930
maybe

522
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,020
we won't be back any more

523
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,090
You know

524
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,780
Ranran is still a child. 
He can't understand many things

525
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,090
Don't feel hatred toward him

526
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,900
No, I don't

527
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,450
Sometime, I even envy him

[Xinhaiyuan Store]

529
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,500
I'll get something to drink

530
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,330
Okay

531
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,330
Do you have Xi'le?

532
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:19,690
Yes, we do

533
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,540
I would like several bottles of it

534
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,540
I hope that you won't bother her any more

Okay

Are you out of mind?

538
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,980
I'm your father

539
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,380
You're my son

540
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,010
It's a matter of course

541
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,140
No one can change it

542
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,080
But it can be changed by law

543
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,660
I worked so hard to bring you up

544
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,860
and send you to school

545
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,900
Is that how you repay me?

546
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,770
My mother was so good to you

547
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,200
How did you repay her?

Aunt

you will agree, I suppose

550
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,570
You mean that after you take 200,000 yuan

551
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,090
You have nothing to do with this family, right?

552
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,620
Since then

553
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,800
I won't take a penny from this family

554

If oneday something happens to my dad

555

I will have no right of inheritance

556

The property will be owned all by my brother

557

Okay. I'll listen to your father

558
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,900
Can't you forgive me?

559
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,210
There is nothing about forgiving

560
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,020
In my mind

561
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,540
you were not my father any more

562
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,020
I am just curious

I feel so sorry about you and your mother

567

The things between your mother and me

568
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,570
You're still a child. You can't understand it

569
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,290
You know

570
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,810
I'm usually busy at work

571
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,930
Your mother always takes care of you

572

She's very well meaning

I didn't do well in the exam

578
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,980
I will study harder. Don't be angry

579
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,680
Why would I be angry?

580
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,810
I know you are a good kid

581
