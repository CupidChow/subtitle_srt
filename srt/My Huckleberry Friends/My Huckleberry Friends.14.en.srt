1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,340
My Huckleberry Friends

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,180
a 30-episode tv series adpoted from the novel My Huckleberry Friends by Bayuechangan

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,820
All right, now we have finished

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,770
all required tasks for the first semester.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,500
There are only two weeks left for the final exam.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,420
I was thinking of a round of review.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,850
But since we are one of the elite classes,

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,770
I think it is unnecessary to do it in class.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,659
Otherwise we may waste time. We've better use the class to prepare for the college entrance examination.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,980
We will move forward our syllabus.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,700
Don't worry about the final exam.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,930
It won't be a tough one.

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,660
But you still have to be careful,

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,340
especially for those who are not good at geography.

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,500
Please use you time wisely

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,650
and fully review what you have learnt.

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,220
一

19
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,220
Well, there's no homework for you this weekend.

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,890
Enjoy yourselves!

21
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,890
Class dismissed!

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,180
Class dismissed!

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,860
Hold on!

24
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,090
I have something to say.

25
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,489
What about this, Mr. Wu?

26
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,250
Are you annoyed at my coming?

27
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,330
Fine. It's my fault.

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,930
I'll call Director Pan to inform you.

29
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:11,289
NO!

30
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:11,930
My apology, Mr. Wu. Just do whatever you want.

31
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,160
As you wish.

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,530
May I have your attention, please?

33
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,340
According to the result of the mid-term exam,

34
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,410
the whole grade didn't give a satisfying result,

35
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,380
especially Class 1, 2, and 3.

36
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,490
You three elite classes

37
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,420
failed to play a leading role

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,460
among all classes.

39
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,570
We should always prepare for the worst and stay alert!

40
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,060
Thus, we decided that

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,729
the three elite classes

42
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,100
are supposed to stay

43
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,780
two more hours at school

44
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,289
every day to study.

45
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:41,530
The new schedule will take effect next week.

46
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,490
Are you kidding me?

47
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,570
Quiet! Quiet!

48
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,930
I haven't finished!

49
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,060
All teachers will stay with you to answer your questions!

50
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,060
From

51
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,700
Director Pan Yuansheng, the one who loves you so much!

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,850
Mr. Zhang!

53
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,979
My dad have ordered films for me!

54
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,610
We planned to go to the cinema after school!

55
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:11,580
Well,

56
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,060
let your parents come to have a discussion.

57
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,780
I will let you go

58
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,610
if they insist.

59
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,000
Fine, fine, fine. I give it up.

60
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,730
Who else want to watch films?

61
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,940
Or who else disagree with the decision?

62
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,730
Are you numb?

63
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,450
It's your chance to keep accompanied with Yu Zhouzhou, isn't it?

64
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,420
Lin Yang!

65
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,060
Your performance in recent tests dropped a lot.

66
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,420
How dare you disagree?

67
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,450
It's a misunderstanding!

68
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,780
I just want to remind my fellow classmates

69
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,730
that we do have to stay alert and spare no effort.

70
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,300
We also have to appreciate Mr. Zhang,

71
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,010
for you will also stay with us every night.

72
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,500
You sacrifice your freedom.

73
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,890
What a good teacher!

74
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,250
Stop flattering me!

75
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,730
You are expected to correct yourself in the next few weeks.

76
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,720
If you cannot regain your previous position at the top three,

77
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,810
you shall have a lesson!

78
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,730
Sit down!

79
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,060
Why don't you learn from Zhou Shenran?

80
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,140
Work step by step!

81
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,980
Dismiss!

82
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,460
Episode 14 Create the Miracle, the Brave Boys and Girls

83
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,530
Hey?

84
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,890
I just remembered something.

85
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,450
Well, another year passed.

86
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,060
Cherish time!

87
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,610
See!

88
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,250
Seems that Jay Zhou's love song

89
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,500
sounds more beautiful from his month.

90
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,090
My dear friend Yu Zhouzhou,

91
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,890
would you like to go to the amusement park with me?

92
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,700
The new ghost house there is very popular.

93
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,500
I don't have time.

94
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,720
Why do you still go to the Children's Palace?

95
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,890
See, Jiang Chuan. Perhaps you should invite him.

96
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,579
Where are we going to?

97
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,610
To the ghost house?

98
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,370
You are my unfortunate ghost!

99
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,370
Don't annoy me!

100
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,360
My fellow friends,

101
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,420
what makes you so depressed?

102
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,330
His beloved Qianqian accepted the invitation of Chu Tiankuo.

103
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,970
His beloved Zhouzhou accepted the invitation of the senior.

104
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,780
Lin Yang! I've told you

105
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,340
to keep fighting!

106
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,580
That senior one doesn't have anything particular!

107
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,769
Except for a handsome face

108
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,490
and a bit of experience,

109
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,860
he has no advantage!

110
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,050
Create the Miracle,

111
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,180
the Brave Boys and Girls

112
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,580
Hey, Chen An!

113
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,770
After you.

114
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,620
Ok!

115
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,580
Stop playing!

116
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,050
Stop playing!

117
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,740
Zhouzhou, play with us!

118
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,900
We will play

119
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,210
after you have finished your class.

120
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,370
Alright.

121
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,700
Are you ready?

122
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,810
Let's begin!

123
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,490
Is everything fine?

124
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,300
Still thinking about your family?

125
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,620
It's not a big deal.

126
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,860
Pause!

127
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,020
Ming,

128
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,520
how long have you

129
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,010
been practicing?

130
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,700
Why don't you make any progress?

131
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,250
Your mistakes are still there!

132
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,020
I won't take you to the contest.

133
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,740
You make no progress at all.

134
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,370
Go back home.

135
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,210
What did you say to him?

136
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,180
We cannot afford to fail.

137
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,700
His incompetence will lag the whole team.

138
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,250
I will ask Mr. Gu for a new one.

139
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,930
You kick him out

140
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,580
because he wasn't good enough?

141
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,180
Zhouzhou!

142
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,930
Our time is limited!

143
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,900
Only then will we

144
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,860
guarantee more chance to success.

145
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,020
Does it matter that much to be success?

146
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,980
Only the champion

147
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,490
deserves to give you the answer.

148
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,370
I do a bad job in geography,

149
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,860
worse than half of my class.

150
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,770
Does it mean that I have to quit the class?

151
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,810
Or I have to quit the college entrance exam?

152
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,250
You told me when I was a kid

153
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,300
that everyone is supposed to be their own hero!

154
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,490
As long as we spare no effort,

155
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,900
we can climb out of darkness

156
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,290
and be the hero of the world!

157
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,020
Not everyone is a hero.

158
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,360
Hero comes from his competence!

159
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,810
Zhouzhou,

160
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,900
you are not like them.

161
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,140
You showed great potential when you were a child.

162
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,530
But there's no difference between they and I!

163
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,570
Resume the rehearsal, shall we?

164
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,970
Start from the begining!

165
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,610
Now,

166
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,130
we have the square y plus the square x1.

167
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,490
Then we will have the function of the lines.

168
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,650
We can first……

169
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,930
Wow, why do you come?

170
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,140
The exam is approaching.

171
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,370
I need your instructions!

172
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,050
I don't know what to instruct you.

173
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,250
You can instruct me on Chinese and English!

174
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,180
Besides, I can also ask for the help of my dear friend Chu.

175
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,860
Will you?

176
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,050
We should help each other!

177
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,650
Help each other!

178
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,860
I have a question!

179
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,020
Here!

180
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,740
Its seems like something for college students.

181
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,330
Is it?

182
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,050
Never mind.

183
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,930
Don't trouble him!

184
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,690
He has to prepare for the physical contest!

185
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,770
The physical contest?

186
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,580
Lin Yang also participates!

187
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,490
He doesn't prepare that early.

188
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,140
X = 3/10

189
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,860
Understood?

190
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,860
Understood.

191
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,930
Thank you.

192
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,210
Oh by the way,

193
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,330
could you please come to our class tonight?

194
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,700
The last paper still confuses us.

195
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,900
They didn't get it and

196
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,330
dare not to ask.

197
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,330
So I come to ask for your instructions

198
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,980
I still have some questions about it.

199
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,810
I don't want to mislead my classmates.

200
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,140
I have told you just now!

201
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,090
What's wrong with you and Class 3?

202
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,050
Every time I instruct you, you pay no attention!

203
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,740
Now you come to me for another chance?

204
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,250
Tonight

205
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,760
I will go to other classes.

206
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,490
I offer myself!

207
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,210
I can solve all the problems!

208
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,740
I may also ask them for advice on Enligh

209
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,810
by the way.

210
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,330
Besides, I can share

211
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,620
your burdens.

212
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,010
What trick do you want to play on me?

213
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,059
Ah, I think perhaps

214
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,770
maybe Li Yang is qualified, let him have a try.

215
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,740
You are so weird, both of you!

216
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,690
Fine.

217
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,570
Don't make it a shame of yourself and your class!

218
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,640
It won't be a big deal to me!

219
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,930
Wow, what a cool drawing of Hanamichi Sakuragi!

220
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,180
What a masterpiece!

221
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,300
Mi Qiao!

222
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,890
What's up?

223
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,500
What's up?

224
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,380
Today is a big day.

225
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,260
Why?

226
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,760
Today is the first day we have the night study.

227
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,330
Freak!

228
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,820
Why are you so excited?

229
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,690
Will Zhouzhou leave?

230
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,530
I've no idea.

231
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,690
Please tell me.

232
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,620
What do you want to do?

233
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,770
Tonight I'll come to

234
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,940
to instruct your class of the last test paper.

235
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,380
Wow, nice job, Mr. Lin!

236
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,570
Please give her my little gift.

237
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,740
Only one? You are too stingy.

238
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,380
Stingy boy.

239
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,250
Zhouzhou,

240
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,530
are you going to meet with your handsome senior tonight?

241
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,690
Are you going to skip the night study?

242
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,650
No.

243
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,180
Well, only studying can keep you accompanied with me after all.

244
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,820
I'm in misery.

245
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,410
What do you want?

246
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,860
I just want some fortune from you for the approaching exam.

247
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,490
Can't I?

248
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,300
I'm not mercy one.

249
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,650
But I don't believe it.

250
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,130
Bless me! Zhouzhou!

251
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,570
Bless me!

252
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,690
No way!

253
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,650
It's already cold.

254
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,260
It must be the left-over of lunch.

255
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,610
There!

256
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,500
Zhenhua is so hardworking.

257
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,740
I wont' make it at all

258
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,690
when we enter the third grade.

259
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,740
Then my dad will send delicious food to me everyday.

260
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,060
Otherwise I cannot bear it at all.

261
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,130
Xin Rui,

262
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,930
why are you alone?

263
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,980
Hey,

264
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,940
what's up?

265
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,820
It's time for meal.

266
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,450
You'd have a rest.

267
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,200
That's ok.

268
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,890
It is all Director Pan's fault.

269
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,330
His ranking mechanism

270
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,300
is bullshit.

271
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,330
If one doesn't do a good job,

272
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,330
he will be replaced by a better one.

273
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,570
He only believes utilitariansim.

274
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,680
That will pose a negative effect to us, both physically and mentally.

275
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,650
Now it's time for food.

276
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,450
If there's any problem,

277
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,330
leave it to the night study.

278
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,820
I can help you, except for geography.

279
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,860
It'll be Ok.

280
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,890
We will struggle against

281
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,820
this evil competition!

282
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,210
Cheers!

283
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,770
With greater power comes greater responsibility!

284
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,620
We two have to

285
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,980
count on you from now on!

286
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:07,980
Here, cheers!

287
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,010
May I come in?

288
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,450
Mr. Wu,

289
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,860
Mr. Zhang Feng orders me

290
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,890
to instruct you class.

291
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,820
What a lazy Zhang Feng.

292
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,380
Take out the exam paper, please.

293
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,940
May I come in?

294
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,570
Come in.

295
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,530
Mr. Wu asked me to help your geography.

296
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,770
If it were no you, I won't accept the request at all.

297
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,060
But you are a smart girl.

298
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,130
You always understand the issues quickly.

299
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,130
In fact, my problem is that

300
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,380
I fail to remember these details.

301
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,300
I have to say you didn't spare all efforts.

302
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,300
Otherwise you have already remembered them all.

303
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,060
May I come in?

304
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,650
What's up, Xin Yue?

305
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,650
I just come for some advice.

306
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,530
I don't know how to review.

307
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,890
Well, take this.

308
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,820
I have generalized all you need here.

309
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,010
You may start from this paper.

310
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,570
I'll instruct you after you have finished.

311
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,010
Thank you!

312
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,620
Mrs. Shen,

313
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,620
I have to

314
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,380
leave for a moment.

315
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,620
Oh, I also have to leave for a moment.

316
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,530
After you.

317
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,210
See you.

318
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,880
Because P=2,

319
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,500
we can get the coordinate (1,0).

320
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,130
Please have a try

321
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,650
according to my instructions on the blackboard.

322
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,980
You failed me.

323
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,690
She went for Mrs. Shen for geography.

324
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,820
No one can expect that.

325
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,500
You can leave when you solve the question.

326
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,890
If there's still anything confusing,

327
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,090
you can go to class 2 to ask Mr. Zhang.

328
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,690
Wait a minute, Lin Yang.

329
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,130
I still don't know the machanism of the third step.

330
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,890
Could you please intruct me once more?

331
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,770
This is your last chance!

332
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,620
Thank you!

333
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,940
Zhouzhou!

334
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,360
—

335
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:23,980
Zhouzhou!

336
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,010
Why don't you ignore me?

337
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,860
Oh, sorry.

338
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,770
Will you go to Mrs. Shen tomorrow evening?

339
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:29,940
Of course.

340
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,740
How unexpected.

341
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,970
How about you?

342
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,090
You have fallen from the first

343
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,450
to the fifth.

344
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,420
So we share the same dilemma. We are like brother and sister.

345
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,570
Then I must be your senior.

346
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,940
No way.

347
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,420
Hey, don't leave me alone, my dear sister!

348
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,260
Mrs.Shen, are you going to the

349
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,290
teacher's training this weekend?

350
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,090
Of course.

351
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,860
Me too.

352
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,820
Do you live far from there?

353
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,860
Not too far.

354
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,380
It only takes about half an hour.

355
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:57,970
Well.

356
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,300
May I come in?

357
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,620
Sorry for that, I'll knock the door next time.

358
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,010
Why do you come this time?

359
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,500
I have some questions on physics.

360
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,650
Seems that you want to reach the highest peak of physics.

361
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,330
You are so abosrbed in physics.

362
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,570
Don't you pay attention to other subjects?

363
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,620
Mr. Zhang,

364
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,180
don't tamp down my enthusiasm!

365
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,500
My love to physics is a fervent fire!

366
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,820
Then you have better cool down for a while,

367
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,970
or you may burn yourself.

368
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,010
How about

369
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,130
giving me a special test paper

370
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,330
like what Mrs. Shen does?

371
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,980
I‘ll stay here

372
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,980
and I promise I won't bother you.

373
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,420
After I finished, I'll hand it over to you.

374
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,880
Well, don't be so arrogant.

375
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,500
You still have a lot to learn. You can at best be my assistant.

376
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,570
Assistant? That's great!

377
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,570
Here you are.

378
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,380
Hi, Mrs. Shen.

379
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,010
I don't know much about geography.

380
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,860
But I asked some advice

381
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,130
from those who do a good job in geography.

382
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,130
Here you are.

383
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,690
They recorded their experiences and suggestions on it.

384
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,380
I think it must be that

385
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,690
you fail to grasp the knack of geography.

386
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,090
You are always smart after all.

387
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,420
It must be useful.

388
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,570
At least I hope it'll be useful.

389
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,090
Thank you.

390
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,250
Do you have time this weekend?

391
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,210
How about studying together?

392
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,530
I bet it must be effective.

393
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,690
But I have an appointment with Chen An.

394
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,570
Both days will be spent on rehearsal.

395
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,770
Is it compulsory?

396
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,810
Could you just skip once or twice?

397
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,010
Why can't he release any free time for you?

398
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,880
It's just a weekend.

399
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,890
It's not just a weekend at all.

400
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,180
It matters very much!

401
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,770
Why?

402
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,330
Because, because the exam is approaching.

403
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,210
Well, that makes sense.

404
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,380
To start with, this part is about China.

405
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,450
The Nile

406
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,690
Niger River

407
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,380
The Congo River

408
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,210
The Zambia River

409
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,210
That's too difficult.

410
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,820
Formula and funtions are much easier to understand.

411
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,190
—

412
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,860
I really love this piece of music.

413
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,330
If I can play it at

414
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,530
the contest, that would be good.

415
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,740
But we don't have now.

416
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,570
Yeah, we have better be a bit conservative.

417
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,640
This is a contest.

418
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,810
They all want to be the champion.

419
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:05,619
Zhouzhou,

420
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,450
I apologize for what I did that day.

421
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,250
That's ok.

422
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,210
They will understand it when they grow up.

423
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,660
I have let him back.

424
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,140
Really?

425
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,260
Yeah.

426
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,170
He reminds me of your childhood.

427
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,900
Am I similar with him?

428
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,569
When you graduated from the primary school,

429
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,740
you told me that you didn't do a good job in math,

430
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,450
nor did you pick up English in advance.

431
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,490
Only by entering the Normal University Middle School

432
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,690
could your mom be happy

433
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,170
about your prosperity.

434
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,930
He told be the same words.

435
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,740
He doesn't want to fail his mom.

436
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,980
Perhaps he really want to participate in the contest.

437
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,260
Oh, here you are. My geography notebook in the second grade.

438
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,540
Hope it will help.

439
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,740
Oh, that you! I almost forget that you are really good at it!

440
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,210
Everything that troubled me

441
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,500
are leaving me.

442
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,980
I'm really happy.

443
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,450
Zhouzhou,

444
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,290
Ihave faith in you. You can do it.

445
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,050
Mr. Zhang,

446
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,900
where is Mrs. Shen?

447
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,800
Since Zhouzhou has asked for a leave,

448
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,930
Mrs. Shen didn't come.

449
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,690
Fine.

450
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,210
Any problem on physics?

451
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,860
No.

452
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,450
Hey, where is your fervent fire?

453
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,540
Sister Zhouzhou!

454
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,020
Sister Zhouzhou!

455
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,660
Sorry, I'm late.

456
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,170
You are supposed to stay for the night study.

457
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,500
One abence is acceptable.

458
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,260
Sister Zhouzhou! We miss you so much.

459
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,290
Me too.

460
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,500
I miss you, too!

461
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,450
They are going to perform this Friday afternoon.

462
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,660
Will you come?

463
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,170
Of course I will come! Definitely!

464
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,440
-

465
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,810
Pay attention to the pace.

466
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,330
At the begining……

467
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,740
Is there any problem?

468
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,260
It's stomachache. I may go to the restroom.

469
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,170
Now let's invite the string orchestra from the Children's Palace.

470
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,090
They are about to perform the string quartet,

471
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,620
the Neapolitan Dance quartet.

472
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,090
You will play a new quartet?

473
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,410
Brother Chen An said that

474
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,440
you think this one is more appropriate.

475
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,930
Don't feel embarrassed on the stage.

476
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,090
Just close your eyes.

477
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,810
Imagine all adudience are pigs!

478
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,690
That will help you overcome your awkwardness.

479
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,860
Have a try!

480
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,140
They are all pigs.

481
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,500
They are all pigs.

482
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,780
Do you feel better?

483
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,620
Here, it's your turn now!

484
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,780
Go.

485
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,050
Cheer up!

486
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,020
Cheer up! Cheer up!

487
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,410
You are the best!

488
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,500
Have you every thought about that

489
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,050
they will one day realize

490
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,140
you simply played some stupid tricks on them?

491
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,330
What will they think of it?

492
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,540
But this is how they grow up,

493
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,620
isn't it?

494
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,860
The champion of the contest

495
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,450
The string orchestra from the Children's Palace.

496
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,690
Yeah!

497
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,740
Go to the stage.

498
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:47,930
Zhouzhou,

499
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,020
Zhouzhou,

500
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,290
I believe you will eventually

501
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,780
leave this place.

502
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
Don't let the troble

503
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,410
constrain your power.

504
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,740
When you arrive at the peak,

505
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,860
you will feel that what you have experienced made who you are.

506
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,320
I'll remeber it.

507
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,050
Director Zhou, you have an appointment at 6.

508
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,860
I know.

509
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:47,980
It's not a big deal.

510
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,980
Ranran's exam will end at 5.

511
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,200
First take him home then go for the appointment.

512
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,290
Ok.

513
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,210
What's going on there?

514
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,320
A girl Yu in the second grade

515
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,970
fatinted

516
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,740
during the exam.

517
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,860
Nowadays, students are too stressful.

518
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,900
I'll take a look.

519
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,690
Director Pan!

520
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,690
Hey, Director Zhou, why are you here?

521
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,860
I heard that Yu Zhouzhou fainted.

522
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,620
Zhouzhou?

523
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,620
No, it wasn't her.

524
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,410
It is another student

525
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,500
who has the same family name Yu.

526
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,410
Don't worry.

527
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,370
Fine, fine.

528
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,540
You know Yu Zhouzhou?

529
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,260
Hey dad. Ranran!

530
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,500
See you, Director Pan.

531
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,450
See you.

532
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,660
See you. She's fine.

533
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,570
Goodbye.

534
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,090
Goodbye.

535
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,010
Goodbye.

536
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,210
Dad, why are you here?

537
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,770
It's raining, I come to pick you up.

538
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,810
Dad, mom said tonight we'll have a big feast!

539
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,330
Also, there's a sport competition tonight.

540
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,690
Let's watch together.

541
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,930
Dad, I have solved all the questions this time.

542
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,570
Zhouzhou! I still have much time to check the answers.

543
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,660
Let's go home together.

544
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,730
Zhouzhou,

545
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,570
do you have any plan after the exam?

546
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,660
How about going to the ghost house?

547
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,780
It'll be very excited!

548
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,170
Sorry,

549
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,140
I'm afraid of ghosts.

550
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,380
How about video games?

551
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,090
Lin Yang,

552
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,140
I want to go home alone.

553
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,050
Mi Qiao,

554
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,090
where is Zhouzhou.

555
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,290
I haven't seen her recently.

556
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,380
She even ddin't reply my text message.

557
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,930
She don't want to see you anymore.

558
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,810
Just kidding!

559
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,210
She has a stoachache today.

560
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,660
What happened to her?

561
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,570
Is she too stressful?

562
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,090
Why are you so garrulous.

563
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,560
Perhaps that is why Zhouzhou don't like you.

564
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,260
Don't ask too much

565
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,540
about a girl's secret.

566
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,620
How about paying her a visit?

567
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,210
I should give her warmth.

568
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,260
Birlliant!

569
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,090
Boy, you've understood the knack of wooing a girl.

570
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,380
You two are like brother and sister.

571
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,290
Shut up.

572
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,290
Well, well,

573
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,900
Sister and brother,

574
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,330
Sister and brother.

575
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,410
Don't you mention that bitch Yu Zhouzhou!

576
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Naughty kid!

577
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,260
You should learn some manners.

578
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,900
Go away!

579
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,450
Yu Zhouzhou hides herself and leaveme here.

580
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,620
Then you all bully me!

581
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,170
Next time I hear you curse Yu Zhouzhou,

582
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,450
I promise I'll

583
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,410
kill you.

584
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,380
She is bitch!

585
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,860
Her mother seduced my father!

586
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,090
That's how she came to this world!

587
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,740
She deserves no love!

588
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,410
Fuck off!

589
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,860
I'll tell my dad.

590
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,400
My dad will kick your ass!

591
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,050
Sorry.

592
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,050
That's ok.

593
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,330
Do you live near Zhouzhou?

594
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:47,930
Not far.

595
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,540
Well, I'll see her.

596
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,620
She feels uncomfortable.

597
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,450
Sounds like a stomachache.

598
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,740
How's she?

599
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,290
I don't know.

600
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,090
I'll go with you.

601
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,660
Ok.

602
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
I bought several kinds of medicine.

603
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,130
I've no idea which may help.

604
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,500
It was not stomachache.

605
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,260
It is the girl's problem.

606
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,970
I have some jujub and brown sugar,

607
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,380
here you are.

608
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,380
You can give these to her.

609
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,050
Well, thank you.

610
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,290
But I just plan to see her for a while.

611
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,090
And remind her to take care of herself by the way.

612
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,210
Zhouzhou must feel happy to have you as her friend.

613
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,210
You are a better friend than me.

614
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,290
Does she feel good now?

615
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,290
I feel beeter.

616
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,170
Will you be there?

617
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,680
I'll go with you.

618
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,890
If you feel sick,

619
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,290
I'll send you back.

620
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,620
Let me help you.

621
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,380
Are you ok?

622
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,570
How about tomorrow?

623
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:11,860
Well……

624
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,410
How about your medicine?

625
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,210
It has become trash.

626
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,170
She doesn't need it anymore.

627
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,570
Ranran,

628
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,690
come here.

629
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,780
Why did you get involved in fight at school?

630
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,020
I didn't.

631
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,210
How about the scar on your face?

632
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,050
Leave me alone.

633
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,290
What's about this?

634
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,810
I said, leave me alone!

635
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,570
It's all about Yu Zhouzhou! It's all about Yu Zhouzhou!

636
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,290
Why all of you are partial to her!

637
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,330
That's not fair!

638
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,660
Excuse me,

639
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,450
excuse me.

640
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,660
Hey, Jiang Chuan.

641
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,450
Well, what a coincidance.

642
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,210
See, Yu Zhouzhou ranks the eights in art and literature.

643
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,290
I rank the eighth in science.

644
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,380
I'm the 168th one.

645
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,090
What a coincidance.

646
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,570
Perhaps we can buy a lottery.

647
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,140
Look at them,

648
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,280
they all rank the first in their list.

649
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,290
The Final Exam Result

650
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,800
They are the real hero and heroine!

651
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,440
That's ok, you can still be the lackey of the hero and heroine.

652
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
That so-called hero is nothing at all. I don't care.

653
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,620
Oh, finally.

654
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,930
At it is acceptable.

655
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,860
At least there are two after me.

656
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,930
Are you a friend of Yu Zhouzhou?

657
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,930
Of course.

658
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,980
We are close friends.

659
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,260
The closest friends.

660
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,570
Why?

661
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,410
Is Zhou Shenran Yu Zhouzhou's brother?

662
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,410
What?

663
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,450
Sorry,

664
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,730
never mind.

665
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,330
Zhouzhou,

666
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,380
do you hide any secret from me?

667
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,570
Mi Qiao, don't annoy me.

668
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,090
I think that secret is soemthing everyone knows

669
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,450
but me.

670
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,620
I have something exciting to tell you.

671
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,920
Really exciting!

672
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,900
There is a girl in Class 1 called Yu Manman fainted at the exam.

673
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,500
Then a man rushed into the school

674
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,620
and said "I'm Yu Zhouzhou's father.

675
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,620
Who fainted?"

676
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,810
He thought it was Yu Zhouzhou.

677
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,690
Do you know?

678
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,290
There is something weird in it.

679
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,410
Because that man is also the father of Zhou Shen ran in Class 2.

680
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,570
That's really exciting.

681
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,570
That makes sense that they looks similar somehow.

682
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,090
Does it?

683
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,860
Also, Zhou Shenran is always tough to Yu Zhouzhou.

684
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,450
Really?

685
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,680
Perhaps that's the reason.

686
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,500
Chen Yao, don't you dare say anything about my friend.

687
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,980
Or I will silence you forever.

688
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,780
Mi Qiao, please give it to me know.

689
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,140
Here you are.

690
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,690
Don't care about them at all.

691
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,210
They are so fond of rumors.

692
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,410
I will shut there mouth.

693
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,170
He is the father of mine and Zhou Shenran's.

694
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,620
Do you know that Yu Zhouzhou's mother seduced her father?

695
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,690
Really?

696
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,730
So she must be a bastard.

697
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,900
It is a rumor.

698
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,620
Zhouzhou.

699
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,450
Let's begin.

700
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,450
For what?

701
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,860
It's about Zhouzhou.

702
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,540
What do you mean.

703
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,290
Zhouzhou's family secret.

704
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,540
You are a close friend of her.

705
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,900
She must told you something.

706
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,210
Family affairs?

707
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,210
I have no idea at all.

708
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Zhouzhou's mother

709
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,900
is a mistress. She seduced Zhou Shenran's father.

710
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,740
What are you talking about?

711
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,800
Mistress?

712
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,170
Of course!

713
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,690
I'm waiting for Zhouzhou herself for more information!

714
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,260
Because Zhouzhou is a bastard!

715
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,740
I've warned you.

716
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,980
Forgive me, forgive me!

717
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,210
How about now!

718
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,620
Forgive me, please!

719
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,500
Why can't you shut your mouth?

720
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,410
Chen Yao, I have to punish you.
