Do you have much homework to do today?

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,260
Just so so. We have more math homework.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,340
How about your test today?

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,660
It's ok, and you?

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,580
It's good.

I'm busy today.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,980
Then we won't see each other this summer vocation.

My father'll take my family to Europe,

00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,500
but I still want to go swimming with you.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,380
Swimming is not as interesting as travelling in Europe.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,650
I want to go there, too.

19
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,340
What gift do you want?

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,250
I can bring it to you.

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,450
I don't know.

22
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,410
You'll be admitted to the Affiliated High School, right?

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,500
Um,

24
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,770
probably.

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,130
That's great.

26
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,210
I'm not sure whether we can be classmates this time.

27
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,610
If we can, it'll be better.

These four words are taught by my grandma.

36
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,780
I always regard them as the best  wish,

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,810
which is only for you.

38

Zhouzhou,

53
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,890
in this Art Festival, I'd like to make a

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,250
Come on, buddy.

57
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,450
Ah!

58
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,610
But I can just...

59
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,730
Ah, stop asking.

60
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,060
Where are you going?

61
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,450
Did you bring that thing with you?

62
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,420
See you in the usual place after after the bell ring, get it?

63
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,450
Boys and girls,

64
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,890
as for the Art Festival mentioned yesterday,

65
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,010
have you thought about it?

66
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,340
Not yet.

67
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,060
In principle, every club

68
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,300
should give a performance.

69
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,450
We'll pick out the best club after performances.

70
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,860
It's said that there'll be a mystery prize.

Who are responsible for clubs in our class?

72
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,700

We're Internet Collection Club.

What can we do?

75
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,060
You are gossip club, aren't you?

76
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,170

Be quiet, be quiet. What are you doing?

81
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,940
You didn't hear the bell ring, did you?

82
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,730
Our class is the noisiest in the corridor.

Mr. Wu, I'm discussing the Art Festival with them.

00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,209

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,140
I want the Zhonghua cigarette.

95
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,770
That's too expensive.

96
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,140
My mom'll kill me if she knows.

97
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,090
All right, I'll make do with it.

bring some snacks to me tomorrow,

104
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,370
which can also help me to quit smoking.

asked for sponsorship fees from me overtly and covertly.

that I decided not to transfer to another school.

Well, well. I promise you.

these are papers of last quiz.

This is what I write especially for the Art Festival.

173
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,090
The program proposal of Anime Club.

174
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,930
Well down.

175
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,700
Sure. This is our Anime Club's

176
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,460
good opportunity to become famous.

177
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,490
We can't miss it.

178
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,770
These are history papers of last exam.

179
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,740
Come and take yours.

180
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,860
Qiao, your score is here.

181
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,530
Hold on. Don't give it to me.

182
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,050
God bless me.

183
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,740
The Jade Emperoe, the Queen Mother, the Tianpeng Commander,

184
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,650
Chang'e, and the Jade Rabbit, bless me to pass the exam.

185
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,210
How about that? How about that? Am I outstanding?

186
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,179
I tell you that even 62 is too high.

187
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,760
Yep.

188
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,330
Mr. Wu asks students whose grade is below 80

189
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,450
to go to his office.

[Art Festival]

193
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,200
What's the matter?

194
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,060
Half an hour has passed.

195
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,940
Where are other students?

196
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,090
Why haven't they arrived yet?

197
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,130
All said to be occupied by class affairs, thus they didn't come.

198
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,420
How about our classmates?

199
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,820
Club leader Qiao, we join the Anime Club

200
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,940
to gather together to read comics

201
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,980
and play games.

202
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,940
Performing program is too tiring.

203
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,090
It's different this time.

204
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,740
This time we'll perform a stage drama,

205
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,450
which is the essence of cosplay.

206
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,260
Do you know that?

207
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,690
How about costumes and prop?

208
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,200
We'll buy them and make them.

209
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,940
That's too troublesome and it costs money.

210
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,130
Ah, that's because you haven't try for once.

211
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,060
You'll know it after having a try.

212
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,690
Ah, I'll lose. Ah, I'll lose.

213
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,450
Stop playing the game.

214
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,090
Go and find other members.

215
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,650
Gather in five minutes!

216
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,610
Lin Yang,

217
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,300
you're not a real friend.

218
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,010
You never came back to see us after you left long time ago.

219
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,180
I'm back.

220
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,620
Chen Yao,

221
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,060
What?

222
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,860
You have an up-do on your head everyday.

223
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,130
Don't you think it's ugly?

224
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,770
What a nuisance! Are you the only handsome guy?

225
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,380
Yu Zhouzhou,

226
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,440
Director asks me to ask you again

227
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,260
whether you'd like to host the Art Festival or not?

228
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,530
Director has already asked me,

229
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,770
and I rejected.

230
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,060
Oh, I see.

231
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,330
What are you doing?

232
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,210
You don't want me to smile at you.

233
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,650
Is it ok this way?

234
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,330
Then I wanna add one more:

235
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,690
don't sit beside me,

236
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,690
neither behind me.

237
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,860
You're too bossy.

238
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,010
You can't do that, Zhouzhou.

239
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,890
Club leader Qiao was angery.

240
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,620
Members of Anime Club, come and gather together.

241
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,770
Mi Qiao is such a great motivator!

242
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,690
Why don't you go?

243
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,500
She makes a stage drama, and I'm definitely not good at it.

244
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,980
Are you sure? I remember when you were little

245
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,620
you paticipated in the story competition.

246
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,370
Lin Yang,

247
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,260
we're finding you everywhere.

248
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,560
You do find a good place.

249
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,330
Host rehersal?

250
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,380
Yes, let's go.

251
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,570
Ling Xiangqian has already been there.

252
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,930
Zhouzhou, I'm looking forward to see you on the stage.

253
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,770
Go away.

254
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,260
Let's go.

255
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,690
You get along well with her.

256
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,620
Well, there is a long way to go.

257
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,740
The passion of youth is the fire,

258
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,620
the passion of youth is the wave.

259
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,290
-Let's sing in the embrace of youth. 
 -Why not get in?

260
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,530
-Let's fly freely with the song. 
 -Did Zhan Yanfei come?

261
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,330
-Let's fly freely with the song. 
-You can have a look.

262
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,300
Let's sing in the embrace of youth.

263
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,490
Let's fly freely with the song.

264
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,330
Did I just move too much?

265
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,420
Undisciplined,

266
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,620
very undisciplined.

267
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,380
Organization without discipline equals to you.

268
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,730
Club leader Qia, everyone is busy.

269
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,010
Yeah.

270
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,530
What are you busy with? What are you busy with?

271
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,060
We still have homework to do.

272
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,260
We have training in the Basketball Club.

273
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,620
With divided minds, the team is hard to lead.

274
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,740
We used to drink liquor with big bowls and take big bites of the meat.

275
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,000
We read comics in class and skipped class to hang out.

276
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,380
You were active before, right?

277
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,620
Now we'll perform a program.

278
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,690
Each and every one of you...

279
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,130
We didn't eat the meat together before.

280
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,010
You!

281
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,450
Exactly.

282
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,570
Well, well.

283
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,180
Liu Ming, is the Naruto I lent you good or not?

284
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,180
Um, it's good.

285
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,010
Did you cry for Uzumaki Naruto's arduous efforts?

286
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,530
Yes.

287
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,260
Huang Qian, was it you who told me

288
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,000
that you were moved by the friendship between Monkey D Luffy and his friends

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,060
again and again?

290
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,940
Zhao Liang, it was after watching the Slamdunk

291
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,820
that you developed the habit of playing basketball, right?

292
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,130
Now there is a chance in front of you.

293
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,940
You can play the roles you like,

294
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,500
experience touching stories,

295
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,530
and carry down the spirit of comics.

296
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,740
Are you excited?

297
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,860
Yes.

298
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,890
Are you happy?

299
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,940
Yes.

300
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,000
Do you want to perform the program?

301
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,180
Perform what?

302
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,260
I've already figured it out.

303
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,500
Here are flying thoughts and expressive feelings.

304
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,010
Here are the melody of youth and the beauty of poems.

305
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,010
Today, let's share art with each other

306
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,890
and show our talents.

307
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,620
Today,

308
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,450
today,

309
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,860
today...

310
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,650
How about have a rest?

311
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,620
We've practiced for a long time.

312
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,010
Ok. Let's have a rest.

313
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,650
Rest again? We practiced for a long time but finished just several sentences.

314
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,010
Ling Xiangqian, you're a bit hot-tempered today.

315
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,090
I still have much homework to do.

316
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,060
Being inefficient like this, we'll do nothing.

317
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,690
What's the matter with you? Why don't you go home till now?

318
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,690
Zhouzhou, save me.

319
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,620
Just go directly.

320
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,690
Why did you put water on your face?

321
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,860
Nope, the Anime Club will be finished.

322
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,450
Those ungreatful students said the stage drama written by me

323
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,620
was hard to understand.

324
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
If you, the honorable member, don't come to help,

325
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,530
we will truely be finished.

326
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,640
Haven't I told you before?

327
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,290
I'm indeed not good at it.

328
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,260
Ah, I heard Lin Yang said that

329
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,060
when you were little, you participated in that

330
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,380
story competition.

331
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,620
You did a good job!

332
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,820
You do gain a lot from spying.

333
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,330
Zhouzhou,

334
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,770
Well, well, I'll help you.

335
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,860
I'll help you , ok?

336
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,690
Will you help me?

337
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,300
Yes.

338
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,650
Get it? Don't forget it tomorrow.

339
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,120
How about asking Xin Rui to join us?

340
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,940
That's good. I remember when I told her last time

341
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,450
she seemed to be interested.

342
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,690
Hey, Xin Rui,

343
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,500
what did he tell you just now?

344
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,570
Nothing.

345
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,450
Our school is going to hold an Art Festival,

346
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,060
thus our Anime Club want to make a stage drama. Will you join us?

347
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,130
Me?

348
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:38,820
Yes.

349
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,690
Ah, this is the proposal written by me.

350
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,760
You guys can have a look.

351
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,060
Give me some precious advice.

352
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,130
Xin Rui,

353
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,370
feel free to give any advice to me.

354
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,450
Yu Zhouzhou?

355
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,530
I think

356
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,130
our story

357
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,090
like this

358
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,530
we can add some typical cartoon characters into it.

359
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,250
I hear that you are selected to participate in the story competition.

360
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:01,980
Hmm.

361
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,500
Have you figured the story out?

362
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,260
Not yet. The teacher asks my parents to write the story,

363
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,380
but my mom is definitely busy.

364
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,690
Then ask your father for help.

365
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,060
Even my grandma is busy

366
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,500
with her tasks in the university for the elderly.

367
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,010
She is definitely busy, too.

368
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,170
Oh, ask my mom for help.

369
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,330
She works for the provincial government.

370
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,420
Many of her subordniates are university students who write well.

371
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,770
Take it easy.

372
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,130
I'll go home and beg my mom.

373
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,210
Does it really work?

374
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,740
Sure, take it easy.

375
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,740
Thank you, Lin Yang.

376
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,130
Did I smile at you just now?

377
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,210
Yes, you did,

378
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,090
but being like a silly guy with glazed eyes.

379
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
I gotta go.

380
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,330
Why do you look at me?

381
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,940
I want to see why you're so good

382
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,619
to fascinate the boy like that.

383
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,020
Talk or not?

384
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,140
You go on, go on.

385
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,859
How is it going?

386
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,859
Our school holds an Art Festival recently

387
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,930
and our Anime Club plans to make a stage drama.

388
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,170
That's great.

389
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,810
I remember when you were little

390
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,780
you loved telling stories.

391
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,410
You remember that!

392
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,290
Sure.

393
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,329
It was probably the second time we met each other,

394
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,380
and in my memory I took photos for you.

395
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,980
[A photo of the story competition award ceremony]

396
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,170
Okay. Class is over.

397
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,850
Members of Cartoon Club, meet you in the playroom.

398
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,090
It's not that we're reluctant.

399
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,330
It is that your story is really beyond our capacity.

400
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,690
Let's go and see.

401
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,380
She has brought a lot of new props today.

402
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,090
Zhouzhou, Xin Rui and I have come up with a new story.

403
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,810
I'm sure it is interesting.

404
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,050
Director Pan, you want to talk to me?

405
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,260
Lin Yang, close the door.

406
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,370
Come here. Come here.

407
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,130
Have a seat. Have a seat.

408
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,410
No. I'd better stand here.

409
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,450
I feel guilty since you smirk like that.

410
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,610
It can't be a good deed.

411
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,810
What are you talking about?

412
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,690
Sit down. Sit down.

413
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,890
It is really a good deed.

414
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,650
I'm going to appoint you

415
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,210
as one of chief planners of the Art Festival.

416
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,620
One of chief planners? Then, what about the others?

417
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,570
Only you and me.

418
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,930
We need to supervise

419
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,330
the content and form of the programs.

420
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,780
Then, you can decide by yourself.

421
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,980
The Art Festival is held for your students.

422
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,660
The option should be left to students.

423
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,450
You make the decision and I'll ladle out suggestions.

424
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,660
Alright.

425
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,020
I think singing shows

426
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,400
should be arranged.

427
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,170
Singing shows?

428
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,860
Yes, especially solo.

429
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,690
What are you doing? I'm talking to you.

430
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,620
Oh, yes. Yes.

431
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,860
I agree with you.

432
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,050
For the Art Festival, forms of the programs

433
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,780
should be various.

434
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,690
We must diversify the forms and take the best.

435
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,930
We should make those who are really gifted

436
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,290
be seen.

437
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,660
Okay, I'll go prepare it.

438
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,090
I got it.

439
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
Wait a moment.

440
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,890
If ... no one registers for solo,

441
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,980
don't worry.

442
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,020
Leave it to me.

443
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,290
Okay. Okay.

444
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:03,930
Director Pan.

445
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,620
Why do you come back?

446
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,660
I'm thinking that I was just disciplined.

447
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,570
Since then,

448
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,450
it's hard for me to convince others

449
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,900
as the chief planner of the Art Festival, right?

450
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,330
What do you mean?

451
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,780
Could you please remove the punishment from me?

452
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,380
Don't you know what "redeeming yourself" mean?

453
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,740
How can I remove it if you refuse to dedicate yourself?

454
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,170
Oh, I got it.

455
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,660
Then, Director Pan, we shake on it.

456
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,090
I'll definitely dedicate myself

457
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,410
and get the Art Festival done.

458
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,410
Thanks, Director Pan.

459
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,690
What are these? They are just no use.

460
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,290
They're better than nought.

461
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,210
Let's soar up with the song.

462
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,500
We have strived, so we feel no regret.

463
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:52,900
We have fought, so we obtain paradise.

464
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,900
She ... she must live in the last century.

465
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,980
Apart from the fights,

466
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,500
we have added some plots about romance

467
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,260
to the new story.

468
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,740
A love story again!

469
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,280
Zhouzhou,

470
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,620
you created the main part of the story.

471
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,900
Then, you tell us about it.

472
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,660
Okay. But I just came up with the general idea.

473
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,290
More details need to be filled by you.

474
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,450
Seiya and Sailor Moon

475
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,330
fell into two camps.

476
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,330
After a series of fights,

477
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,780
they fell in love with each other.

478
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,810
But the two of them

479
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,860
couldn't betray their own camps.

480
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,970
So Sailor Moon made a feint of committing suicide

481
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,500
and left her clan.

482
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,900
However, Seiya thought she had really died

483
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,450
and committed suicide.

484
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,260
In the end, Sailor Moon died for love.

485
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,290
The two of them were buried together and turned into butterflies.

486
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,930
Why does it sound so familiar?

487
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,690
Yes.

488
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,800
Isn't it Romeo and Juliet?

489
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,560
I guess it's The Butterfly Lovers.

490
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,570
Shakespeare?

491
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,930
Shakespeare.

492
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,450
These are props I made before.

493
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,210
Have a look. Handle them with care.

494
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,930
I've made a prop similar to this one when I was a kid.

495
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,380
I want to be Shiryu.

496
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,740
God. You want to be Shiryu?

497
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,930
If you were Shiryu, no wonder he was blinded.

498
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,330
Shiryu? Then, I am Sailor Moon.

499
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,210
In the name of Moon, I'll perish you.

500
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,380
Club Leader Qiao.

501
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,860
What?

502
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,540
Sailor Moon needs to strip when she shapeshifts.

503
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,540
Take care of the props. Be careful.

504
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,620
Slow down. Slow down.

505
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,260
It shouldn't be put on the head. It's a kneecap.

506
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,620
Why does the atmosphere of Cartoon Club change

507
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,980
when you are here?

508
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,810
What do you think?

509
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,860
All the classes have put in their program schedules.

510
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,900
The day after tomorrow, the rehearsal will begin.

511
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,740
It seems that Director Pan really attaches great importance to it.

512
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,570
Does Yu Zhouzhou register for it?

513
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,620
I guess no. She seems to lack interest in these activities.

514
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,050
Why isn't Zhan Yanfei here yet?

515
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,570
Right. She performed the worst.

516
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,140
But she's late again when the rehearsal is around the corner.

517
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,170
She had learned it in Children's Palace ever since she was a kid.

518
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,500
It's hard for her to correct herself in a short while.

519
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,860
But she has to correct herself.

520
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,980
When she goes up on the stage,

521
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,410
what if audience burst into laughter?

522
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,780
Hello, Zhan Yanfei.

523
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,450
Are you scaring me?

524
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,260
I'm kidding you.

525
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,170
Alright, I go to the toilet

526
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,330
and leave the room to you two.

527
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,290
Dare you say it again?

528
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,800
We have just mentioned you.

529
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,050
I don't mean that.

530
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,140
Are you okay?

531
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,490
Ling Xiangqian didn't mean that.

532
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,260
I know. It's my fault.

533
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,410
What about this? Let's work in pairs.

534
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,170
And we two can team up. I don't have any style

535
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,660
and there must be no problem if you team up with me.

536
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,380
Lin Yang,

537
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,570
have you missed your childhood?

538
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,210
I really felt happy at that time.

539
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,140
Back then,

540
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,660
I have hosted a provincial competition.

541
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,290
School authority attaches great importance to the Art Festival

542
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,690
and rented such a big field.

543
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,500
I hope you can cheer up and work hard.

544
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,810
Don't let us down. Okay?

545
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,090
Good job.

546
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,330
Well done.

547
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,210
You go arrange it. Pay attention to protecting the hall.

548
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,860
Benben, why are you here?

549
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,260
We're training here in these days.

550
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,330
I just wondered why it is hopping here

551
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,680
and came to have a look.

552
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,780
I didn't expect to see you.

553
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,860
Why does Zhen Hua need to rent the hall?

554
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,260
It is said that some big men will present.

555
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,500
And we need to keep up appearance.

556
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,570
Will you perform?

557
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,410
Yes.

558
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,540
Right, will you come?

559
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,410
Hello, Mr. President. It is in rehearsal.

560
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,980
And I'm checking the programs.

561
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,810
Don't worry. I'll definitely run it well.

562
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,090
Yes.

563
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,450
What? The chorus competition of last year?

564
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,930
As for threats like Lu Xinghe,

565
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,660
I'll nip them in the bud.

566
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,780
Yes, Mr. President. Leave it to me.

567
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,980
Okay. Bye.

568
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,920
Hello, Director Pan.

569
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,260
Mr. Zhang.

570
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,540
What program does Class 3 prepare?

571
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,690
Class 3?

572
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,620
A language program.

573
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,450
Dramas like that of last year are strictly forbidden.

574
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,020
That was really rough-and-tumble.

575
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,540
Next Program is a costume play, the love story of  Seiya and Sailor.

576
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,740
Please enjoy.

577
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,900
Long long ago,

578
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,450
in a mysterious continent,

579
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,380
there were two old clans.

580
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,330
They were the family of Saint Seiya

581
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,740
and that of Sailor Moon.

582
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,290
They had been gone against each other for many years.

583
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,540
And they were incompatible as fire and water.

584
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,290
Fire.

585
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,930
Fire.

586
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,020
In the name of Moon, I'll perish you.

587
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,810
Each fight resulted in injuries and deaths to both parties.

588
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,540
The passing of every person

589
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,450
deepened their hatred to each other.

590
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,280
What are they acting?

591
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,620
However,

592
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,450
this time....

593
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,260
Alright.

594
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,500
Stop. Stop.

595
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:37,930
Stop acting.

596
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,570
What are you acting?

597
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,540
Director Pan, it's just the beginning.

598
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,980
Just the beginning? If I didn't stop you,

599
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,740
what are you going to play?

600
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,810
No. Then ... then we continue. We continue, Director Pan.

601
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,020
Enough. Just come down.

602
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,050
Your program is canceled.

603
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,090
No stage drama is allowed this year.

604
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,660
No, Director Pan.

605
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,160
Why?

606
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,660
What should we do?

607
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,450
I have no idea.

608
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,890
You've done a good job.

609
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,450
But I think

610
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,380
the cooperation among you is not good enough.

611
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,090
Little swallow,

612
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,330
well done. You deserve a praise.

613
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,020
No wonder you are a child star.

614
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,810
You have an easy stage manner.

615
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,410
No. I still have a lot to imprve.

616
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,930
Zhouzhou.

617
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,380
Why was your program canceled that easily?

618
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,690
He goes too far in bullying us.

619
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,540
You should work harder....

620
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,780
Director Pan, why did you cancel our program?

621
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,010
What are you doing? What do you want to do?

622
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,930
Can that be called a program?

623
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,900
No, you haven't sat it through.

624
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,050
We still have a lot,

625
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,450
a lot....

626
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,400
I don't need to sit it through.

627
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,490
It can't be called a program since you are dressed like this.

628
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,330
What's wrong?

629
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,410
Acting. Keep acting.

630
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,410
If you continue to act,

631
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,450
I'll directly disqualify Class 3 from performing in the Art Festival.

632
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,260
This time, superior leaders will come to make an inspection.

633
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,980
You can't go too far while performing.

634
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,090
You have numerous chances to act in the future.

635
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,780
All in all,

636
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,900
no drama is allowed this year.

637
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,380
It doesn't matter. Never mind.

638
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,290
You know nothing.

639
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,690
It's kind of me to....

640
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,450
I still want to win a prize.

641
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,900
Now, not only do we lose the chance,

642
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,260
but the Cartoon Club might have to be dismissed.

643
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,260
I got an idea.

644
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,500
Director Pan, right?

645
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,260
I go ask my buddies to block him after class.

646
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,410
And then?

647
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,930
Force him to reflex himself.

648
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,170
And ask him if he had done something against students' will.

649
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,330
What's wrong?

650
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,210
He doesn't know me.

651
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,810
He certainly will not know I am one of you.

652
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,980
Then, not only the Cartoon Club will be dismissed,

653
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,210
but the Class 3 will be punished.

654
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,740
You'd better take your brain out and roast it.

655
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,620
Roasted brain for today.

656
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,280
It is useless, anyway.

657
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,450
Then, what should we do? Can we play?

658
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,620
Now, it is Director Pan that rejected us.

659
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,780
Unless he agrees,

660
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,260
none of us can deal with it.

661
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,810
May I come in?

662
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,650
How is it?

663
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,690
No one registers for solo, right?

664
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,020
I have a really really....

665
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,780
There is.

666
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,740
There is? Which class registered for it?

667
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,660
Class 3.

668
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,540
They was originally going to perform a stage play,

669
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,450
but you didn't pass it.

670
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,330
That play was a complete farce.

671
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,850
That's right. So this time

672
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,450
they are going to sing a song together.

673
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,860
What song?

674
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,450
I can't quite remember the title,

675
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,570
but that tune seems to be

676
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,170
♫You are my eyes, bring me to ...♫

677
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,050
Just like this.

678
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,810
No way. Change it. Let them change it.

679
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,250
You said all ways.

680
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,380
You didn't pass their stage play,

681
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,140
and even not allow them to change to sing together.

682
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,290
At that time I thought

683
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,410
I think

684
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,330
they rehearse the stage play very attentively,

685
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,410
it is the content is a little impulsive.

686
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,740
What do you think in this way

687
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,210
that I asked them to readjust it again

688
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,570
and rehearse

689
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,740
with a more cultural and positive play.

690
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,170
Adjust it right away.

691
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,160
Okay. I'll tell them

692
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,540
and give you the best plan as soon as possible.

693
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,330
Go. Go.

694
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,860
Why you look like as if nothing happened?

695
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,210
Our play wasn't get pass.

696
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,890
The Cartoon Club made a big fool of itself.

697
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,260
And you are still laughing, Yu Zhouzhou.

698
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,850
I remembered that once I had also participated in a competition,

699
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,540
the provincial kind,

700
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,140
and also made a big fool of myself.

701
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,800
What? You had made a fool of yourself?

702
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,330
Yeah.

703
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,260
Is it real or not?

704
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,050
It's real.

705
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,020
You say it

706
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,570
so we can all be happy.

707
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,290
Okay, kid, please draw a question.

708
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,960
[Provincial Children's Story Competition]

709
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,780
The kid number forty-one was given the title of

710
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,050
mouse, cat, yellow balloon and superstar.

711
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,170
The mouse... mouse... The mouse

712
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:42,170
is cruelly tortured... tortured by the cat.

713
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,260
The cat... But the mouse doesn't say anything.

714
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,500
The cat says that hand over the yellow balloon

715
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
and you'll become a superstar.

716
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,690
I didn't know you could make things up like that when you were a kid.

717
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,900
That's right. I tell you

718
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,500
that I was growing up while listening to the stories that she made up.

719
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,620
I was so embarrassed

720
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,800
and hid in bed crying for a long time.

721
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,810
No matter how my mom persuade me.

722
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,290
And I swore I would never go on stage again.

723
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,050
In fact, there are so many things embarrassing when you were a kid

724
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,050
but seem funny now.

725
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,330
I don't remember many things when I was a kid,

726
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,260
but I always remember this one very clearly.

727
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,730
Zhouzhou,

728
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,290
I don't want to give up.

729
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,250
Let's try it again, shall we?

730
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,660
Yeah, let's try it again.

731
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,540
All right. Let's cheer up.

732
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,860
Reach out your hands.

733
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,930
I say Struggling And Striving and you say With Directer Pan.

734
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:43,900
Okay.

735
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,690
Struggling And Striving!

736
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,140
With Directer Pan!

737
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,320
Cheer up! Cheer up! Cheer up!

738
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,170
Considering what you said just now,

739
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,410
you are the best external assistant of our Cartoon Club.

740
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,980
Class begins! Hurry up! It's Chinese class!

741
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,530
Wait for me!

742
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,660
You could be relieved.

743
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,050
Okay.

744
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,570
Zhouzhou,

745
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,540
I'll wait for your battle plan.

746
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,100
Okay.

747
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,409
Yu, is your friend normal?

748
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:19,409
It's okay. He's just like that, an ardent youth.

749
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,370
Are you crazy? What are you sneaking about?

750
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,060
I'm going to ask what are you doing.

751
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,060
The school is my place.

752
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,780
I have nothing to say.

753
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,340
The Zhouzhou's met difficulties,

754
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,260
I came to help them.

755
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,130
It seems like you can deal with it.

756
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,340
Do something if you can.

757
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,580
I have an agreement with Zhouzhou

758
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,780
that I cannot contact her at present.

759
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,650
That's right.

760
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:46,570
In addition to causing her problems,

761
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,820
what shit can you solve?

762
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,060
What?

763
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,020
Go out and talk.

764
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,100
I've dealt with Directer Pan

765
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,500
and written the revised plan of the play clearly.

766
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,450
You give it to her for me.

767
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,020
Aerial historical cartoon?

768
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,170
You wouldn't understand even if I tell you.

769
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:23,650
Well,

770
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,370
it is you who came up with the idea

771
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,410
and dealt with Directer Pan.

772
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,820
But it is me who lifted everyone's morale.

773
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,690
So as for the contribution at most I can recognize that four tenth and six tenth.

774
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,650
Four for you and six for me?

775
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,610
What did you do then you got six?

776
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,580
Eight for me and two for you.

777
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,580
Are the Mi Qiao's depressed?

778
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,690
Often.

779
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,060
But with my encouragement

780
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,060
and

781
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,100
listening Zhouzhou's story about her childhood,

782
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,300
everyone cheered up again.

783
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,580
Story about her childhood?

784
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,160
Yeah. Don't you know?

785
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,410
I don't know what's wrong with me.

786
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,690
I always offend people unaccountably.

787
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,500
Like this time,

788
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,300
do you think it is fine hosting like Zhan Yanfei?

789
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,370
She's kind of old school.

790
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,450
Right!

791
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,260
Wasn't it good for everyone that I said it.

792
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,370
There was also Directer Pan who praised her unexpectedly.

793
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,170
She must be very pleased with herself.

794
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,060
I have no idea about how could she laugh at me.

795
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,100
Ling Xiangqian,

796
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,170
You are indeed a little princess.

797
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,410
How could you also laugh at me?

798
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,780
I didn't laugh at you.

799
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,840
You are the little princess in my heart.

800
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,850
Smart, beautiful and excellent.

801
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,610
Why did you say this suddenly?

802
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,980
There are too many ordinary people in this world.

803
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,820
They have their own difficulties and pains.

804
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,100
These things cannot be felt

805
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,260
from a different standpoint.

806
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,780
Even if you ask them,

807
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,740
they may not answer you.

808
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,370
So sometimes

809
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,690
we need to think about it

810
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,260
in a different way.

811
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,850
Maybe they don't understand your difficulties either.

812
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,210
This is the story of Yu Zhouzhou.

813
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,020
That's what she told you?

814
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,650
Yeah.

815
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,370
It is said that

816
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,060
she cried all night on her bed.

817
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,690
That's not the story.

818
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,850
What does it mean?

819
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,980
As expected is Zhouzhou's style,

820
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,650
lies open mouth to come.

821
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,340
Lies?

822
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,780
How do you know she's making lies up?

823
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,410
Because I was there at that time.

824
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,060
The kid number forty-one was given the title of

825
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,820
mouse, cat,

826
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,170
yellow balloon and superstar.

827
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,740
Once upon a time

828
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,690
there was a little country mouse named Benben.

829
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,170
He always thought

830
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,400
he was born to be a superstar.

831
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,370
But Benben's family never believed him.

832
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,130
Only his best friend kept him encouraged.

833
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,300
His friend said that only in the city

834
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,970
could he realize his dream.

835
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,650
So Benben left home and went far away.

836
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,210
But he had tied to his tail

837
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,980
a big yellow balloon.

838
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,740
He told his friend that

839
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,610
when he could stand on the stage and sing

840
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,400
he would let the yellow balloon fly.

841
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,920
His friend would see it no matter how far away he is.

842
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,170
Benben went into city and ran to the theater.

843
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,690
The boss of the theater asked him what songs he could sing.

844
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,450
Benben stood up straight and sang carefully,

845
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,100
Oh, mouse.

846
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,060
The boss said on one likes mice.

847
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,450
you should sing, "Oh, cat.".

848
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,100
Benben said, "No, I would never sing about cats.

849
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,850
I hate cats the most.".

850
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,450
They quarreled

851
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,410
and the boss kicked Benben off the theater with one kick.

852
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,770
Benben rolled for a long time.

853
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,820
At last he hit the wall

854
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,600
and the yellow balloon on his tail burst with a pop.

855
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,100
Wow!

856
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,540
Benben cried for a long time.

857
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,340
He wasn't crying

858
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,580
because the boss didn't like his song.

859
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,850
He thought his friend

860
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,060
might never see the yellow balloon anymore.

861
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,170
Kid, time is up.

862
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,060
But I haven't finished yet.

863

[Children's Story Competiton]

864
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,610
On the day of the performance,

865
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,370
the boss asked Benben if he was ready.

866
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,740
Benben said, "I have one more request.".

867
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,820
The boss said, "What request?".

868
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,170
Benben said, "Please buy me a big yellow balloon

869
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,130
and let it fly when I sing.

870
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,780
No matter how far my friend would see it.

871
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:57,130
He'll know I've achieved my dream.".

872
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,820
Thank you.

873
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,370
Good story.

874
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,020
You say if I know more than you.

875
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,130
See it. She was in first grade.

876
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,060
First grade.

877
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,370
She has such a clever brain.

878
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,820
I know too much about Zhouzhou's ability to make up stories,

879
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,920
after all I have been childhood sweethearts with her.

880
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,610
You and her? The childhood sweethearts?

881
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,370
So what?

882
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,370
Then who am I?

883
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,690
Who knows.

884
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,540
You are flattering me, Da Xia Murong. 
[Da Xia: a Chinese term for a hero]

885
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,130
You could compare with me anything,

886
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,060
but you choose to compare with me who knew zhouzhou earlier.

887
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,450
Do you know what my nickname is?

888
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,100
Who knows what your nickname is.

889
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,300
Benben.

890
