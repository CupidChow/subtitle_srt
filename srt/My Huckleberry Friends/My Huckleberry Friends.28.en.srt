[Ten-year hard work composes the chapter of life, ten-day sprinting shows students' heroic bearing]

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,160
In the every Gaokao of the past years,

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,830
there were students whose grades were usually average,

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,670
but at important points

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,110
they created surprise which is unbelievable

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,750
to their parents, the school and themselves.

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,240
I'm almost melted.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,950
So you must stick it out

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,470
and keep trying

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,150
especially in the home stretch of Gaokao.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,150
What are you doing here?

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,440
To block the sun for you.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,670
Well,

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,350
how about I pretend to faint

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,630
and you carry me out?

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,470
The late emperor was taken from us before finishing his life's work.

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,280
Today the empire is still divided in three

21
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,830
and our very survival is threatened.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,800
Yet..yet still the officials at court are royal to..to you

23
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,120
and the soldiers throughout the realm..

24
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,270
You can't memorize it.

25
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,270
Copy it ten times later.

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,440
How could you be so sudden?

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,760
Didn't you say that you will check regularly?

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,950
I'd love to.

29
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,950
40 sheets need to be recited in Gaokao which only accounts for 8 points.

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,870
Why should we recite those for questions that

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,789
are time-consuming but accounts for less points.

32
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,840
You can get the points as long as you can recite.

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,520
Why don't you recite?

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,200
Here, I want to especially praise

35
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,120
Xin Rui in class 3 of grade 3.

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,990
Since she has transferred to Zhenhua high school in grade 2,

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,590
her grades improved by leaps and bounds.

38
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,670
She is the only direct admission student

39
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,120
in the liberal arts classes.

40
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,840
Test me tomorrow. I promise to recite it.

41
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,340
You has guaranteed it from grade one to the Gaokao.

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,400
I won't believe that.

43
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,039
So you knew my Chinese was not good since the first year of high school.

44
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,200
Then, let's welcome Chu Tiankuo

45
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,230
who is also direct admission student and

46
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,480
will soon step down as president of Students' Union.

47
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,710
I'm Chu Tiankuo from class one, grade three.

48
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,670
It's my honor to be here

49
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,710
to thanks for all the teachers and students

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,710
who ever helped me.

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,000
I stood here a year ago

52
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,280
to compete for president of the Students' Union.

53
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,120
I made my promise that time.

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,140
A year ago I was a confused adolescent

55
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,000
the same as you.

56
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,200
I was confused and at a loss.

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120
The Students' Union of Zhenhua high school gave me..

58
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,950
Good. Good.

59
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,840
Great. Great. Great.

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,360
Thank you all.

61
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,280
Actually he didn't do anything wrong.

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,870
Yep.

63
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,270
People have their own aspirations and it's needless to force.

64

Zhouzhou,

65
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,790
did you regret quitting the exam?

66
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,360
Never.

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,270
Although we did something in the bygone days

68
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,000
and it seems forever..

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,700
I didn't either.

70
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,040
Because contentment means ceasing to go ahead.

71
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,870
Although what we have done is fiddling,

72
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,870
they're results of students' passionate support

73
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,590
and selfless devotion of

74
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,920

I'm fine.

Are you ok?

80
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,839
I watch you from afar that you walk more and more crookedly,

and hit it directly.

82
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,510
Did your cerebellum shrink?

83
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,960
Could I hit doorframe

84
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,830
if I didn't correct your terrible writing?

85

I think I do well this time.

86

I've cited many quotes of celebrities.

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,550
The ancients once said that one stroke can't draw a dragon,

88

and digging a well can't be made in one step.

Mr. Zhang Feng. How come he is not a celebrity

Okay, okay.

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,200
Won't you come to school anymore later?

94
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,390
I won't come if there's nothing.

how is Ling Xiangqian recently?

She is so great. She can't be better.

which is able to be admitted by the Beijing Normal University.

in great condition.

106

After last exam for direct admission,

107
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,550
she didn't reply my message anymore.

108
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,760
Chu Tiankuo, you have nothing to do with what happened last time.

109
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,830
Quitting the exam is Ling Xiangqian's own choice.

110
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,920
You are not obliged to do those things for her.

111
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,480
We have no position to ask you

112

to quit the exam together.

113
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,030
I still would like to say sorry.

114
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:36,800
All right.

115
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,200
I accept your apology on behalf of Ling Xiangqian.

116
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,960
But we really didn't blame you.

Ok.

I think this sentence I wrote is great.

123
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,310
Being the judge of myself

124
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,640
doesn't mean choosing rivals and wars.

125

But Lin Yang

126
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,360
can you change the grammar

127
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,590
before using lyrics?

128
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,830
What you wrote is a wrong sentence.

In your opinions, what are differences between me and Lin Yang?

133
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,800
To put it in a nasty way, the difference is

134

if life is a rive, he is downstream

but I'm upstream.

what I want to say today.

138

I really know I'm hypocrisy.

Actually, it's tried to be alive.

142
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,760
I'm afraid of taking the wrong step

143
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,520
and not willing to offend anyone.

144

I also know neither of you like me.

I know Lin Yang has said something to you impulsively

because of what happened on Ling Xiangqian.

148

Actually you're different from Lin Yang.

151

You have your own capital perspectively

152

and you have your own choice.

153

336
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,630
I've drunk it all.

337
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,350
Check it out.

338
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,200
Ok, drink it again tomorrow.

339
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,350
By the way, Lao Yu,

340
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,840
I also get a prescription for you

341
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,910
especially for stomach disease.

342
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,150
The medicine is simmered on the stove.

343
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,220
I'll serve you a drink later.

344
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,720
Uncle, hold on!

345
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,840
I'll have the exam in ten days.

346
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,270
Damn it!

347
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,340
Lin Yang, why do you have so many nosebleed?

348
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,270
You're terminally ill because of study?

349
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,920
Pah!

350
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,510
How come you get so many nosebleed?

351
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,350
Eating nourishing food as what my mother has done,

352
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,440
I'm about to explode in place,

353
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,870
without bleeding.

354
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Lin Yang, what's wrong with you?

355
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,430
Zhouzhou,

356
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,350
I'm dying.

357
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,470
Ouch, I feel dizzy.

358
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,840
Give me a shoulder to lean on.

359
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,150
Then I'm gonna go.

360
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,350
Zhouzhou,

361
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,600
don't call me if he dies later.

362
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,430
You're in good spirits, aren't you?

363
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,110
What are you doing?

364
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,230
Zhouzhou.

365
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,200
Here's a present for you.

366
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,800
[Blessed by the Temple of Confucius; Victory in the College Entrance Examination]

367
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,270
Yu Zhouzhou,

368
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,800
since when did you become so superstitious?

369
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,960
Do you remember the 'Mr. Democracy' and "Mr. Science' in history books?

370
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,840
Have you recited them?

371
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,350
Give me back if you don't want it.

372
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,230
I want it.

373
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,630
Remember to bring it to the exam.

374
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,040
I keep it in my pocket when I sleep.

375
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,680
Then I'll give you a big gift, too.

376
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,800
What is it?

377
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,440
The late emperor was taken from us before he could finish his life's work.

378
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,680
Now the country is divided into three, and Yizhou has exhausted it resources.

379
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,590
It is indeed a critical moment when our survival is threatened.

380
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,870
However, the royal guards keep vigilant at court

381
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,040
while the loyal soldiers fight selflessly on the battlefield,

382
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,080
because they remember the late emperor,

383
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,620
and they wish to repay his kindness in service to you.

384
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,630
Please extend your divine influence, to honour the memory of the late emperor

385
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,040
and strengthen the morale of your officers. It is not the time to belittle yourself

386
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,510
and  listen to bad advice, or close your ears to the suggestions of loyal men.

387
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,560
How big the gift is.

388
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,720
I really worked on it all night.

389
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,030
I suppose that half of my nosebleed

390
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,340
was for Zhuge Liang.

391
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,800
Then I should thank you for Zhuge Liang.

392
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,990
What do you think we should be doing at this time next year?

393
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,960
Next year.

394
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,720
Maybe the same as now.

395
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,720
We have classes together during the day.

396
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,920
We go to the cafeteria for dinner in the evening.

397
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,590
On the weekend,

398
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,870
Jiang Chuan and Ling Xiangqian come to us, and we watch movies and play games.

399
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,800
Then we go home together for the holidays.

400
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,440
And we travel around,

401
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,110
to many, many places we have never been.

402
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,720
I am just discussing next year with you.

403
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,040
Next year, next next year, next next next year,

404
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,350
next next next year, and the year after that. They are all the same.

405
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,960
I'll go wherever you go.

406
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,870
What if one day I want to go to the moon?

407
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,100
Then I'll go with you.

408
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,440
Anyway, my height and my eyesight are

409
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,920
up to pilot standard.

410
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
I admit I have a weak eye for color.

411
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,720
But there are no traffic lights on the moon.

412
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,800
Why are you always following me around?

413
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,800
I don't know.

414
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
I guess I'm used to it.

415
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,040
If I don't want to follow you, I would have stopped when I was six.

416
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,800
On the first day of primary school,

417
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,200
I spilt ink all over you.

418
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,470
And you've followed me since then.

419
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,750
Are you trying to get even?

420
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,110
Yes.

421
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,750
Lin Yang, you are such an unforgiving man.

422
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,200
There's more.

423
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,440
You are so narrow-minded.

424
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,150
I am not listening. I'm not. I'm not.

425
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,470
Lin Yang, how childish you are.

426
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,870
I listen to everyone else.

427
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,870
-I just don't listen to you. 
-Lin Yang.

428
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,350
There's something else I want to say to you.

429
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,920
Thank you. It's good to have you.

430
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,990
Zhouzhou.

431
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,560
Go downstairs after you have finished the soybean milk.

432
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,720
Your uncle is waiting for you downstairs.

433
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,270
Okay.

434
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,200
Have you packed everything?

435
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,150
Yes.

436
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,110
2B pencils and the exam admission ticket?

437
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,960
I packed them all.

438
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,910
No, I'll check again.

439
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,920
Aunt, I packed them all.

440
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,150
All right, I'll check them again.

441
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,900
[Victory is assured.]

442
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,440
Zhang Ping, why do you look even more nervous than the students?

443
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,840
I am nervous.

444
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,380
Zhang Ping, are you nervous?

445
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,350
I was more nervous than you when I first escorted my students to the exam.

446
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,040
Director Pan, I am not nervous.

447
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:39,960
My,

448
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,070
and you said you were not nervous.

449
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,800
How old are you? How can you be choked on water?

450
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,790
Where is Mr. Wu?

451
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,720
Right, where is Mr. Wu?

452
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,390
Sir, can you please speed up?

453
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,600
My exam is about to start.

454
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,350
I can't help it.

455
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,990
Hi, mom, I am, I am stuck in a traffic jam.

456
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,270
I will not be able to take part in the exam. What should I do?

457
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,350
Sir, can you speed up?

458
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,350

-Come on, come on. 
-Mr. Wu.

-I thought I couldn't go to the exam. 
-Come on. Come on. Thanks. Thanks.

Don't cry. Don't cry. Hurry up.

Don't worry. We can make it. We can.

464

Sit well.

465
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,920
Hold me tight.

466

We can make it. We can make it. Don't cry.

467

I thought I couldn't go to university.

Don't worry. Don't worry.

There's still time. There's still time.

We can make it.

No. We can make it.

472

Come on!

Come on!

474
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,320
Have you brought the exam admission ticket?

475
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,320
Yes. Yes.

476

Have you brought the exam admission ticket?

480
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,470
I want to use the restroom.

481

Hold it.

They say a little bit of tension is good for concentration.

But all I can think about is going to the restroom.

484
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,270
Zhouzhou, are you still in pain?

485
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,870
Shall I buy some more medicine?

486
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,500
No, I'm fine.

487
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,440
You've taken medicine and it doesn't help.

488
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,320
Luckily, it is not too hot.

489

I'll be all right after a short rest at noon.

OK. Don't worry.

494
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,560

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,630
You won't be able to go to the restaurant to have a rest.

501
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,200
Why don't we find a hotel? I'm sure you'll feel good after you take a nap.

502
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:32,800
Let' go.

503
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,440
Zhouzhou, are you still having a tummy ache?

504
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,460
No, I'm much better.

505
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,390
Then sleep a little longer.

506
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,860
No, you should have a rest.

507
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,350
No, I'm not sleepy.

508
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,560
Let's come back here tomorrow at noon to have a rest.

509
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,110
Good.

510
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,510
Are you hungry?

511
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,320
Yes.

512
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,720
By the way, I just bought you some bread and milk.

513
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:58,920
Have some.

514
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,080
Thanks.

515
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,270
You have some too.

516
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,470
OK.

517
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,630
Is it good?

518
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,230
Yes.

519
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,950
Put all your schoolbags on the table here.

520
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,080
Take your exam admission tickets and pens.

521
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,350
Line up here to enter the examination hall.

522
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,270
Line up here.

523
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,080
Here, take your exam admission tickets and pens.

524
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,600
Line up and enter one by one.

525
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,040
Do you have any extra pens?

526
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,150
You didn't bring pens.

527
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,800
No.

528
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,720
I only brought one pen. Go ask if someone else has one.

529
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,510
You, the exam is about to start. Put your cell phone back.

530
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:23,920
Line up here.

531
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Sir, I want to call my mom

532
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,080
and ask her to send me something.

533
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,670
It's too late to send you anything now.

534
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,470
If you need something, borrow it from other students.

535
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,560
Put your cell phone back.

536
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,870
Here, line up here.

537
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,670
Put all your schoolbags here.

538
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,080
Don't you have to take an exam?

539
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
I was recommended for admission to university.

540
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,270
Your parents must be very proud

541
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,600
to have such a wonderful daughter as you.

542
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,920
Maybe.

543
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,200
My daugher always said to me,

544
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,680
'Dad, can't you just praise me?'

545
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,390
‘Maybe once.’

546
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,080
Your father and mother must be the same.

547
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,440
Are you waiting for her?

548
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,790
She couldn't come.

549
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,720
I am here for her.

550
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,620
She didn't need to take the college entrance exam?

551
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,960
She said she didn't want to take any exam.

552
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,390
She was going to a freer place.

553
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,710
You must love her very much.

554
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,990
I also miss her very much.

555
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,200
She was just like you.

556
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,840
She stayed in the good age of eighteen forever.

557
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,110
I heard you were the only one recommended to university in the classes of arts.

558
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,680
Congratulations.

559
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,550
Thank you, and you're the only one who congratulated me.

560
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,920
I was accorded a military rank.

561
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,500
How about this military uniform?

562
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,680
I've known you for so long

563
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,750
and you look good in this outfit.

564
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,320
I'm going to Inner Mongolia in a couple of days

565
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,679
and I've always wanted to say something to you.

566
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,510
Don't.

567
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,190
I don't like you.

568
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,270
Xin Rui, you pig.

569
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,159
Got to go.

570
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,270
Xin Rui,

571
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,270
I don't want you to be anyone

572
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,639
but yourself.

573
00:34:54,670 --> 00:35:08,440
[The class of 2003 in Zhenhua High School, a pleasant journey and a bright future!]

574
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,950
You are all being silly because of your study.

575
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,230
-Hello, Director Pan. 
-Director Pan.

576
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,470
The college entrance examination is over.

577
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,080
Get down to business.

578
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,600
Tear up the papers and throw the books up in the air.

579
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,430
Sir, why do I feel so unreal?

580
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,080
Is the exam really over?

581
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:28,880
It's over.

582
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,120
Right, what if it was a dream,

583
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,030
and we woke up and found the books had been torn up,

584
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,320
how could I take the exam?

585
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,950
-Hit me and I'll see if it hurts. 
-Go away.

586
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,950
Three years is all underlines and wavy lines

587
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,910
marked on the books.

588
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,470
I spent hundreds of yuan just on red marker pens.

589
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,230
Those books and papers

590
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,430
are my most, most, most valuable possessions.

591
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,710
I keep them to encourage my parents.

592
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,180
I'll take out these books and papers

593
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,670
in case they don't work hard.

594
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,270
Anyway, I've tried my best in my life.

595
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,430
It's up to you.

596
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,080
I've been a director of teaching and discipline in Zhenhua for more than 20 years,

597
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,560
and you are the best class I've ever seen.

598
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,190
Sir, do you say that every year?

599
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,400
Hurry up.

600
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,400
Go.

601
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,230
Three two one.

602
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,080
Freeze.

603
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,710
Moved. Lin Yang you moved.

604
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,040
Which flavor would you like？

605
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,070
I want vanilla flavoured.

606
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,270
I want strawberry flavoured.

607
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,040
Qianqian you eat that one.

608
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,600
I want strawberry flavoured.

609
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,560
Qianqian wants strawberry flavoured.

610
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,510
QIanqian I can change with you.

611
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,950
You are dripping while you are eating.

612
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Would you stop being like a kid?

613
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,080
You can tell me how to do it.

614
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,600
Like this. Like this.

615
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,800
Let's go to that shop over there later.

616
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,470
I already.

617
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,640
I just thought of the one from the Titanic.

618
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,510
I ask you to apply for the school in Beijing.Remember?

619
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,070
Major doesn't matter.

620
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,270
Your Dad just got transferred.

621
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,150
It's easy to find a job when you graduate.

622
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,460
I'll ask about it later.

623
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,360
How many scores did that little bitch estimate to get.

624
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,870
You must be higher than her.

625
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,080
Even one score is good.

626
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,190
Ranran

627
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,590
This is the last time.

628
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,600
You have to keep mom's chin up, you know?

629
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,910
Good boy.

630
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,830
The teacher just went out.

631
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,400
He asked us to wait him for a while.

632
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:47,990
Okay.

633
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,990
How many scores do you estimate to get?

634
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,910
Your mom asks you to do that, right?

635
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,750
My Dad was transferred.

636
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,560
My whole family will move from here.

637
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,710
I will go with my Dad to go to the university in Beijing.

638
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:18,640
My mom said.

639
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,270
Zhou Shenran.

640
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,750
Do you know about the monkey in the Himalayas?

641
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,360
Once upon a time there was a small village.

642
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,470
Here comes an immortal who can turn everything into gold.

643
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,470
The villagers treated him with great hospitality.

644
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,080
After the immortals was fed and watered with good food and drink.

645
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,880
He told them the spell of Midas touch.

646
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,180
But he told to them.

647
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,750
When you use the spell,

648
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,710
never think of the monkey in Himalayan.

649
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,950
The villagers all felt strange.

650
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,430
They thought. Why we will think about that monkey?

651
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,800
The monkey has nothing to do with us.

652
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,840
But here was the irony.

653
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,160
When they wanted to use the spell,

654
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,800
they can't help to

655
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,990
think about the monkey.

656
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,080
So they didn't succeed until the end.

657
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,270
They were as poor as ever.

658
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,840
Honestly speaking, when I was a kid

659
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,110
I hated you very much.

660
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,190
But later I found that

661
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,830
actually we were both the same.

662
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,190
You grew up in the shadow

663
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,110
that Dad would leave at any moment.

664
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,510
I grew up in the shadow that I didn't have a Dad.

665
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,320
But that doesn't matter now.

666
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,600
I am not interested in taking your father away from you all the time.

667
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,800
You don't need to worry about that.

668
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,560
I am not.

669
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,360
To be Zhou Shenran.

670
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,230
Instead of being the son of Zhou Shuguo.

671
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,190
In your heart, we are just like

672
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,040
the monkey in the the Himalayas.

673
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,600
Ranran, you can package first when you get back.

674
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,800
Later we will send it to Beijing.

675
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,710
Then We will travel to the foreign countries.

676
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,990
Think which country you want to go.

677
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,910
After we received the admission letter.

678
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,080
We will go to Beijing to live with your father.

679
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,270
I heard that little bitch also got a good score.

680
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,230
No matter how good the test is, what's the use?

681
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,430
-Even if she goes to Peking or Tsinghua University, she would. -Oh no, don't say anything.

682
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,040
You speak for her now.

683
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,720
I think she is just like her mother.

684
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,750
They have many ways to seduce men.

685
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,600
I didn't apply for the university in Beijing.

686
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,430
What are you saying?

687
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,180
I've had enough of you.

688
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,750
Ranran.

689
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,950
Come on, cheers, cheers.

690
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,880
Come on, cheers, cheers.

691
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,190
You mush finish it. Come on.

692
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,750
Okay, I will.

693
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,160
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

694
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:17,990
Zhouzhou comes.

695
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,950
Sit down. Sit down.

696
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,560
Drinking. Drinking.

697
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Fill Lin Yang's cup.

698
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,710
Come on. Fill Lin Yang's cup.

699
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,080
Zhouzhou, you are here.

700
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,600
I know that Jiang Chuan will invite you.

701
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:28,910
Your class party.

702
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,360
Why me and Zhouzhou come here?

703
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,320
We don't know them.

704
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,800
I know you both, which is enough.

705
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,800
I just realized.

706
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,270
Do you know when I review at home

707
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,070
what am I read?

708
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:42,670
Buddhist texts.

709
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,190
Oh my God, in this Italian restaurant,

710
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,270
how come there are peanuts?

711
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,980
I bring it to here.

712
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,750
Okay, now let's start the game part.

713
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,470
-Come on. Come on. -Okay.

714
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,600
Come on. Game. Game. Game.

715
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,080
The name of the game is "visiting three kinds of gardens".

716
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:00,660
"Visiting three kinds of gardens" is interesting.

717
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,360
Zhouzhou, together?

718
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,470
No, thanks, I'm good.

719
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,270
Let's go. Let's go.

720
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,880
I thought I almost recovered at home.

721
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,230
But today when I come,

722
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,910
seeing them all looking at me like that,

723
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,750
I still feel uncomfortable.

724
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:19,840
Very uncomfortable.

725
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,360
Those guys originally hoped that I was that kind of person.

726
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,160
You must feel so bad.

727
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,750
But you still come.

728
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,400
I don't know why I come to here.

729
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,990
But anyway.

730
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,360
At least, Jiang Chuan stays with me.

731
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,840
Why you add at least here?

732
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,990
Time is like flooding.

733
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,270
The distance between people will get farther and farther.

734
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,040
A lot of things that seemed very big at that time

735
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,360
would actually be diluted very lightly in the end.

736
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,120
You also read Buddhist texts?

737
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Okay, I will drink it. I will.

738
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,430
Drink quickly. Drink quickly.

739
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,080
Bravo.

740
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,600
Lin Yang is really worrying.

741
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,230
You don't know. That is called strategy.

742
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,360
Zhouzhou what are you going to do?

743
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,160
I go first.

744
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,800
I go out to the toilet.

745
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:34,430
Lin Yang.

746
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,670
Come back soon. Quickly.

747
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,160
Let's drink. Let's continue.

748
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,400
Zhouzhou. Zhouzhou.

749
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Why are you here?

750
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,320
And you drink so much.

751
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,670
You go back quickly, and be careful on the way.

752
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,430
What's the matter?

753
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,030
Why are you still treat me like this?

754
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,270
Like what?

755
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,980
I ignore you, why are you not angry?

756
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,560
You ignore me?

757
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,670
Jiang Chuan and those guys said.

758
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:15,120
I'm too enthusiastic for you.

759
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,870
They said if I leave you alone and ignore you,

760
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:20,910
you will be jealous.

761
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,560
So you will understand your own mind.

762
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,270
It took me a lot of effort to catch up with you.

763
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,430
Why are you still like this?

764
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,470
Not angry at all.

765
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:32,750
Lin Yang.

766
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,910
Are you okay?

767
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,470
A little bit painful.

768
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,470
Get up.

769
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:05,430
Lin Yang.

770
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,950
Let me send you to your home.

771
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,710
This sentence should be said by boys.

772
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,670
Okay. You send me home.

773
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,470
No way.

774
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:39,560
Zhou Zhou, you have been this expression since childhood.

775
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,190
You never take the initiative to find me.

776
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:46,990
Sometimes you just stand there.

777
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,190
And watch me running to you.

778
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,990
Sometimes you even run in the opposite direction.

779
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,940
I am so flustered.

780
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,120
Because everything seems to push you farther.

781
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,950
I can hardly catch up with you.

782
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,230
I'm really afraid.

783
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,360
Lin Yang. Lin Yang.

784
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,270
Actually just now you ignored me.

785
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,400
I was a little angry.

786
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,880
And I didn’t always have only one expression since I was young.

787
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,710
I'm just good at pretending.

788
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,430
I tell you a secret.

789
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,040
Actually I am an actor.

790
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,230
Do you like Lin Yang?

791
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:42,900
I didn't lie to you.

792
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,190
I didn't fall asleep.

793
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,750
You thought I was drunk.

794
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,670
How is it? Serial tricks.

795
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,400
Yu Zhouzhou, let me ask you a few questions.

796
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,160
You have to answer seriously.

797
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,190
You cannot lie.

798
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,470
Go ahead.

799
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,990
Were you a little angry just now?

800
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:05,560
Yes.

801
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:06,950
I ignored you just now.

802
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,230
Were you a little unhappy?

803
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:11,750
Yeah.

804
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,590
I invite you.

805
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:16,460
Even if you don't like it,

806
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,270
you still come.

807
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,640
Yes.

808
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:21,910
What do you really want to ask?

809
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,840
So this is,

810
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:25,560
this is,

811
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,710
the manifestation of a little bit liking me.

812
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:33,400
This question？

813
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,950
You can just ask me directly.

814
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,360
Why you are so

815
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,360
so

816
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,080
Okay. Zhouzhou.

817
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:50,880
Do you like Linyang?

818
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:52,670
Yes.
