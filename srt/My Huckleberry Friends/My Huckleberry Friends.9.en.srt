4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,530
I'm so angry.

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,180
What's going on? Is your paper rejected again?

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,210
Pan Yuanshen. He has become my deadly enemy.

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,500
I wrote so many words,

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,890
but he completely returned the paper to me without taking a further look.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,130
To play up to him,

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,730
I even tore off the poster.

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,880
What if he doesn't think you play up to him?

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,290
Then what else does he want?

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,890
Should I stick his photo on the desk and pray to him?

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:48,980
No way.

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,610
All right. You guys stop laughing.

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,020
I'm not in the mood for joking now.

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,450
How about

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:00,450
this?

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,770
I see other clubs also have dancing programs.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,930
How about we also make such a program?

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,420
In this way, we also have a program.

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,490
If so, should we still call the animation club?

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,930
No. No.

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,490
I have an idea.

25
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,060
Go ahead.

26
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,380
I studied the cello before.

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,700
If we enroll in the program in the name of music,

28
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,020
we can play for the stage with the mixture of the musical.

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,020
Would it be OK?

30
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,810
Do one thing under the cover of another thing.

31
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,700
Zhouzhou, you are awful.

32
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,420
My pleasure.

33
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,340
All right. I feel relieved that

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,610
the animation club has you who is so devious.

35
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,380
These are all Lin Yang's ideas.

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,740
He even wrote a stack of modification advice to me.

37
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,810
He is so devoted to your things.

38
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,340
Come on. I think I finally figure it out.

39
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,060
He is the sun.

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,289
You are the sunflower.

41
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,930
It's so warm to be irradiated by someone.

42
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,340
Hi. Director Pan.

43
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,700
Lin Yang.

44
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,220
Yes. Director Pan.

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,060
Come here.

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,140
I have read the program.

47
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,980
Ah. Excellent. It's worthy of praise.

48
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
However,

49
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,600
I feel that the program still has a little shortcoming.

50
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,650
It might be short of a singing program,

51
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,810
especially the vocal solo.

52
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,650
You see

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,220
we are on the same page.

54
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
Ah, do we?

55
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,780
Look.

56
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,780
So I add a new program. Have a look.

57
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,090
You are going to play fun with the people.

58
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,980
I just want to liven up the atmosphere at the scene.

59
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,300
Director Pan.

60
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,370
As usual, you are a serious person who has an aura of dignity.

61
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,060
If you integrate yourself with everyone,

62
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,220
no one will be afraid of you.

63
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,060
At that time, you will not have the aura of dignity.

64
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,170
Care about your own business.

65
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,090
You only see my hard look,

66
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,530
but you don't know my gentleness.

67
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,720
This program's purpose is to let the students

68
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,420
see a real Director Pan instead of singing.

69
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,730
The meaning of this program is so great.

70
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,580
I will try my best to arrange it for you.

71
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,220
Do a good job.

72
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,500
Yes. OK. OK.

73
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,170
[Episode Nine The script doesn't have this scene.]

74
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,770
Zhouzhou, are you going to play a song?

75
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,060
I haven't heard Zhouzhou playing yet.

76
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,810
Let me enjoy it now.

77
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,010
I haven't played the cello for a long time so that my skill might be rusty.

78
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,340
No worries.

79
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,940
Yes. Feel free to play.

80
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,420
She is not modest, right?

81
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,240
Mi Qiao.

82
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,810
Can I borrow this book?

83
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,140
You just say if you will join the animation club or not.

84
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,250
As long as you join the animation club, you can read all these books.

85
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,140
Can I do that?

86
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,740
What procedure do I need to go through?

87
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,180
It's not so difficult.

88
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,250
You can just buy me a popsicle.

89
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,650
OK, I will join the club.

90
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,090
Oh, as you are so crisp,

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,860
you don't need to buy the popsicle.

92
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,210
Congratulations. You open the new world's door.

93
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,740
We are ready now.

94
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,420
OK. Let me hear it.

95
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,460
OK. OK. Yu, it's OK.

96
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,810
I played two wrong notes.

97
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,770
I didn't recognize how many wrong notes you played.

98
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,740
But it might be rhythmless.

99
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,020
I haven't played the cello for a long time.

100
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,530
You need to let me have some time for practice.

101
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,050
I have played the cello much better than yesterday.

102
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,860
If we wait for your skill to be mature,

103
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,330
how will this song sound like?

104
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,650
Oh, it will be this level.

105
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,050
Wow. Fabulous. It's so picturesque.

106
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,700
You are too overreacted.

107
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,900
Yu.

108
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,300
We will temporarily trust that your skill will be recovered

109
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,530
in such a short time.

110
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,930
But the song that you just played was

111
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,810
the instrumental ensemble between the piano and the cello.

112
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,740
Of course, it's a cover for you to play the cello.

113
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,420
But I think one cello's performance

114
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,370
might not be good enough.

115
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,370
Right?

116
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,620
You are coming so early today.

117
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,930
The teacher rarely didn't delay the class.

118
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,770
You are so hardworking and still doing the review.

119
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,460
No. I'm afraid that the dialogue will be lost

120
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,700
so that I put it in the book.

121
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,250
Where is Zhan Yanfei?

122
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,740
Oh, she told me that

123
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,090
she wanted to practice by herself.

124
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,700
Thus, she will not practice with us.

125
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,740
Qianqian. In my opinion, you should not always play a joke to her.

126
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,740
I'm not playing a joke to her.

127
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,370
OK. Today there are just three of us.

128
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,180
Let's do it as quickly as possible. Practice the lines.

129
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,860
Come on.

130
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
Zhouzhou.

131
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,020
Oh, I will not laugh at you.

132
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,980
What's wrong with you?

133
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,900
The ancient people make a few regulations that everyone should comply with.

134
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,860
Yu Zhouzhou has made more and more regulations with me.

135
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,090
Forget it. I'm looking for Ling Xiangqian today.

136
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,580
Ah? Looking for me?

137
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,530
Our animation club wants to perform a program at the arts festival.

138
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,050
What we told Director Pan was the instrumental ensemble between the piano and the cello.

139
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,140
But what we are actually doing is our animation drama.

140
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,210
We want to invite you to play the piano with us.

141
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:30,930
Would it be OK?

142
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,740
It might not be a good idea.

143
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,090
You are standing up to Director Pan.

144
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,620
This can not be said as "against".

145
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,330
We just seek loopholes.

146
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,620
Zhouzhou, you'd better think twice.

147
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,700
It will be serious if Director Pan blames this thing.

148
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,740
Ah, you think too much.

149
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,460
The arts festival is held for the students

150
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,860
instead of Director Pan.

151
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,040
Oh. What's more,

152
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,050
Ling Xiangqian, you really liked to play the piano when you were young.

153
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,010
Just in time.

154
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,860
Let me think about it.

155
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,810
Oh, why are you playing the piano again

156
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,620
instead of reading books in the room?

157
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,580
The school has the activity and requires me to perform.

158
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,620
Why do you take part in those useless activities?

159
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,410
Go to read books as soon as possible.

160
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,650
I have already done my homework.

161
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,130
Can I just play the piano in half an hour?

162
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,210
No. Your Teacher Wu has said that

163
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,679
your recent score has a step back.

164
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,890
In this case, why do you want to play the piano?

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,740
In other words, playing the piano can't get the extra point for the college entrance examination.

166
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,820
You go to read the books as soon as possible.

167
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,500
I should have sold this piano long ago.

168
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,740
You just play the piano if you want.

169
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,820
Qianqian, what are you doing here?

170
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,760
I just passed by.

171
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,090
Ah, you have just passed by for a while.

172
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,890
You have been spying on me.

173
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,130
How do I dare to spy on you?

174
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,180
I'm just too outstanding.

175
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,740
Are you bullying Jiang Chuan again?

176
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,820
No. I just passed by.

177
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,130
I have something to discuss with you.

178
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,380
Are you talking about presiding over the program?

179
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,890
Yes.

180
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,570
Just in time. Let's chat while walking.

181
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,130
OK.

182
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,330
What a doomed couple they are!

183
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,770
Don't talk nonsense.

184
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,420
Just by yourself? Do you still want to contend with Chu Tiankuo?

185
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,770
Are you still hesitating if you should accept

186
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,090
Yu Zhouzhou's invitation or not?

187
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,650
If they would do it in such a way,

188
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,300
Director Pan would blame.

189
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,650
Actually, I think what Lin Yang said yesterday did make sense.

190
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,770
The arts festival is an activity that

191
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,500
should collect all the people's ideas for fun.

192
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,980
But I haven't been playing the piano for a long time.

193
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,530
My mom also doesn't support me.

194
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,620
Do you like playing the piano?

195
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,970
I quite liked it when I was young.

196
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,300
But I don't like to do it for getting the extra point

197
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,620
and the piano grading test.

198
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,650
And then it was not necessary anymore.

199
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,450
My family also didn't let me play the piano.

200
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,570
Actually, I think life should not be too utilitarian.

201
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,650
It's not necessary to care about exterior details.

202
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,820
And Director Pan is also not a monster.

203
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,330
So you suggest accepting the invitation.

204
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,060
This decision still needs to be made by yourself.

205
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,770
But whatever choice you will make,

206
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,330
I will always support you.

207
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,380
Oh. One more thing,

208
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,530
recently little swallow is not in a good mood.

209
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,980
She still has some habits as a host.

210
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,650
You would not be that hard on her.

211
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,010
OK.

212
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,210
Come on.

213
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,930
Did you bring the stuff?

214
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,130
I'm begging you. Can you give me a break?

215
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,260
My mom almost finds it out.

216
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,200
OK. OK.

217
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,850
Just such a damn thing.

218
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,890
What happened if it would be found out?

219
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,530
Ah. Give me back. This is not mine.

220
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,180
Your life is good now.

221
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,740
Don't break it.

222
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,730
I'm leaving now. I borrow this book for several days.

223
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,420
It depends on your ongoing performance.

224
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,060
Xu Zhiqiang.

225
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,740
Li Bai is Sailor Moon.

226
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,010
Li Bai is not Sailor Moon.

227
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,820
Li Bai replaces the original character in Sailor Moon.

228
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,180
And Du Fu replaces Seiya.

229
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,130
And then they fall in love with each other.

230
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,890
Uh, they are not falling in love.

231
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,090
This is a feeling between men.

232
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,380
They are like friends or brothers.

233
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:57,860
Soulmate.

234
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,650
Yes, soulmate.

235
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,060
Alright, any situation is ok.

236
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,420
As we want to play, we should play well.

237
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,890
So you accept it.

238
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,180
Let's have a try.

239
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,380
The passion of youth is fire.

240
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,770
The passion of youth is.

241
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,290
The passion of youth is.

242
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,330
I left my stuff here.

243
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,570
Are you looking for this?

244
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,090
Oh, yes. Thank you.

245
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,440
Lin Yang.

246
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,860
Do you have a crush on Yu Zhouzhou?

247
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,980
I just took a glance over it.

248
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,980
I was not intentional.

249
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,300
Are you talking about this?

250
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,890
How should I say this?

251
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,260
But Yu Zhouzhou

252
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
has a crush on someone now.

253
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,380
This is what we borrowed from the music classroom.

254
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,120
It's convenient for us to rehearse.

255
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,450
Ah. Right. Ling Xiangqian.

256
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Can you sort of bear with Zhouzhou?

257
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,620
Her level.

258
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,650
I did practice a lot these days.

259
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,620
OK. Let's have a try first.

260
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,450
Good job.

261
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,330
I accidentally played several wrong notes.

262
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,970
I didn't recognize any wrong note this time.

263
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,940
Oops, you are so excellent. Ling Xiangqian.

264
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,060
Let me say something that is against my will.

265
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,740
You are a beautiful lady when you are playing the cello.

266
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,770
Then you don't tell the truth.

267
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,450
This is also my first time cooperating with other people.

268
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,010
I don't realize that it went smoothly.

269
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,690
Mi Qiao, I'm kind of looking forward to our show now.

270
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,500
Were you reluctant before?

271
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,650
Before.

272
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,690
OK. Then we take a look at the script and allocate the roles.

273
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,860
Ah. OK.

274
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,380
Xin Rui, which role do you play?

275
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,300
I I can't do it.

276
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,380
Ah, no way.

277
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,420
If you don't play, people are not enough.

278
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,650
I haven't played before.

279
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,770
I'm afraid I will be nervous.

280
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,820
If so, can you play as the horse? It has no lines.

281
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,770
How do you know this?

282
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,500
She told me personally.

283
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,820
But the person is not you.

284
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,930
No need to be nervous.

285
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,860
She told me this when I was in primary school.

286
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,940
Oh, the primary school.

287
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,450
At that time, it was popular to say who likes whom

288
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,860
and who likes whom.

289
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,820
Benben. I'm Benben.

290
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,410
But I really envy Yu Zhouzhou.

291
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,180
She is smart, beautiful, and doing well in her studies.

292
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,770
And she is not that remote like Ling Xiangqian.

293
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,530
What Ling Xiangqian talked about you was not spiteful.

294
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,410
She is just not good at expressing herself.

295
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,610
I know. Everyone has no malice.

296
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,810
As a child,

297
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,890
the teacher of the Children's Palace was not spiteful

298
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,530
to say that I was suitable for learning to be a host.

299
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,850
Everyone is not spiteful to praise me that I'm smart and beautiful.

300
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,010
When I grow up, study suddenly becomes the top priority.

301
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,130
My teachers and parents are not spiteful to say that I'm doing no decent work all day.

302
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,060
After that, I'm getting fat.

303
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,090
My best friend was not spiteful

304
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,180
to snigger behind my back.

305
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,080
Do you know

306
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,210
I actively apply for this time's host to Director Pan?

307
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,740
I'm not reconciled to it.

308
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,500
Little swallow, actually everyone has recognized your improvement.

309
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,820
I'm sorry to suddenly say so many words.

310
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,890
You can leave first. I want to practice for a while.

311
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,010
OK.

312
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,180
Will you come to rehearse tomorrow?

313
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,880
Yes.

314
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,569
Holy shit.

315
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,440
I'm so mad.

316
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,540
The accounts are still incorrect this week.

317
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,690
Did this store encounter any thieves?

318
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,050
Xin Rui.

319
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,900
Did you secretly steal the store's stuff?

320
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:26,140
It's not me. How do I dare to do this?

321
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,609
I bet you would not do it.

322
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,860
If I catch the thief,

323
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,020
I will let him die.

324
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,900
OK. Today's lesson is over. Class dismissed.

325
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,740
Stand up.

326
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,660
Goodbye, teacher.

327
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,380
What's going on?

328
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,660
Have you already learned off the dialogue?

329
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,410
Have you learned off the dialogue?

330
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,330
Mi Qiao, I still think that

331
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,690
the dialogue is too much.

332
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,980
You are just not serious.

333
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,740
How can you learn off the text?

334
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,020
Who said that? I also didn't learn off the text.

335
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,130
You.

336
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,740
Ah. I think our dialogue is a bit too much.

337
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,450
We should refine it.

338
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,090
Yu Zhouzhou and I have discussed some songs

339
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,040
to cooperate with the progress of the stage performance.

340
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,980
I think we should always keep in mind

341
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,330
that the music perfectly matches the specific stage performance

342
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,320
and specific note.

343
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,540
This sounds good,

344
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,980
but it might be a little complex.

345
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,540
My thoughts are that

346
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,860
we can add some asides

347
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,900
which are controllable

348
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,860
and the result is also good.

349
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,900
You are meaning that

350
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,330
we find someone individually say the dialogue.

351
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,410
Yes.

352
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,620
This might be good.

353
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,980
I have an idea.

354
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,380
As our show is related to Li Bai and Du Fu,

355
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,660
can we use ancient poetry as a replacement for asides?

356
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,450
This sounds a little interesting.

357
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,570
I think this is good.

358
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,740
Yes. We have an action scene at the beginning of our show.

359
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,020
I think we can use Du Fu's poetry

360
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,980
for the scenes that Li Bai moves ten steps to kill one person

361
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,210
and the scene before the struggle.

362
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,770
The Pressgang at Stone Moat Village 
 I seek shelter at nightfall. What is the pressgang coming for?

363
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,260
This also explains the background.

364
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,980
This is good.

365
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,620
But who can say the asides?

366
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,560
Both of you have to play and I'm unable to it.

367
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,660
I recommend a person.

368
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,260
We can ask her to have a try.

369
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,170
Come in.

370
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,170
Teacher Zhan is coming.

371
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,410
We just finished the modification.

372
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
If you do that,

373
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,210
I'm leaving now.

374
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,900
No. No. We really can't do this.

375
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,890
This is our script. You can have a look first.

376
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,050
We are lacking of a monologue now.

377
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,500
Our story is mainly related to classical culture,

378
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,690
but we really can't find a person who can read this like a well-educated person.

379
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,330
a literate person to read the article.

380
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,690
It seems interesting.

381
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,980
Would you join us?

382
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,330
My task is to read these characters, right?

383
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:53,900
Yes.

384
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:54,810
Read the red characters.

385
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,330
They are mainly ancient poems.

386
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,410
Let me have a try.

387
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:57,860
Okay.

388
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:06,050
I seek for shelter at nightfall. What is the pressgang coming for?

389
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:13,410
My old host climbs over the wall. My old hostess answers the door.

390
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,570
It sounds great.

391
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,090
Let's try to add music on it.

392
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,690
You're right.

393
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,900
Ride off without stopping for a thousand miles.

394
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,330
I have asked you to have dinner, but you didn't hear it.

395
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,860
Why are you acting so crazily?

396
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,260
Mom, I will have a performance at the school's festival.

397
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,330
Performance?

398
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,740
What can you play?

399
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,080
Okay. Today's class is over.

400
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,450
Students who have questions can come to ask me.

401
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,140
Can you give my comic book back?

402
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,620
I haven't finished reading it.

403
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,410
Are you insane?

404
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,780
I can't steal things from my home anymore.

405
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,020
This is the last time.

406
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,660
My mom is more fierce than you when beating someone.

407
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,500
It's so boring.

408
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,330
Let's play it again.

409
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,050
What's wrong with you, my dear horse?

410
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,660
I...I'm nervous.

411
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,620
There's nothing to be nervous about.

412
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,500
It's just a rehearsal today. And you have no line.

413
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,050
It's my first time to play on such a huge stage.

414
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,140
Mi Qiao, aren't you afraid of playing badly or being embarrassed in public?

415
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,330
Life is short. I have no time to think about these.

416
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,980
Mi Qiao is heartless.

417
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,930
The word "nervous" can't be seen in her dictionary.

418
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,290
You're right.

419
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,540
I tell you,

420
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,690
if you are nervous,

421
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,690
you just think that

422
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,290
the audience are pigs.

423
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,540
Then you won't be nervous when thinking of it.

424
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,980
Zhouzhou, you're greater. I admire you.

425
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,050
This is what Littile Swallow taught me.

426
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,810
Zhouzhou.

427
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,660
Have you finished the table tennis game?

428
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,140
They're showering. I come to see you.

429
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,860
For you.

430
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,080
Thanks.

431
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,170
Oh, you are really like a little old man after sticking the beard.

432
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:48,540
Get away.

433
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,770
I'm the Immotral Poet, Li Bai.

434
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,410
When does the formal performance begin?

435
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,210
On half past four tomorrow afternoon.

436
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,450
Our exercise will be finished just at that time.

437
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,500
We will come to support you.

438
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,260
Okay.

439
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,540
No, no, no.

440
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,090
Don't come to make trouble, please.

441
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,810
Yu Zhouzhou, I'm standing still.

442
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,780
You're coming towards me.

443
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,980
Ah, you can keep standing still.

444
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,660
You have someone you like, don't you?

445
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,260
What do you mean?

446
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,450
Just the literal meaning.

447
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,040
You have someone you like, don't you?

448
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,620
I know you have.

449
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,260
Is the boy called Benben?

450
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,260
You're talking nonsense.

451
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,620
Tell me whether you have.

452
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,040
I have promised all what you have forbidden me to do.

453
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,540
But when will the condition change?

454
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,290
I'll be late for school.

455
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,450
I'm sorry. I'm not intentional.

456
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,930
Lin Yang, I'm warning you again.

457
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,900
I don't allow you to

458
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,810
come to me in any way, like walking, running, and jumping.

459
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,440
I don't allow you to talk and smile to me.

460
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,570
Don't touch anything of me.

461
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,500
It means that I can come to see you merely by rolling, right?

462
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,170
You can do it.

463
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,260
Don't be late for school.

464
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,450
Xin Yue, I have signed my name on your papers.

465
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,450
I'm putting them in your bag.

466
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:38,930
Okay.

467
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,260
You are rehearsing with Qianqian and that boy everyday.

468
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,570
Do you think that they have fallen in love like others say?

469
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,210
I don't see it.

470
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,860
What are you thinking about?

471
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,500
Are you thinking about how to roll to her?

472
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,260
Get away.

473
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,900
Will you roll?

474
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,050
Get away.

475
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,260
Xin Yue has been absent all morning. What's wrong with her?

476
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,170
Zhouzhou?

477
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,540
What are you thinking about?

478
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,170
You have talked about Xin Yue.

479
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,090
Let me give her a call.

480
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,090
Mom.

481
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,380
Mom, I beg you to let me out.

482
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,260
Mom.

483
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,620
Mom, please.

484
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,210
Nobody answers.

485
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,290
She always tells us she is nervous.

486
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,780
Is she going to sneak away before the performance starts?

487
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,780
She can't let Li Bai that I act walk to anywhere.

488
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,330
Leaders have attached great importance to this rehearsal.

489
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,620
The principle have mentioned it to me for several times.

490
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,020
You must take it seriously. Do you understand?

491
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,860
It's Mr. Pan. I forgot to think about him.

492
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,140
We have planned to feign our actoins and secretly reach the real purpose.

493
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,330
But the truth can only be revealed when we stand on the stage.

494
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,690
If we are stopped by him, our efforts will be in vain.

495
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,410
What can we do?

496
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,050
Please tell us. We really don't know it.

497
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,210
I ask you and you answer it.

498
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,450
Ah, I only know Pavarotti.

499
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,380
So, you, you, you.

500
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,330
Your functions are like the walkways'.

501
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,410
Swagger into that place.

502
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,920
Others come with me.

503
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,930
I know a secret path.

504
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,500
Be in a good state.

505
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,570
Be more positive.

506
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,210
What about my state today?

507
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,620
Hello, Director Pan.

508
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,570
Director Pan.

509
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,140
You're here. Where is Mi Qiao?

510
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,020
Mi Qiao?

511
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,140
She hasn't come.

512
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,020
I hear that you have prepared a musical

513
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,290
about Li Bai and Du Fu, right?

514
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,260
Yes. We have combined the musical with historical themes.

515
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,690
It can show great historical contents.

516
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,170
That's the right behavior.

517
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,050
Themes like anime are not decent.

518
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,780
Programs like yours are quite excellent.

519
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,450
Rehearse it seriously.

520
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,930
I'm confused. Why Director Pan suddenly approved our program?

521
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,450
Oh, I see.

522
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,500
Don't talk nonsense. It's not true.

523
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,140
Chu Tiankuo.

524
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,980
For our program, thanks a lot.

525
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,660
Why do you thank me?

526
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,780
Come in, come in.

527
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,660
Close the door.

528
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,660
Let me tell you.

529
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,540
I have investigated this place.

530
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,170
It's near our backstage.

531
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,410
To be on the safe side,

532
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,330
let's change our clothes here,

533
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,660
and go to the backstage before our performance starts.

534
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,020
You're very thoughtful.

535
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,140
Of course.

536
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,170
Will anyone use it?

537
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,740
You can prepare for the show now.

538
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,690
Wait for me for a moment.

539
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,020
Change your clothes first.

540
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,540
[Male Bathroom]

541
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,050
Hey, was my forehand shots just now

542
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,930
unbeatable?

543
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,260
-Amazing! 
-Are you convinced?

544
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,930
I tell you,

545
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,260
I didn't exert my strength just now.

546
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,380
If I exerted it, you must lose.

547
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,780
Xiao Yu.

548
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,500
You're admiring yourself again.

549
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,980
Why can't I admire myself?

550
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,620
Beat him.

551
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,690
Who's there?

552
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,660
Don't move.

553
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,740
Chase her!

554
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,020
Lend me the place.

555
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,740
I'll let you out for a while.

556
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,860
Who? Open the door.

557
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,330
Who? Open the door please.

558
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,500
Don't leave. Open the door.

559
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,290
It seems that Director Pan has no problem.

560
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,330
Let's prepare for it.

561
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,780
I refuse. What if he want to create a diversion

562
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,080
and draw the snake out of its hole?

563
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,860
I think the safest plan is to step on the stage before our performance starts.

564
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,450
What's wrong?

565
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,050
Mi Qiao, why is your face so red?

566
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,740
You just go out for a moment.

567
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,660
And you come back in this state. What happened?

568
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,500
It's none of your business. I'm hot.

569
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,860
Anyway, I won't go.

570
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,050
I will go. I will help you to have a look.

571
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,860
You prepare for the performance.

572
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,090
Hey, Xin Yue hasn't come.

573
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,860
What are you laughing about?

574
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,200
It begins. It begins.

575
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,090
The passion of youth is like fire.

576
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,170
The passion of youth is like wave.

577
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,330
Let's sing in the embrace of youth.

578
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,740
Let's fly freely in the songs.

579
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,540
The Club Festival of Zhenhua High School this year

580
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,540
now begins!

581
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:53,330
The Foolish Old Man sweared to move the Wangwu Mountain away.

582
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,290
That would make his life better.

583
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,020
Can you tell me the reason?

584
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,930
Because it wouldn't block the signal.

585
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,450
We must hurry up.

586
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,930
It will be our turn after only one program.

587
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,010
Hasn't Xin Yue come?

588
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,050
What can we do?

589
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,540
You can give up riding the horse.

590
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,280
How can I?

591
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,380
Zhouzhou.

592
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,020
You see, can we ask your friend for help?

593
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,020
Are you insane?

594
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,780
You peered us and locked us in the bathroom.

595
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,900
Don't get angry with me. My beard is going to drop.

596
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,860
I can let you have no beard forever.

597
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,970
Benben.

598
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,980
It's Mi Qiao's fault indeed.

599
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,380
If you want to teach her a lesson, please wait for a while.

600
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,570
We really need your help now.

601
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,410
For what?

602
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,780
An actor of our performance doesn't come.

603
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,410
I won't help you.

604
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,930
I haven't finished.

605
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,020
Don't expect me to help you.

606
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,620
It's very easy.

607
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,090
It's just like the role-play

608
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,500
we have did in our childhood in the yards.

609
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,570
You can regard it as a game.

610
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,500
Will you join us?

611
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,260
Which role?

612
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,620
What have you done?

613
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,620
You have promised the festival would last for three hours.

614
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,540
It has performed for a longer time.

615
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,570
Brother, I'm sorry.

616
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,370
Please make an exception.

617
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,210
We have only two programs

618
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,260
and a curtain call left.

619
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,090
There's another performance after yours.

620
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,450
I'll give you the last ten more minutes.

621
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,080
Hasten to adjust the programs.

622
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,260
If the program can't be finished playing, just stop performing it.

623
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,280
Brother.

624
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,540
How's it going?

625
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,260
Director Pan,

626
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,540
he said he would only give us ten more minutes.

627
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,170
Only one program can be performed from the solo and the musical.

628
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,080
What's your opinion?

629
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,260
Do you need to ask?

630
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,050
You can't do this.

631
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,250
Who is the director, you or me?

632
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,380
I can't obey it.

633
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,780
Listen to me. You must obey.

634
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,210
I...

635
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,540
This festival is for students.

636
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,020
And Class Three has prepared for this program for a long time.

637
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,380
They must perform it.

638
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,860
Director Pan,

639
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,380
what about your solo?

640
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,080
I can't sing well.

641
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,280
Let them perform.

642
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,900
I see, Director Pan.

643
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,780
Thanks for the great performance from the members of Computer Club.

644
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,100
What's the next program, Lin Yang?

645
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,980
Next program is wonderful.

646
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,130
It's the ensemble of the piano and the violin.

647
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,130
One of our hosts is a player.

648
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,010
Really?

649
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,650
Let's expect the next program together.

650
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,020
"A Fairy Tale of Moon and Stars"

651
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,540
Who are you?

652
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,260
Come

653
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,740
Ma

654
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,300
What?

655
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,610
- Kneel down. /N -Release my mom.

656
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,050
Release me. What are you doing!

657
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,610
Jerk

658
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,580
You release her. You don't move.

659
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,540
Burry them for me.

660
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:20,850
OK

661
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,060
Release them!

662
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,580
During Anshi Period, Du Fu traveled through mountains and rivers.

663
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,490
He came to a village.

664
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,610
You shameless people.

665
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,580
Tie this crap up for me as well.

666
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,450
Got it.

667

Minister

669
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,780
I was seeking shelter at County Shihao at nightfall, and found some sergeants catch people at such night

670
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:25,210
An old man climbed up the wall, and an old lady watched outside the door.

671
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:31,060
How angry was the sergeant’s shout! How bitter was the woman’s cry!

672
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,170
Are you alright, minister?

Mi Qiao, you are done.

675
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,060
Shut up and go.

This show is good.

680
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,300
Your students are really devoting to the performance.

681
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,330
What do  you want?

682
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,500
I'm so tired. I will quit acting. Bye

683
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,100
Do we continue acting? Where are you going?

684
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,410
Li Bai's horse died of arrow shot,

685
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,920
so Li Bai left with tears.

Du Fu and Li Bai traveled through mountains and rivers together,

and visited all the friends.

With the scenery here, would you like to compose a poem, bro Zimei?

Well,

707

Leaving at dawn the White King crowned with rainbow cloud, I have sailed a thousand miles through Three Georges in a day.

711
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:36,650
With monkeys' sad adieus the riverbanks are loud. My boat has left ten thousand mountains far away.

I didn't break the rule.

722

I rolled over here.

Li Bai was set up and left the officialdom.

724

One day, to scoop the moon from the water after drinking,

725
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,890
Li Bai fell into the water.

00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,850
but hasn't got the chance to sing it for everyone.

738

Next, let's welcome Director Pan.

With only one minute left,

740

I would like to say something.

741
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,580
Why do I choose to sing this song?

742
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,610
I have been a director of teaching for over twenty years,

who she talked about was a cartoon figure.
