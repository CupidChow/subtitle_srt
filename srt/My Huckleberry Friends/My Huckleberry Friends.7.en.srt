4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,610
Is it over?

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,020
It hasn't started yet.

6
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,250
Let me say something.

7
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,250
The seniors' scores in the 5-Schools Joint Examination
have been announced.

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,290
As for the number of top students who got over 600 points,

9
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,500
the Affiliated High School is not too different from us.

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,020
The competition is extremely intense and very serve.

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,500
It's surely

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,540
a smokeless war.

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,700
Who said so?

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,500
Wrong! It's completely wrong!

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,250
It's a war with flames and smoke,

16
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,610
a war with bloody blades.

17
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,459
In this exam, Yu Huai of your class

18
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,490
declined 18 places.

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,810
Han Xu declined 25 places.

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,490
They are the top seeds,

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,610
the elites of Zhen Hua High School.

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,660
They are supposed to fight to win victory for Zhen Hua.

23
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,340
You, as the commanders,

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,289
should be on the alert.

25
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,100
Lin Yang of your class

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,010
sit on the top 5.

27
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,810
Good job. Hang in there.

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,810
If anything goes wrong, you will bear the blame.

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,250
As for Ling Xiangqian and Yu Zhouzhou,

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,240
raise their scores by 20 points.

31
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,810
Let's surpass the Affiliated High School.

32
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:34,930
Got it?

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,140
One more thing.

34
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,660
Should we hold the basketball game?

35
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,060
I think it is worth discussing.

36
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,170
Well, Director Pan,

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,810
I think

38
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,370
the kids are worn out by studying every day,

39
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,740
so they take this game very seriously.

40
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,140
That's true, Director Pan.

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,570
Frankly speaking, the kids are having rough days.

42
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,660
How could we

43
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,420
cancel their extracurricular activities?

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,810
Even the NBA would cancel games,

45
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,490
is our basketball game more important than the NBA?

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,940
Um...

47
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,450
I have to say something.

48
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,520
Mr. Zhang,

49
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,580
no offense,

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,420
but Director Pan made a point this time.

51
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,940
Indeed we should pay attention to

52
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,500
the students' grades.

53
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,890
Director Pan has been teaching for many years

54
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,579
and has rich experience.

55
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,940
I think we class teachers

56
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,010
should fully implement Director Pan's ideas.

57
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,610
We should focus on the grades,

58
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,720
and also cherish the opportunity of the basketball game.

59
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,890
Tell the students to play it well after we go back.

60
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,500
Mr. Wu,

61
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,340
sit down.

62
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,810
Why?

63
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,890
What do you mean?

64
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,980
Didn't I say to cancel it?

65
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,420
Why did you make it go ahead?

66
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,300
Didn't you say to discuss it?

67
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,300
How could it be "worth discussing" if we cancel it?

68
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,220
That would be "no discussion", right?

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,340
No...

70
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,980
Pan,

71
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,220
you've been a leader for years,

72
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,500
but your ability of expression

73
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,220
has declined.

74
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,730
I'm going to give a class.

75
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,070
[Episode 7 Take Off Points Of Your Class]

76
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,940
Morning, Mi Qiao!

77
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,880
Morning!

78
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,090
Zhouzhou,

79
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,610
which one is more handsome?

80
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,250
This one.

81
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,610
I still think this one is better.

82
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,980
Why bother asking me?

83
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,050
Help me with this.

84
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,220
I'm sticking it on my desk.

85
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,420
Stick it on the desk?

86
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:55,730
Yes.

87
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,370
Aren't you afraid that Wu Wenlu will scold you?

88
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,300
Wu Wenlu won't care.

89
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,170
I didn't know you liked basketball.

90
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,580
Let me tell you. I just got addicted to it.

91
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,580
Although he's not very tall,

92
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,340
only 183cm,

93
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,890
he is a real man on the basketball court!

94
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,370
Isn't 183cm tall?

95
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,060
Not in the NBA.

96
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,140
In our school, 183cm is OK.

97
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,089
Hey,

98
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,700
come with me to watch the boys play basketball after class today.

99
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,810
Lin Yang who always sticks to you

100
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,460
seems to play well.

101
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,580
Oh.

102
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,370
I have some homework to do.

103
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,490
What a bummer!

104
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,580
What's the smell?

105
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,490
It smells like...

106
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,490
baked bun slices.

107
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,420
Benben gave them to me at the gate. You want some?

108
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,740
Of course I'll eat it.

109
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,580
Wow!

110
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,650
I do like this.

111
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,090
So nice!

112
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,860
Oh,

113
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,360
here it is.

114
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,860
Perfect!

115
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,620
Let me get this straight.

116
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,490
There's so much information.

117
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,810
That's to say,

118
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,900
the tragedy happened to Yu Zhouzhou's family

119
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,090
because of a ticket?

120
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,250
That's why Yu Zhouzhou has been ignoring you for a year,

121
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,460
and you haven't been very proactive?

122
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,370
Yesterday was Zhouzhou's mom's death day,

123
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,450
so finally she was willing to talk about it?

124
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,580
Here is my question.

125
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,210
Go ahead.

126
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,770
When Yu Zhouzhou was crying,

127
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,050
did you hold her in your arms?

128
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:36,620
Get lost!

129
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,810
Seriously,

130
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,409
let me tell you something.

131
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,580
Girls are at their most vulnerable time when crying.

132
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,860
If it were my Qianqian,

133
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,300
I would hug her immediately.

134
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,240
The atmosphere would be so good.

135
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,620
How dare I?

136
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,330
Finally she's willing to open up.

137
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,930
How dare I push it?

138
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,210
That's right.

139
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,420
Yu Zhouzhou has suffered such a big blow.

140
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,450
No wonder I felt something was wrong this year.

141
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,530
I just think of it...

142
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,650
Such a big thing happened and you didn't tell me anything.

143
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,930
Do you still regard me as your friend?

144
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,740
Ouch!

145
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,140
You're overacting.

146
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,860
How about now? What are you going to do?

147
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,810
I've no idea.

148
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,900
I just hope that before I leave I can hear her say

149
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,050
she will not blame me anymore.

150
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,930
In this way she can completely let go the pain,

151
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,040
and I can start over again without feeling guilty.

152
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,650
I think...

153
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,890
no one should be blamed for this.

154
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,460
Before you leave? Where are you going?

155
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
I'm transferring to another school.

156
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,740
Transfer schools?

157
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,020
To the Affiliated High School.

158
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,210
My dad's working on it.

159
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,450
The arrangements will be done next week.

160
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,900
What's wrong with you?

161
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,330
It's such a big thing but you didn't tell me.

162
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,700
What kind of a friend are you?

163
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,050
I was afraid you would cry and beg me not to leave.

164
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,930
What if I weaken?

165
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,180
Then don't go. Why are you transferring schools!

166
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,370
For over one year

167
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,620
everything that I've done for Yu Zhouzhou

168
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,650
was to find out

169
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,930
whether she still blames me or not.

170
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,970
Now I know

171
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,700
I can never hear her say that,

172
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,700
but I'm no longer asking for it.

173
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,180
Maybe only my departure

174
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,330
could free Yu Zhouzhou from her pain.

175
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,900
Lin Yang, I just want to know...

176
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,900
Leaving is the last thing that I can do for her.

177
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,210
Fine.

178
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,420
Good shot!

179
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,760
Why are you here?

180
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,460
Do you know that the basketball game will be held next week?

181
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,300
If your class is up against us,

182
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,490
be prepared to be defeated.

183
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,740
I might not even participate.

184
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,570
Why not?

185
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,980
I'm transferring to the Affiliated High School.

186
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,930
Why? What happened?

187
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,090
Nothing. It's just easier to get a recommendation
in the Affiliated High School.

188
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,920
Come on. Isn't it because of Yu...

189
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,580
Yu...What?

190
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,420
Yu Huai.

191
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,290
Yu Huai? You don't have to worry about him.

192
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,490
I‘m kind of vacating a place in the race for everyone.

193
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,920
In this case,

194
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,460
we have all the more reason to have a friendly game.

195
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,370
When will you leave?

196
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,770
Next week. The arrangements are almost done.

197
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,740
That's a deal. You must come.

198
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,580
It's really boring without you.

199
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,140
You should think about it carefully.

200
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,090
If I participate,

201
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,740
there would be no chance for your class.

202
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,640
I just like the way you brag

203
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,050
with a straight face.

204
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,620
Be prepared to be defeated!

205
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,580
Why can we bump into you everywhere?

206
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,020
Mi Qiao, Zhouzhou, what a coincidence!

207
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,020
Since we've met, let's sit and eat together.

208
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,140
Oh,

209
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,050
this is Xin Rui, a new student in our class.

210
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,180
Hello!

211
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,130
Zhouzhou, I have to tell you something.

212
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,330
Xin Rui, there are lots of...

213
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,330
mysterious snacks in Zhen Hua's cafeteria.

214
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,010
Let's get more dishes.

215
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,420
I have enough food.

216
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,320
Let's go.

217
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,940
What did you want to tell me?

218
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,420
Nothing. It's nothing.

219
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,770
Let's eat. I'll talk to you after lunch.

220
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,090
Why are they having lunch together?

221
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,450
It's none of your business.

222
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,130
Keep your eyes on your own tray.

223
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,090
It's the braised pork you took!

224
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,820
I just ate your shredded meat.

225
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,010
I won't eat it. You can take it.

226
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,450
Xin Rui, you don't have to be polite with her. You eat.

227
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,300
Zhouzhou,

228
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,650
I...

229
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,500
Lin Yang,

230
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,300
I'm looking for you everywhere. Zhouzhou's here, too.

231
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,890
The game schedule is set.

232
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,860
Friday afternoon. We happen to have 2 self-study periods.

233
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:07,940
No problem.

234
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,380
You hid it quite well.

235
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,940
Come to watch my basketball game.

236
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,380
Why?

237
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,690
Because I play basketball pretty well.

238
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
I'll see at the time.

239
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,420
Okay.

240
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,180
Actually this week I...

241
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,060
What is it?

242
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,570
Nothing.

243
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,010
Nothing.

244
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,650
Hey, did he just confess his love to you?

245
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,450
Nonsense.

246
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,940
What's going on?

247
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,890
This?

248
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,060
This is the benefit that the Animation Club got for us.

249
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,200
How's it?

250
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,060
The students who don't go home at noon can watch animations,

251
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,090
and relax.

252
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,210
We need to thank our Class Monitor Ling for her support.

253
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,260
It doesn't feel right. I almost got distracted by you.

254
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,860
I think...

255
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,010
Lin Yang is a good guy.

256
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,570
What do you think about him?

257
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,330
Stop talking, or I'll draw on your poster.

258
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,770
Don't touch my man!

259
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,500
My bad! No!

260
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,760
Ling Xiangqian.

261
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,530
My classmates are like that. I hope you don't mind.

262
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,180
It's nothing.

263
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,770
As long as you don't mind, I'm OK with it.

264
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,330
I've finished the book. Thank you!

265
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,030
[Decisive Moments in History]

266
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,650
You're watching a cartoon?

267
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,090
Mi Qiao brought it.

268
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,450
It's Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky.

269
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,530
Aren't cartoons only for kids to watch?

270
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,500
You like them?

271
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,940
I haven't watch cartoons for a long time.

272
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,090
But it's fun.

273
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,970
Isn't that because you are still a kid?

274
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,260
Maybe.

275
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,300
I gotta go.

276
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,060
I'm sorry!

277
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,380
Sorry!

278
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,980
Taking these to the office?

279
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,640
Yeah.

280
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,060
Let me help you.

281
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,770
No, thanks.

282
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,690
It's OK. Let me do it.

283
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,930
OK, thanks.

284
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,420
See you.

285
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,820
OK.

286
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,330
Did I hurt you?

287
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,180
No.

288
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,770
Lin...

289
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,570
Lin...What?

290
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,260
Benben.

291
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,500
Come on. Let's take some BBQ skewers.

292
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,650
I don't want to eat.

293
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,570
Then let's go to an internet cafe?

294
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,880
I don't know how to play computer games.

295
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,690
How about playing billiards?

296
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,330
Name a place.

297
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,170
I'll come with you.

298
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:08,860
Let's go!

299
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,450
Let's go!

300
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,090
If you feel bored, you are free to leave.

301
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,890
It's not boring.

302
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,000
Be quiet.

303
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,210
It's very interesting.

304
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,050
Have you told Yu Zhouzhou?

305
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,500
Not yet.

306
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,380
I kept it all day but didn't know how to tell her.

307
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,300
I bet she's the only one in our school who doesn't know.

308
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,060
It doesn't matter whether she knows.

309
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,940
I'll never hear her say that.

310
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,130
That won't work. There should be a kiss goodbye!

311
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,620
Get lost!

312
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,530
You're a typical case of being angry when embarrassed!

313
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:09,770
Hello.

314
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,060
Mi Qiao, I'm in a bookstore.

315
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,000
Call you later.

316
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,500
Don't hang up.

317
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,970
Yu Zhouzhou,

318
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,860
do you know Lin Yang's transferring schools?

319
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,300
Where did you hear the rumor?

320
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,980
I just bumped into Zhan Yanfei at the stationery,

321
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,090
She was buying a gift for Lin Yang.

322
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,500
She said Lin Yang would leave next week.

323
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,530
No way.

324
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,180
Why not?

325
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,860
I have to hang up. Let's talk tomorrow.

326
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,740
Take it slowly.

327
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,010
I'm fine.

328
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,530
Why did you drink so much?

329
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,680
Couldn't you just drink a little less?

330
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,770
Yang.

331
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,380
Yang!

332
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,060
Coming!

333
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,260
Get your dad some water.

334
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,570
He's drunk.

335
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,260
OK.

336
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,860
Director Hao said so.

337
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,820
There are 3 honors classes in the Affiliated High School

338
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,860
and all the head teachers are provincial top-notch teachers.

339
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,940
Yang can choose any class he wants when he goes there.

340
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,440
How can I not express some gratitude?

341
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,210
You can't say that without drinking, can you?

342
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,530
You don't know that.

343
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,300
Dad.

344
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,010
Yang,

345
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,500
Director Hao asked me to bring you

346
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,330
to the Affiliated High School tomorrow to look around,

347
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,860
to get familiar with the school first.

348
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,740
OKay.

349
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,940
On the day of the performance,

350
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,420
the boss asked Benben if he was ready.

351
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:59,020
[Youth&Children Story Contest]

352
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,060
Benben said, "I have one more request."

353
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,010
The boss asked, "What request?"

354
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,980
Benben said,

355
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,420
"Please buy me a big yellow balloon,

356
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,900
and release it when I'm giving the performance.

357
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,280
No matter how far,

358
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,619
my friend could see it,

359
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,050
and she will know that I've realized my dream."

360
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,810
Thank you!

361
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,020
I went to check at the gate but there were only red ones.

362
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,260
Thank you.

363
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,660
Benben,

364
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,540
why are you here?

365
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,930
Zhouzhou, take me in for one night.

366
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,450
Come on in.

367
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,170
Be careful.

368
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,290
Slow down.

369
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,660
Thanks.

370
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,540
No worries.

371
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,500
Zhouzhou,

372
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,980
you're so nice.

373
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,900
Are your dad drunk again?

374
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,900
Yeah.

375
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,090
When I was a kid, he drank a few times in a week.

376
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,660
Now he get sober a few times in a week.

377
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,410
Why don't you go find your biological father?

378
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,020
Why should I?

379
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,610
Except for not beating me,

380
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,380
he's not much better.

381
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,680
Now there's one good thing.

382
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,660
I don't have to count the bruises for my lifetime.

383
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,050
The lifetime will be over like that.

384
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,290
Zhouzhou,

385
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,050
it's my turn to protect you.

386
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,330
I won't let anyone bully you.

387
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,400
Zhouzhou,

388
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,610
are you asleep?

389
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,450
Benben,

390
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,020
Lin Yang said he was leaving.

391
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,500
Transfer schools?

392
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,050
How did you know?

393
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,980
I went to find him once,

394
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,740
to warn him to stay away from you.

395
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,260
So it is true.

396
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,090
Sure.

397
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,620
A guy like him should get far away,

398
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,450
the further the better.

399
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,090
I'm pissed off that he always shows up in front of you.

400
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,620
How could he forget what he did to you?

401
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,500
Benben...

402
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,090
Zhouzhou.

403
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,210
That accident had nothing to do with him.

404
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,020
I did it for your own good.

405
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,500
Why do you all know what is for my good?

406
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,170
Why only do I not know it?

407
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,330
Zhouzhou...

408
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,780
I'm fine. Go to sleep.

409
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,540
It seems that all the people around me

410
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,540
never get the chance to say goodbye

411
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,810
before they never see me anymore.

412
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,260
Hey, is Lin Yang here today?

413
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,290
No.

414
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,780
His seat is still empty.

415
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,690
Thanks.

416
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,290
The classroom is a place for studying.

417
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,290
It's very improper to stick the posters on your desk!

418
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,780
Tear it off right now!

419
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,020
I like him, so when I have it on my desk,

420
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,930
I'd like to study.

421
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,660
It's none of your business!

422
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,210
How dare you!

423
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,020
You tore my man!

424
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,690
You tore my man!

425
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,980
Pan Yuansheng, I'll kill you!

426
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,660
Pan Yuansheng!

427
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,660
Pan Yuansheng!

428
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,020
I'll kill you!

429
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,020
Pan Yuansheng!

430
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,780
I'm telling you. This isn't over.

431
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,380
I'm talking to you.

432
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,530
I like him, so when I have it on my desk,

433
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,410
it makes me feel like studying.

434
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,450
Stay out of it.

435
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,260
What did you say?

436
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,930
You are out of my control, right?

437
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,540
Get Mr. Wu to come to my office.

438
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,860
No, Director Pan. My bad. I was wrong.

439
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,900
You're right.

440
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,730
I'll tear it off right now.

441
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,370
Director Pan.

442
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,050
I was looking for you.

443
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,330
Tell me about Lin Yang.

444
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,890
I was just about to report it to you.

445
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,860
Let's go.

446
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,860
I'm not afraid of you.

447
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,900
I have my own reason.

448
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,450
You are the one who violated my rights first.

449
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,500
Then don't tear it up if you're so capable.

450
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,330
Stop laughing at me.

451
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,040
You helped me stick it, so help me tear it off.

452
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,980
Come on, help me tear off the tapes.

453
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,620
Mi Qiao,

454
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,740
give up so easily?

455
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,900
I have another one.

456
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,780
By the way,

457
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,740
are you going to watch

458
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,620
the basketball game between Class 1 and Class 2?

459
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,440
It's Lin Yang's farewell game.

460
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,780
He was so devoted to you.

461
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,450
This would be his last game.

462
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,090
If you don't even show your face,

463
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,690
it would be too...

464
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,540
What?

465
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,170
Nothing.

466
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:30,810
Jiang Chuan!

467
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,570
Oh!

468
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
You scared the heck out of me.

469
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,330
Did Lin Yang come to school today?

470
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:37,900
No.

471
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,570
He went to the Affiliated High School.

472
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,020
He left today?

473
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,570
No, just to look around today.

474
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,930
He will transfer next week.

475
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,780
You knew it?

476
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,090
Do you know why he's leaving?

477
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,410
Don't you know?

478
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,290
Haven't you forgiven him?

479
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,900
Forgive him?

480
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,570
Forget it.

481
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,450
Excuse me, I gotta go.

482
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,900
Qianqian,

483
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,380
what are you doing here?

484
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,930
When did you know that Lin Yang was leaving?

485
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,380
Just yesterday.

486
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,090
How could he do this?

487
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,570
Yeah,

488
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,140
it's so ridiculous.

489
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,730
Jiang Chuan!

490
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
What does Lin Yang have to do with me?

491
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,290
You knew it but you didn't tell me either.

492
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,450
I found out when I came to school this morning.

493
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,740
I must be the last one in our grade

494
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,810
to know that he's transferring.

495
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,080
Not you.

496
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,330
Yu Zhouzhou is the last one.

497
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,740
Yu Zhouzhou?

498
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,380
I just met her.

499
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,980
How can Zhouzhou compare with me?

500
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,570
Before kindergarten,

501
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,380
three of us have been together.

502
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,140
I thought we would go to college together,

503
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,140
and work together,

504
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,980
and live in the same neighborhood,

505
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,050
so we can often hang out together.

506
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
What did he do?

507
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,980
Just walked away and left us.

508
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,810
Does he regard me as his friend?

509
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:21,980
That's right.

510
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,380
It would be better if it could rain a little bit.

511
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,450
What?

512
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,500
What did you say?

513
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,620
Everything will be fine.

514
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,690
Zhouzhou.

515
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,540
Why are you here?

516
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
I have something to tell you.

517
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,930
Say it.

518
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,930
Actually...

519
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,500
I'm transferring to another school.

520
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:56,450
I knew.

521
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,140
You knew?

522
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,130
Almost the whole school knows,

523
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,410
how could I not know?

524
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,260
I didn't hide it from you on purpose.

525
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,140
I wasn't blaming you.

526
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:08,860
I'm sorry!

527
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,740
Lin Yang, can you stop saying that?

528
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,500
I don't blame you anymore.

529
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,450
If you transfer schools

530
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,440
or even drop out,

531
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,050
it's to get my forgiveness.

532
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,260
Fine.

533
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,140
I can tell you right now,

534
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,290
that I've already forgiven you.

535
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,170
You don't have to keep doing this to remind me.

536
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,130
Zhouzhou, I didn't mean that.

537
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,260
It's not your fault.

538
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,900
I'm only blaming myself.

539
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,740
If what I said then

540
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,780
hurt you,

541
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,210
I apologize.

542
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,410
Zhouzhou, don't go.

543
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,380
Zhouzhou!

544
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,660
Listen to me! Listen to me!

545
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,530
Stop being so childish!

546
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,050
I can't do it.

547
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
I can't do it anymore.

548
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,290
It's just a farewell game. You don't have to...

549
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,410
How is the Affiliated High School? Isn't it good?

550
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,130
Did they get you cheerleaders?

551
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,540
Anyone prettier than my Qianqian?

552
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,200
Well, you don't...

553
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,850
don't have to answer it.

554
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,980
If you say yes, I won't believe that.

555
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,330
Aren't you not leaving?

556
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,090
Why?

557
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,980
Since there's the news you're leaving,

558
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,620
the relationship between Qianqian and I

559
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,450
has flowered by leaps and bounds.

560
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,050
You don't have to worry about it.

561
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,140
Why?

562
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,570
Didn't Yu Zhouzhou ask you to stay?

563
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,410
Jiang Chuan,

564
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,740
Zhouzhou and I are over.

565
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,000
[Whoever tears it is a dog]

566
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,330
Zhouzhou,

567
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,660
let's go watch the game.

568
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,090
I'm not going.

569
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:48,980
Why?

570
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,980
Did you two fight?

571
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,050
There are plenty of handsome guys on the court.

572
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,620
Lin Yang is not the only one.

573
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,260
It's not like that.

574
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,410
I'm really not going. You should go.

575
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,090
That's a very scary smile.

576
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,090
Whatever.

577
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,020
I'm off.

578
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:04,740
Okay.

579
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,170
Xin Rui,

580
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,620
let's go to watch some handsome boys.

581
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:09,860
I...

582
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,410
Let's go.

583
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,500
Wait up. I'll go with you.

584
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,320
Lin Yang!

585
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,810
What are you thinking about?

Sir, grill 10 sticks of tendons.

588
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,090
Do you have chicken kebabs?

589
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,210
Can't you read?

590
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,500
What?

591
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,170
What kind of BBQ stall is this?

592
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,900
You grill one thing in a day?

593
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,860
It's the spirit of the craftsman.

594
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,620
You haven't heard about it?

595
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,170
You won't understand even if I explain.

596
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,140
Huh?

597
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,330
If you don't eat, then go away. Don't take up space!

598
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,040
Fine. Fine.

599
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,780
Then give me 2 sticks. 2 sticks.

600
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,410
Xu Yanliang,

601
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,020
I want 2 sticks, too.

602
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,380
Aren't you watching the basketball game

603
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,810
between Class 1 and Class 2?

604
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,330
There are too many people. I can't get in.

Go! Go! Go!

611
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,570
Who are we cheering for?

612
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,210
Normally,

613
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,860
we should cheer for Lin Yang.

614
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,780
Since Yu Zhouzhou's not here,

615
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,380
we don't have to do so.

616
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,740
Look,

it's Class Monitor Ling.

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,540
Why is she here?

619
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,090
Who do you think she is looking at?

620
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,050
I don't know.

621
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,370
Let's cheer for Lin Yang.

622

Are you all right?

634
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:17,900
I'm OK.

635
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,290
Do your best for the second half.

636

Come on!

OK.

Do you know how to play?

648
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,540
Come on. There's a fight on the basketball court.

649

00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,290
Come over!

654
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,570
Stop fighting!

655
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:03,900
Did you get hurt?

656
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,330
Jiang Chuan! Lin Yang!

657
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,020
Stop fighting!

658
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,690
Come over here!

659

Come over here!

660
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:14,340
They started fighting?

661
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,580
Even girls of Class 3 got involved?

662
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,580
What does the Class 1 and Class 2's basketball game

663

have to do with Class 3's girls?

664
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,690
I'll be right back.

665
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,210
OK. Bye.

666
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,650
Sir...

667
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,370
Take off your uniform.

668
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,020
Why?

669
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,690
Take it off!

670
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,260
Why?

671
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,929
Get the skewers by yourself.

672
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:36,489
It's been cooked too...

673
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,170
Eat up! Don't leave until you eat them up!

674
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:42,850

675

Stop fighting!

681

Why did you take me here?

682
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,020
You've already missed half period.

683
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,980
You might as well miss it all.

684
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,300
Why?

685
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,120
I'm sorry.

686
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,340
You said that yesterday.

687
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,370
I'm sorry for what happened yesterday.

688
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,250
I was too emotional yesterday.

689
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,580
But I really don't blame you anymore.

690
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,130
Do you really mean it?

691
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,580
I've already got enough.

692
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,450
I'm very satisfied. Thank you.

693
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,340
Yu Zhouzhou,

694
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,060
I'm not leaving.

695
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,410
Ah...

696
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:01,930
Yu Zhouzhou,

697
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,820
you are a liar.

698
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,740
What did I lie to you?

699
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,290
Do you remember, when we graduated from elementary school,

700
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,600
I asked you if you could go to the Affiliated School,

701
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,780
and you said you could?

702
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,020
I seemed to have said that.

703
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,260
Then,

704
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,450
I spent the whole holiday looking forward to it,

705
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,580
and even prayed that we would be in the same class in the middle school.

706
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,340
When I was traveling in Europe

707
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,100
and saw anything that we couldn't get at home,

708
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,410
I wanted to buy for you.

709
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,580
When the new term began,

710
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,300
I spent all day on the name list at the school entrance

711
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,130
looking for your name.

712
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,580
I didn't find it after everyone else had left.

713
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,740
I'm sorry. I said that then,

714
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,780
because I didn't want to disappoint you.

715
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,170
It was the same in kindergarten.

716
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,100
You said you would come the next day,

717
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,980
but you didn't.

718
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,340
I've explained that to you.

719
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,330
So, Yu Zhouzhou,

720
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,340
I don't believe that you have forgiven me.

721
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,540
If I'm doomed to bring bad luck to you,

722
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,260
I'd like to keep following you,

723
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,580
until I give you back

724
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,850
all the happiness that were taken away from you.

725
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,740
It looks better.

726
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,300
Your dad drank so much alcohol for this,

727
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,610
but you are not transferring.

728
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,780
Aren't you afraid that the Director Hao of the Affiliated High school bans you?

729
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,820
It's not my concern now.

730
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,500
If I were your mom, I would force you to transfer.

731
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,260
As long as I play up to her, it'll surely be fine.

732
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,610
You're such a scourge.

733
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,690
Let me be Yu Zhouzhou's scourge for a lifetime.

734
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,820
How dirty!

735
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,980
Where did you get the uniform?

736
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,340
To be honest,

737
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,820
it looks better on you than that of vocational school.

738
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,580
Lin Yang, are you a real man?

739
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,580
Don't you know that every word carries weight?

740
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,580
Don't you know that a promise should be kept?

741
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:05,850
I'm sorry.

742
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,020
A real man knows when to yield and when not.

743
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,340
I don't wanna go out of sudden.

744
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,170
Fine.

745
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,500
By the way,

746
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,020
I've made up with Zhouzhou.

747
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,100
All right.

748
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,820
We probably will often meet.

749
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,370
Let's get along.

750
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,890
Get along with you? Okay,

751
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,690
but you must promise me something.

752
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,100
What is it?

753
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,340
From now on,

754
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,980
let's take Zhen Hua High School as the boundary,

755
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,300
inside the school she's under your umbrella,

756
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,300
outside she's under my protection.

757
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,060
If Zhouzhou gets a little bit bullied...

758
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,930
Then what?

759
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,050
Hand over the territory.

760
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,100
Deal!

761
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,440
A word spoken

762
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,780
is an arrow let fly.

763
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,930
I'll never let Zhouzhou be wronged.

764
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,450
I hope you won't.

765
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,170
Bro,

766
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:06,980
only 2 strings left.

767
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,260
Eat up!

768
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,100
I can't eat anymore.

769
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,260
Then just eat!

770
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,400
Eat up, or you can't leave.
