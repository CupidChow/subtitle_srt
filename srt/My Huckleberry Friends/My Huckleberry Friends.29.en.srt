00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,059
No. I had my lunc downstairs

173
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,770
With your colleague?

174
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,690
It was Lin Yang on the phone.

175
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,010
RIght. No wonder he got back from US.

176
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,210
It turns out Yu Zhouzhou is back.

177
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,330
Zhouzhou is back?

178
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,330
Yeah.

179
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,810
Isn't Lin Yang an idiot?

180
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,380
He suffered so many years.

181
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,770
I mean, Can't he focus on his life?

182
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,170
If something doesn't have a  result,

183
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,090
it does make you preoccupied.

184
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,890
Yeah. Good thing that we have a result.

185
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,980
Lucky thing.

186
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,820
Darling, did you want to see a film yesterday?

187
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,380
Here. Which one? I'll book tickets.

188
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,300
Which one do you want to see?

189
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,300
Me. I want to watch sci-fi movies for sure.

190
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,080
But, my love likes artistic ones.

191
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,330
Let's see Little Love Letter.

192
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,060
I heard the director is quite nice.

193
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,060
See the one you like.

194
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,210
Darling, what's the matter?

195
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,500
What matter?

196
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,170
You don't sound like usual.

197
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,060
You usually... Why are you so obedient today?

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,180
Darling, darling.

199
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,930
I've got good news and bad news.

200
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:51,980
Which one do you want to hear?

201
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,650
Bad news.

202
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,980
Bad one. The bad news is 
 I didn't attend to the interview.

203
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,650
You don't like the company?

204
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,620
No. The enemy is pushing up to the high ground.

205
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,940
I was defensing the tower. So I didn't go.

206
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,500
But, the good news is I kept the tower.

207
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,210
Never mind. Wait for the next chance.

208
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,300
Weird. Darling there must be something wiht you.

209
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,200
You would've been worried normally.

210
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,210
You'd say childish as Lin Yang to stay at home.

211
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,890
Disregard your feelings.

212
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,500
How come you say nothing today?

213
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,810
JIang Chuan, could you stop being like this?

214
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,980
Then what do you want from me? Darling.

215
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,130
What do you want me to do? Tell me.

216
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,740
Just tell me.

217
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,180
Jiang Chuan, get off my back.

218
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,650
Everytime I don't talk you'd think I'm unhappy.

219
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,330
Once my mind wanders, you'd consider something goes wrong.

220
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,560
Jiang Chuan, I am absolutely fine.

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,320
I just feel oppressed.

222
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,970
I couldn't breathe.

223
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,210
Leave me alone,will you?

224
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,010
I'm just caring about you, darling.

225
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,740
If you don't want to see movies.

226
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,060
How about we have a walk on the street?

227
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,940
Get relaxed.

228
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:58,620
Are you under too much pressure today?

229
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,520
Jiang Chuan, damn it.

230
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,860
I've told you so many things.

231
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,130
Did you listen to me or not?

232
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:04,980
I did.

233
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,060
Hmm.

234
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,090
I said nothing just now.

235
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,010
Thanks.

236
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,980
I had a meeting this morning. So I'm late.

237
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,530
It doesn't matter. I almost finish.

238
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,980
You work overtime last night?

239
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,890
Is that obvious? Do I have shadows?

240
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,530
No. You just yawned a few times.

241
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,530
Like you feel sleepy.

242
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,770
It shoudl be I didn't sleep well last night.

243
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,620
Hold on.

244
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,620
I come to look for this book.

245
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,940
Let's just look at this camera lens.

246
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,690
I'll say three two one, then it begins. OK?

247
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,130
You are the little princess in my heart.

248
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,180
Smart, pretty, excellent

249
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,980
The sea is broad, the sky is high.

250
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,930
Nothing can hold me back.

251
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,420
Dummy

252
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,740
Do you accept a gift from dummy?

253
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,860
Can I borrow a bit energy from

254
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,330
our radiant Mr. Chu Tiankuo?

255
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,260
Thank you.

256
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,300
I intent to take a good rest this noon.

257
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,210
Didn't expect that I made you embarassed again.

258
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,210
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,180
Nothing.

260
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,940
I lost a program in the meeting this morning.

261
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,130
What's wrong?

262
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,690
I'v prepare the program for nearly two months.

263
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,060
Another colleague convinced

264
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,450
a larger company,

265
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,330
and took the program.

266
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,500
It'll be alright.

267
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,570
Sometimes I recall the memory of senior high.

268
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,500
Thought I can't remember what's the exact thing.

269
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,650
I just have a vague feeling.

270
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,650
What feeling?

271
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,090
I feel it was happier than right now.

272
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,210
At that time. countless people 
 regarded us as up-and-coming.

273
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,890
So many possibilities of the future.

274
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,570
Now I know that

275
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,180
no matter how many choices there are.

276
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,690
You can only choose one of them.

277
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,650
No matter how many people envy us,

278
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,330
we are just ordinary people.

279
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,690
Isn't ordinary good?

280
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,380
Doing ordinary petty things,

281
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,820
eating food processed by convenience store

282
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,010
and work overtime till no one left in the company.

283
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,060
The following day, you repeat the same ordinary petty things.

284
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,930
Are you satisfied?

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,770
I used to think being ordinary is easy thing to do.

286
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,570
But now I find that

287
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,210
it takes many efforts

288
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,770
to be an ordinary person.

289
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,180
Get into an ordinary university.

290
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,210
Find an ordinary job.

291
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,260
Build an ordinary family.

292
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,860
All of these need efforts.

293
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,060
I just want to be like before.

294
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,010
I like the feeling of seeing achievements

295
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,420
after making efforts.

296
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,210
Not compete with a bunch of people

297
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,530
with countless extra conditions.

298
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,770
Can't win the game no matter how.

299
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,450
You're doing great just like this.

300
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,490
Do you remeber that Mr. Zhang Feng

301
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,570
often mentioned the example of 
 Edison inventing the filament?

302
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,530
Edison failed a thousand times.

303
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,520
He eventually found the material for filament.

304
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,060
At that time I thought how important to work hard.

305
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,380
A thousand times of efforts to finally succeed.

306
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,850
We were too naive at that time.

307
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,330
Thought choosing a goal

308
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,420
and a thousnd times of efforts will succeed.

309
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,860
Now I know, success is to make efforts to choose the right one.

310
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,940
Now, isn't choice a thousand times important

311
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,570
than making efforts?

312
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,380
Your colleague?

313
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,940
Daughter of my boss. Kind of colleague.

314
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,450
Girlfriend?

315
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,010
Sort of.

316
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,210
Tiankuo !

317
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,620
Then I'm leaving.

318
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,940
See you next time.

319
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:12,940
JIang Chuan.

320
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,260
Jiang Chuan.

321
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:21,970
Jiang Chuan.

322
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,380
Hey, Lin Yang.

323
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,760
Zhouzhou?

324
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,060
Is Jiang Chuan with you?

325
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,620
Nothing. He's not home.

326
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,410
His phone is off.

327
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,260
I'm a bit worried about him.

328
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,569
No, nothing, We're fine. We didn't have a row.

329
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,140
You're back.

330
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,170
Why didn't you tell me you came back?

331
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,329
I thought you would stay at US.

332
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,410
You don't have to ask Lin Yang. 
 I'll ask some other friends.

333
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,540
Let's have a dinner some time.

334
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,079
OK, Bye !

335
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:53,260
[Jiang Chuan:  Let's go to the movies tonight. Wait for me, baby.]

336
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:00,690
[Jiang Chuan, it's time for us to say goodbye.]

337
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,330
Honey.

338
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,380
Honey.

339
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,330
I am back.

340
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,660
Where have you been?

341
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,020
I went for an interview.

342
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,380
A very good company came to me today,

343
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,410
and they are very interested in me.

344
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,930
Why did you turn off your phone?

345
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,770
Because of the interview.

346
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,200
The company gave me an internal test number.

347
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,660
Then the phone ran out of battery.

348
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,170
Did the interview go well?

349
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,290
Of course it went well. I'm very good at it.

350
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,980
The company asked me to start tomorrow.

351
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,690
They hire me as a project manager.

352
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,900
Really?

353
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,570
Of course.

354
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,050
To celebrate my job,

355
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,930
I bought your favorite Japanese food.

356
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,860
By the way, can I use your mobile phone?

357
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,860
I need to send a WeChat message to Lin Yang.

358
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,740
And tell him I'm home.

359
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,500
Go get the phone by yourself.

360
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,620
Qianqian, I have something to tell you.

361
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,500
I also have something to tell you.

362
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,410
Let me go first.

363
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,260
Let me talk about it first.

364
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,170
I'll just say one word.

365
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:19,980
Me too.

366
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,050
I know what you're going to say.

367
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:21,740
You don't know.

368
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,620
Let me talk first, Qianqian.

369
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,410
I don't want to hear it.

370
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,500
Look at the WeChat message.

371
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,330
Let's eat sushi first.

372
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,500
I told you to read WeChat message first.

373
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,570
The sushi I bought for you

374
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,740
is your favorite.

375
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,090
And I asked for a few more mustard.

376
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,810
Jiang Chuan,

377
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,570
You've been calling me "wife" for years.

378
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,660
Do you seriously think we will get married?

379
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,740
Of course.

380
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,980
But I'm losing faith in our relationship.

381
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,170
I don't know

382
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,980
why every time I talk to you about getting married,

383
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,050
you always run away from me.

384
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,140
If you agree to break up today,

385
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,540
that's fine with me.

386
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,690
Qianqian,

387
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,860
today...

388
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,560
Today is your last day

389
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,660
to be my girlfriend.

390
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,900
After eating this sushi,

391
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,900
our relationship

392
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,900
is over.

393
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,500
It's the ring!

394
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,380
Jiang Chuan, you...

395
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,660
Who would anyone put a ring in a sushi?

396
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,140
I know you love sushi.

397
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,780
I knew it. You didn't know what I was trying to say.

398
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,170
Excited or surprised?

399
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,160
Ling Xiangqian,

400
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,450
marry me.

401
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,930
Qianqian, can you tie it for me?

402
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,780
I really don't want to go to school.

403
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,250
If only the summer vacation would always be like this.

404
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,450
Please support Ling Xiangqian, the goddess of Class Three.

405
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,690
She is beautiful. A good singer and she loves to give.

406
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,650
Be sure to support her.

407
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,450
Jiang Chuan, how dare you...

408
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,260
Even if I pretend like this, you can always recognize me.

409
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,210
Are you disappointed?

410
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,930
Because it's not ChuTiankuo

411
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,740
or Lin Yang looking for you?

412
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:06,860
You are so annoying.

413
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,450
You see, I know you better than they do.

414
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,740
Jiang Chuan, how dare you...

415
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,260
You play around all day,

416
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,380
why don't you think about your future?

417
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,090
I am already fighting for my future.

418
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,900
What is your future?

419
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:20,930
Ling Xiangqian!

420
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,780
What I said just now is my future.

421
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,620
Jiang Chuan, you won't leave me, will you?

422
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,930
Of course not.

423
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,450
Because I think

424
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,130
you are the best girl in the world.

425
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,570
Do you agree to marry me?

426
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,260
You acted quite realistically.

427
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,540
You promise to marry me first.

428
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,620
Why don't you read WeChat message?

429
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,090
I know what you want to send.

430
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,930
What I said before was “Jiang Chuan, it's time for us to say goodbye..."

431
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,130
What you sent was "Jiang Chuan,  it's time for us to say goodbye..."

432
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,090
with a comma and the second half.

433
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,810
We have been together for 25 years,

434
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,810
and I don't believe you can break up with me in seven words.

435
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,050
Jiang Chuan, you..

436
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,410
Honey, don't regret it.

437
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,660
Let me help you put on the ring.

438
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,450
Oh, no. Don't...

439
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,210
There is still mustard on the ring.

440
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,130
Darling.

441
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,930
Put on the ring. Oh, no. Don't...

442
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:29,890
Honey.

443
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,570
[Qianqian: Jiang Chuan,  it's time for us to say goodbye.]

444
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,170
-Put it on quickly. -No, I don't want to.

445
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,340
[If you don't propose to me tonight.]

446
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,410
Actually, I've already had dinner.

447
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,050
Were you with the woman who was with you last time?

448
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,540
We are high school classmates.

449
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,410
She works around here.

450
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,690
Is she your ex-girlfriend?

451
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,450
I'm right.

452
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,050
No.

453
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,450
It's all in your head.

454
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,020
We are just classmates.

455
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,740
It's impossible.

456
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,450
I saw the way she looked at you last time.

457
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,450
It was strange.

458
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,500
You must had a relationship.

459
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,170
Like I said, we are just classmates.

460
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,690
How do you want me to explain to you?

461
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,090
You are rude to me.

462
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,900
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

463
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,020
I don't care.

464
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,410
Tell me something about your past.

465
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,930
In high school,

466
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,570
we ran for the president of the student association together.

467
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,780
We participated in the selection of school ambassador together.

468
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,450
You pick the point.

469
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,500
Once the dean of our school invited the parents to the school.

470
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,620
We were punished.

471
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,380
You've been punished,

472
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,440
and you still won't admit that she was your first girlfriend?

473
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,530
She didn't admit it.

474
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,260
We used to

475
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,260
talk a lot and do a lot of things,

476
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,380
but I don't remember now.

477
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,780
But

478
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,090
I remember her answer clearly.

479
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,260
I was not admitted as her boyfriend.

480
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,620
It cannot be changed forever.

481
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,490
Look, they have new dishes!

482
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,020
I want three sea urchins.

483
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,260
Let's order sea urchin sushi first.

484
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,080
Then order another one with sea urchins and steamed eggs.

485
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,210
The steamed eggs with sea urchins!

486
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,810
And the sea urchin fried rice.

487
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:39,540
Oh, right.

488
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,890
What did you just say?

489
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,020
Nothing.

490
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,260
You order first.

491
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,450
After we finished dinner, I have to go back to work.

492
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,140
I'm going to call my dad.

493
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,330
Why does he always make you work late?

494
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,680
Your time is for me.

495
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:52,980
There is no need to do that.

496
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,200
I'm not in charge of that project anymore,

497
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,380
so I won't be so busy in the future.

498
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,450
What's going on?

499
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,980
Why didn't you manage the project?

500
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,740
Haven't you been preparing for two months?

501
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,620
Don't worry about work.

502
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,620
Your dad knows what he wants.

503
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,620
No. I have to call now.

504
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,160
Is he bullying you?

505
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,810
If he bullies you, it is the same as bullying me.

506

except being a soldier and surfing the Internet.

00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,380
I caught up with the e-sports craze after I left the army.

558
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,210
Well, I grouped an e-sports team.

Over the years,

none of those fomer classmates have contacted me.

577

Since you changed your number in the first year of university,

00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,580
When the wallpaper fell off, I was reluctant to decorate it.

675
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,130
Now is off-season.

676
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,130
Everyday I'm worried that whether I'll starve to death next month.

677
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,650
I can put my webmaster and team members

678
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,130
in your company to keep up appearances.

679
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,640
My mom is not easygoing.

680
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,020
Maybe she'll be better when she's older.

681
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,740
But, when she gets her daughter married,

682
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,210
she may demand a lot of money.

683
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,650
It's OK.

684
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,400
I have learned how to make pancakes from my mom.

685
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,650
I can set up a pancake stand in the Cyber cafe. It's not a big deal.

686
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,410
I'll make every effort to redeem you.

687
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,650
Oh no, not redeem, not redeem. It is save.

688
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:40,930
Neither. Neither.

689
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,060
Neither. It is...

690
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,170
You must save me.

691
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,130
Get me out of my previous life.

692
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,170
You don't want to be those superior people?

693
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,820
The cruelest thing in the world

694
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,840
is not that you try so hard to be someone else, but you can't.

695
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,980
It is when you want to be yourself,

696
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,060
and you find yourself beyond recognition.

697
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,740
It doesn't matter.

698
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,210
The Xin Rui I want is always in my heart.

699
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,340
Hello, Zhouzhou?

700
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,210
You came back?

701
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,610
OK. I'll pick you up.
