4
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,610
Hello,

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,580
Zhouzhou.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,500
Hello, aunt.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,850
When you hang out with your classmates,

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,570
you must pay attention to safety.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,980
Okay, I know.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,060
And,

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,180
you're not back until 12 o'clock,

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,340
will it be too late

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,450
to be safe?

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,820
I'll ask your uncle to pick you up later, okay?

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,890
Don't bother, my classmate will send me back.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,380
Here my classmate comes, I'd better go now.

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,410
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,020
Merry Christmas!

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,220
You came all the way,

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,340
just to give me this?

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,770
Right,

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,660
I heard them say that

23
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,890
one must eat apples on Christmas Eve,

24
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,410
or they will have bad luck next year.

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,130
Then let's go halves.

26
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,090
No,

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:02,980
I've already eaten one,

28
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,340
this is especially for you.

29
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,140
Well, thanks.

30
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,170
By the way,

31
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,610
hope it's not too late,

32
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:11,100
Merry Christmas!

33
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,210
Fine, fine,

34
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,530
as long as you are happy, I will be happy.

[Texting. Recipients: Chen An. OK, I'll wait for you.]

Zhouzhou,

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,850
who are you meeting tonight?

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,530
A guy I like.

[Episode 12 Just want to be with you at 0.00 am.]

42
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:57,979
Tonight I seem to see

43
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,520
Zhouzhou walking with

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,610
a girl from their class.

45
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,250
I have asked Mi Qiao,

46
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,480
and she said she was not with Zhouzhou.

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,380
Not Mi Qiao.

48
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,570
It's the one

49
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,419
who wears her hair in pigtails.

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,370
It's the one

51
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,980
whose eyes are full of that

52
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,220
tired, gloomy, lonely, cold

53
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,860
and green light.

54
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,420
Are you talking about Xin Rui?

55
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,700
Yes, yes, it's her!

56
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,210
How can you describe a classmate like that?

57
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,700
But you guessed it right away, didn't you?

58
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,700
It's Zhouzhou.

59
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,450
Hello, Zhouzhou,

60
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,140
I'm already waiting for you.

61
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,860
Didn’t we plan it yesterday?

62
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,420
Where are you going tonight?

63
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,420
Let me go with you.

64
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,300
It's okay, it doesn't matter how late it is.

65
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,880
Still not working, is it?

66
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,170
Okay, then.

67
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,060
Zhouzhou said that she was going to meet

68
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,140
a very important friend tonight,

69
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,700
so she couldn't come.

70
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,700
It's okay,

71
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,170
when I confess my love to Ling Xiangqian tonight,

72
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,000
you can set off fireworks next to us,

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,140
so that you won't be bored.

74
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,140
But Zhouzhou

75
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,650
has no friends I don't know.

76
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,160
Can't you let her have secrets?

77
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,980
What?

78
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,090
Qianqian,

79
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,220
come out to play.

80
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,650
No.

81
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,090
We're all together,

82
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,579
Zhouzhou and Lin Yang are both here.

83
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,250
I really don't want to go.

84
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,340
You said that Chu Tiankuo would come.

85
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,080
They said they had called Chu Tiankuo,

86
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,340
and he seems to be coming soon.

87
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,810
Really?

88
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,450
Of course!

89
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,220
So where are you guys?

90
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,769
We are in...

91
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,580
Zhouzhou,

92
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,800
I think

93
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,530
you should reconsider this matter.

94
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,420
Consider what?

95
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,770
How can you like him?

96
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,420
That guy, I dislike him on sight.

97
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,140
You dislike that guy on sight?

98
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,650
He is like chewing gum,

99
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,930
once you are stained, you can not get rid of it.

100
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,740
Other than that, he laughs heartlessly every day,

101
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,050
and I want to punch him when I see him.

102
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,930
Did you say Lin Yang?

103
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,650
Yeah,

104
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,300
isn't it him?

105
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,300
Well, I know your taste will not be...

106
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,330
Wait, who is he?

107
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,370
You may not know him,

108
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,300
and he is a person I admire very much,

109
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,210
so the like I'm talking about may mean admiration.

110
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,170
But how can I...

111
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,810
Hello, Mi Qiao, what's the matter?

112
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,050
Hey, hep me!

113
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,050
I'm in the hospital now.

114
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,490
-What? 
 -Just come.

115
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,370
What? Why are you in...

116
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,210
All right,

117
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,460
I'll come right away,

118
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,130
and wait for me.

119
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,490
What happened to Mi Qiao?

120
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,200
Mi Qiao,

121
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,620
and she,

122
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,700
she had a toothache while eating,

123
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,140
and then went to the hospital to get her teeth filled,

124
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,090
but her wallet was left in the taxi,

125
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,330
and she found it only after the filling,

126
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,210
so

127
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,490
she called me

128
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,700
and asked me to come over and pay for her.

129
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,580
Don't fool me,

130
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,020
she only talked to you for five seconds,

131
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,530
and you told me it for half a minute.

132
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,250
You know that, I'm not good at expressing myself,

133
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,090
let me tell you again quickly.

134
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,370
Hello, Benben,

135
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,580
I just had a toothache

136
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,170
while eating,

137
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,900
and then I went to the hospital to fill my teeth,

138
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,300
but I found my wallet left in the taxi,

139
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,180
you just come and pay for me.

140
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,650
Look, it's exactly five seconds.

141
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,490
Then let me go with you.

142
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,460
No no,

143
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,620
I'll be fine on my own.

144
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,580
You just go to celebrate the festival with your idol,

145
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,300
and I will call you if something happens.

146
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,740
Well,

147
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,210
be careful on the way.

148
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,810
Okay okay.

149
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,140
So weird.

150
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,330
Excuse me, which ward is Mi Qiao in?

151
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,420
Wait a minute.

152
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,180
Did you ride your bike?

153
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,580
No.

154
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,210
Well, it's okay to take a taxi.

155
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,930
What's the emergency?

156
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,330
Today Eason Chan will perform in the square,

157
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,700
if I don't go now, I won't have a seat.

158
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,900
Then why did you call me?

159
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,420
My dad is buying food downstairs.

160
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,650
How can I escape by myself?

161
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,580
So I have to ask you for help.

162
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,180
Wait,

163
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,250
how many IV bottles do you have left?

164
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,370
Three.

165
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,140
What are you doing?

166
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,740
What's going on?

167
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,050
Mom, I'm going out for a while.

168
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,860
Where are you going?

169
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,300
Jiang Chuan and Lin Yang called me out.

170
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,080
So when will you be back?

171
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,770
It may be late,

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,180
Christmas is after a few hours

343
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,530
I want to be the first to wish you a merry Christmas

344
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,770
Okay

345
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,530
Turn around

346
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:57,940
Why?

347
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:58,890
I want to give you a present

348
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,380
made by myself

349
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,090
Go to see a meteor shower with me!

350
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,180
No news has suggested that there will be a meteor shower tonight

351
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,890
How do you know that?

352
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,740
It's said by Lin Yang's father

353
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,330
As you know,

354
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,650
Lin Yang's father has a colleague

355
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,770
who is interested in astronomy

356
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,620
It's he that told Lin Yang's father

357
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,260
Then Lin Yang's father told Lin Yang,

358
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,500
and Lin Yang told me.

359
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,450
I don't think the meteor shower will show at this bad place

360
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,180
It will

361
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,650
Believe me

362
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,260
I don't believe you at all

363
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,530
I give you my word

364
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,650
You will be greatly surprised tonight,

365
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,450
and won't be regretful.

366
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,210
Is the meteor shower at 11 pm?

367
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,620
Yes

368
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,210
Jiang Chuan?

369
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,180
Don't call him

370
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,570
Why?

371
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,130
Didn't he agree to

372
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,530
see the meteor shower together?

373
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,650
Jiang Chuan is going to express his love to Ling Xiangqian tonight

374
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,260
We'd better not disturb them

375
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,569
Sir

376
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:08,930
How much is it?

377
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:10,050
Thirty five yuan

378
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,540
It was thirty yuan yesterday

379
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,500
Today is a festival

380
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,290
The price goes up

381
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,020
How can you do business in this way?

382
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,859
Raising the price according to your own wish

383
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,170
I can file a complaint against you

384
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,410
At this festival,

385
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,020
apples are sold at this price everywhere

386
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,450
If you are willing to wait,

387
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,380
you can wait until midnight.

388
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,980
The price will fall after the festival

389
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,170
Qianqian!

390
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,570
Are you up here?

391
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm coming

392
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:42,930
Wait a moment

393
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,020
Qianqian

394
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,330
What an awful place！

395
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,250
It's even difficult to find a bathroom

396
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,680
Jiang Chuan, I'm warning you.

397
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,560
If I can't see the meteor shower tonight,

398
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,290
you will be badly punished.

399
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,210
Your satisfaction is guaranteed

400
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,500
Come here

401
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,610
Take a seat

402
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,810
I have cleaned it for you

403
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,330
It's really stupid in this way

404
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,380
You're awake

405
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,620
An infusion bottle is already empty.

406
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,620
I'm hungry

407
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,090
What do you want to eat?

408
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,900
I guess I've got my comeuppance

409
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,690
I only want to eat kebabs of your stall now

410
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,570
Let's go right now

411
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,900
No

412
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,980
You still have another bottle of intravenous drip

413
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,810
But I'm starving

414
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,740
I want to eat kebabs

415
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,500
Many kinds of kebabs

416
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,050
And you also want to go to the concert, right?

417
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,330
Can I?

418
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,500
Do you have the ticket?

419
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,570
No

420
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,020
But there will be people selling scalped tickets

421
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,140
Come on

422
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,410
With your skinny body,

423
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,450
you're likely to be crushed

424
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,540
when you push your way through the crowd.

425
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,290
I'm really hungry

426
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,450
Hamburgers are sold downstairs

427
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:18,980
Do you like to have one?

428
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,570
Make a choice

429
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,140
Yes

430
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,250
Wait for me

431
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,210
This is really beautiful

432
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,160
Do you like it?

433
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,450
How much is the apple,

434
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,210
sir?

435
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,210
Forty five yuan

436
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,620
Okay, please pack it for me.

437
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:38,690
No problem!

438
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:43,900
Thank you

439
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,690
You're welcome

440
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,500
Goodbye

441
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,450
We two just do nothing but wait here?

442
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,290
Just a minute

443
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,860
It will come in a moment

444
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,050
Lin Yang

445
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,260
Don't move, Zhouzhou

446
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,290
The meteor shower

447
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,500
is not likely to show tonight

448
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,170
Wait a minute

449
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,140
It will come very soon

450
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,690
What're you doing?

451
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,740
Don't come over!

452
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:39,570
Zhouzhou

453
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,780
I want you to know...

454
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,930
It's stuck

455
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,660
There's no big problem

456
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,210
Wait a moment

457
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,930
I can help you

458
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,090
I should do this by myself

459
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,260
It doesn't matter

460
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,380
If Jiang Chuan succeeds,

461
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,450
I will also be very happy.

462
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,620
But Ling Xiangqian has fallen in love with someone else

463
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,330
Do he have to tell her tonight?

464
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,650
Zhouzhou

465
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,540
This is prepared for you

466
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,170
Lin Yang

467
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,740
I've forgiven you

468
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,810
You don't need to do things like this anymore

469
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,530
Let's go back to the previous relationship

470
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,390
[McDonald's]

471
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,210
You're really fast

472
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,810
I should have let you bring some kebabs

473
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,410
You can eat kebabs when you recover

474
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,570
Well

475
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,930
I don't think there will be a day when I recover

476
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:44,860
What're you talking about

477
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:48,900
Don't move

478
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,780
Let's go tomorrow

479
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,380
Everything is put off to later,

480
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,540
but who knows if I can wait until that time

481
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,900
How come you always say ominous words

482
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,740
I hate it when people say words like

483
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,380
next time, another day and later

484
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,570
If there is something to do,

485
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,050
why not go to do it

486
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:04,980
right away?

487
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,810
Don't try to coax me into taking you to see Eason Chan

488
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,140
You're not stupid

489
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,770
When you get well again,

490
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:12,930
I will take you to eat

491
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,080
various kinds of kebabs.

492
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,660
Okay?

493
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:16,980
Well

494
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,090
Did you just worry that I would run away?

495
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,620
No

496
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,620
I haven't thought about it at all

497
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,410
Having run so fast, you're sweating on your head.

498
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,690
It's too hot in the room

499
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,620
Don't worry

500
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,450
I will definitely keep my word

501
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,660
Okay

502
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,210
Let's go back to the normal relationship

503
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,780
I'm leaving, then

504
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,330
Zhouzhou

505
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,730
That's not what I mean

506
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,210
It's too stupid. I need to go.

507
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,170
Just a minute!

508
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,660
It's here!

509
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,370
That's what you call the meteor shower?

510
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,170
No

511
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,810
Please wait one more minute

512
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,810
Just a minute

513
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,690
Jiang Chuan, I've had enough of you!

514
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,530
Qianqian

515
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,280
Qianqian!

516
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,500
What the hell. Jiang Chuan may have put the fireworks upside down

517
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,900
Be careful

518
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,530
Let's go

519
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
Zhouzhou, are you okay?

520
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,540
Did you get any bruises?

521
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,170
I'm fine

522
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,410
This is what you call the artificial meteor shower?

523
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,860
That is not what I have imagined

524
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,740
It's an accident caused by a lack of experience

525
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,210
That's okay

526
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,660
It's beautiful anyway

527
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,570
Zhouzhou

528
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,620
I have decided

529
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,620
I have to tell you something

530
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:24,980
I...

531
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,610
What're you doing?

532
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,860
You are too reckless!

533
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,440
If we hadn't found out in time,

534
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,530
the whole warehouse would have been lit by you.

535
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,380
What are you waiting for?

536
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,050
Call your family members right now!

537
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,140
You want us to make the call

538
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,290
or you make it by yourselves?

539
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,540
Uncle

540
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
Forget it, okay?

541
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,740
Hurry up

542
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,690
or else we will call the police

543
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,980
Considering you're still minors

544
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,900
or we would directly sue you

545
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,740
for vandalism,

546
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,380
and let the police take you into prison

547
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,020
You don't want to call?

548
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,260
You must be students of Zhen Hua High School

549
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,860
Go to contact their school

550
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,900
We're not!

551
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,290
Such a good school

552
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,250
doesn't have students like us

553
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,260
who violate the law and discipline

554
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,860
We're not from Zhen Hua High School

555
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,170
Really

556
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,290
Just go

557
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:12,500
Okay

558
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,610
Uncle!

559
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,140
I'm not that old!

560
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:15,920
That's not what I mean

561
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,570
Since we were young, teachers have told us

562
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,980
that people in uniform are very nice

563
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,210
We've made a lot of effort to attend Zhen Hua High School

564
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,500
You don't want us

565
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,450
to be expelled from school, right?

566
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,290
Then call your parents at once

567
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,570
Let them come

568
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,170
to pay compensation

569
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,810
This is all I have

570
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,090
This is mine

571
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,130
Such a little money

572
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,980
A total of more than one hundred yuan

573
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,050
I see

574
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,140
Uncle!

575
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,170
Uncle!

576
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:46,570
No! Don't!

577
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,020
Something is wrong with me

578
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,860
I'm not feeling good

579
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,380
Let him drink some water

580
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,410
I'm sick

581
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,330
They went away

582
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,250
I feel ill

583
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,330
Lin Yang

584
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:05,930
Really

585
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,860
Qianqian, Qianqian!

586
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,500
How about going to see fireworks?

587
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,570
Don't follow me, okay?

588
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,780
Sir

589
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,610
Sell it to me!

590
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,900
I've called one of your family members

591
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,380
He said he would come very soon

592
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,380
Just call my parents

593
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,380
You thought I didn't want to call?

594
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,890
If your phone was not out of battery,

595
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,140
your parents should also come!

596
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,930
You two really need to be educated

597
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:57,780
by your family members

598
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,140
You not only damage public property,

599
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,370
but also pretend to be sick.

600
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:02,740
I really don't know how your parents

601
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,690
teach you.

602
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,500
There's nothing to do with my parents.

603
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,980
We already apologize.

604
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,980
The money is here.

605
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,050
What else do you want me to do?

606
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,050
You still have reason, right?

607
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,660
Policeman, we're sorry.

608
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,860
When my uncle comes,

609
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,450
he will pay for all losses.

610
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,680
This sounds fine.

611
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,140
Listen, you guys

612
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,540
stay here honestly.

613
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,020
What's up?

614
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,170
Could you please stay away from me?

615
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,450
Jiang Chuan, why do you follow me?

616
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,690
What do you want to do?

617
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,140
I just want to enjoy the firework with you.

618
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:49,900
Enjoy what!

619
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,130
I don't want to enjoy the firework with you.

620
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,450
I want to celebrate the Christmas Eve with Chu Tiankuo,

621
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,260
not you.

622
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,570
Chu Tiankuo is

623
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,980
not here right now.

624
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,290
I will stay with you for a while.

625
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,860
Jiang Chuan, you are just my friend.

626
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,500
I know.

627
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,570
I also know that the post is written by you.

628
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,900
You just want to ask Chu Tiankuo

629
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,570
to celebrate the Christmas Eve with you.

630
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,130
I'm just afraid you are not safe here

631
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:26,930
alone.

632
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,090
Don't worry, qianqian.

633
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,330
I will leave when he comes.

634
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,330
I promise he won't see me.

635
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:01,900
2, do you want it?

636
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,500
No.

637
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:02,860
You go on.

638
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,450
You are not good at this.

639
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,330
9 10 J Q K A

640
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:05,540
I can't take it.

641
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,780
3 4 5 6 7

642
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,570
You're annoying.

643
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,260
Come here.

644
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,140
You should take the result if you want to bet.

645
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,620
Here.

646
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,290
You need to improve your skills.

647
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,050
Listen!

648
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,170
You'd better not go tonight.

649
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,740
I will win.

650
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,610
Zhouzhou,

651
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,410
when your uncle comes,

652
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,860
you leave all responsibilities to me.

653
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,010
I'm the only one who do this.

654
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,620
It's ok.

655
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,860
My uncle won't blame me.

656
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,140
Zhouzhou

657
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,570
Brother Chen An

658
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,210
Zhouzhou,

659
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,980
I will send you back to home first.

660
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,570
No.

661
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,660
My aunt said I could

662
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,860
play with my classmate

663
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,020
and go back home later.

664
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,980
Right.

665
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,540
I can send Zhouzhou back to home later.

666
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,900
When did you come out?

667
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,740
You were still at home

668
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,500
when we were on the phone.

669
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,680
After that, my classmate called me.

670
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,210
So, I went out.

671
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,410
You are not allowed to come to

672
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,450
dangerous place like this since now.

673
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,170
I can hide this for you this time.

674
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,020
If next,

675
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,780
I will ask dean Pan to take you.

676
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,540
Oh, it's you.

677
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,770
You're the senior student who will give a lecture at our school next semester.

678
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,740
How do you know Zhouzhou?

679
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,170
We knew each other since we were young.

680
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,210
How young?

681
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,330
Why didn't I know?

682
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,450
There's a firework downtown today.

683
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,170
Let's go and watch.

684
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,020
I go as well.

685
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,740
Why don't you go home?

686
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,410
I want to stay with you.

687
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,690
Lin Yang, didn't I told you clearly?

688
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,690
This time is different.

689
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:35,900
Zhouzhou,

690
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,540
if there's a place

691
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,620
more interesting than the firework,

692
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,450
do you want to go?

693
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,090
Where?

694
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,570
We'd better go downtown for the firework.

695
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,920
Eason Chan's performance is also there.

696
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,740
Lin Yang!

697
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,330
Ok.

698
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,740
We go to the place where our senior student just said.

699
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,380
Four 2.

700
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,860
I can't take it.

701
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,680
A bomb with a single card.

702
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,620
I'm done.

703
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,660
I win!

704
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,570
Well done.

705
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,620
It's disgusting.

706
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,380
Here.

707
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,290
You crushed my nose.

708
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,290
Finally, you have one.

709
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,450
Senior student,

710
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,450
where are we going?

711
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,560
Lin Yang,

712
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,690
you can leave first if you don't want to come.

713
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,980
No. I need to protect you.

714
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,810
Where is this?

715
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,020
Secret jungle.

716
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,860
Secret jungle?

717
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,290
I gave here this name.

718
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,570
I found this place when

719
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,160
I walked alone without destinations before.

720
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,450
You usually come here alone?

721
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,890
Sometimes, I want to find a quite place.

722
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,620
This means you never tell others this place.

723
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,370
This is my secret place.

724
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,050
It seems that I really can hear the sound of jungle here.

725
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,620
It's the firework that looks better.

726
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:41,860
Listen!

727
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,050
What?

728
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,290
Eason's song.

729
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,020
You didn't hear it?

730
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,860
Can you hear it so far?

731
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,980
Of course.

732
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,170
Listen carefully.

733
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,660
You are so easy to be fooled.

734
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,330
I hear it.

735
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:57,900
You listen.

736
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,450
Come on. I'm cheating.

737
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,050
You listen.

738
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,380
What are you doing?

739
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,050
Thanks for your flower.

740
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,050
Qianqian,

741
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,330
Merry Christmas!

742
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,690
Ten

743
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,850
Nine

744
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,280
Eight

745
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,740
Seven

746
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,330
Six

747
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,620
Five

748
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,860
Four

749
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,050
Three

750
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,090
Two

751
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,570
One

752
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,540
Merry Christmas!

753
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Zhouzhou, Merry Christmas!
