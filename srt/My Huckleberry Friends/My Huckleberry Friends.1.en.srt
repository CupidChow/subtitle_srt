1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,750
Our Zhen Hua High School is an ideal school

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,030
that all the middle school students of Shanhai City want to attend.

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,910
Our school adheres to the educational philosophy of studying inquisitively,

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,310
practicing earnestly and pursuing uprightness and progress.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,510
What are you doing?

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,910
What are you looking at?

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,830
Vic Zhou.

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,030
So good-looking.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,830
Smile.

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,390
What's the reason for choosing Zhen Hua High School?

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,790
Except Zhen Hua High School, I don't seem to have any other choice.

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,590
Because Zhen Hua High School is the best.

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,950
I believe that every graduate of Zhen Hua High School

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,390
won't regret the three years they spent here.

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,350
You!

17
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,510
Be 16 or 17 years old again.

18
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,310
So serious. Xin Rui, smile.

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,070
I think the life back then was purer.

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,830
And I could do anything I like.

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,190
Am I cool?

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,990
Very cool.

23
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,270
I think I was happier back then.

24
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,350
The childhood days seem to be better.

25
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,230
I think it might be

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,190
the happiest period of time in my life.

27
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,070
I could read books

28
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,110
or play as I wished.

29
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,230
While you were a high school student,

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,950
did you ever fancy someone

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,670
who didn't like you sincerely?

32
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,950
Can Qianqian see this?

33
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,110
While studying in the high school,

34
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,430
every male student ever liked a girl very much.

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,550
If I could be 17 years old again,

36
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,350
I would say thanks to one girl.

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,350
My name is Yu Zhouzhou.

38
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,670
I am a student of Class 3 graduating from Zhen Hua High School in 2003.

39
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,030
(The year 2004)

40
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,310
The answer is right.

41
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,070
The High School Affiliated to the Normal University, please raise the question.

42
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,710
Quit your monkey business.

43
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,510
Get out of the way. Out of the way.

44
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,070
Thanks.

45
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,390
Why are you still playing?

46
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,710
Zhouzhou, hurry to come with me.

47
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,030
Mr. Pan [Director Pan] needs to talk to you about something.

48
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,950
What's the matter?

49
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,350
The delegation of the High School Affiliated to the Normal University

50
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,670
has come to our school to challenge us.

51
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,830
Now our school is at the most urgent

52
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,710
and the most critical time.

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,110
You are needed by the organization.

54
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,310
I am at the most urgent

55
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,390
and the most critical moment as well.

56
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,430
The brother-in-law of A'Zi is going to die.

57
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,070
Now come with me.

58
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,470
Or Mr. Pan will give me a hard time.

59
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,310
Zhou Mo, give my book back to me.

60
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,670
Don't look at me.

61
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,710
Don't go easy.

62
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,550
Give it back to me.

63
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,510
I'll return it to you if you catch up with me.

64
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,910
Is she Zhouzhou?

65
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,470
Zhou Mo.

66
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,670
Yu Zhouzhou?

67
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,230
You must have mistaken her for someone else.

68
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,310
No, I haven't. She is Zhouzhou indeed.

69
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,550
You put love above friendship.

70
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,110
Mr. Pan! Mr. Pan!

71
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,590
Mr. Pan.

72
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,310
I brought her here as you said.

73
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,310
This is her book.

74
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,270
Are you here to read the martial art novel?

75
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,990
It doesn't matter if your contestants  can't answer the question.

76
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,190
We can soften the terms.

77
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,590
If anyone present knows the answer,

78
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,430
you are welcome to communicate with us on the stage.

79
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,630
As long as your answer is right, Zhen Hua will be the winner.

80
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,269
Get out of the way.

81
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,230
Qianqian.

82
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,630
This sucks.

83
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,070
Even Yu Zhouzhou can't solve this problem.

84
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,190
Rest assured.

85
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,510
We will win for sure.

86
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,470
Something is wrong with this problem.

87
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,870
So it can't be solved.

88
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,350
The description of this problem must be changed.

89
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,550
Otherwise, it seems to be solvable,

90
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,830
but is actually impossible to be solved.

91
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,470
Is she solving it correctly?

92
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,550
The answer is right.

93
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,790
Yu Zhouzhou is quite something.

94
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,950
She even saw through such a trap.

95
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,990
She really brought honor to our school.

96
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,590
Like I said, we'll win.

97
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,910
Let' s leave.

98
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,110
I announce the delegation of Zhen Hua High School is the winner.

99
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,550
Qianqian, I'll be off.

100
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,110
Second-year students will be divided into science and  liberal art classes.

101
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,950
The students who intend to stay in our science class

102
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,310
need not fill in this form

103
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,909
while those who want to become liberal art students must fill in it.

104
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,110
After you fill in the form, ask your parents to sign in the last column.

105
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,150
I

106
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,670
suggest that you should

107
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,750
combine your capabilities with your interests.

108
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,150
Mr. Zhang.

109
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,310
I didn't get it.

110
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,510
Capabilities stand for your learning achievements.

111
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,350
You not only need to consider the status quo,

112
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,550
but also need to take your potential into account.

113
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,630
-There are two levels of interests.
-What are you doing?

114
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,710
On the first level,  there is your interest in science or liberal arts

115
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,190
-as a high school student.
-Parallel class.

116
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,990
After you got admitted to a university, on the second level...

117
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,790
Be quiet.

118
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,030
Well,

119
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,030
your head teacher is away to make out questions for the college entrance exam.

120
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,750
So I'll teach you in the coming couple of days.

121
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,150
Forego these meaningless formalities.

122
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,190
I'll first inform you of one proper business.

123
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,150
You will be divided into science and liberal art classes soon.

124
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,430
If any of you want to focus on liberal art learning,

125
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,550
come here to get a form.

126
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,630
Sir.

127
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,430
I want one.

128
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,310
You want to be a liberal art student?

129
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,030
No. I need one piece of rough paper.

130
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,590
Be serious.

131
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,909
The class division this time is not a minor matter.

132
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,950
It concerns your career choices in the future.

133
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,230
You

134
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,870
must be responsible for your own future.

135
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,590
Sir.

136
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,710
None of the students from Class 1 and Class 2 of our school

137
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,230
have ever chosen the liberal art class all along.

138
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,390
It seems to have become a rule.

139
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,470
This seems to be true.

140
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,670
Well, all right.

141
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,510
I will ask you for the last time.

142
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,950
Is there anyone who wants the form?

143
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,390
If not, I'll be off.

144
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,310
Mr. Zhang.

145
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,790
I want one.

146
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,030
Yu Zhouzhou.

147
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,150
What are you thinking?

148
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,910
I want to focus on liberal art learning.

149
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,990
How can you be a liberal art student?

150
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,630
You told us to be responsible for our future., right?

151
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,190
What I said does not apply to  you.

152
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,270
Moreover,

153
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,590
in the previous science contest,

154
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,190
you brought such great honor to our school.

155
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,669
It has nothing to do with which class I choose.

156
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,150
Yu Zhouzhou.

157
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,230
Think more about it.

158
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,750
You can't take this lightly.

159
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,230
OK. Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

160
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,590
Mr. Zhang Feng.

161
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,950
I also want a class division form.

162
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,870
You also want to be a liberal art student?

163
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,190
Mmm.

164
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,790
Thank you, sir.

165
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,910
There is also the soup.

166
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,150
Zhouzhou.

167
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,590
Dig in.

168
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,030
So many dishes.

169
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,270
Aunt, you are so nice to me.

170
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:25,790
Oops!

171
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,950
Sorry.

172
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,630
It's all right. This thing takes up too much room.

173
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,190
OK. Just leave it like this.

174
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,750
Zhouzhou.

175
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,070
You'll be a second-year high school student.

176
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,470
You are a young adult now.

177
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,350
After your uncle and I talked,

178
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,030
we  bought you a new cellphone.

179
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,470
It will be easy for you to contact people in the coming days.

180
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,670
Thank you, uncle and aunt.

181
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,790
Come on. Have a look at it.

182
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,070
It's good.

183
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,550
Look!

184
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,550
Isn't it beautiful?

185
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,110
Thank you.

186
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,270
Ah. Well.

187
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,630
This is my school's class division form.

188
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,590
Parents need to sign it.

189
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,590
You chose the liberal art class?

190
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,110
Mhm.

191
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,430
You do well in science subjects, right?

192
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,070
But I want to be a  student of liberal arts very much.

193
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,070
Zhouzhou.

194
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,270
You need to think this matter over.

195
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,630
After all, it concerns your future.

196
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,030
It is not as simple as you think.

197
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,910
OK.

198
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,670
Let's eat first. Come on.

199
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,350
Eat before the food cools down.

200
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,870
Eat. Eat.

201
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,310
Come on.

202
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,830
Lin Yang.

203
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,910
Lin Yang.

204
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,910
Have you heard of it?

205
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,830
Yu Zhouzhou chose the liberal art class.

206
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,110
What?

207
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,550
Qianqian told it to me.

208
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,190
It seems that in her class,

209
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,550
only Yu Zhouzhou and her chose the liberal art class.

210
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,470
This is a good thing.

211
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,830
What makes you think so?

212
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,430
My test scores are almost equal to Yu Zhouzhou's.

213
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,030
As long as we both choose the liberal art class,

214
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,350
I'm sure we'll end up in the same advanced class.

215
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,470
In other words, as long as I choose the liberal art class,

216
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,270
Yu Zhouzhou and I will become classmates for sure.

217
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,510
You will choose the liberal art class?

218
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,710
Are you insane?

219
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,670
Aren't you afraid that your mum will beat you out of anger?

220
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,030
Now let's invite Lin Yang from Class 2, Grade 1

221
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,950
to give us a speech under the national flag.

222
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,590
Respectable teachers

223
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,790
and dear schoolmates,

224
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,110
I am very glad that we are gathering here again

225
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,390
on this beautiful morning.

226
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,710
I am Lin Yang from Class 2, Grade 1.

227
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,470
Today I'll give a speech

228
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,390
titled "Let the Flower of Ideals Bloom".

229
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,590
The left.

230
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,910
Pull it to make it smooth.

231
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,910
Smooth the characters.

232
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,350
Right. Right. Right.

233
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,310
I am bothered about all matters, be it small or big.

234
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,710
Check these data.

235
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,870
You'll be shocked by them.

236
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,950
Between the High School Affiliated to the Normal University and our school,

237
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,430
there is only a gap of 0.7 %.

238
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,870
Did this mock exam reflect our true proficiency?

239
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,670
They alleged that they would surpass us in three years.

240
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,430
We are losing our edge in the competition.

241
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,350
And I especially

242
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,110
invited the outstanding graduates of all previous years back.

243
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,150
Besides,

244
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,070
I want to praise

245
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,230
a first-year student.

246
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,830
It is Yu Zhouzhou from Class 1.

247
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,550
In our contest with the High School Affiliated to the Normal University,

248
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,590
she turned the tide.

249
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,550
She has great potential to be an excellent science student.

250
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,350
You must lay emphasis on her cultivation.

251
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,430
Mr. Pan.

252
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,710
As a matter of fact...

253
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,670
What are you trying to say?

254
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,270
-In fact, Yu Zhouzhou...
-Mr. Pan.

255
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,510
The student representative is here.

256
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,790
Mr. Pan.

257
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,430
It has been a long time.

258
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,070
Chen An, you are just in time.

259
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,990
Let me introduce him to you all.

260
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,670
This is the outstanding graduate of our school.

261
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,230
Now he is an outstanding student leader

262
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,510
of Peking University.

263
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,190
Go to my office in a while.

264
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,310
I want you to shed light on

265
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,270
your junior schoolmates before the college entrance exam

266
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,550
and give a lecture to them about your college entrance exam experience.

267
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,390
OK.

268
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,310
Come with me to my office.

269
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,310
Um, Pan...

270
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,190
Why do you think Ling Xiangqian chose the liberal art class?

271
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,470
It came as no surprise to me

272
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,430
that she chose the liberal art class.

273
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,830
As you can see, learning makes her so tired every day.

274
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,670
There will be too many top students in the science class.

275
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,590
When she becomes a student of liberal arts,

276
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,110
maybe she can surpass some other students

277
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,910
and get admitted to a university by recommendation.

278
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,750
That'll be nice.

279
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,750
Right?

280
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,070
Then why did Yu Zhouzhou  choose the liberal art class?

281
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,990
Does she also want to take advantage of the students inferior to her?

282
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,670
Yu Zhouzhou.

283
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,710
She might think nothing in the science class can interest her.

284
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,510
You see she has beaten all the top students.

285
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,270
I think she wants to compete with

286
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,790
a new batch of students in the liberal art class.

287
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,510
I can't think out any other explanation.

288
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,670
I don't care about this.

289
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,470
Anyway,

290
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,710
I only care about

291
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,950
when she'll give us a treat.

292
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,430
The character.

293
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,750
Sorry.

294
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,590
Pick one.

295
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,470
The big adventure.

296
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,790
The big adventure.

297
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,390
Here is the thing.

298
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,870
You shall use this

299
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,590
to draw the moustache on Yu Zhouzhou's face.

300
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,590
Stop laughing.

301
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,950
Are you out of your mind?

302
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,230
Now she is under special protection of our Zhen Hua High School.

303
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,430
Also, she is Yu Huai's youngest aunt.

304
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,190
I dare not trifle with her.

305
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,990
Well, I choose to tell the truth.

306
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,790
Truth?

307
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,630
Sure.

308
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,870
Which girl do you love?

309
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,510
Come on, you guys...

310
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,390
Take a look around. Look familiar?

311
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,750
Just like old times.

312
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,870
Feel free to visit  us when you're available.

313
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,710
You are the pride of  Zhen Hua High School.

314
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,190
I learned  a lot from teachers then as well.

315
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,550
Zhouzhou,

316
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,630
Zhouzhou,

317
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,470
Come here. Come here.

318
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,950
Well, I  just praised you  at the conference.

319
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,470
You did an excellent job in the competition. Keep it up.

320
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,270
Well,

321
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,590
let me introduce you

322
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,310
to this outstanding graduate of our school.

323
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,630
Go and wipe your face.

324
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,870
You two know each other?

325
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,030
I got your text.

326
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,070
I think  liberal arts

327
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,670
is a good decision for you.

328
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,710
Zhouzhou,

329
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,710
Say something, please.

330
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,990
Oh, sweet Jesus.

331
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,910
I...I didn't mean it.

332
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,270
Give me something,please.

333
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,470
Here is the soap.

334
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,230
Zhouzhou,

335
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,230
open the door.

336
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,550
I brought  you a soap.

337
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,069
Really.

338
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,310
I know I was wrong.

339
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:25,910
This time I really...

340
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,510
Why are you keeping drawing the same place?

341
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,870
Don't move. Don't, don't, don't.

342
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,030
Stop drawing. Stop it.

343
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,630
What are you doing?

344
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,310
Where is the soap?

345
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,750
Soap. Soap.

346
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,670
Here you are.

347
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,230
As I said, she was fine.

348
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,870
This is

349
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,830
Zhou Mo's written review.

350
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,790
I have lectured the other boys too.

351
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,070
They promised that

352
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,510
they would not play jokes on classmates anymore.

353
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,670
You can stay in the science class at ease.

354
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,270
Director Pan, that's not the case.

355
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,430
Don't be afraid.

356
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,990
Don't switch to the liberal arts class because of such a thing.

357
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,310
That's too emotional.

358
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,390
That's not a solution

359
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,430
but an escape.

360
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,910
It can't solve the problem.

361
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,910
Director Pan, I'm not being evasive.

362
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,030
I mean it.

363
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,110
See,

364
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,070
you still have concerns.

365
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,910
Relax.

366
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,670
I promise no one will bully you.

367
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,110
Director Pan, you misunderstand.

368
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,150
It's my own decision to learn the  liberal arts.

369
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,190
I really love it.

370
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,710
How can it be?

371
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,950
Why do you suddenly want to study liberal arts?

372
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,910
Where did you get this drink?

373
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,790
School.

374
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,590
Does Zhen Hua have these benefits?

375
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,990
Let me see. Let me see.

376
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,350
All the same? Let me see.

377
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,550
It's me that

378
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,710
bought these drinks for everyone.

379
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,350
Why?

380
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,590
Actually,

381
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,990
I chose  liberal arts.

382
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,390
It is the rule of our class to treat guests before leaving.

383
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,030
I'm leaving next semester.

384
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,750
I hope to get along with you all the rest of the time.

385
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,990
Zhouzhou,

386
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,630
when will you treat us?

387
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,510
You are back, brother.

388
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,910
Yes.

389
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,270
Was the graduation trip fun?

390
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,390
It sucks.

391
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,230
When I report to the university,

392
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,510
I shall have a truly free life.

393
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,750
Dad,

394
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,190
I  have an appointment with my classmates.

395
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,190
I got to go.

396
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,750
Buster.

397
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,750
Zhouzhou,

398
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,350
take care of my room.

399
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,670
When I come back later,

400
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,950
I'm afraid that I will sleep on the couch.

401
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,190
Mom,

402
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,070
why don't you sell the cello?

403
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,990
It gets in the way.

404
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,510
Zhouzhou doesn't play it now.

405
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,990
Make  Zhouzhou herself say it.

406
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,430
You are the one in the way!

407
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,310
It's okay.

408
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,990
I can bring this cello to my bedroom.

409
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,710
No, no.

410
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,990
Our house might not  be  big

411
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,310
but enough for your cello.

412
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,950
Leave it here.

413
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,910
I'll just walk carefully in the future.

414
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,830
Go. Go.

415
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,790
Zhouzhou,

416
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,430
when will you

417
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,030
hand in your division table?

418
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,470
Before the final exam.

419
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,350
A few days left.

420
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,470
I  definitely support you

421
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,270
if you want to study liberal arts,

422
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,670
Zhouzhou,

423
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,630
you need to think very carefully.

424
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,870
Look at your brother. He learned  the science

425
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,550
and majored in computing.

426
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,550
It's heard that  students of this major

427
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,790
will graduate with monthly salary of 5,000 RMB.

428
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,670
It never the case of other majors.

429
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,950
Okay! Okay!

430
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,830
Water's on!

431
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,710
Go check it out.

432
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,150
So

433
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,430
you have to think about that.

434
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,230
Take it seriously.

435
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,310
Okay, got it.

436
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,270
Zhouzhou,

437
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,870
your aunt's words

438
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,750
make some good points.

439
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,470
Think about it.

440
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,270
Zhouzhou,

441
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,630
Follow your heart  and  make your own decision.

442
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,070
Don't listen to them.

443
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,670
What are you talking about?

444
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,750
Hurry back.

445
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,590
Will do.

446
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,110
Punk kid!

447
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,910
Zhouzhou,

448
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,270
do you have a decision?

449
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,830
Yes.

450
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,870
Director Pan,

451
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:46,950
I'm done.

452
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,790
Take your time.

453
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,150
Hello,

454
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,310
is this Zhouzhou's parent speaking?

455
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,630
hi, hi,

456
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,790
I'm Director Pan.

457
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,390
Ling Xiangqian,

458
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,950
what are you looking for in my desk?

459
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,750
Your  division table.

460
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,710
I want to know whether you really want to learn the liberal arts.

461
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,910
Oh, I thought there was blood feud between us.

462
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,590
Zhouzhou,

463
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,950
you're amazing.

464
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,710
I'll take that as a compliment.

465
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,910
So for the  recommended spot,

466
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,110
I will not give up that for you.

467
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,750
You are going too fast.

468
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,470
Why would you like to learn the liberal arts?

469
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,590
Because I like it.

470
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,710
I want to act like a master,

471
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,830
simple but always getting my way,

472
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,270
and do whatever I like.

473
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,590
What about you?

474
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,910
Why choose the liberal  arts?

475
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:44,950
Zhouzhou,

476
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,310
the master you imagined

477
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,710
can always acts in their own way.

478
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,510
But think about it,

479
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,990
Is there really a master?

480
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,510
Don't they need to take the college entrance exam?

481
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,550
Ling Xiangqian, don't move.

482
00:23:59,550 --> 00:23:59,950
Aa,

483
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,990
what happened?

484
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:02,910
Is there something wrong?

485
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,510
What are you doing?

486
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,110
I honestly haven't thought it all the way through.

487
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,750
I just feel that

488
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,470
my mom

489
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,070
will be happy for my decision.

490
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,310
Aunt.

491
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,190
I think you don't need to talk to her about this matter.

492
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,630
Let her go.

493
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,990
This kid

494
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,030
is willful,

495
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,350
unpredictable,

496
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,630
and stubborn.

497
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,950
Director Pan even called today，

498
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,070
saying learning science would be benefit for her future

499
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,510
while the liberal arts would keep her around.

500
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,990
Zhouzhou,

501
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,150
was more sensible than other kids since the childhood.

502
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,430
Her mom had said

503
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,430
she knew what she was doing.

504
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,790
I mean

505
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,550
I put everything of her first now and satisfy her need.

506
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,910
When it came to this important matter,

507
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,150
she didn't consult me on this.

508
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,870
Could you please

509
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,310
tell me what's wrong with her?

510
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,830
Ever since she was a child

511
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,070
Just like her mom.

512
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,790
Let's not focus on what she should learn

513
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,230
but what she wants to learn.

514
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,310
Her mother is gone

515
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,150
and she is now living with us.

516
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,990
We have to be responsible for her.

517
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,950
If you really want to,

518
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,990
you need to put yourself in her shoes.

519
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,630
Haven't I served her enough?

520
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,510
If you were Zhouzhou's mom,

521
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,750
would you want to

522
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,510
disregard the kid's wishes?

523
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,190
I'm her aunt,

524
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,390
not her mom.

525
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,710
Zhouzhou,

526
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,630
Are you in there?

527
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,870
It's really hard.

528
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,230
Zhouzhou.

529
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,830
Aunt, I'm going to sleep.

530
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,830
Pick one.

531
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,390
OK.

532
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,710
Which one do you prefer?

533
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,390
The ones over there are second-hand,

534
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,310
and the price is relatively cheaper.

535
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,550
But the sound quality is guaranteed.

536
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,270
Could you please do me a favour?

537
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,070
No problem.

538
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,390
Actually,

539
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,750
making a choice is not difficult at all.

540
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,510
As long as you close your eyes and listen carefully,

541
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,630
you can choose the most beautiful voice

542
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,830
in your heart.

543
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,710
Aunt,

544
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,190
The neighbour said the milk...

545
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,550
Ah, I'm exhausted!

546
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,510
Let's call it a day.

547
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,110
OK, bye.

548
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,070
Bye.

549
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,910
Whose water is this?

550
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,630
I'll drink it,

551
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,990
and I will buy another bottle for her after school in the afternoon.

552
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,950
Zhouzhou bought it just now.

553
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,350
She said she was leaving next semester,

554
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,790
so she invited everyone to drink.

555
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,590
She also specially told us to keep more bottles for you.

556
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,870
Mr. Zhang, I have made up my mind.

557
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,950
Why don't you give me some suggestions?

558
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,030
There is no right or wrong

559
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,590
in studying arts or science.

560
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,670
As a teacher,

561
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,390
I can give you some suggestions.

562
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,030
But the final decision is still up to you.

563
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,150
Liberal arts and science,

564
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,070
if you can't make a decision

565
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,990
on these two options,

566
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,630
there will be more options after graduation.

567
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,910
How will you choose?

568
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,150
Got it.

569
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,630
But

570
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,950
Director Pan has another expectation of you.

571
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,470
Although you chose the liberal arts,

572
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,190
he still hopes that you will not give up the math competition.

573
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,950
After all, do not give up

574
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,390
what you like and are good at.

575
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,550
I know. I won't give up.

576
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,550
-Bye, Zhouzhou.
-Bye.

577
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,550
-Bye, Zhouzhou.
-Bye.

578
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,430
Bye.

579
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,990
See you.

580
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,469
Life is helpless,

581
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:11,270
it has no right answer.

582
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,670
But life is very lucky,

583
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,550
you can turn any choice

584
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,590
into the right answer.

585
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,150
Maybe I didn't understand

586
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,310
how important choices are at the time,

587
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,989
but it taught me

588
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:27,310
how to face my own choices.

589
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,190
For us at that time,

590
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,590
persistence may be more important

591
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,389
than anything else.

592
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,150
With time elapsing,

593
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:39,989
everyone changes but also remains the same.

594
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,870
But I believe that

595
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,429
the "me" in the old days

596
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,110
was the most wonderful me.
