Who is stalking you?

did you really hand in your recommendation letter?

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,130
Of course.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,500
Didn't I submit it with you?

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,770
I was afriad you'd sneak it back.

14

Then I won't go wither. I'll talk to Mr. Zhang.

Yes?

00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,530
No!

170
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,300
I know.

171
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,210
Everyone is waiting to laugh at me,

172
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,860
to see how I get worse every time,

173
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,650
and how hard I work

174
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,770
and still no progress at all.

175
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,530
What happened, Qianqian?

176
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,490
I hate you guys.

177
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,140
Have you filled out the recommendation form?

178
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,300
Handed over.

179
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,770
Tomorrow is a five-school joint exam,

180
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
and tomorrow's exam results

181
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,420
is the most important reference for recommended places.

182
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,980
Even if you failed your last exam,

183
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,700
you still have a chance.

184
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,930
I sometimes wonder

185
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,300
there's a reason I can't win Yu Zhouzhou.

186
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,890
After all, my foundation and background are poor.

187
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,090
But why can't you win?

188
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:40,890
I don't...

189
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,860
I'd really rather lose to you.

190
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,620
Where have you been?

191
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,330
School.

192
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,980
Why didn't you answer when I called you?

193
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,740
I'm taking the evening study class,

194
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,530
how can I answer the phone?

195
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,620
Mr. Wu called me

196
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,490
and said your last exam result dropped sharply.

197
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,740
Why didn't you tell me about this?

198
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,450
What should I tell you?

199
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,130
Tell you that the day before the exam,

200
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
you've been arguing with dad all night

201
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,380
and I stayed awake all night?

202
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,180
Since when are you like your father

203
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,650
and learned to make excuses?

204
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,530
Does this have anything to do with your declining grades?

205
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,500
You don't do well in the exam, and it's my fault?

206
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,980
I don't blame you.

207
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,940
I have nothing to say to you anyway.

208
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,620
You!

209
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,770
You went through my drawer?

210
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,380
Yes, well. What time is it now?

211
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,250
Stop thinking about all this nonsense!

212
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,500
Are you reluctant to throw?

213
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,130
It's okay. I'll throw it for you.

214
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,740
I throw it all away for you!

215
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,820
YES!

216
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,650
What are you doing?

217
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,090
What are you doing? What are you doing?

218
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,380
What are you doing? Ling Xiangqian!

219
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,300
What are you doing?

220
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,180
Ling Xiangqian, you're crazy, aren't you?

221
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,210
Yes, yes, yes, I know there's only one place this time,

222
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,420
but

223
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,530
is there any other way to add places, or...

224
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,450
Yes, yes. I know.

225
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,060
It indeed depends on the grades.

226
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,130
But you know that

227
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,180
Ling Xiangqian's previous grades

228
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,330
are not bad.

229
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,770
She is basically in the top three of the grade.

230
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,380
It's just she has been under stress lately.

231
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,300
She just doesn't perform well occasionally.

232
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:15,890
Come in.

233
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,650
Uncle.

234
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,980
You aunt asks you

235
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,570
what do you want to eat tomorrow morning?

236
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,820
I'd like to have skinny pork and fermented egg porridge.

237
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,210
Do you want the bun?

238
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,860
I want to eat the sugar triangle.

239
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,680
OK, I'll buy it for you tomorrow morning.

240
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,570
Thank you, uncle.

241
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,300
The liberal arts math are so hard these days.

242
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,690
If I were to do this now,

243
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,940
I would definitely not pass it.

244
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,090
You didn't get in at that time, either.

245
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,980
We just need to find a job in those days.

246
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,380
There's no point in going to university.

247
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,760
Look at your aunt,

248
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,570
an official college student

249
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,890
ended up marrying me

250
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,980
who didn't even graduate from high school.

251
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,940
However, times have changed.

252
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,210
You need to study hard and get a good university.

253
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,570
Why are you talking to Zhouzhou again?

254
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,650
Don't you know she has an exam tomorrow?

255
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,890
We agreed not to bother her, right?

256
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,690
Get out of there!

257
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,420
I'm a parent, aren't I?

258
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,980
I care about my child. What's wrong with that?

259
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,410
[Lin Yang: There are a lot of mosquitoes under your house]

260
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,650
I'll take out the trash.

261
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,740
Hey, don't move Zhouzhou.

262
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,260
I'll put the trash out later.

263
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,410
I'll take it out later. Leave it.

264
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,450
Then I'll go downstairs to buy a pen. My pen is out of water.

265
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,980
Hey, wait, the pen?

266
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,650
Well, here, take this.

267
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,500
I'll tell your uncle to get a few more for you

268
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,530
in his workplace tomorrow.

269
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,210
Okay.

270
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,010
Uncle.

271
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,620
Zhouzhou, go buy me a pack of cigarettes.

272
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,980
Any brand is ok.

273
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,380
Ok.

274
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,650
Didn't you quit?

275
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,200
I've quit. I've quit.

276
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,820
I'm just watching...to work on my stamina.

277
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,210
I'm out of here.

278
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,300
What kind of questions do you have to ask at this time of night?

279
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,530
Here you are.

280
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,690
Thank you.

281
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,820
Your favorite Ice cream cone. And this.

282
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,740
It's still cold. You can eat it.

283
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,330
I'm not hot, you eat.

284
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,210
Let me send it to you every night.

285
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,260
There is a McDonald's near my house.

286
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,500
Then I'll bring you fruit.

287
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,450
It's not like we don't have fruit at home.

288
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,570
Then I'll bring you...

289
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,010
Do not.

290
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,450
I haven't said what to send yet.

291
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
All right, nothing.

292
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,690
The exam is tomorrow, so go and study!

293
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,050
Lin Yang, you are so naive.

294
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,130
Yu Zhouzhou, you are so cute.

295
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,570
Lin Yang, you are so stupid.

296
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,940
Yu Zhouzhou, you are so clever.

297
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,210
Lin Yang, you are so kind.

298
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,250
Okay, you've lost. Go home now.

299
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,530

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,380
I wish you all get good results.

304

in this five-school joint examination.

305
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,770
All right, class is over.

306
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,620
Ms. Zhang, class finished?

307
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,260
-Director Pan. 
 -I'd like to say a few words.

308
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,620
All right, everyone, quiet!

309
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,060
Director Pan has something to tell us.

310
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,930
This five-school joint examination

311
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,500
is a very important mock exam before Gaokao.

312
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,530
It's not just about the recommended places,

313
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,690
but also the reputation of Zhenhua.

314

Chen Yao, are you listening to me?

317
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,890
Director, don't say cheat.

318
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,940
I can't even get this place

319
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,330

My stomach hurts. I can't hold it in.

321

I'll say it up front.

322
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,890
This examination is very important,

323
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,260
so I hope you could create

324
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,500
a level playing field.

Mr. Zhang, I swear that

Ling Xiangqian will not cheat.

331
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,500
She must have been wrongly accused, Mr. Zhang.

I don't have any say in the matter.

333

The school has its own method.

334

Mr. Zhang,

335
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,500
I was sitting next to Ling Xiangqian.

336
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,740
She really didn't even look at it.

337
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,620
I can testify.

338
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,330
Mr. Zhang, can I beg you, please? Mr. Zhang.

339
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,740
Ling Xiangqian will never cheat.

340
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,930
Can you put in a good word for her?

341
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,260
She would never cheat, Mr. Zhang.

342
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:19,930
Mr. Zhang,

343
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,540
we all believe that she is not this kind of person.

344
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,540
But the invigilator found the cheat sheet in her pocket.

345
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,810
This is the truth.

346
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,740
I don't care if she forgot to put it away,

347
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,090
or brought it in on purpose.

348
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,020
She should be responsible for her mistake.

349
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,250
What if this was Gaokao?

350
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,260
You also go to the teacher and plead for mercy?

351
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,140
You,

352
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,740
always try to take responsibility for other people's mistakes.

353
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,330
So you're going to take responsibility for her future life?

354
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,690
Let me ask you,

355
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,260
what if she did cheat?

356
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,810
These are the ones you bring in?

357
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,620
We have contacted your parents.

358
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,050
After they come,

359
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,570
let’s communicate in details.

360
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:17,900
Ling Xiangqian,

361
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,450
you make me disappointed very much.

362
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,660
You are the parent of Ling Xiangqian, right?

363
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,660
You!

364
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,570
You shouldn’t beat her!

365
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,260
Do you educate your child at home by beating her?

366
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,290
If I knew she had done such a shame,

367
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,900
I would have slapped her to death.

368
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,380
Ling Xiangqian’s mom, take it easy.

369
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,330
The situation is not that serious.

370
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,770
Let me tell you

371
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,260
the decision of the school.

372
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,140
Even though the recommendation to the key university  has been canceled,

373
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,140
Ling Xiangqian can still attend Gaokao.

374
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,020
The recommendation has been canceled?

375
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,450
No, director Pan. Please don’t cancel the recommendation.

376
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,400
You know that she was seduced by others.

377
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,380
It’s all because of that boy.

378
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,860
Otherwise, Qianqian will not be like this.

379
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,250
No. I have to find the bad boy out.

380
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,010
I cannot let him escape from this.

381
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:02,890
Please calm down.

382
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,740
Ling Xiangqian is the student of my class.

383
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,410
As the head teacher, I will be responsible for her.

384
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,290
The punishment has been decided.

385
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,410
Let’s talk about other things after Gaokao ends, ok?

386
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,410
Director Pan, please think twice.

387
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,260
Come here, come.

388
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,210
Say sorry to the director and the teacher.

389
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:21,980
Say you were wrong.

390
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,290
Say please to the school. Please give me one more chance.

391
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,260
Hurry up, say!

392
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,980
Stop forcing me!

393
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,380
You all, stop forcing me!

394
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,330
Qianqian! Qianqian!

395
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,260
Qianqian, stop! Don’t go!

396
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,620
Qianqian! Stop! Qianqian!

397
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,560
Qianqian!

398
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,540
Ok. Then don’t come home!

399
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,290
Teacher, I quit.

400
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,090
It’ not time yet. You cannot go.

401
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,900
I quit!

402
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,930
What’s wrong with you?

403
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,780
It’s in exam. Sit down.

404
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,450
Chu Tiankuo.

405
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,050
Ling Xiangqian is in trouble now. Do you want to go and find her?

406
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
I will not go. You guys go.

407
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,540
I said she is in trouble now!

408
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,620
Hey, what are you going to do?

409
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,860
Chu Tiankuo, enjoy your exam.

410
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,050
Stop fighting! Sit down!

411
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,370
Go go go!

412
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,050
Stop fighting!

413
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,780
Are you ok?

414
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,130
Teacher,

415
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:13,860
my pen is broken.

416
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,210
Can you get a new one for me?

417
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,290
Ok.

418
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,540
No. 2 again?

419
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,210
Why don’t you learn

420
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,020
from the person who got the No. 1?

421
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,080
You cannot eat until you finish practicing playing the piano.

422
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,810
Why do you play the piano wrong again?

423
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,170
You cannot watch the cartoon tonight.

424
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,290
You cannot stop practicing until you play well.

425
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,540
Excuse me.  Where did that girl go?

426
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,660
I think she went left.

427
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,260
She went left.

428
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,450
No. No.

429
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,020
I am old. I don’t remember well.

430
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,260
Ok. Zhouzhou and Lin Yang.

431
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,530
I go this way and you two go that way.

432
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,570
Let’s keep in touch.

433
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,540
Excuse me. Excuse me.

434
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,690
Did you see

435
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,540
a girl with the ponytail like me?

436
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,620
-No. -Thank you.

437
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,210
Hello? Mom?

438
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,930
Give me the phone number of Ling Xiangqian’s dad, right now!

439
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,500
Why are you calling me now?

440
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,780
Aren’t you in exam now?

441
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,050
Ling Xiangqian is in trouble.

442
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,020
I went out to find her.

443
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,690
Give me the number! Hurry up!

444
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,450
What? You quit the exam?

445
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,540
Is quitting the exam alright for you?

446
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,140
No big problem.

447
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,740
If I cannot be recommended, I will take Gaokao.

448
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,090
If you are alright with that, then I’m alright too.

449
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,660
We are different.

450
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,140
Don’t worry.

451
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,860
Qianqian.

452
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,740
Are you disappointed?

453
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,330
I……

454
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,570
You don’t need to say anything.

455
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,570
I trust you.

456
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,170
I really,

457
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,930
I really cheated.

458
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,410
Jiang Chuan.

459
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,380
I really don’t know

460
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,810
where Ling Xiangqian normally likes to go.

461
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,780
What if we call Chu Tiankuo and ask him about this?

462
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,140
He will not pick up the phone.

463
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,210
If we still cannot find her until the exam ends,

464
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,020
we go to the school gate to stop Chu Tiankuo.

465
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,260
I have to warn you.

466
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,020
Do not learn this kind of behavior from Benben.

467
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,450
Hello, this is Lin Yang’s mom.

468
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,930
Please ask Lin Yang to answer the call.

469
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:58,930
Who is that?

470
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,100
The person wants to talk to you.

471
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,080
Yes.

472
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,730
I have no choice. Otherwise, I’m not a human.

473
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,780
I’m not showing anger to you.

474
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,660
My attitude is quite good right now.

475
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,540
Mom, it must be too late for me

476
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,500
to go back and continue with the exam.

477
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,780
Please let me find her out without concern.

478
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,450
Yes. Please comfort Ling Xiangqian’s mom.

479
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,380
No matter how good Ling Xiangqian pretends to be in front of me and Jiang Chuan,

480
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,860
we all know that

481
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,380
her crazy mom……

482
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,450
Ok, ok. I should show my respect to older people.

483
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,920
Mom, this is my choice.

484
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,620
Regardless of whether this choice is right or wrong, I will take the responsibility.

485
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,330
What are you two talking about?

486
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,570
You.

487
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,680
You’d better not come.

488
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,660
I will send her back.

489
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,090
Hello?

490
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:52,620
Hello?

491
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,780
Are you all coming out to find me?

492
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,620
Sure!

493
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,210
Actually not all.

494
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,450
Are you disappointed?

495
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,860
It is neither Chu Tiankuo nor Lin Yang that finds you out.

496
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:15,930
Go away!

497
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,660
See! I know more about you than they two.

498
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,740
Jiang Chuan! You!

499
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,690
As I think.

500
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,500
You are an energetic person.

501
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,810
You don’t need to pretend to be a princess.

502
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,780
That’s fine. I will not hate you.

503
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,250
Qianqian, do you remember when we were young?

504
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,050
The time when we were playing together.

505
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,930
At that time, Lin Yang often acted as king.

506
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,810
You acted as queen. And I acted as knight.

507
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,740
Do you know what scared me most?

508
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,140
I was scared that you would really marry Lin Yang.

509
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,410
But then, I found that

510
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,020
because of Chu Tiankuo

511
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,560
you changed

512
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,290
to a person I never know.

513
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,980
You are in mess. You become careful.

514
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,690
You are not a princess anymore.

515
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,440
You no long yell at me.

516
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,380
Lin Yang changes too. He changes because of Yu Zhouzhou.

517
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,810
He becomes moody.

518
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,620
At that time, I will think

519
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,780
you might as well marry Lin Yang.

520
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,080
Then I can go and visit you two often.

521
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,210
We three will still be together.

522
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,660
Be together forever.

523
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,410
Jiang Chuan.

524
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,210
But now I think

525
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,290
it doesn’t matter who you stay together with

526
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,540
as long as you are still you.

527
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,740
Qianqian, you have me, Lin Yang and Zhouzhou.

528
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,020
We will all stay by your side.

529
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,620
I think it will be worse next.

530
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,380
But I will not be afraid.

531
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,570
For the cheating,

532
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,290
I will admit the mistake to Mr. Wu.

533
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,210
Good.

534
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,620
I will definitely behave well in Gaokao and prove myself!

535
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,140
I trust you.

536
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,330
Jiang Chuan,

537
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,900
do you still believe me?

538
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,540
Of course.

539
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,980
Because I think

540
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,650
you are the best girl in the world!

541
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,290
Jiang Chuan! Ling Xiangqian!

542
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:34,680
Are you ok?

543
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,260
What are you doing?

544
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,740
What happened?

545
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,410
Qianqian.

546
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:44,980
Are you alright?

547
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,200
Does Jiang Chuan do anything to you?

548
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,450
Go away!

549
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,780
What happened?

550
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,810
It’s ok. It’s ok.

551
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,260
Didn’t I tell you two not to come?

552
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,090
Why?

553
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,170
You don’t want us to be here, right?

554
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:05,610
Zhouzhou.

555
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,410
This incident has nothing to do with you.

556
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,440
You don’t need to give up the exam for me.

557
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,900
But you are more important than the exam.

558
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,450
Thank you, Zhouzhou.

559
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,200
How did you find Ling Xiangqian out?

560
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,860
Maybe we all think the childhood is better.

561
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,090
Do we?

562
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,410
But why do I think now is better?

563
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,260
Thank you all for giving up the exam

564
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,500
to attend Gaokao with me, a normal person.

565
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,450
Being self-sentimental is a disease.

566
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,050
I also think now is better.

567
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:54,810
Me too.

568
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,380
Mom.

569
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,780
I have told you to come back home early to look after our store.

570
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,930
Where did you go and play? You come back so late.

571
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,450
I will beat you!

572
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:17,930
Mom.

573
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:19,690
I will be recommended to the key university.

574
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,500
You will be recommended? Really?

575
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,860
Then I don’t need to spend anything for you to go to college, right?

576
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,900
Yes. And I don’t need to attend Gaokao.

577
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,570
Will you have scholarship?

578
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,540
Is there any subsidy for college?

579
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,500
Is your living cost also included?

580
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,410
Xin Meixiang! You make your mom feel so proud!

581
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,540
People go to college and spend their parents’ money.

582
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,210
But you can earn money from going to college for your mum!

583
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,900
The rest of my life all counts on you.

584
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,780
Raising you up is worth it!

585
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,740
You are way better

586
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,020
than your dad, that loser!

587
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,980
After you go to college and you make a fortune,

588
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,020
you buy this store back for me.

589
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,660
This is so good!

590
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,010
Is this ice sculpture ticket unusable

591
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,980
since I didn’t attend the exam for recommendation?

592
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,090
Have a second look carefully.

593
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,580
[Indefinite.]

594
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,250
I didn’t expect that you are so eager to hang out with me.

595
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,740
But if I regret,

596
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,780
there’s nothing you can do.

597
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,380
Lin Yang.

598
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,210
I remember there is an episode in Doraemon.

599
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,780
They shrink themselves very small by using the shrink channel.

600
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,810
They built a mini city in their backyard.

601
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,140
Inside,

602
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,660
they could do as they pleased,

603
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,050
and realized their dreams

604
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,740
which were impossible to be met in normal times.

605
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,900
Nobita Nobi could always stay in the comic book store,

606
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,980
and read new comic books.

607
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,500
He didn't fear to be kicked out by the store manager.

608
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,410
Konta Takeshi could have his Katsudon.

609
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,210
Doraemon bought a lot of dorayaki.

610
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,010
He didn't need to pay.

611
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,450
Minamoto Shizuka had her own toy store.

612
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,290
I remembered.

613
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,660
I thought it was pretty cool.

614
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,810
But my favorite is

615
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,210
a nameless cameo role.

616
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,500
But it's just one shot.

617
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,370
Who is he?

618
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,060
At that moment he was sprawling on the road,

619
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,500
and shouting to the sky,

620
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,739
"Finally I can

621
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,060
sprawl on the road freely."

622
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:22,820
What are you doing?

623
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,690
Let's sprawl on the road.

624
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,020
Zhouzhou,

625
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:44,060
we're living in the mini city.

626
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,889
Finally I can

627
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,210
sprawl on the road freely.

628
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,540
Don't worry, Qianqian. You go upstairs.

629
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,370
You can call me in case of necessity.

630
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,370
I'll be here for you.

631
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,170
What happened?

632
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,580
Where did you go?

633
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,370
Come out and eat the soup.

634
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,780
Do you still think you're right even though you made a mistake?

635
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,650
Where did you go?

636
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,130
I've called you many times,

637
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,260
but why did you switch off your phone?

638
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,850
I went to my kindergarten.

639
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,300
I switched off the phone because of the exam.

640
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,120
Then I forgot to turn it on.

641
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,820
Here is the thing.

642
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,450
Tomorrow you go to Director Pan's office.

643
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,780
You apologize to him and remember to be polite.

644
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,740
We'll see if he gives you a chance to make up tests.

645
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,980
Moreover, I'll ask your father to look for other chances,

646
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,170
and people who can be counted on.

647
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,890
We'll see if we can take use of some other ways to

648
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,920
score extra points in the College Entrance Examination.

649
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,170
But you have to keep in mind,

650
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,930
it's you only choice to take part in the College Entrance Examination.

651
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,260
Nothing more.

652
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,410
Mum, please,

653
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,650
please stop commanding me. I beg you.

654
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,130
What nonsense did you say?

655
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,090
Don't you want a bright future?

656
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,100
I have planned to speak my mind

657
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,370
to you for a long time.

658
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,210
As long as I can remember,

659
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,410
you've told me to be a good kid.

660
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,780
So I have to study hard and do exercises day after day.

661
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,610
I have to be outstanding in every exam.

662
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,540
I have to win the first prize.

663
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,210
When we join the dinner party held by dad,

664
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,410
I have to sing,

665
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,250
to say some claptrap to make everyone happy.

666
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,450
When uncles and aunts discuss

667
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,370
who are the most outstanding,

668
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,780
the most generous and well-behaved kids,

669
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,410
I have to be one of them.

670
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,340
What do you mean? I want you to be well-behaved,

671
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,610
to be outstanding,

672
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,410
to be a good kid,

673
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,300
so am I wrong?

674
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,930
But both of you seem to forget that

675
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,300
the so called "good",

676
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,300
it's about care.

677
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,450
I am not sure,

678
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,210
whether Ling Xiangqian in your expectation

679
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,020
is me,

680
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,650
or is another you.

681
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,020
When you grow up,

682
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,410
when you have your kid,

683
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,690
you'll find the answer.

684
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,690
Perhaps at that time,

685
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,740
you may behave like me,

686
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,740
and use my way

687
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,130
to treat your kid.

688
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,170
Maybe one day, you'll understand me.

689
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,130
Perhaps I'll understand then,

690
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,130
perhaps I will never understand.

691
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,300
Ling Xiangqian,

692
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,780
maybe you're very confused

693
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,980
why you have a mum like this.

694
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,020
She is strict and tries to control you in every aspect.

695
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,020
She asks you to be the best at everything.

696
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,610
Never mind. I don't need your understanding.

697
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,820
I just want you to know

698
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,690
I care about my daughter.

699
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,490
I hope her to be good

700
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,780
and outstanding.

701
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,740
I hope that when she grows up,

702
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,500
in face of troubles and challenges,

703
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
she won't come to me

704
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,690
and complain,

705
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,260
"Mum, when I was young,

706
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,890
why didn't you cultivate me?

707
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,060
Why didn't you control me?"

708
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,930
I just want her to know that I love her.

709
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,170
That's enough.

710
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,260
But, Ling Xiangqian,

711
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,930
I'm very disappointed at you.

712
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,130
No, I mean I'm desperately disappointed at you.

713
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,290
It's not because you cheated in the exam or anything else,

714
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,780
but it's because,

715
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,570
because,

716
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,820
because I thought what I did for you

717
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,490
needn't to be spoken out.

718
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,360
For my love for you,

719
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,060
you always know it.

720
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,130
But,

721
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,890
but I didn't expect,

722
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:01,130
I didn't expect that you never understand.

723
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,530
Jiang Chuan, thank you.

724
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,610
(From Ling Xiangqian: Jiang Chuan, thank you.)

725
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,690
Ok, let's have dinner.

726
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,400
Come on, let's celebrate Zhouzhou's success in the recommendation exam.

727
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,370
Cheers.

728
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,650
I give up.

729
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,500
Uncle, aunt, I'm sorry.

730
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,260
I give up.

731
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,580
The meaning of "give up" is to give up the recommendation exam,

732
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,300
am I right?

733
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,010
When we were taking part in the exam,

734
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,610
there was a student who was stressful

735
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,200
running out of the classroom.

736
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,210
We went to look for her,

737
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,580
so we didn't take the exam.

738
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,340
Well, what you did is sort of helping others,

739
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,850
so the school should make an exception for you.

740
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,580
Zhouzhou, what do you say if I go to your school

741
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,930
and intercede for you?

742
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,450
Never mind. I still can take part in the College Entrance Exam.

743
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,370
But it's not fair for you guys

744
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,020
just because you helped her.

745
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,020
Well, I think Zhouzhou did right.

746
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,890
Several days ago, in their school,

747
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,570
there was a student having a breakdown.

748
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,980
If something bad had happened to the kid today,

749
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,500
it would have had a bad influence on all of the students.

750
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,540
Nonsense!

751
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,610
Why are you pouring the liquor?

752
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,020
Zhouzhou didn't take the exam, so there's nothing to celebrate.

753
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,980
Well, you don't understand.

754
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,100
We'll celebrate if she does well in the exam.

755
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,780
But we also need to celebrate even if she gives up.

756
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,930
From now on, every dinner at home,

757
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,740
is a celebration.

758
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,500
Cheers, Zhouzhou.

759
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,160
That's fine. Let's eat.

760
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,020
Fine. 
 Let's eat.

761
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,170
Yu Zhouzhou,

762
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,820
Lin Yang,

763
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,500
Jiang Chuan,

764
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,850
Ling Xiangqian, I...
 Mr. Zhang,

765
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,740
calm down, Mr. Zhang, I'll take this.

766
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,540
Do you realize that...

767
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,810
We know we are wrong, Mr. Wu.

768
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,120
You know, in that case,

769
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,410
we couldn't take the exam.

770
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,020
If we failed, we would be rebuked.

771
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,690
So it sounds better to give up the exam in a great way.

772
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,130
Do you think it's great?

773
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,580
Mr. Wu, I know I'm wrong.

774
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,740
I did it voluntarily, so I'm willing to accept the punishment.

775
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:58,410
Me, too.

776
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,210
Me, me too.

777
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,890
You..., I..., yesterday I...

778
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,170
Fine. You come to handle this.

779
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,060
Ok. Your punishment includes

780
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:10,500
cancelling your admission qualifications.

781
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,260
The three of you will be criticized in a circulated notice.

782
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,130
Ling Xiangqian will receive a warning.

783
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:16,980
Do you agree?

784
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:18,100
Yes, we do.

785
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,580
If yes, take the test paper and finish it.

786
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,410
Then you estimate your scores separately.

787
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,050
Go, right now.

788
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,850
What are you waiting for?

789
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,820
Are you waiting for me to call Director Pan?

790
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,820
Go, go, go. 
 Hurry, go.

791
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,650
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu.

792
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,370
I took the note to the exam classroom.

793
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,210
I knew it.

794
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,020
But your warning

795
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,410
won't be recorded in your archive.

796
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:58,890
So don't feel much pressured.

797
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:00,610
You can go to the classroom now.

798
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,410
Mr. Wu,

799
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,680
I probably won't come to school again.

800
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,890
I want to study at home.

801
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,020
That's ok.

802
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,200
Ok. I know. You can go.

803
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,210
Let's go.

804
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,840
Qianqian, if you don't come to school,

805
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,300
I'll go to accompany with you.

806
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,300
Jiang Chuan, you're a little babysitter.

807
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,580
It's unnecessary. You guys study hard at school.

808
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,780
I'll sort out the test papers

809
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,640
and send to you tomorrow.

810
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,580
I'll do it. I'll do it.

811
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,580
It's such a glorious task,

812
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,540
so I'm supposed to do it.

813
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,410
Jiang Chuan, you're a little senior babysitter.

814
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,690
Get out. What are you saying?
