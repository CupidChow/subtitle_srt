4
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,770
I'm hungry.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,020
Why are you always say you are hungry or you are thirsty over and over?

6
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,020
Aren't you hungry?

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:29,810
Me?

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,210
I'm not hungry.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,450
Forget it. Let's stop arguing.

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,220
Save your strength.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,180
What's the smell?

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,180
Look! Look! Look! Look!

13
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,380
Here's your barbecue.

14
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:03,980
Enjoy your barbecue.

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,459
OK.

16
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,850
So what?

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,210
Through smelling the barbecue, we can feel full.

18
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,980
I can't. You're a liar.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,740
You take me in the middle of nowhere,

20
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,100
now I'm starving to death.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,250
I have an idea.

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,660
What?

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,420
Move in.

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,460
What?

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,340
I hope you come again!

26
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,800
OK, come on, enjoy your meal!

27
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,850
Enjoy your barbecue!

28
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,490
What are you doing?

29
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,660
-Loot! Freeze!
-What are you doing?

30
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,490
Put the phone down! Hands up!

31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,250
Mi Qiao, good job.

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,340
I learn from the television.

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,200
Don't move!

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,289
That's my coke.

35
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,740
You're so stingy! Shut up!

36
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,289
Pack all  roasted meats and desserts up!

37
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:55,810
Hurry up!

38
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,340
Pack them up! You only have 30 seconds.

39
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,100
Pack them up! Pack them up!

40
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,610
Hurry up! Hurry up!

41
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,890
Freeze!

42
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,729
Freeze!

43
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,300
Put down your weapons.

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,730
Don't make useless resistance.

45
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,650
Why do you drink coke in the hijacking process?

46
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,980
Don't you want to drink coke?

47
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,050
Well, I want to drink coke,

48
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,220
but that's bad business!

49
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,220
Only for roasts, desserts and some drinks

50
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:30,980
maybe lose myself in it.

51
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,640
I don't want to spend the rest of my life in jail.

52
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,250
I still have to see Eason Chan.

53
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,140
Now that you mention it,

54
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,860
I think there's something wrong.

55
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,370
When the police turned up, they wouldn't say "Freeze!",

56
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,370
they would say "You're surrounded".

57
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,250
Is that the point?

58
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,720
So what do you suggest?

59
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,130
We must use strategy to get food.

60
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,610
Come again!

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,090
OK! Thank you!

62
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,250
And enjoy your meal!

63
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,890
What happened to you?

64
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,420
Grandpa and grandma,

65
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,940
please

66
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,010
give us some food.

67
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,450
Go away. Where did this beggar come from?

68
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,730
We haven't eaten anything for three days,

69
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,810
we're so hungry,

70
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,370
please give us some food.

71
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,050
Baby...

72
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,690
Baby?

73
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,860
It' OK that we didn't eat anything,

74
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,250
but I'm afraid the unborn baby is hungry now.

75
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,940
Here you are.

76
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,060
Why are you still so stingy?

77
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,420
Still?

78
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,010
Baby... For baby.

79
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,650
For baby.

80
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,610
My old man,

81
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,860
let them eat something.

82
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,580
Come in,

83
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,650
Come in.

84
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,730
Thank you!

85
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,370
Thank you! Thank you!

86
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,060
Thank you!

87
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,490
Thank you all. Thank you all.

88
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,769
Thank you all. Thank you all.

89
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,140
Cut it out.

90
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,140
Okay?

91
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,420
That is so humiliating.

92
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,810
That's better than robbery, right?

93
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,300
Hurry up!

94
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,050
So miserable.

95
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,050
So rustic.

96
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,180
Go around the back.

97
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,330
I'm smart, right?

98
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,740
Master! This is not your first time doing this, right?

99
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,300
Get out! Quickly pack the roasted meats and desserts up in later!

100
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:10,770
OK!

101
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,420
I survived.

102
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,650
It's gorgeous.

103
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,740
Taste this, taste this.

104
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,330
Coke!

105
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,010
Coke! Coke!

106
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,180
Do you think it’s not good for us to do this?

107
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,740
Yes...

108
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,300
So, what, then?

109
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,420
We are in a difficult financial situation,

110
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,090
I write down my phone number

111
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,620
and pay the barbecue when we have enough money.

112
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,450
Exactly.

113
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,930
Yang Zhi sold knives, Qin Qiong sold horses,

114
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,250
Han Xin has also been humiliated by the crotch.

115
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,930
What's wrong with this?

116
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,620
Pack it up!

117
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,300
Pack it up!

118
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,210
It's so nice!

119
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,450
This meat with a woody flavor, try this!

120
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,620
So juicy!

121
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,650
-Pack it up!
- I'm eating this one.

122
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,900
Come here, what are you doing?

123
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,010
What are you doing?

124
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,820
[Episode 21 If I were Eason Chan]

125
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:30,980
That's it.

126
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,210
Our money was robbed,

127
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,490
and our motorcycle also broke down.

128
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,580
We are so starved

129
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,180
that we did this inappropriate behavior.

130
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:38,930
Yes, yes.

131
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,930
We planned to take you two pieces of meat and leave,

132
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,330
but your barbecue

133
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,980
is so delicious,

134
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,770
I can't stop.

135
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,180
Well, well, well.

136
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,530
Sit down please.

137
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,250
You choked just now for barbecue, right?

138
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,810
Drink some water.

139
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,090
No, no, no.

140
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,090
Grandpa and grandma, don't you call the police?

141
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,900
Just some pieces of meat,

142
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,980
why should I call the police?

143
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,530
See you guys eat so delicious,

144
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,420
we're also happy.

145
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,140
Grandma and grandpa, you're so kind.

146
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:07,980
OK.

147
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,770
You have finished your meal, right? Let's go to check the situation of motorcycle.

148
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,300
When I was young,

149
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,810
I was an automobile mechanic.

150
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,490
I can handle

151
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,760
the common problems of motorcycle.

152
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,250
Thanks!

153
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,530
Let's go right now?

154
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,170
OK.

155
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,420
I will check their motorcycle.

156
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,300
Take care of this little girl, right?

157
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,700
Let's go.

158
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,050
OK.

159
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,580
Go.

160
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,210
What's the problem with it?

161
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,180
Grandma,

162
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,010
thank you, grandma.

163
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,700
Screwdriver.

164
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,980
Grandpa, grandma doesn't like talking.

165
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,900
She is a deaf-mute.

166
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,650
So you keep gesticulating with her.

167
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,490
She is not deaf and dumb with born.

168
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,020
After she got sick,

169
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,700
she firstly lost her listening ability,

170
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,140
and then she cannot speak clearly.

171
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,300
She's got huge pride,

172
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,770
so she refuse to talking.

173
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,460
She was illiterate at that time,

174
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,330
she can't read or write.

175
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,420
But she learned to read during her deaf time,

176
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,580
and she writes

177
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,210
better than me.

178
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,290
Grandpa, can you tell me

179
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,049
what caused this situation?

180
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,210
When she was young,

181
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,620
she suffered a lot of difficulties.

182
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,970
At that time, the rural condition is very poor,

183
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,210
they cannot choose to

184
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,090
go to hospital.

185
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,890
But at that time,

186
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,980
she got a huge fever.

187
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,820
At that night, I sent her to the town hospital

188
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,530
and walked dozens of miles.

189
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,770
Maybe the treatment is not timely,

190
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,300
and the doctor's medical skill isn't good

191
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,530
so after the illness is over,

192
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,380
she lost the hearing sense.

193
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,770
A quack doctor! That's awful!

194
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,650
That's messed up!

195
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,620
Do not blame anyone.

196
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,890
At that time, the rural condition is very poor,

197
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,890
even a common cold can

198
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,570
take one's life.

199
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,060
It's not a rarity.

200
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,130
Grandpa, did you marry grandma at that time?

201
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,860
No,

202
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,260
I married her

203
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,890
after she got sick.

204
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,530
It's so great.

205
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,770
I‘m also hope to find a great boyfriend.

206
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,650
OK.

207
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,060
Give me the oil drum.

208
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,530
That's not diesel.

209
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,770
Grandpa...

210
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,210
Here you are.

211
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,450
Pouring gasoline on it.

212
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,570
OK. Enough.

213
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,770
It worked!

214
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,570
Amazing!

215
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,370
You're welcome.

216
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,570
You must've run out of money.

217
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,500
Here, it's total 500 yuan.

218
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,210
Take it.

219
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,090
This...

220
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,940
Quickly, take it.

221
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,530
After watching that show,

222
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,570
you should come home quickly.

223
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,330
Don't make your family worried

224
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,820
No, I cannot take this.

225
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,330
-Well.
-Take it.

226
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,980
Mi Qiao, take this. We will return this.

227
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,980
We will have chance to see grandparents in next time.

228
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,650
Exactly! Come again!

229
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,260
We also feel happy, right?

230
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,210
-Thank you!
-Bye!

231
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,200
Well. Bye! Bye!

232
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,410
Come on.

233
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,180
Well.

234
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,090
Well.

235
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,770
Bye!

236
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,770
Okay. Go!

237
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,130
Let's go.

238
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,210
We will go. Grandparents!

239
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,210
Bye! Grandparents!

240
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,130
Bye!

241
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,260
Bye!

242
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,500
-Bye! Grandparents!
-Bye!

243
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,320
Zhouzhou, I‘m ready to get a glass of water.

244
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,060
Give me your water cup.

245
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,130
Thanks.

246
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:51,690
You are welcome.

247
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,080
Yanyi,

248
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,650
Does Mi Qiao still not come?

249
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:03,980
No.

250
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,180
She seems still on leave.

251
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,690
Zhouzhou,

252
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,570
Have a nice class.

253
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,650
You too. Bye.

254
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,330
“Ask the grave-sweepers for some leftover sacrifices to eat,”

255
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,380
“but the common people don't know that."

256
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,500
"Yi Qiu..."

257
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,770
Go?

258
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,450
Right now?

259
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:48,980
Do it?

260
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:50,860
OK.

261
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,420
There are a lot of our school students.

262
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,650
What are you doing here?

263
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Aren't you say that you have to study at school?

264
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,420
There are no supervision,

265
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,760
and the Chinese class is too boring.

266
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:23,860
Good.

267
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,500
The precious time

268
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
cannot waste in classroom.

269
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,940
Are we too ostentatious in school uniforms?

270
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,770
Do we need to change our clothes?

271
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,690
This isn't the school uniform, this is the team shirt.

272
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,450
Team shirts?

273
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,210
Well, go. Today we play the CS, I'm in charge of the front part.

274
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,090
You're in charge of the behind part

275
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,860
Xu Zhiqiang, here! Why so late?

276
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,330
Quickly! Let's team up.

277
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,010
Come on!

278
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,650
TVXQ!

279
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,650
I really love this!

280
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,500
Too cool!

281
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,940
I tell you, this is awesome.

282
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,010
So handsome!

283
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,450
Awesome.

284
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,770
Amazing! Look! Kim Jae Joong!! Look!

285
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,130
I really don't understand them.

286
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,850
Zhouzhou, have a look.

287
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,210
The two basketball shoes, which one is better?

288
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,420
I think they are similar.

289
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,010
When did you get interested in this?

290
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,650
This! Many our classmates bought this one.

291
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,850
it's good, but too normal.

292
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,930
This one, a little expensive.

293
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,890
Lin Yang,

294
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,650
Do you think the atmosphere in our school...

295
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,880
What's wrong?

296
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,010
So impetuous.

297
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,180
Recently, many classmates play truant,

298
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,740
they don't like studying anymore.

299
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,330
Because Director Pan isn't here,

300
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,130
but this one is different,

301
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,200
this is for playing basketball, this is more scientific and technological.

302
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,450
Look this, this has the collection value.

303
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,980
This is comparison.

304
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,210
Did I?

305
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,010
Fine.

306
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,570
I buy this one, keep a low profile.

307
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,060
Just Kidding.

308
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,570
It's a basketball shoe.

309
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,300
It is not necessary.

310
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,260
I'm not saying you can't buy shoes,

311
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,820
I can't reach Mi Qiao recently,

312
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,770
after your birthday,

313
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,690
I can't assist the last activity of the Cartoon Club,

314
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,130
she begin to ignore me.

315
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,300
I don't know if she is still angry with me.

316
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,690
No way.

317
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,010
You get along well with her,

318
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,530
she cannot be mad at you.

319
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,000
I hope so.

320
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,690
We've arrived.

321
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,940
Two missed calls

322
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,010
and one message from Zhouzhou.

323
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,420
She asked me whether you stay with me or not.

324
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,300
You don't say we're staying together.

325
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,060
You say I'm in hospital.

326
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,060
Why?

327
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,410
Are you still angry with her?

328
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,010
Well...that's Zhouzhou's faults.

329
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,690
She is worried about you,

330
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,210
and she was busy that day.

331
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,620
Let her worry about a few days,

332
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,690
you don't say we're staying together.

333
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,650
After today's concert.

334
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,890
We'll go back, okay?

335
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:01,980
All right.

336
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,060
Eason Chan, I'm coming!

337
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,060
Eason Chan,

338
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,740
What are you doing? Come on!

339
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,450
I'm coming！

340
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,500
What‘s the matter?

341
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:32,840
[Benben: Mi Qiao is with me now. 
 Please pretend to know nothing about it.]

342
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,090
Benben sent the message, acting so stealthy.

343
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,090
This....

344
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,450
Did they also...

345
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,450
What's wrong?

346
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,690
Did they skip class to go to the Internet bar？

347
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,130
Internet bar？

348
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,620
You're thinking about Internet bar every day!

349
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,890
Have you also been to the Internet bar?

350
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,440
[Tickets: Eason Chan's concert]

351
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,450
I saw they also sell posters.

352
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,620
If I lifted it up,

353
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,860
do you think Eason Chan will identify me?

354
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,260
Then I'll take a seat in the front

355
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:55,970
so that he could be able to see it.

356
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,890
Do you think the tickets 
 of front row will be difficult to buy?

357
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,820
I don't think so.

358
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,770
The tickets are sold out.

359
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,690
Please go back.

360
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,210
What?

361
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,290
Sold out?

362
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:08,740
I'll ask.

363
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,569
We've been waiting in line for so long!

364
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,859
What should we do now?

365
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,140
Don't worry. There must be scalpers around here.

366
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,810
Let's go and ask them.

367
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,170
All right.

368
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,849
Two thousand yuan for one ticket.

369
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,260
The lowest price of a standing ticket 
 is 600 yuan each.

370
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:23,980
That's too expensive.

371
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,660
Think about it.

372
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,050
Dude, you want a ticket?

373
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:26,859
Any tickets left？

374
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,810
Tickets for best view, 2000 yuan for one.

375
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,080
Sounds like a trap!

376
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,500
Could it be cheaper?

377
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,980
The lowest price of a standing ticket 
 is 600 yuan each.

378
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:36,740
No bargain.

379
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,980
How dare you add at least three times 
 of its price?

380
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,620
Girl, I just do it for a living.

381
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,690
Dude, let's talk it over.

382
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,780
500 yuan for two standing tickets, ok?

383
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,980
Or I'll turn you in.

384
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,500
Turn me in? Look around!

385
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,170
Little boy, if you have little money,

386
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,170
you can just sit on the kerbs 
 outside the concert.

387
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,570
They're seats available for free!

388
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,690
What do you mean?

389
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,740
Let's forget it.

390
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,290
It's okay.

391
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,090
I've had a great time. It's okay.

392
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,050
But...

393
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,540
It's okay.

394
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:42,970
Are you okay?

395
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,330
Yeah, i'm fine. Thank you.

396
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,980
Well, could you help me pick up that bag?

397
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,040
That bag means a lot to me.

398
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,500
No problem!

399
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,140
Thank you!

400
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:54,900
What are you doing?

401
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,210
Make way! Excuse me!

402
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,810
Excuse me! Excuse me!

403
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,410
What are you doing?

404
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,900
Miss,

405
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,140
are you okay?

406
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,930
I come out to relax.

407
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:25,930
Let's go back as early.

408
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:26,290
All right.

409
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,690
Why does he speak Cantonese?

410
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,620
His voice sounded familiar, too.

411
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,620
Could it be...?

412
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,810
Oh my, I'm so lucky!

413
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,610
I shook this hand with Eason!

414
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,540
I shook hands with Eason!

415
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,090
It ticks me off

416
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,170
that I didn't even have time to look up at him.

417
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,380
It's all your fault!

418
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,170
I've been wasting on scolding you!

419
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,780
No, how can I say that?

420
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,170
If... if you hadn't had me tumbled,

421
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,930
I... I won't have this chance either.

422
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,140
Thank you! Thanks!

423
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,090
Mi Qiao, would you please calm down?

424
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,450
Ok. Calm down, calm down...

425
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,780
I can't calm down!

426
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,540
It'd be perfect if I could go to the concert 
 this time!

427
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,660
No, not that way.

428
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,170
If... if I had gone to the concert

429
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:31,810
just as ordinary fans,

430
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,020
I won't have this special chance!

431
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,380
Benben, if it were you, 
 which one would you choose?

432
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,540
Then I choose to die!

433
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,020
If I could shake hands with Eason, 
 it's okay for me to die!

434
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,040
I'll never wash my hands again!

435
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,260
I don't wash my hands anymore!

436
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,660
Mi Qiao,

437
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,500
that's embarrassing. Let's go!

438
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:55,980
All right. Let's go!

439
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,090
When I go back and meet with 
 Zhouzhou, Lin Yang, Yanyi and Chen Yao,

440
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,980
I'm going to show off to them!

441
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,140
Eason Chan!

442
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,860
I'm so lucky!

443
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,540
Director Pan,

444
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,170
How did you lose your energy?

445
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,620
Cheer up! Get some energy!

446
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,170
Hello, director Pan!

447
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,330
You should have a haircut.

448
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,450
Hello, director Pan!

449
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,170
Pan!

450
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,500
Aye,  you're back.

451
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,610
Haven't seen you for so long, 
 I kind of miss you.

452
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,260
Really?

453
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,620
How's your trip going?

454
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,980
Wu, let me tell you,

455
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,090
this trip is really rewarding!

456
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,690
I learned a lot of experience.

457
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,330
I have been away for these days,

458
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,020
is everything fine in the school?

459
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,160
Of course!

460
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,620
Whether you're at school or not,

461
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,660
Zhen Hua will operate as well as usual.

462
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,290
I'm going to work.

463
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,730
What does he mean?

464
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,740
That sounds uncomfortable.

465
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,430
[Report Box]

466
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,410
What's going on?

467
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,780
What's going on?

468
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,210
Why are you all so quiet?

469
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,890
I've read all these reports.

470
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,660
And I‘ve known the situation.

471
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,050
It's terrible!

472
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,690
I've only been away for a few days,

473
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,780
and Zhen Hua has become like this.

474
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,500
Uh, Director Pan.

475
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,170
It's true that recently these students

476
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,900
are a little loose minded.

477
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,540
Just a little?

478
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,690
I don't think it's just students 
 who are loose minded.

479
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,290
I think all of you have been loose minded.

480
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,540
What's wrong? Don't cough!

481
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,620
Actually it is not as serious as you think.

482
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,620
Now you come back just in time.

483
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,930
You can use the management experience

484
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,690
you have learned in other schools

485
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,290
to rectify them in our school.

486
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,930
What you have learned

487
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,050
can also be used in a targeted way.

488
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,050
See, Mr. Wu has hit the nail on the head.

489
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,770
I have been to several high schools this time

490
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,330
and learned a lot of experience.

491
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,810
What impressed me the most

492
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,020
is Handong High School in Hanshui.

493
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,090
They study in the morning from half past six

494
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,860
and have evening study until ten at night.

495
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,570
They don't have any extracurricular activities,

496
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,930
running in the morning and at night 
 to keep up their energy,

497
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,140
and going to school on every Saturday and Sunday.

498
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,660
Wait. Director Pan.

499
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,810
Do you mean to do the same with Zhen Hua？

500
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:58,620
That may not be.

501
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,450
But, if necessary,

502
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,210
we can probably try this.

503
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,140
I think this thing

504
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,740
still need to consider carefully.

505
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,050
No, there's no need.

506
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,900
As far as it goes,

507
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,740
I think we are going to overhaul Zhen Hua.

508
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,140
That's the deal.

509
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,500
Director Pan.

510
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,930
What's the matter?

511
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,370
That's fine, come down, that's okay.

512
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,660
Take it slow.

513
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,050
Attention, teachers and students!

514
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,050
Attention, teachers and students!

515
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,570
I now make an announcement.

516
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,090
In view of Zhen Hua's current lax discipline

517
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,700
and students disregard school rules
 and regulations,

518
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,210
especially yesterday's spot check,

519
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,660
fifty-six students were found to skip class
 and not dress according to the regulations.

520
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,930
We also confiscated prohibited items.

521
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,380
From this day on,

522
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,020
Zhen Hua will not only strengthen supervision,

523
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,450
but also increase its regulations articles,

524
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,620
as follows.

525
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,660
All students must wear school uniforms
 and school tags.

526
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,330
Brand shoes are not allowed in the school.

527
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,740
All boys should keep short hair.

528
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,450
And no odd hairstyle or bald head is allowed.

529
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,620
Girls keep with short Bob hiarstyles
 as the standard,

530
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,810
and are not allowed to make up or wear jewelry.

531
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,850
Items that have nothing to do with study

532
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,810
are all prohibited in the school.

533
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,370
The morning study begins at seven o 'clock,

534
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,380
and the evening study ends at nine o 'clock.

535
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,450
There are some more details that will be

536
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,080
communicated by the head teacher of each class.

537
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,980
Little Pan is insane!

538
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,210
I've only been away for a few days.
 And now what a mess in Zhen Hua!

539
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,500
Mi Qiao,

540
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,930
Do you get better? Are you all right?

541
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:05,620
I'm all right.

542
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,930
Actually, I went to see Eason Chan's concert.

543
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:11,980
Mi Qiao,

544
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,620
Zhouzhou, I miss...

545
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,260
You're still mad at me?

546
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,500
Yeah.

547
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,570
I heard you shook hands with Eason Chan.

548
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,090
Did Benben tell you that?

549
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
He is a traitor!

550
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,450
But this time I really have a close contact

551
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,780
with Eason Chan.

552
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,650
I'm telling you, I fell on the ground then.

553
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,380
And he took hold of me

554
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,690
with this hand, this hand!

555
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,280
And he grabbed me to my feet.

556
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,040
I haven't even washed my hands until now.

557
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:39,980
Mi Qiao,

558
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,330
you did shake his hand?

559
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,810
Although I didn't get the ticket,

560
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,210
I had by chance

561
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,660
a close contact with him.

562
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,020
Then, can I shake your hand?

563
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:50,860
Of course!

564
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
How many days have you not washed your hands?

565
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,930
I'm not going to keep it for the rest of my life.

566
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,410
Then how do you do at dinner time?

567
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,450
How do you do when you go to the toilet?

568
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,050
And how do you do if you wanted a meal
 after going to the toilet?

569
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,330
I'm not going to wash this hand for the rest of my life，

570
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,680
even if I don't eat or go to the toilet.

571
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,140
Clear?

572
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,290
Why are you so nosy?

573
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,330
This is the hand that Eason shook,

574
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,290
which has the original taste and temperature of Eason.

575
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,540
Shake it or not.

576
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,930
I wanna shake your hand.

577
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,740
Wait.

578
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,210
Oh my god.

579
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,690
This is the homework assigned these days?

580
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,690
There is so much.

581
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,170
Fine, Chen Yao.

582
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,050
Finish one paper for me, I will shake hand with you once. It is up to you.

583
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,290
Deal.

584
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,620
Mi Qiao, can I have one?

585
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,140
Monitor Lin,

586
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,690
I didn't realise you like Eason too.

587
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,260
OK.

588
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,570
Wait a minute, wait , wait.

589
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,090
There are so many people. Line up.

590
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,620
Finish one paper for me, I will shake hand with you once

591
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,500
This is the hand shook by Eason.

592
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,210
There isn't much paper, hurry up.

593
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,050
Don't push! Don't push!

594
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:00,660
Come one by one!

595
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,540
Oh my god.

596
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,740
Take the paper first, take the paper first.

597
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,650
Mi Qiao, mind the door, mind the door.

598
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,050
What's up?

599
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:08,570
The door.

600
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,660
Boss,

601
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,620
Have you really decided?

602
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,290
Of course.

603
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,410
I must do

604
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,410
what I promised Mi Qiao.

605
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,620
Do you think we can do it?

606
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,290
You are the ones who help me shout.

607
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,290
Later, you will blend in with the students

608
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
to initiate their enthusiasm.

609
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,380
I'll take care of the rest.

610
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,900
Look at you guys,

611
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,210
why did you ask for trouble?

612
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,500
I reminded you before,

613
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,090
but you think I was wordy.

614
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,290
Well, that's just great.

615
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,330
Hearing director Pan's words,

616
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,740
you were all froze up.

617
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,570
Even if it's our fault,

618
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,290
director Pan's measures are too harsh.

619
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,290
Okay, Don't complain.

620
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,930
This should blame youselves.

621
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,210
Direct Pan is for your own good.

622
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:09,690
Stand in position.

623
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,260
You guys should study hard.

624
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,330
-I will plead with director Pan for you in a few days. -Everyone writes a 3000-word self-reflection.

625
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,260
Hand to me tomorrow morning.

626
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,740
Pretending to be sick, skipping class, and talking back to me，

627
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,930
you write 10000 words.

628
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,410
Go back.

629
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,330
Mr. Wu, come to my office.

630
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,260
Mi Qiao, you've been there so long, are you okay?

631
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,370
I have never seen such kind of director.

632
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:00,810
Do you know?

633
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,980
I said one sentence, he cursed ten.

634
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,500
I have admitted my mistake.

635
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,740
What else does he want?

636
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,260
Droping the cup, smashing the table,

637
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,260
is he the only one who is strong?

638
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,540
Okay, don't be angry.

639
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,330
Zhouzhou, do you know how bad director Pan was?

640
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,560
Do you know how unacceptable he was?

641
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,020
He said that my hands were dirty and forced me to wash my hands

642
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,050
He got a basin of water himself and pressed my hand into it,

643
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,090
rubbed it with soap for five minutes.

644
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,380
My Eason.

645
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,260
Mi Qiao, look,

646
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,900
I just shook this hand

647
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,980
with your hand.

648
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,020
Let me shake you hand again.

649
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,260
It doesn't work. It doesn't work.

650
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,500
It will work.

651
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,900
Class is over, class is over, class is over.

652
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,500
Hurry up.

653
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,810
Class is over, let's do it.

654
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,900
Fei, give me a hand, give me a hand.

655
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,860
One, two, three.

656
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,090
Zhouzhou,

657
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,410
I feel like I have nothing left now.

658
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,620
Even Eason seems like a dream,

659
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,900
which is not real at all.

660
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,380
I can't afford to buy tickets.

661
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,410
I couldn't listen to his concert.

662
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,660
I didn't have time to talk to him either.

663
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,210
Just a handshake,

664
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,260
now there is no temperature either.

665
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,410
Mi Qiao, Eason will definitely come again.

666
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,260
When he comes I will accompany you to see him.

667
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,250
Look what is that! Let's go.

668
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,050
Come here.

669
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,450
Come here, students.

670
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,450
Here it is, the superstar.

671
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,930
Look, that is Benben.

672
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,450
Hey, why are you standing so high?

673
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,140
Eason, look, it is Eason.

674
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,040
What is he doing?

675
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:21,860
I don't know.

676
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,050
That student, you can't sing over there.

677
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,090
Come down quickly

678
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,020
Pass it backwards. Pass it backwards.

679
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,210
Come here.

680
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,810
Come here, here, here.

681
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,370
So handsome.

682
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,210
Mi Qiao,

683
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,690
This is a concert I prepared especially for you,

684
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,210
do you like it?

685
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,409
Yes.

686
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,929
Louder, I can't hear you.

687
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,340
I said, I like it.

688
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,500
Who's up there? Get down!

689
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,260
Which class do you come from?

690
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,340
I am Chen Yixun.

691
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,330
Chen Yixun, come down.

692
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,980
Go home if you don't want to write a self-reflection.

693
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,610
♫ If I didn`t speak that two words with fear. ♫

694
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,850
-♫ I wouldn`t have found myself badly hurt. ♫ -Who is singing?

695
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,450
♫How to say it?♫

696
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,170
Who is singing?

697
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,890
-♫That was only a break-up. ♫-Who are you? Come out.

698
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,210
I am not from your school.

699
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,170
♫If there were not any hope for tomorrow.♫

700
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,370
-♫Hand in hand, just like having a tour.♫ -Don't sing.

701
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,820
♫Thousands of doors, ♫

702
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,500
♫one had to leave first.♫

703
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,260
You have to get down.

704
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,370
You're not coming down, are you?

705
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,980
-♫Since we couldn`t hold forever. ♫ -Okay, get me a ladder.

706
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,300
♫When we said goodbye,♫

707
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:02,060
♫why not share happiness with tears?♫

708
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,580
♫Ten years ago, we didn't know each other.♫

709
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,410
♫You didn't belong to me.♫

710
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,100
♫We were all the same, ♫

711
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,740
♫stayed by a stranger`s side,♫

712
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,450
♫walking through the familiar street.♫

713
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,340
♫Ten years later, We`re still friends♫

714
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,450
♫and can greet each other.♫

715
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,780
♫But for that affection,♫

716
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,500
♫we can`t find a reason to embrace any more.♫

717
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:37,340
♫Lovers are meant to be friends in the end.♫

718
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,810
One more.
