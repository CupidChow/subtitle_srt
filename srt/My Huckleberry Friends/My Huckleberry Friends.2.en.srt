At seven, she gets up and washes.

13

At five past seven, she has breakfast

At a quarter past seven, she gets downstairs and goes to school.

She meets three red lights in total all the way.

19

When she is to pass the third one,

the light happens to turn yellow.

88
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,920
Self-introduction is unnecessary.

We are the key class.

99

Other arts classes are all looking at us.

100
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,330
At least ten.

101
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,650
So conservative.

102
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,320
Do you want to know my prediction?

103
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,700
Yes.

104
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,930
I think

105
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,650
all of you can do that.

106
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,420
But it's not up to me.

107
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,770
I won't go to Peking University.

108
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,490
Universities of 211 Project are enough for me.

109

110
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,020
Get ready for class.

Oh, sit sit sit.

113

In the future,

114
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,490
don't need to stand up in my class.

115
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,860
Open your textbooks and turn to Lesson Two.

116
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,050
Eh, teacher,

117

what about Lesson One?

118
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,330
It isn't the content of tests.

119
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,090
The puddles on the ground have dried up, and the water in the pond is cool and translucent.
 At dusk the rays of the setting sun, condensed in the evening haze, turn the mountains purple.

120
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,330
This is a sentence in A Tribute to King Teng's Tower.

121
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,320
The puddles after rain have dried up.

122
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,090
The cool pond water is very clear.

123
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,180
The afterglow of the setting sun seems to be condensed.

124
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,620
The mountains in the evening haze look cold purple.

125
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,930
OK.

126
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,210
That girl, answer a question.

127
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,210
Why can such a hazy view

128
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,530
and purple mountains appear?

129
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,810
Is it because the sun shines on the mountains?

130
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,700
Very good.

131
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,530
It produces the Tyndall effect.

132
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,620
What? What effect?

133
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,250
The Tyndall effect.

134
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,650
It means when light passes through a colloid,

135
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,170
we can observe the scattering

136
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,610
from the vertical direction of light.

137
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,980
This is the Tyndall effect.

138
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,020
Nonsense.

139
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,330
I see all of these from books.

140
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,330
What books?

141
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:14,930
Physics.

142
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,370
This is Chinese lesson.

143
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,650
What's your name?

144
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,300
Yu Zhouzhou.

145
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,300
Yu Zhouzhou, if you answer questions like this again in the future,

146
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,370
go to learn science.

147
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,380
This class focuses on the judgement of time

148
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,330
and season.

149
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,200
If there is something you don't understand,

150
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,820
you can try to draw pictures by yourselves after going back.

151
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,380
In fact, geography is also a part of science.

152
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,740
OK. Class is over.

153
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,530
Stand up.

154
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,200
Goodbye, teacher.

[Welcome new classmates]

What's wrong, Zhouzhou?

157

I always can't understand

158
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,820
the Earth's deflection angle.

159
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,810
Let me help you draw the picture.

160
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,820
Yanyi, you draw so well.

161
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,090
Have you ever learned drawing?

162
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,210
Yes. I learned a little in the past.

163
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,940
I feel you draw more clearly than Mr. Shen.

164
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,330
Your skills have regressed too much.

165
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,980
Nothing. Just because of lacking practice.

166
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,500
There is even no basketball team in Class 3.

167
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,380
Enough. Don't be critical.

168
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,450
There are so many pretty girls in you class
 after the division of arts and sciences.

169

You still complain you can't play basketball.

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,570
There are indeed many pretty girls but the feeling of gloom is too strong.

171
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,210
When I open the door, the classroom is full of the smell of shampoo.

172
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:51,770
Some kinds of smell are missing.

173
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,690
What kind of smell?

174
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,380
The smell of adrenal hormones, men and sweat.

175
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,820
In a word, there is no passion.

176
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,050
Most importantly,

177
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,090
everyone is demoralized and goes his or her own way.

178
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,890
There is no sense of community.

179
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,690
That's because you aren't familiar with each other just after the division.

180
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,570
Besides, your target is not Class 3.

181
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,500
Eh, how about the relationship between you and Yu Zhouzhou?

182
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,090
Do you sit next to her?

183
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,770
No.

184
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,860
Are you close to her?

185
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,500
No,

186
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,820
but I sit at the rear of her.

187
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,330
Jiang Chuan,

188
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,690
the ball and people are all here.

189
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,740
Let's play three-on-three basketball.

190
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,650
OK. Lin Yang, join us.

191
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,330
I no longer belong to your class.

192
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,880
We will also have PE class later.

193
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,980
I will organize a team to defeat you.

194
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,890
Go go go.

195
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,010
Where is the PE monitor of your class?

196
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Teacher, he went to the science class.

197
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,380
The new PE monitor hasn't been selected.

198
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,570
You are responsible for leading the team in this class.

199
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,210
Ask Mr. Wu to quickly select the PE monitor after going back.

200
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,570
You are supposed to be the key class.

201
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,770
Your mental outlook is much poorer than that of the regular class.

202
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,090
OK. Warm up first.

203
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,980
In this class, girls play volleyball

204
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,980
and boys do free activities.

205
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,080
Break!

206
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,210
Come on! Boys team up to play basketball.

207
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,450
-No. No. No.
 -Play basketball? No.

208
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,090
I haven't finished my homework.

209
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,010
How can I organize a team?

210
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,890
We are here to enter Peking University,

211
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,740
not to play basketball.

212
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,090
What's your meaning? Is there no basketball team in Peking University?

213
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,260
Lin Yang.

214
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,060
Eh.

215
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,300
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

216
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,260
Hello?

217
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,740
I say, you

218
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,860
went to learn arts without saying a word.

219
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,440
Do you really think I, the head teacher doesn't exist?

220
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,500
Mr. Zhang, there is something you don't know.

221
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,940
Actually, I'm also very reluctant to part with our class.

222
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,490
But after thinking for a long time,

223
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,260
I found I still like learning arts.

224
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,090
I want to combine my ability with my interest.

225
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,180
So I chose arts at the last moment before the new term began.

226
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
No matter how you talked with your parents

227
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,530
and Director Pan,

228
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,820
the life is your own,

229
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,980
and your willfulness should have a limit.

230
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,380
OK. Go to class.

231
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,180
Eh. OK. Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

232
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,330
Come.

233
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,940
Zhouzhou.

234
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,770
Stop reading. Hurry up to have dinner.

235
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,530
Oh. OK.

236
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,450
Come.

237
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,130
Eh. Zhouzhou.

238
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,500
Well.

239
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,210
How about your recent study?

240
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,010
Everyone says learning arts is easy.

241
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,300
I don't think arts is easier than science to learn.

242
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,890
That's right.

243
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,130
Hurry up to eat.

244
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,570
Eat. Eat. Eat.

245
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,260
Take it easy.

246
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,820
In 1839, Lin Zexu destroyed opium at Humen.

247
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,420
From 1840 to...

248
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,620
Why do you always recite some strange things recently?

249
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,690
Don't you need to recite chemical formulas?

250
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,770
Physics and biology? Don't you need to review them?

251
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,090
Mom.

252
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,330
I tell you. Don't think I am annoying.

253
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,860
Once you've learned mathematics, physics and chemistry well,
 you will have no trouble throughout the world.

254
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,820
This point is universally acknowledged.

255
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,380
Why don't you ask me about my interest?

256
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,210
Interest is the best teacher of children.

257
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,330
Who said it?

258
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,410
Einstein.

259
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,260
I tell you the small splint is the best teacher.

260
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,770
Who said it?

261
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,530
I.

262
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,530
Talk about your interest with me until you score 680 in the Gaokao.

263
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,940
The Opium War took place from 1840 to 1842.

264
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,130
In 1842, China and the UK signed Treaty of Nanjing.

265
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,820
Reliable.

266
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,610
Telescope.

267
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,330
Limit.

268
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,500
OK. That's all for today's dictation.

269
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,130
Let me have a look.

270
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,680
This.

271
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,890
What kind of attitude is this? Ah?

272
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,860
Two words are wrong.

273
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,890
Both of them were just learned today.

274
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,570
You can't make mistakes even if they were just learned.

275
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,740
Do you know because you have transferred to the arts class,

276
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,000
you have no other choice?

277
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,760
You must be the top one. You can't be the second one.

278
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,890
Just one mistake is too many. You even made two mistakes!

279
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,330
Mom.

280
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,010
It is not easy to be the top one.

281
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,380
Yu Zhouzhou also learns arts.

282
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,090
Yu Zhouzhou.

283
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,890
She also learns arts?

284
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,380
Hey, you say.

285
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,620
Why do you often meet Yu Zhouzhou?

286
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,860
Let me check it again.

287
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,940
OK. OK.

288
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,570
I will take a look at it tomorrow.

289
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,060
Eh, Qianqian, have you selected the monitor of your class?

290
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,980
No. What's wrong?

291
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,650
Oh. Nothing. Nothing. Hurry up to study.

292
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,620
Monitor, what are you listening?

293
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,500
Also let me listen.

294
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,570
Eh. Eh. Don't casually call me monitor.

295
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,650
The devil teacher hasn't selected me as monitor.

296
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,090
You have always been the monitor of this class.

297
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,450
You must continue to be the monitor.

298
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
Don't talk about me as if I have the empleomania.

299
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,820
In fact, being a monitor has few benefits.

300
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,130
As a monitor, you can do recreational reading aboveboard,

301
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,380
such as reading your comic books.

302
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,440
You also can let teachers tolerate you a little.

303
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,760
Isn't that enough?

304
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,260
That's right.

305
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,570
OK. I will mange to

306
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,980
be your monitor for another two years.

307
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,820
Eh. Right. Let me show you something great.

308
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:33,980
What?

309
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,090
Isn't it a common cap?

310
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,420
Are you blind? Look at here.

311
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,320
The autograph of the author of Saint

312
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,420
Masami Kurumada.

313
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,180
Really?

314
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,890
Yes.

315
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,570
Mi Qiao.

316
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:48,980
Well.

317
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,090
Where did you get it?

318
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,940
I tell you

319
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,330
I have a cousin in Japan.

320
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,500
She got the autograph after squatting at the entrance of the master's studio

321
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,300
for two days and two nights.

322
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,180
Can you let me copy the autograph?

323
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,570
Also let me keep it as a souvenir.

324
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,090
Oh, oh, oh. Go away.

325
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,010
This is the apple of my eye.

326
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,130
You're lucky to have a look at it.

327
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,380
Cheapskate, why can't I play it for a while?

328
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,180
Eh, Chen Yao.

329
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,120
Why can't I play it for a while?

330
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,060
Why can't I play it for a while?

331
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,530
-I won't let you go if you stain it.
 -Why can't I play it for a while?

332
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,970
-Give it to me.
 -You can't reach it.

333
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,450
Ah. Ah.

334
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,740
What are you doing? What a foul atmosphere!

335
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,850
No. What are you yelling about?

336
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,130
I was splashed with water.

337
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,740
I haven't been worried yet but you have felt worried first.

338
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,810
So ridiculous.

339
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,300
Wu Wenlu still hasn't appointed class committee members by now.

340
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,250
What does he want to do?

341
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,260
The class is in such a mess. He even doesn't care.

342
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,500
He may be a false evil teacher.

343
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,570
OK. Class begins.

344
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,450
Stand up.

345
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,050
Eh. Sit sit sit.

346
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,619
Didn't I say you don't need to stand up?

347
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,619
Mr. Wu, only our class hasn't selected the class committee members.

348
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,540
Can you give us the official appointment?

349
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,210
OK. I know.

350
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,500
Ling Xiangqian, you are the monitor

351
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,680
Seriously?

352
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,440
I was originally the monitor of this class.

353
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,619
That's because

354
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,900
you were in Grade 10 formerly

355
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,930
and now you are in Grade 11.

356
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,500
OK. Lesson Four Protestant Reformation.

357
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,450
Protestant Reformation. In the early 16th century,

358
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,660
the Protestant Reformation initiated by Martin Luther in Germany

359
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,040
was a movement in which as for God, Western Europe...

360
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,540
Drink the milk.

361
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,330
Mom, did you do that?

362
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,380
What?

363
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,020
You know what I mean.

364
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,330
Yes. I went to visit Mr. Wu

365
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,450
to ask him to select you as monitor.

366
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,140
I don't like being in charge.

367
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,260
You don't need to take charge of anything. You only need to be the monitor.

368
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,260
Do you know it?

369
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,440
Only when you become the monitor,

370
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,690
will your teacher pay attention to you and cultivate you.

371
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,330
Then you can defeat Yu Zhouzhou,

372
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,900
and be recommended for admission to Peking University without obstacles all the way.

373
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,050
Mom. I am just in Grade 11.

374
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,560
I don't want to live such a tiring life.

375
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,330
When you are admitted to Peking University,

376
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,140
you can relax yourself

377
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,810
and play however you want.

378
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,540
Drink up.

379
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,740
Hurry up to drink up.

380
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,780
Be quiet. I have something to say.

381
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,140
Be quiet. I have something to say.

382
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,860
Everyone. Be quiet.

383
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,780
Didn't you hear that our Monitor Ling has something to say?

384
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,050
The thing is

385
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,540
that next week, our school will hold the competition of blackboard newspaper,

386
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,540
exactly the blackboard newspaper at the back of every classroom.

387
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,020
In the last competition in our grade,

388
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,020
our class gave up.

389
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,810
Who is good at this

390
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,740
or who has drawn before?

391
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,450
Zheng Yanyi,

392
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,410
you have the art foundation.

393
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,380
Can you do it?

394
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,860
I.

395
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,380
I'd better not.

396
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,450
Zheng Yanyi, I'm asking you

397
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,380
not others.

398
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,860
You Class 3, who else can draw?

399
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,660
You Class 3? What do you mean?

400
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,930
Which class were you in?

401
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,500
It makes sense! Why can you students of Class 2 and Class 3

402
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,900
be  appointed to class leaders?

403
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,020
Instead, we Class 3 have to do hard work.

404
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,260
That's right!

405
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,500
Am I right?

406
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,090
Yes!

407
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,500
It's true.

408
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,090
Well, we shouldn't quibble over such trifles.

409
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,930
We are a family.

410
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,170
Do you know what a family is?

411
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,380
Ok, let our monitor

412
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,570
set an example to our family.

413
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,930
I'm not good at drawing.

414
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,380
It doesn't matter.

415
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,500
What's the meaning of this?

416
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,980
I mean it's your duty to draw the wall-newspaper.

417
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,740
As a monitor, if you can't finish the task,

418
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,740
how can you convince the class of your leadership?

419
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,660
It's reasonable!

420
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,020
I don't care your choice, I tell you!

421
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,900
If you don't draw, just abstain rather than interupt others.

422
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,500
Well, who cares?

423
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,330
I'll inform teachers of that right away.

424
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:39,570
Wait!

425
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,740
Ling Xiangqian, shall we take part in the activity?

426
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,140
It's none of your business!

427
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,090
Do you think Yu Zhouzhou is silly?

428
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,050
She's in a dilemma.

429
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,380
Nobody will appreciate her kindness.

430
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,780
Also, what Ling Xiangqian did was incredible.

431
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,740
Stop here, you're talking about Zhouzhou.

432
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,210
Don't mention Qianqian.

433
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,290
You couldn't imagine her bad temper.

434
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,290
What's the matter?

435
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,570
What happened to your class?

436
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,620
Could you please not separate your class from our class?

437
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,770
I'm nearly sick of that.

438
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,080
Is there a fighting for power in your class?

439
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,140
Alas! Is it a hard work for Ling Xiangqian.

440
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,210
Yeah.

441
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,620
Why did Zhouzhou also get involved in the trouble？

442
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,740
Now the task of drawing wall-newspaper

443
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,140
is entirely delegated to Yu Zhouzhou.

444
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,210
Wall-newspaper?

445
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,930
Well, I thought it was a great deal.

446
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,210
We've finished the work early.

447
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,210
Do me a favor, please.

448
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,210
Collect blackboard poster designs of all classes.

449
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,890
Don't give me the order.

450
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,380
It's you who want to help Zhouzhou, not I.

451
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,290
That will help not only Zhouzhou,

452
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,260
but also Ling Xiangqian.

453
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,620
That will help Ling Xiangqian?

454
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,740
Let's think about the wall-newspaper activity.

455
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,050
It's Ling Xiangqian who delegated the work to Zhouzhou.

456
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,690
If we fail,

457
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,810
who will be to blame?

458
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,500
Ling Xiangqian?

459
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,660
If we succeed and win a prize,

460
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,690
who will be the happiest one?

461
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,980
Ling Xiangqian?

462
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,050
What a self-taught boy!

463
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,450
Upon hearing your words, I was suddenly enlightened.

464
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,690
Tell Yu Zhouzhou

465
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,260
if she can't make it, don't be a hero.

466
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,020
Warn Yu Zhouzhou

467
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,980
not to get mixed up with the mass.

468
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,860
Otherwise, I won't be so easy on her.

469
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:37,930
I get it.

470
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,210
Why did they both talk to me about the matter?

471
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,780
Do you want to leave a message for Yu Zhouzhou?

472
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,140
No, just give this to her.

473
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,350
[portfolio]

474
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,770
[top secret]

475
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,660
Who gave it?

476
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,090
It's a secret.

477
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,050
It's a good picture!

478
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,290
It's fine, I think.

479
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,930
but kind of stiff.

480
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,210
I don't think so.

481
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:58,980
Yes, it looks pretty good.

482
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,540
Yeah.

483
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,050
How happy you were.

484
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,410
Mr. Wu.

485
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,140
Here.

486
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,570
Mr. Wu, I have something to tell you.

487
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,210
Please.

488
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,410
The students of Class 3 seem to be messed up these days.

489
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,800
Why not be stricter with them?

490
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,210
Director Pan takes Class 3 as a key class.

491
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,210
If you blow that off, they may fall behind with others.

492
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,660
Don't worry. I was in charge of classes with less discipine before.

493
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,810
It's not a big deal.

494
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,740
Hey, look at the grass she is drawing. So ugly!

495
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,140
It seems actually out of shape.

496
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,250
Shall we give her a hand?

497
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,740
Forget it!

498
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,980
Well, return to your seat, please.

499
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,380
We'll have a quiz.

500
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,570
Pack away your books.

501
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,450
Yu Zhouzhou.

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,740
Yu Zhouzhou!

503
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,860
If you had invested half your energy spent on drawing

504
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,210
in geography study,

505
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,570
you wouldn't fail to answer the questions.

506
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,450
The test begins.

507
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,810
No one is allowed to look around.

508
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,090
Stop! Stop!

509
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,410
Ms. Shen, the test is over.

510
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,050
Monitor, tell your class teacher to come to my office now.

511
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,290
You Class 3 isn't united at all,

512
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,020
which many teachers have told me.

513
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,380
I put in a good word for you.

514
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,290
But today, Ms. Shen supervised them herself.

515
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,140
Half of students in your class cheated unscrupulously.

516
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,810
Oh, you're exaggerating.

517
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,380
Half of the students cheated?

518
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,930
I guess at most a handful of them did so.

519
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,160
Are you following me?

520
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,500
What I focus on is not the number of students who cheated,

521
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,620
but your class

522
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,410
cohesion.

523
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,290
Your class is a key class

524
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,380
which is not even as good as a regular class now.

525
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,450
I feel too ashamed for that.

526
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,330
Stop!

527
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,410
You...

528
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,740
Is it necessary to get angry?

529
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,690
All is my plan.

530
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,900
I set a trap for them.

531
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,090
A trap?

532
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,900
Tell me about it.

533
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,660
As for the trap...

534
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,570
It's your fault！

535
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,920
Since you insist on running so-called key classes

536
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,660
as a trial, the kids

537
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,980
have been so arrogant.

538
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,900
They ask me how many can go to Peking University early in this term.

539
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,690
We teachers should

540
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,290
cheer them on when they are discouraged.

541
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:57,860
Right?

542
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,860
We need to throw cold water on them when they are too arrogant.

543
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,730
I did that to protect them.

544
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,570
Well, enough is enough.

545
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,860
Enough?

546
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,930
It is far from enough.

547
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,500
Only when they

548
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,920
are soundly defeated and suffered the loss of dignity,

549
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,170
will they be brave after feeling ashamed.

550
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,050
I'll tell them that in gaokao，

551
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,980
key classes and regular ones are equal.

552
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,170
Director Pan, come outside for a second.

553
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,170
Something happened.

554
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,330
A thief slipped in my office?

555
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:45,930
On that evening,

556
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,050
someone stayed in your office for ten minutes.

557
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,620
His face is unclear,

558
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,210
but he is very familiar with our school.

559
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,020
I guess he may be one of our students.

560
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,980
This is the Students Affair Office. Attention, please!

561
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,500
Here is an important notice.

562
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,210
This is Pan Yuansheng.

563
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,330
Today I learned, in Zhenhua High School,

564
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,980
something extremely bad happened.

565
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,040
On the day before this term began,

566
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,690
some student slipped into my office.

567
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,200
We keep the video and solid evidence,

568
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,260
so it's just a matter of time before finding you.

569
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,660
Before the police involve in the investigation,

570
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,930
I hope the student can admit his mistake as soon as possible.

571
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,170
How dare he stole from Director Pan!

572
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,140
Who is he?

573
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,540
Anyone.

574
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,980
Being the director of the students affair office for years,

575
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,090
Pan is sure to offend some students.

576
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,660
You're right.

577
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,620
Besides, how do you know he is a thief?

578
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,290
Something was stolen?

579
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,410
Haven't you heard of it?

580
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,380
What?

581
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,090
I heard that Director Pan lost a large amount of money

582
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,380
so that the police got involved in the investigation.

583
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,500
Who told you?

584
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
Chen Yao in your class.

585
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,740
It's foolish of you to believe her.

586
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,570
Monitor, don't you think Yu Zhouzhu

587
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,490
isn't gifted in drawing at all?

588
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,210
She is simply drawing flowers and grass

589
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,210
without a distinct theme.

590
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,380
How can we compete with others?

591
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,500
I think Yu Zhouzhou is a good painter,

592
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,450
not like those who love to gossip instead of taking actions.

593
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,210
It's not hard.

594
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,540
You are certain the thief is one of your students,

595
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,450
If you file case, we will find him out soon.

596
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,780
It's a better choice for you.

597
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,860
Thanks, it's not a big deal.

598
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,930
We can tackle the problem ourselves.

599
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,330
Besides, nothing was lost.

600
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,540
But it has brought extremely bad influence.

601
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,210
It doesn't matter.

602
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,330
We'll work on it ourselves.

603
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,450
If so,

604
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,260
could you sign your name on my poice record?

605
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,980
Ok.

606
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:12,680
Here?

607
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,170
Yes.

608
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,980
Who did it?

609
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,570
You?

610
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,540
Who did it?

611
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,210
One more time. Who did it?

612
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,540
Hey, Lin Yang.

613
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,570
Sit down!

614
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,330
Mr. Wu, you can't turn a blind eye to our class descipline, can you?

615
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,400
Without enough patience and calmness,

616
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,450
how can you go to Peking University?

617
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,090
It's just a blackboard poster. We can give it up.

618
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,500
We are key class.

619
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,170
Quibbling over trifles with regular classes

620
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,930
makes no sense, right?

621
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,500
Sit down, please.

622
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,740
Let's focus on today's class.

623
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,970
You did't finish the last homework well.

624
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,980
It was you who went to the office of Pan!

625
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,170
Hold it down, will you?

626
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,900
I regretted telling you the secret.

627
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,210
Lin Yang, what is done is done.

628
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,410
The only words I want to tell you...

629
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,660
Admit my mistake to Pan and beg for less punishment.

630
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,780
No, you should insist on your innocence and refuse to admit.

631
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,290
Only in this way, will Pan find no way out.

632
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,170
I tell you, Lin Yang.

633
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,570
If you admit your mistake,

634
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,900
you're likely to be expelled from school.

635
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,170
That's not what I exactly worry about.

636
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,020
I'm afraid if I admit,

637
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,500
I won't be in the same class with Yu Zhouzhou.

638
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,780
Who can protect her?

639
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,570
In the circumstances,

640
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,140
you are still worried about Yu Zhouzhou.

641
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,540
You didn't see when the blackboard poster was ruined,

642
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,900
how sad she was.

643
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,740
Lin Yang, I ask you.

644
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,330
You've done so much for her.

645
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,380
Does it makes sense?

646
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,740
I have no idea.

647
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,020
But I don't want her to be sad.

648
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,020
No time left! No time left!

649
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,780
Director Pan is checking on the second floor.

650
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,900
It will be our turn soon.

651
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,690
What should I do?

652
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,450
As least 3 hours are needed to finish the wall-newspaper.

653
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:41,780
Oops！

654
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,900
Well.

655
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,050
We are so-called key class,

656
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,170
which ranks the last one in both study

657
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,930
and wall-newspaper competition.

658
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,740
It's really a joke.

659
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,620
We just leave our wall-newspaper unfinished?

660
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,290
It's been done.

661
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,500
What do you insist on?

662
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,980
Mr. Wu said we don't need to fuss about trifles.

663
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,900
but if we give in to such a minor difficulty,

664
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,410
I'm not sure what we can insist on in the future.

665
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,050
I don't want to leave any regrets,

666
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,450
so I won't give in.

667
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,660
Neither will I.

668
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,540
Count me in.

669
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,500
Neither will I.

670
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,780
Neither will I.

671
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,540
We'll never give in.

672
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,400
Count me in.

673
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,450
Neither will I.

674
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,050
I'd like to...

675
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,660
Count...count me in.

676
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,140
Director Pan,

677
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,410
could you help me deal with the problem?

678
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,780
The atmosphere is highly commendable.

679
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,780
Keep it up!

680
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,450
Chemistry exercises?

681
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,540
Why do you study chemistry?

682
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,570
Don't you think it is a waste of time?

683
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,780
How about this political exercise?

684
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,410
You should ask your politics teacher

685
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,660
instead of me.

686
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,410
Just do a favor for us.

687
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,060
The wall-newspaper haven't been finished.

688
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,300
Do you intend to gain more time?

689
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,300
Director Pan, please!

690
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,679
Director Pan, Director Pan.

691
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,540
Could you give more time?

692
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,260
We'll finish it soon.

693
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,020
We can't be the last one anymore.

694
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,610
All the other classes have finished painting.

695
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,610
What would other classes think

696
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:22,889
if I extended your time?

697
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,100
Am I still qualified to be the director?

698
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,210
Director Pan, please give us a few more minutes.

699
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:25,929
Just a couple of minutes.

700
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,500
No one can stop the  blackboard competition

701
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,130
for any reason. No way!

702
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,210
Director Pan.

703
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,739
I know who sneaked into your office.

704
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,100
Who?

705
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,060
Can we talk in your office?

706
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,449
I'll tell you everything.

707
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,780
Go!

708
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,690
Why hasn't Lin Yang come back? School is over.

709
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,340
Isn't that perfect?

710
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,260
If he comes back one day later,

711
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,210
we have one more day to
 prepare for the blackboard competition.

712
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,450
Zhouzhou.

713
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:17,930
What's up?

714
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,600
If you hadn't stepped forward that day,

715
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,820
the blackboard competition would have been lost.

716
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,580
So the rest,

717
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,890
I will leave it to you.

718
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,260
OK.

719
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,580
I'm leaving. Zhouzhou.

720
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,820
Bye.

721
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,850
Why are you here?

722
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,540
If I don't guess wrong,

723
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,060
you splashed the paint on the  blackboard, right?

724
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,930
Fine,  let me tell you.

725
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,300
Yes. It's me.

726
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,780
So are you going to do it again, right?

727
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,300
How can I?

728
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,090
I almost broke my bones, okay?

729
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,540
Give this to Zhouzhou for me.

730
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,500
Don't tell her I'm here.

731
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,340
Why don't you go by yourself?

732
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,780
I got it.

733
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,740
You want to pursue Yu Zhouzhou.

734
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,100
Do you want me to tell her for you?

735
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,930
If I were to pursue her,

736
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,100
I could tell her by myself.

737
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,170
There is no need for you to say it.

738
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,820
So what do you mean?

739
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,370
Today is my last day in the arts class.

740
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,500
I don't know how to tell her.

741
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,060
Yan Yi told me everything that happened in the afternoon.

742
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,780
So you sneaked into Pan's office

743
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,810
and changed the division table for Yu Zhouzhou?

744
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,740
Good. Lin Yang.

745
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,060
To pursue a girl at any cost.

746
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,170
You are faithful to your feelings.

747
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,540
I admire you.

748
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,260
I've known Yu Zhouzhou since I was in kindergarten.

749
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,740
If I wanted to pursue her, I would have already done.

750
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,820
I came to the arts class to protect her.

751
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:07,820
That's all?

752
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,690
Yes.

753
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,500
It's no fun at all.

754
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,780
But how is Pan going to punish you?

755
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,540
I'll go back to Class Two tomorrow.

756
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:18,980
Anything else?

757
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,300
He said I couldn't do it again.

758
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,500
How could it be?

759
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,850
Cut the crap.

760
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,780
You'd better get the food there quickly.

761
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,980
Lin Yang!

762
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,100
You can go back to Class Two and don't worry.

763
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,300
As for Yu Zhouzhou,

764
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,890
I'll protect her for you.

765
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,890
I didn't mean it.

766
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,980
I just want to draw a sun

767
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,410
next to the Star and Moon Goddess.

768
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,130
To make her look a little better.

769
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,020
The student of Class Three who is in the classroom?

770
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,500
I didn't mean to make things so bad.

771
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,260
Sorry. Sorry.

772
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,450
Why are you crying?

773
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,980
Hey. Why don't you comfort me?

774
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,540
Mi Qiao.

775
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,260
What?

776
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,370
The best consolation in the world is not to tell each other

777
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,130
that everything will be fine,

778
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,340
but with a bitter face and saying,

779
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,650
“What are you crying for?

780
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,690
Look. I am worse than you.”

781
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,820
Nonsense.

782
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,300
Come on.

783
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,210
Ah.

784
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,640
Oops.

785
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,020
Hey.

786
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Yu Zhouzhou! Stop!

787
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,100
Yu Zhouzhou!

788
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,450
Don't catch a cold.

789
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,780
Are you okay?

790
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,880
This is for you. Wear it if you are my friend.

791
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,610
Others wouldn't have such a great treatment.

792
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,210
Do you have any requirements for giving me this?

793
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,300
Of course.

794
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,540
The requirement is

795
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,200
to wear the hat backward like me.

796
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,170
Your big head.

797
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,500
Your big head.

798
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,170
Stealing the keys.

799
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,930
Altering the division table in private.

800
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,130
How do you dare!

801
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,370
I'm wrong, Director Pan.

802
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,500
Don't call me the director. I'm not your director.

803
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,650
Get the hell out of here with your schoolbag right now!

804
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,580
You are expelled from school.

805
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,980
Hello? Lin Yang's parents?

806
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,300
I am Pan Yuansheng, the director of the school.

807
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,260
I officially inform you that

808
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,650
Lin Yang has been expelled from our school.

809
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,210
Lin Yang!

810
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,450
What are you thinking?

811
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,820
He sneaked into my office in the middle of the night

812
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,580
and altered the division table in private.

813
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,100
His behaviors have seriously affected

814
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,740
the school ethos of Zhen Hua High School.

815
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,450
Go.

816
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,370
Are you sure it works?

817
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,340
It can only be relied on now.

818
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,060
If your father takes out a stick,

819
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,980
you pretend to cry and drop a few tears.

820
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,410
Once your mother compromises and stops your father,

821
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,680
then we are halfway there.

822
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,020
Or I will go up later,

823
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,780
until they are asleep.

824
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,850
Coward!

825
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,580
Does it work for you to hide?

826
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,980
Well.

827
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,610
How about you go up first with the light as a signal.

828
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,060
If the light is off, I will go home.

829
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,370
Otherwise, that means something happened to you.

830
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,500
I will rush up immediately.

831
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,450
I  reckon when your father is going to take out a stick,

832
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,290
I will immediately knock on the door
 to borrow your physics notes.

833
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,410
Don't look at me. That's all I can do.

834
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,340
Then you need to get the timing right.

835
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,500
Go. Go. Go.

836
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,780
Dad. Mom.

837
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,100
You're still awake.

838
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,730
Director Pan called me today.

839
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,650
Dad.

840
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,170
Sorry!

841
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,650
Don't need to say.

842
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,130
It's mom and dad's fault.

843
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,600
Yang. Sorry!

844
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,020
Sorry to let you suffer.

845
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,260
Mom, what‘s up?

846
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,970
If you don't want to study science you can talk to us.

847
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,260
Why did you go back to school secretly
 to change the division table?

848
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,410
I was wrong.

849
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,980
Yang.

850
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,120
I admit that

851
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,300
your mother and I were too arbitrary in this matter.

852
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,370
We made the decision for you

853
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,450
without asking your opinion.

854
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,340
We apologize to you.

855
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,930
I have discussed this with your mother.

856
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:30,540
We will go to school to plead for you tomorrow.

857
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,100
We have a great responsibility in this matter.

858
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,820
If your director punishes you,

859
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,540
I'll take care of it for you.

860
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,260
I was wrong.

861
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,890
No, you were not. Come.

862
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,300
I won't force you anymore.

863
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,780
Mom, sorry!

864
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,890
I won't force you with a clipboard.

865
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,820
It's good to be home.

866
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,850
We thought you are running away from home.

867
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,450
If you don't come back,

868
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,740
we'll call the police.

869
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,260
Mom, I was wrong.

870
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,580
I won't do it again.

871
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:20,980
Good.

872
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:49,610
It's time for class.

873
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,690
It's time for class.

874
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,130
The class is beginning.

875
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:58,010
Stand up!

876
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,500
Hello! Sir!

877
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,060
Sit down!

878
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,300
Let's continue with the practice test today.

879
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,370
Take out your test papers.

880
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:56,950
