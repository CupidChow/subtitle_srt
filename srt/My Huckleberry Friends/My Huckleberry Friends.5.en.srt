So this is your barbecue stall?

I'm its major shareholder.

56
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,530
I bought this grill.

57
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,300
Then what about your school?

58
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,250
I planned to earn my living in the society,

but my dad got me back.

First, work in his company.

62
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,650
Second, go back to school.

63

Finally we both conceded.

64
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,980
So I went to a vocational high school not far away from here,

65

I learn the hotel management.

78

Tourism and hotel catering management.

79
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,980
Right! Zhouzhou,

80
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,060
I told them I had a childhood friend

81
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,530
who was really awesome.

82
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,650
They didn't believe it.

83
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,810
I was seven years old then,

84
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,010
and was cornered by a bunch of rogues.

85
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,580
At that time, she rushed towards us

86
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,650
and all those rogues just ran away in no time.

87

From then on, Zhouzhou has been

88

That was a long time ago.

Thank you.

Zhouzhou,

94
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,980
I didn't believe it was you early today.

95
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,300
You've really changed a lot.

96
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,860
But you smile is still the same.

97
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,860
But you've grown up, Benben.

What's wrong?

105
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,220
Is it your Internet nickname?

106
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,060
It's my real name! Does it sound strange?

107
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,220
No, it's nice.

108
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,140
But who will call such a name in reality?

109
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,220
Well, then you just call me by my childhood nickname.

110
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,500
But not in front of others.

111
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,930

Oh, it's good if you can come back.

115

But if you can't,

116
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,980
just prepare something for me.

117

119
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,810
Can you bring you girlfriend home this year?

120

Let me have a look.

Dad, what's wrong with you?

122
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,740
You didn't allow me to find a girlfriend at college, did you?

123
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,740
I didn't advise you to do so, but I never prohibited it.

124
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,140
Okay, bye-bye.

Yes.

141
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,580
I've seen it this morning.

142
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,850
What?

143
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,050
A valuable secret to you.

144
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:10,930
Say it.

145
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,020
Hurry up!

146
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,860
This morning, Yu Zhouzhou got off the motorbike

147
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,020
of a strange man in public.

148
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,090
And this man is tall and handsome,

149
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,900
who is said to be from a rich family.

150
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,930
The point is that he has courted Yu Zhouzhou for years.

151
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,650
You're telling the story, right?

152
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,300
I saw it in person!

153
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,330
I saw it, too.

154
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,810
You think he's handsome?

155
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,650
Anyway,

156
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,370
he's a hard nut to crack.

157
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,740
He's been so close to Zhouzhou just in a couple of days.

158
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,300
Help me investigate this man.

159
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,050
And your milk this month is on me.

160
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,330
I'm not that kind of man.

161
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,140
And that of the next month.

162
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,970
Deal.

163
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,810
Among those candidates,

164
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,810
you're the only one whose family info is incomplete.

165
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,250
So now we can't apply for your passports

166
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,620
and visas together.

167
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,090
Hope you can fill it in and submit it quickly.

168
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,370
Director Pan, can I skip it?

169
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,580
If you skip it, you can't join the return visit.

170

Don't worry, this information is not publicly available.

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,050
In your grade, only you and another student of Class Two

174
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,770
are selected, which is quite rare.

175
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,930
Hurry up. It's due next week.

176
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,530
This time, Zhou Shenran

177
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,490
will be the youngest student representative of Zhen Hua

178
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,250
to pay the return visit to the Japanese school. It's really an honor of our class.

179
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,460
Why him?

180
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,900
-You guys should
-Can't it be Lin Yang?

181
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,330
-learn from him and try to get the chance next time.
-I saw his mom this morning.

182
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,180
She comes to our school every day.

183
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,300
Maybe she's asked for someone's help.

184
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,900
Maybe.

185
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,860
Shenran,

186
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,250
can you bring me some Garage Kits

187
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,860
from Japan this time?

188
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,050
No problem.

189
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,740
And what about magazines? I watched an anime before,

190
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,300
and I've always wanted its original magazines. Can you help me?

191
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,050
Sure.

192
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,090
It's said Yu Zhouzhou will go there, too.

193
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,130
And she was specially selected by that famous Japanese school.

194
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,650
She's so awesome!

195
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,810
Yu Zhouzhou?

196
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,580
That Yu Zhouzhou of Class Three?

197
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,810
Zhou Shenran, Yu Zhouzhou.

198
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,250
You two are really matched.

199
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,050
If you two have a baby,

200
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,700
he or she can be called Zhou Zhouzhou.

201
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,860
Yu Zhouzhou is just the unwanted.

202
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,930
What did you say?

203
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,900
Let's go…

204
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,940
Mi Qiao calls us to play basketball.

205
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,090
Nice!

206
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,500
Brilliant!

207
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,380
I said I was not good at it.

208
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,620
Why do you have to choose me?

209
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,450
You used to be a long-distance runner.

210
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,410
Sports are quite similar.

211
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,180
Right, Lin Yang?

212
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,260
Yeah… One more shot.

213
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,820
One more shot.

214
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,010
Nice!

215
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,890
Nice…

216
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,060
Enough…

217
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,570
Just go ahead if you have anything to ask.

218
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,850
Yu…

219
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,210
Don't ask me about Yu Zhouzhou.

220
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,060
And that…

221
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,090
And I also don't know who that man is.

222
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,420
I only know he's from a vocational high school.

223
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,770
How could Zhouzhou get along with that kind of people?

224
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,050
How can I get along with the man like you?

225
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,980
What do you mean?

226
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,060
How dare you ask me that? We promised to celebrate together that day.

227
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,380
I had been waiting for your cake.

228
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,570
But it turned out to be a failure.

229
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,740
And that man just took the chance to take Zhouzhou away.

230
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,860
Were it not for…

231
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,650
What did Zhouzhou say?

232
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,300
You really runs into a rival this time.

233
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,060
Seems like he's known Zhouzhou for a long time.

234
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,620
I've known Zhouzhou since kindergarten.

235
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,380
And you're still friends now?

236
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,090
What happened in kindergarten was kind of complex.

237
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,420
Stop it.

238
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
It's not important.

239
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,530
I heard that you got

240
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,820
the fund for the Anime Club.

241
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,300
Right, you remind me of it.

242
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,420
I asked Chu Tiankuo for that before.

243
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,450
Seems like it's about to be allocated.

244
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,060
And it's said to be kept by us for the moment.

245
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,080
How should we use it?

246
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,890
One side is the friendship,

247
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,940
and the other side is money.

248
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,760
It's really hard to choose.

249
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,420
You get the intelligence for us,

250
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,860
and we'll help you get the fund.

251
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,530
I can get the intelligence for you,

252
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,570
but I can also get the fund by myself.

253
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,860
Lin Yang,

254
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,570
I just wanna ask you one thing.

255
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,530
What on earth happened between you and Zhouzhou?

256
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,380
Well, Mi Qiao,

257
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,940
you really shot like Francis just now.

258
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,380
Give it one more try, and I'll teach you that.

259
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,210
Lin Yang,

260
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,770
From the moment you sneaked into Mr. Pan's office

261
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,380
I knew something must have happened between you two.

262
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
You didn't say anything, and nor did she.

263
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,410
I'm not sticking to your gossip.

264
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,210
If you like her,

265
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,450
I could be your matchmaker.

266
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,330
And if you made her mad,

267
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,770
I could be your mediator.

268
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,890
But you must tell me something

269
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,210
before letting me help you.

270
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,300
Indeed,

271
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,330
nothing happened between Yu Zhouzhou and me.

272
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,980
Alright, forget about it.

273
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,500
Bye-bye.

274
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,970
Something did happen,

275
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,620
but I can't tell it to others.

276
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,330
Then come to me after you can tell me that.

277
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,500
One,

278
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,180
two,

279
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,860
three.

280
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,420
Three yuan and fifty cents.

281
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,980
Enough to buy the spicy hot pot.

282
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,210
Excuse me!

283
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,820
My spicy hot pot!

284
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,530
Who are you hiding from?

285
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,740
No…

286
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,560
No one.

287
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,000
Really?

288
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,060
Then why did you run away when you saw my car?

289
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,010
I-I'm hurrying home to have dinner.

290
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,330
You can't lie to your girlfriend.

291
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,180
Stop!

292
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,060
Are you flirting with a man

293
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,650
by force in broad daylight?

294
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,500
Your new girlfriend?

295
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,690
What?

296
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,090
Are you playing a love triangle?

297
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,450
It sucks.

298
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,890
Hey…

299
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,760
You're welcome.

300
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,570
Just treat me to the spicy hot pot.

301
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,450
You want me to keep it secret just by two skewers of chicken wings?

302
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,450
Not enough.

303
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,380
I saw everything just now.

304
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,980
Since you're so mysterious

305
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,820
and have a girl with you,

306
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,450
I'll mind you seriously.

307
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,210
Zhouzhou is no longer the one you knew before.

308
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,060
It's not that easy to court her.

309
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,940
First of all, you gotta pass me.

310
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,980
Got it?

311
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,620
How long have you known Zhouzhou?

312
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,010
For two months.

313
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,820
Not that long, right?

314
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,010
Alright, it's more than one month.

315
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,260
How do you know that?

316
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,420
I knew her when I was six.

317
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,180
It has been more than ten years.

318
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,650
You'll test me for Zhouzhou? Seriously?

319
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,860
So what?

320
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,090
I haven't known her for so long,

321
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,010
but we just hit it off straight away.

322
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,060
You've known her for ten years,

323
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,530
but I didn't hear her mention you before.

324
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,010
Seems like you're just ordinary friends.

325
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,690
Did I put too much chilli for you?

326
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,820
Why are you so aggressive?

327
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,890
But,

328
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,330
why does Zhouzhou have so many childhood sweethearts?

329
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,090
Right,

330
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,380
do you know Lin Yang, too?

331
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,530
If you say so.

332
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,130
That's good.

333
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,610
So you two just compete fairly.

334
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,420
This is the best way.

335
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,940
So he asked you to come to me?

336
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,420
None of your business.

337
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,890
I know he dared not to do so.

338
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,410
he doesn't deserve it.

339
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,450
C'mon, let's drink.

340
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:50,980
OK.

341
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,060
I'm going to the rest room.

342
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,890
I'll go with you.

343
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,450
Okay.

344
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,690
Zhou Shenran is young,

345
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,300
and kind of naughty.

346
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,210
Please take care of him, Lin Yang.

347
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,530
Sir, he's fine in our class.

348
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,980
Mom said, I should fight back

349
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,080
no matter who bullied me.

350
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,330
What on earth did she teach you?

351
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,330
It's alright. Lin Yang is also there,

352
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,010
so no one will bully Ranran. Huh?

353
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:32,940
Yeah.

354
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,450
Right,

355
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
there are two in your grade selected to go to japan.

356
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,090
Who's the other guy? Is it Chu Tiankuo?

357
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,740
It's Yu Zhouzhou.

358
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,210
I wonder how she resorted to the teacher.

359
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,770
She's as disgusting as her mom.

360
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,330
Ranran!

361
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,300
Sir, I'm full.

362
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,090
Zhou Shenran,

363
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,420
I just bought Chinese Paladin 3 these days.

364
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,210
Do you wanna have a look?

365
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,820
Really?

366
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,010
We'll leave for a while.

367
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:57,940
Let's go.

368
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,300
See?

369
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,330
They're still kids.

370
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,010
Where are we going?

371
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,330
Zhou Shenran,

372
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,060
What did you say inside?

373
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,860
I didn't hear it well, can you repeat it?

374
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,210
Yu Zhouzhou is as annoying as her mother.

375
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,180
Yes, this is what you said,

376
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,770
say it one more time.

377
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,650
You also think I am right, correct?

378
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,370
Yu Zhouzhou is a bitch,

379
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,210
same as her mother.

380
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,260
You say it one more time!

381
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,940
Yang, what are you doing?

382
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,760
You say it again!

383
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,300
You like Yu Zhouzhou as expected,

384
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,980
you transferred to the art class for her!

385
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,300
Ranran, what are you talking about?

386
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,060
What do you mean by transfering to the art class?

387
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,890
You revised the division table for Yu Zhouzhou?

388
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,500
Say something!

389
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,090
You did! You dare to do but dare not to admit!

390
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,610
Everyone knows in the whole school!

391
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,820
Believe or not, I will beat you?

392
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,450
What are you trying to do?

393
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,500
Lin Yang's mom,

394
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,690
you should figure this out.

395
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,090
There is no big deal that Ranran was bullied,

396
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,820
Lin Yang is undergoing adolescence.

397
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,130
If taking a false step,

398
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,420
it would be difficult for him to come back to the right track.

399
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,090
Yang, you speak!

400
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,330
This is true?

401
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,060
So what?

402
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,410
This is my freedom.

403
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,820
How come Yu Zhouzhou can go to the art class,

404
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,570
but I cannot?

405
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,500
One this issue of Yu Zhouzhou,

406
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,130
you surely don't have freedom!

407
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,450
[Application form for Chinese citizens going abroad for private purposes]

408
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,210
( Main family members)

409
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,450
You are not allowed to fill that form!

410
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,770
I don't want to go with you!

411
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,980
I don't want to go with you either.

412
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,820
You are like your mother,

413
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,260
who does not let go when holding onto someone who can help to climb up.

414
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,940
Lin Yang's parents said,

415
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,650
they will not let Lin Yang to contact with you.

416
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,530
Her mother has made a promise to my mother.

417
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,060
Go away!

418
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,500
Yu Zhouzhou, you remember it!

419
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,740
He is my father, not yours!

420
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,780
My mom said,

421
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,980
you are a bastard.

422
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,020
I should have beaten you to death yesterday.

423
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,450
Teacher, Lin Yang hit me first!

424
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,859
I don't care who started the fight,

425
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,290
the nature is the same.

426
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,810
Why did they fight each other?

427
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,690
Zhou Shenran is unpleasing to my eyes,

428
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,080
I wanted to hit him long time ago.

429
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,290
Yu Zhouzhou was just passing by.

430
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,740
Lin Yang, just be quiet!

431
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,130
Let's do this way,

432
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,980
two of you should apologize to each other,

433
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,260
let it go.

434
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,320
Why should I apologize?

435
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,500
I did nothing wrong.

436
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,020
I am going to look for my mom,

437
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,290
you are all bullying me.

438
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,690
I feel dizzy,

439
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,690
I need to go to hospital.

440
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,740
You go looking for your mom,

441
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,660
after that I will hit you again!

442
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,770
So you can get all the diagnoses you need in the hosital!

443
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,570
Lin Yang!

444
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,330
Yu Zhouzhou,

445
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,540
what on earth is going on,

446
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,660
can't you say something?

447
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,170
It is personal matter between me and Zhou Shenran,

448
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:05,930
it has nothing to do with her!

449
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,780
Lin Yang, if you are having this kind of attitude,

450
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,740
I will ask your parents to come over.

451
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,410
Sorry.

452
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,900
Zhou Shenran, I am sorry.

453
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,740
Why are you apologizing to him?

454
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,290
Lin Yang, sorry.

455
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,210
It's all my fault.

456
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,890
What's the matter with Zhou Shenran,

457
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,620
why insulting Yu Zhuzhou suddenly?

458
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,620
Thinking about when youn were young,

459
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,690
weren't you like cursing too?

460
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,290
It makes sense.

461
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,620
Where is Zhouzhou?

462
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,260
She was picked up by your rival in love.

463
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,690
I helped you to ask around,

464
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,050
his name is Murong Chenzhang,

465
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,330
who is a celebrity in vocational high school.

466
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,260
It is said, he already has his own business

467
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,620
when he is young.

468
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,050
It is not business,

469
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,140
but still a little better than Lin Yang.

470
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,260
What are you staring at?

471
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,400
He is childhood sweetheart of Zhouzhou,

472
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,780
you are also childhood sweetheart of zhouzhou.

473
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,090
Therefore, Yu Zhouzhou did nothing when she is young but

474
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,860
fooling around riding bamboo stitcks, didn't she?

475
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,410
Childhood sweetheart?

476
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,410
Zhouzhou told you this?

477
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,050
Or what?

478
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,900
Therefore, those advantages of yours

479
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,810
are nothing in front of him, don't you know this?

480
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,490
You should think about other methods quickly.

481
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,210
Where did this guy come out?

482
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,260
The procedures are done,

483
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,620
you don't have to go to school start from next week.

484
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,090
Why don't you let me know in advance?

485
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,410
Who asked you to do this?

486
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,540
Me.

487
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,130
I don't transfer!

488
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,320
You cannot be with Yu Zhouzhou anymore.

489
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,570
You cannot decide who I be friend with,

490
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,020
I am no longer a child!

491
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,900
Are you just friends simply?

492
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,090
You withdrew from the competition for her in kindergarten,

493
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,660
you did not want to go to affiliated high school for her in middle school,

494
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,260
now you making your own choice by transfering to the art class for her.

495
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,850
Are you burying your future

496
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,810
for her?

497
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,900
But I owe her, you know that!

498
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,330
You don't owe anyone.

499
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,050
I know what happened has injured both of you deeply.

500
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,980
But that was an accident.

501
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,140
You cannot bury your future

502
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,500
because of an accident.

503
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,170
Mom, dad, I promise you.

504
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,140
I will not be like this anymore.

505
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,210
Can this be the last time?

506
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,490
Yang, you promised me to leave Yu Zhouzhou,

507
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,660
but you have been lying to me.

508
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,930
It is impossible for me  to trust you anymore.

509
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,170
You cannot force me to do something I don't want to do.

510
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,450
You have been lying this much,

511
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,780
you don't have the right to negotiate with us.

512
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:43,900
Zhouzhou,

513
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,380
I have run out of chilli powder,

514
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,020
can you help me to buy some overthere at the store?

515
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,380
Ok.

516
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,500
The owner of that store is my friend.

517
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,860
Here you go.

518
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,330
I need to speak to her.

519
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,690
My words don't count, do they?

520
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,650
I asked you to go away from Yu Zhouzhou.

521
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,660
I have to talk to her!

522
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,450
I will deliver the message for you.

523
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,260
It's one-year anniversary of the death of Zhouzhou's mother tomorrow,

524
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,450
I don't want her to be too sorrowful.

525
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,780
You don't want her to be too sad?

526
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,210
Lin Yang,

527
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,740
don't try to put feathers in your cap.

528
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,540
Mi Qiao doesn't know,

529
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,620
Zheng Yanyi doesn't know,

530
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,810
so you think the whole world doesn't know.

531
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,770
Zhouzhou's mom died because of you!

532
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,810
I am transfering to another school.

533
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,160
You should be gone long time ago.

534
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,540
Zhouzhou's mom died because of me,

535
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,080
Zhouzhou has all the reasons to hate me.

536
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,860
If staying beside Zhouzhou

537
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,370
only reminds her about these things,

538
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,010
then I am willing to leave her.

539
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,090
Now we are talking!

540
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,290
If not because of what happened to Zhouzhou,

541
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,140
we might become friends.

542
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,780
You took great pains,

543
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,560
even setting barbecue booth for Zhouzhou.

544
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,980
Who do you think you are?

545
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,780
Talking about protecting Zhouzhou, you are too far to beat me.

546
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,040
Such a relief!

547
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,500
We shall meet again some day.

548
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,330
Never meet again!

549
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,140
The last person I want to meet is you!

550
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,290
If I see you coming back again for Zhouzhou.

551
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
I will keep my promise.

552
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,740
Thank you for keeping me company today.

553
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,380
Thank you.

554
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,660
I will take you out tomorrow again.

555
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,170
Alright.

556
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,290
Who is calling you?

557
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,020
What are you doing?

558
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,380
I am annoyed that he is badgering you.

559
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,140
Whatever he does cannot compensate

560
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,170
the harm he has done to you.

561
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,080
That matter has passed,

562
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,050
I don't blame him anymore.

563
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,740
It has passed? I don't think so.

564
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,450
My barbecue booth has been in front of your school gate

565
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,570
for more than a month,

566
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,860
don't you think I noticed when

567
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,290
you cried or  smiled,

568
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,780
and when you were happy or sad?

569
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,660
I am ok now,

570
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,050
you all can leave me alone.

574

don't forget to take with us tomorrow.

Yes.

maybe she will forget about tomorrow.

Yes.

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,380
That's impossible!

Alas, we don't need to worry about her, actually.

589

Zhouzhou is not a little child anymore.

590

How could she forget this special day?

591

Where shall we go?

592
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,450
Give your family a call and tell them you may go back late today.

593
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:02,800
OK.

594
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,540
How do you like it, Zhouzhou?

595
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,380
It's a nice place, isn't it?

596
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,370
My girlfriend took me here.

597
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,740
Did you admit that I'm your girlfriend?

598
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,410
Go.

599
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:17,770
Would you like some wine?

600
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:18,930
Zhouzhou doesn't drink.

Three glasses of juice, please.

602

Zhouzhou, let's sit over there.

603
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,770
Zhouzhou, you can sit at the inside place.

604
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,370
Thank you.

605

608
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,900
Can I choose a song?

609
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,380
Of course!

610
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,050
