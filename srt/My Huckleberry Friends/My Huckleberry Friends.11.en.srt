My Huckleberry Friends

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,180
My Huckleberry Friends
 adapted from BA YUE CHANG AN's novel of the same title 30 series

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,420
Is this your best move?

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,340
Are you afraid?

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,820
If you are afraid, we can stop here

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,740
and you need to pay the bill directly.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,500
I'm sorry,

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,090
that's exactly what I'm good at.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,820
It looks like you can't make up your mistake,

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,660
but have to buy another bucket of chicken wings.

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,540
Usually, before fighting, swordsmen

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,770
will drink wine to boost their courage.

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,570
Do you want to drink cola?

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,410
No need to.

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,540
It will occupy my stomach.

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,090
It will burp and affect my performance.

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,930
All grudges will be written off today.

19
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,290
No mercy.

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,090
Come on.

21
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,760
Three

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,570
Two

23
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,450
One. Start

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,289
Mi Qiao, hurry up

25
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:28,060
Go go go

26
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,289
I overestimated you.

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,660
Hurry up

28
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,100
Mi Qiao, come on.

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,850
Look there.

30
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,979
Great,

31
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,340
I win.

32
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,610
I haven't eaten such delicious food for several days,

33
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,100
but luckily, I eat a bucket of chicken wings for free.

34
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,340
Such a competition

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,460
is exactly

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,460
an act of  caring.

37
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,530
Bye bye.

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,810
Stop.

39
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,610
What are you doing?

40
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,579
Are you really chasing me.

41
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,810
Don't chase.

42
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,090
Stop there.

43
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,450
Stay.

44
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,220
Stop chasing.

45
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,700
Stop, I say to stay

46
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,700
You really should stop chasing me.

47
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,170
Why

48
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,810
I chickened out but you are still chasing?

49
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,300
It's too late.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,170
-Gosh. -I say

51
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,520
to stay. Stop.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,579
Why are you so bossy?

53
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,700
Enough,

54
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,530
knock it off.

55
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,220
What will you do after chased me?

56
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,530
I'm gonna wear you out.

57
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,010
Oh my god.

58
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,079
Stop.

59
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,010
Stop there.

60
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,810
Halt.

61
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,010
Stop pretending fainting.

62
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,890
Mi Qiao.

63
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,250
Mi Qiao.

64
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,530
Don't frighten me, Mi Qiao, wake up.

65
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,940
Mi Qiao,

66
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,170
wake up.

67
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,650
Is anybody there?

68
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,370
Mi Qiao

69
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,700
[11 Not that much tricks]

70
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,860
Don't speed up infusion, don't pull out the needle.

71
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,700
I remember.

72
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,010
If this IV bottle almost empty,

73
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,090
please ask me to change another one.

74
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,650
OK.

75
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:13,860
Besides,

76
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,140
her father is on the way,

77
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,089
you can't let her slip away again.

78
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,459
OK, I promise.

79
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,020
At this rate,

80
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,330
even if Naruto is completed, I can't leave hospital.

81
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,650
Please speed it up,

82
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,420
just a little bit.

83
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,770
No, I can't.

84
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,490
Why?

85
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,530
You have heart trouble,

86
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,490
if I speed it up, you'll die.

87
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,520
Don't let them fool you.

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,490
Well,

89
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,930
from the perspective of science,

90
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,020
the rate of infusion for

91
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,480
ordinary heart patients should below

92
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,860
50 drips per minute.

93
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,810
This kind of rate is obviously unreasonable.

94
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,020
No, you can't.

95
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,900
Come on.

96
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:51,980
Dad.

97
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,490
Sweetheart,

98
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,530
you are awake,

99
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,250
how are you feeling?

100
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,980
I'm fine.

101
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,250
Sorry, Mr. Mi, it's all my fault.

102
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,490
I told you,

103
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,980
Don't run, don't hang about,

104
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,130
you never listen to me.

105
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,490
I will suspend your schooling

106
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,320
and make you go home and rest for a while.

107
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,860
Come on, dad,

108
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,700
I just run a little faster today.

109
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,700
I'm OK.

110
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,420
Mr. Mi,

111
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,050
Mi Qiao's disease is that serious?

112
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,570
Who are you?

113
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,210
He, he,

114
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,020
he is my classmate.

115
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,210
He sent me to the hospital.

116
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,250
Thank you.

117
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,250
You are welcome.

118
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,250
On the way, I was thinking

119
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,620
if Mi Qiao

120
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,770
Dad, it's not that bad.

121
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,580
I promise,

122
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,050
I will not do that again.

123
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,650
It's fine, dad.

124
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,980
You silly girl.

125
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,890
I want to eat some snacks.

126
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,650
Where is my motorcycle?

127
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,700
You bastard,

128
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,250
You made me walk two hours to go to the office.

129
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,620
Don't hit me.

130
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,490
Stop.

131
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,330
Excuse me, excuse me.

132
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,620
Where is the motorbike?

133
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,900
I was in a hurry then,

134
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,970
now I don't know where it was dragged to.

135
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,900
My half-day wage is reduced because of my lateness.

136
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,980
Dragging motorbike will cost another half salary.

137
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,900
Do you think I'm an easy money earner?

138
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,420
That's your money,

139
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,580
I haven't taken it.

140
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,760
You say that again.

141
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,650
My dad actually gives you money,

142
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,860
you shouldn't bragging about it.

143
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,250
That little money

144
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,900
doesn't satisfy me

145
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,090
and it couldn't afford my consumption of wine.

146
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,850
Which hospital

147
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,860
would hire drunk nurses?

148
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,700
I just sip a little while resting.

149
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,770
Leave me alone.

150
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:40,770
Well,

151
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,650
you should leave me alone too.

152
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,050
Today, I will sleep over there.

153
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,090
Well, well,

154
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,370
you still use that trick.

155
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:47,740
Come on,

156
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,530
I will call that dad tomorrow

157
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,330
to give you more money next month.

158
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,300
Please buy some good wine.

159
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,900
I don't have enough money to afford you to see a doctor.

160
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,250
You need to find my motorbike.

161
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,210
OK, I know.

162
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,420
Are you drinking?

163
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,580
Why are you here?

164
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,460
I can't wait.

165
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,900
Is your father conciliating?

166
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,860
He is so worried about you.

167
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,300
He is running for the procedures.

168
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,900
He is such kind of man

169
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,250
who is so sensitive.

170
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,740
Is that your father?

171
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,650
Kind of.

172
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,580
Well,

173
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,580
who is that dad?

174
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,090
Another father.

175
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,700
Cool.

176
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,020
They couldn't compete with your dad,

177
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,050
a handshake

178
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,409
almost break my hand.

179
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,530
That's because you play tricks on me,

180
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,040
it's kind for him without hitting you.

181
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,580
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,140
But looking you are so active now,

183
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,860
you should be alright.

184
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,860
Don't tell anyone I have heart disease,

185
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,180
especially Zhouzhou.

186
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,580
Why are you keeping it from Zhouzhou?

187
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,490
My illness is like influenza or fever

188
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,860
attacks me several times in a short period.

189
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,460
She will be frightened if you tell her.

190
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,140
To be fair,

191
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,370
I will not tell her

192
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,460
you make me in hospital.

193
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,250
Deal?

194
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,370
Deal.

195
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,740
I want to hear your vow,

196
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,620
more vicious one is better.

197
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,740
I swear,

198
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,140
I will never tell Zhouzhou,

199
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,700
if I tell her，

200
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,770
I will lose every fight,

201
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,890
loose bowels once I eat barbecue,

202
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,940
and be caught when I skip even one class.

203
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,419
What do you think?

204
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,370
Not bad.

205
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,820
You are out of the ward again.

206
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,690
I'm sorry.

207
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,059
I was looking for the toilet,

208
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,520
and I couldn't find it since I left here for a long time.

209
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,130
True warrior,

210
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,690
dare to face the bleak life,

211
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,010
dare to face dripping blood.

212
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,300
Who are these grieved people and happy individuals.

213
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,380
Yet good fortune often is created for mundane people.

214
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,890
Lin Yang,

215
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,450
you supposed to stay in the classroom.

216
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,380
What are you doing here?

217
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,690
Morning reading, do you understand?

218
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,420
Now, I'm an image ambassador of Zhen Hua  High School.

219
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,450
Image ambassador?

220
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,570
With the passage of time, washing

221
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,440
He means his latest photo with Zhouzhou.

222
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,420
Lin Yang,

223
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,640
come down.

224
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,770
You two are on the opposite sides of the website,

225
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,570
and both of you have side faces on the photo.

226
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,180
-You don't understand. -How humiliating.

227
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,860
Don't brag about yourself.

228
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,650
Come down here.

229
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:11,690
Zhouzhou.

230
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,620
How early are you to read.

231
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,130
As an image of Zhen Hua High School,

232
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:17,970
I'm in burden.

233
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,530
Why don't you come and join me?

234
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,180
Come on, get down.

235
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,090
How silly you are.

236
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,180
I feel disappointed.

237
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,180
What happen?

238
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,820
Why we took photos

239
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,530
so close,

240
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,530
but it presented unexpectedly?

241
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,260
The largest distance in the world

242
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,860
is the distance between taking photos and their presentation.

243
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,980
Don't bother me.

244
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,610
Are they flirting just now?

245
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,250
Does that photo have magic?

246
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,210
I already give you 20 odd minutes,

247
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,260
if you couldn't recite it,

248
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,300
you must come to my office after school.

249
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,820
Only by reciting the whole passage can you go home.

250
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,010
Alright,

251
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,770
please close your books,

252
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,650
let's start from this group.

253
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,740
It was on the sixteenth of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, in the autumn of the year of Renxu,

254
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,940
that my friends and I went boating along the foot of the Red Cliff.

255
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,930
A light breeze was blowing gently without ruffling the calm water.

256
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,210
OK, sit down.

257
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,260
Wine up in hand, I toasted my companions

258
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,200
and recited the first verse of "The Moon Rises"

259
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,690
from The Books Of Songs.

260
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,740
Next.

261
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,620
I forget.

262
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,860
Next.

263
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,260
Next one.

264
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,420
The one after that.

265
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,450
Last one.

266
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,980
We are like mayflies enjoying a flicker of life in this world, and as infinitesimal as a grain in the vast sea.

267
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,980
I'm sorry for the brevity of our existence and I envy the boundlessness of the Yangtze River.

268
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,420
I wish

269
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,450
Yu Zhouzhou.

270
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,820
Yu Zhouzhou.

271
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,130
[Chen An: Zhouzhou, I'm back]

272
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,180
Please start from "I will not take even a tiny bit"

273
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,690
I will not take even a tiny bit.

274
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,380
As to the gentle breeze on the river

275
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,500
and the bright moon over the mountains.

276
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,690
What are you doing?

277
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,820
You have some complaints, right?

278
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,090
Is there something wrong of my painting?

279
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,010
See, look at your hands.

280
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,300
Look at her,

281
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,090
look at her hands.

282
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,130
They look like pig's feet with pernio.

283
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,820
Look, they are so alike.

284
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,570
Xin Rui, Xin Rui.

285
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,380
Let it go, Xin Rui.

286
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,530
Xin Rui, stop.

287
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,690
Come on,

288
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,380
let's get some water.

289
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,620
Let's go to wash hands.

290
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
Nothing need to see here.

291
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,300
This time, Xu Zhiqiang has gone too far.

292
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,650
But weather is cool now,

293
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,380
you have to pay attention to your hands.

294
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,890
Well,

295
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,820
at ordinary times, you can apply some hand cream

296
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,860
and wear gloves.

297
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,760
Today, let's go home together after school,

298
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,650
and we can always be together till then.

299
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,560
Well, silence.

300
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,500
Everyone's ball need to move over the screen,

301
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,010
and you are all required to hand in your work.

302
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,420
The class will not finish until you pass my examination.

303
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,190
[Yu Zhouzhou]

304
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,010
Are you listening to teacher's requirements?

305
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,570
He asked for a rolling ball,

306
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,820
not a rolling Yu Zhouzhou.

307
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,260
It seems like you are sensitive and fragile recently,

308
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
you should be taken care of.

309
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,330
Well,

310
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,740
just because you and Yu Zhouzhou are on the first page of school's website,

311
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,620
you become a brilliant person?

312
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,450
Definitely.

313
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,570
We are a perfect match.

314
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,260
Do you think Yu Zhouzhou and I are a good match?

315
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,770
Think about this morning,

316
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,810
Yu Zhouzhou looked at me

317
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,180
with smiling and appreciation.

318
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,210
Please stay away from me.

319
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,330
I'm out of temper recently.

320
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,010
[I think Ling Xiangqian and Jiang Chuan from Grade 11 are a better match]

321
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,500
Who post that on it?

322
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,620
I'll reply now.

323
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,820
[Disagree, unlike the perfect match Lin Yang and Yu Zhouzhou]

324
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,570
Delete it.

325
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,380
Look at this,

326
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,500
they say at the midnight of Christmas Eve,

327
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,810
if you stay with your secret crush

328
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,650
Jiang Chuan

329
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,940
I'm going for it.

330
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,060
Zhouzhou,

331
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,300
your boyfriend is here.

332
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,130
What are you talking about?

333
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,620
I mean this.

334
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,940
[Milk]

335
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,090
What are you doing here?

336
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,500
Do you have a plan tomorrow night?

337
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,180
No, what's the matter?

338
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,180
Please leave that for me,

339
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,260
I'll meet you tomorrow night.

340
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,380
What will you do?

341
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,530
You'll see.

342
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,010
Please, please leave that for me.

343
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,380
I almost forget,

344
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,890
tomorrow night

345
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,180
It's Christmas Eve.

No.

You didn't even ask me which Post Bar I was referring to.

I’m not sure if we will be able to meet.

352
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,010
So I prepared a gift for you in advance.

353
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,500
You can open it now,

354

I'm sure you will like it!

I will read the card later when I arrive home.

Didn't you get anything for me?

358
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,530
I don't know that Christmas is in this week,

359
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,010
so I didn't prepare you a gift in advance.

360
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,890
Why can't you just lie to me?

361
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,450
Lie to you?

362
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,210
Why would I lie?

I can buy it for you after school.

Big Uncle, maybe you shouldn't get her a gift like this...

That's not an option.

It's hard to tell from your appearance that

deep down your heart, you are a romantic person.

It's mainly because that I don't want your Big Auntie to be mad.

00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,330
I don't want to take your apple for free.

517
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,040
Here you go.

518
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,540
Here.

519
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,740
It was peeled for you by others.

520
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:19,930
Don't worry about it.

521
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,020
Just eat it.

522
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,740
Take it.

523
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,170
Eat.

524
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,740
I got something to say after you finish it.

525
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,500
It's Christmas Eve tonight.

526
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:33,930
How are you gonna spend it?

527
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,050
Not so many plans.

528
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,680
Just go home, watch videos.

529
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,890
Just as usual.

530
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,540
You can't always be single like this, right?

531
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,020
What do you mean?

532
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,260
What do you think of Miss. Shen?

533
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:56,980
She is also single.

534
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,140
I think she is nice in all aspects.

535
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,500
Why don't you woo her?

536
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,780
Me?

537
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,620
Stop teasing me.

538
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,540
Even my junior female schoolmate scorned me.

539
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,500
Let alone Miss. Shen.

540
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,170
I think you two should get to know each other.

541
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,570
If you two can be together,

542
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,500
that would be perfect!

543
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,980
There is no other female teacher in our school

544
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,490
who is better than Miss. Shen.

545
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,050
Come on.

546
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,050
How about this,

547
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,570
you help me ask her if she is free tonight,

548
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,170
be strategic,

549
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,980
saying that we'd like to hang out with her together.

550
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,900
You can count on me.

551
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,690
Lao Yu, Lao Yu, Lao Yu, Lao Yu.

552
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,620
Mi Qiao.

553
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,170
Come sit here.

554
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,090
What's wrong?

555
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,040
Have a sit.

556
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,450
Tell me,

557
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,560
where were you yesterday.

558
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,050
I... overslept.

559
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,210
Ok, keep on lying to me.

560
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,090
Tomorrow is Christmas Day, I got something for you.

561
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,250
Don't you get all touched

562
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,450
Where's mine?

563
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,810
Yours

564
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,140
You're gonna have to wait for it

565
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,690
I don't believe it. You must have finished it

566
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,490
No! Mi Qiao

567
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,860
Fine

568
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,810
So mysterious

569
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Then I'll give you another half day

570
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:29,900
Take your time

571
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,500
Don't worry

572
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,380
The more words, the more I like it

573
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,740
Zhou Mo just asked me out to see a movie with him tonight

574
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,050
Are you going?

575
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,450
Didn't you see the recent post

576
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,860
on Post Bar?

577
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,170
What post?

578
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,980
The post says that

579
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,780
if two people can spend Christmas Eve

580
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,810
together at midnight,

581
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,210
they can be together forever

582
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,380
I think there's something wrong about it

583
00:27:59,130 --> 00:27:59,900
If

584
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,980
one spends Christmas Eve with different people every year,

585
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,980
who is he going to be together with?

586
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,900
You're so annoying

587
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,160
I am never talking to you again

588
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,810
Qianqian

589
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,860
Let's go to the Downtown Square to see firework

590
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,090
What?

591
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,020
Let's spend Christmas Eve together

592
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,170
Ok

593
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,090
Yu

594
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,380
What's your plan for tonight?

595
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,540
Did Lin Yang ask you out?

596
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,380
Why?

597
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,410
Didn't you see the post on the school Post Bar?

598
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,410
It is said that if you spend Christmas Eve at midnight

599
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,980
with the one you like,

600
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,740
you two can be together forever

601
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,380
And you believe in those things?

602
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,620
What if it is true?

603
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,020
It says that Eason Chan is hosting a concert tonight

604
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,450
Do you think that if I spend the midnight with Eason Chan,

605
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,500
we can be together forever?

606
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,450
Oh, right. Yu

607
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,400
Where's my Christmas card?

608
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,090
Merry Christmas!

609
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,020
That's more like it

610
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:13,770
This is not right

611
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,410
This is not the one in your bag

612
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,110
[Chen An：Ok, see you tonight.]

613
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,020
It's not as pretty as that one

614
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,050
Who are you texting?

615
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,020
Stop right there

616
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
What on earth do you want?

617
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:37,810
It's for you

618
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,400
[Merry Christmas]

619
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,290
Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang

620
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,020
I asked her the question for you

621
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,380
She is currently available

622
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,140
No one has asked her out

623
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,740
on such an important day

624
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,050
How did you ask her?

625
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,810
I asked her if she wanted to go for a movie tonight

626
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,140
She said yes

627
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,860
Later

628
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,570
I'll buy three movie tickets

629
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,920
When the movie starts,

630
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,740
you will give me a call quietly

631
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,900
saying that there is a burst in the water pipe at home

632
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
And then I will sneak out

633
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,330
Then

634
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,140
Then you are free to do whatever you want

635
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,500
I find that you're quite smart

636
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,570
But what if Mrs. Shen

637
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,660
does not like me?

638
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,780
You will never know unless you give it a try

639
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,570
Be brave, ok?

640
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,660
Mr. Zhang

641
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,290
I find that you sure are good at being a encourager

642
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,450
But when it comes to you,

643
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,930
you become such a coward

644
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,380
Hello?

645
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,540
It's me

646
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,450
My tuition has gone up

647
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,620
No

648
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,900
The school has to make up lessons on weekends

649
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,260
Next month we will need to pay...

650
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,050
Listen to me

651
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,410
You...

652
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,620
Are you done with the yelling?

653
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,010
If you're done, now it's my turn

654
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,500
I have no money now

655
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,530
If you don't want to see

656
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,210
your own son starve,

657
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,540
the give me more money starting next month

658
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:52,810
Until the weekend is ove,

659
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,290
do not call me for anything

660
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,290
Ok, I'm done

661
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,260
Bye

662
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,260
Let's go get steak

663
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,210
or pasta

664
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,860
Then we'll go shopping and see a movie

665
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,860
And let's go see the firework at the Downtown Square at midnight, ok?

666
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,570
Or you don't want western food?

667
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,780
Then let's go get some barbecue

668
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,140
All fine by me

669
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,500
Barbecue seems not so fit

670
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,780
for only two people

671
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,290
Forget it

672
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,170
How about Japanese cuisine?

673
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,620
Japanese cuisine...

674
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,450
Do you think it's a little bit too expensive?

675
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,780
No. It's fine

676
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,500
Right?

677
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,490
You go there often, too

678
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,810
I know one Japanese restaurant downtown

679
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,130
that serves really good Japanese cuisine

680
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,260
They send their sweet shrimp and salmon by air

681
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,540
which taste so fresh

682
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,380
They're my favorite

683
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,200
Qianqian

684
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,380
It suddenly occured to me that

685
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,380
my dad asked me to go home early

686
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,570
to help him

687
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,860
Can't you go home a bit later?

688
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,930
I'll call you later

689
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,620
We must spend the midnight together

690
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,090
Ok?

691
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,900
Then...

692
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,780
I'll leave first

693
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,090
Hello?

694
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,810
Zhouzhou, what's your plan for the night?

695
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,320
Wanna come to me for some barbecue?

696
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,080
I have a date tonight

697
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
Next time

698
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,410
Come on

699
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,490
Where are you now?

700
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,330
Xin Rui

701
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,810
I'm not going with you today

702
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:23,860
Go by yourself

703
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,330
Hey

704
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,810
We are making so much effort

705
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,140
What if it doesn't work tonight?

706
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,740
Then we'll do it again

707
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,980
until we succeed

708
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,810
Such a love master

709
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,290
Let me tell you, Lin Yang

710
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,860
If I were a girl,

711
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,650
I would totally fall in love with you

712
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,500
Don't mention you

713
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,780
If I were a girl,

714
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,889
I would have fallen in love with myself a long time ago

715
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,210
Did you bring potassium permanganate and glycerin？

716
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,210
Of course I did

717
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,100
Don't you worry

718
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,820
You will never know that

719
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,500
in order to get the key to the chemistry lab

720
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,130
from Zhou Mo,

721
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,300
I stole two DVDs from my dad

722
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,850
just to bride him

723
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,540
What's so magical about the DVDs?

724
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,780
You don't have to know about it

725
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,370
In a word, I am a good friend

726
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,340
♫ Brotherhood and righteousness ♫

727
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,300
♫Are so precious♫

728
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,340
Don't touch me! You scared me!

729
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,060
Where do we pour them in

730
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,060
Good question

731
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,930
Wait a minute

732
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,260
I think we should keep away

733
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,850
Yes, we should

734
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,060
What's wrong?

735
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,100
It's on fire
