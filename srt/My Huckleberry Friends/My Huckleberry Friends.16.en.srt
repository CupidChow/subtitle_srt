You don't like the sketch?

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,050
Are you tired?

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,340
I guess I ran too much in the morning

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,930
and it will be OK after a short rest

12

He told me

21
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,700
OK, forget it

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,480
just take a rest

What do you think?

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,370
If I had not followed my parents' arrangements

35
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,140
but chose to live with you

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,170
it would have been a good life

With this injection

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,530
she will be OK

41
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,420
It's so sorry for bothering you

42
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,010
Yes

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,250
It's so sorry to bother you

it's just my job

47

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,930

Auntie, I am all right

55
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,140
I should not have believed you

56
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,860
you should have stay hospital for a couple of more days

Hello

63
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,700
Hi

64
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,770
Where do you want

Before going to the airport

I need to deliver an article to Xinhua community

They are different routes

68
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,810
I am afraid it will be late for plane

69
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,010
No. I will buy ticket when arriving airport

70
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,570
OK, OK

Leave it to me

74
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,700
You'd better have a good rest, today

75
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm OK, and just want a stroll

76
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,250
OK, take it easy

77
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,010
I will back soon

What do you want

84
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,770
Your mother is a bitch

85
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,980
You are a bitch too

What do you want from my husband this time

You reached him at new year Eve like a snake

90
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,980
I'm not a snake

91
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,330
You watch your tongue

92
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,700
Where you go? stop

Listen, Yu Zhouzhou

94
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,980
If you are not a snake

95
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,740
why did you hide when I came in the morning

96
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,300
I was in hospital last night

97
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,020
Liar, keep playing

leave my family away

102
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,330
Go hell as you like

103
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,020
Zhouzhou, let's go

104
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,460
get out of my way

105
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,620
Damn, who are you

106
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,250
Where's Zhouzhou

107
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,810
Drop trap downstairs

108
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,290
She is in sick

109
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,810
Why do you ask her to do that

110
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,530
She wants a stroll for a while

111
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,810
It's so long till now

112
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,210
She should have returned home

What

120
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,900
What? She is missing?

121
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,140
Are you seriously

122
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,460
Are you

123
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,530
I asked neighbors

124
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,140
They told me several old women

125
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,700
volleyed a girl a moment ago

126
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,020
abusing her a bitch alike

127
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,250
It must be the wife of Zhouzhou's father

128
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,210
came for Zhouzhou

129
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,620
How dare she

130
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,770
I come for her

131
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,450
Wait

132
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,020
Now, more important is to find Zhouzhou

133
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,530
What then on

134
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,460
They don't know

135
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,620
They said they heard quarrels outside

136
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,180
when watching TV at home

137
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,490
Let me phone Zhouzhou's father

138
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,040
Yes, yes

139
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,180
Well, Feifei

140
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,860
You just phone Zhouzhou's classmates, now

141
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,420
Maybe, she goes to their homes

142
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,640
as she feels worse

143
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,730
Hello

144
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,650
Do you know why I call you?

145
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
I am Yu Fei

146
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,860
Zhouzhou's brother

147
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,020
Zhouzhou is missing

148
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,250
Is she with you?

149
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,020
What

150
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,300
Can I use your mobile

151
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,980
What happened

152
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,770
I don't know how to explain it to family

153
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,330
Let's go home after a quick stroll

154
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,860
I don't go home

155
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,650
You don't?

156
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,180
I am going to airport today

157
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,850
leave here

158
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,420
and never return

159
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,620
These are music notations I collected

160
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,370
Some spent me a long time

161
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,740
I planned to present you before my leave

162
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,700
For me?

163
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,860
I will not play them anymore, I guess

164
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,620
Worthless case doesn't deserve efforts

165
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,090
You

166
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,620
still came for your father

167
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,370
So, it triggers today's story

168
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,770
It also proves my words

169
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,970
that some one will never change

170
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,580
You are too kind-hearted

171
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,130
to hurt yourself

172
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,980
I don't know

173
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,700
I just feel a little bit hesitant

174
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,740
Zhouzhou's missing?

175
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,170
Yes, her brother

176
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,420
just told me by phone

177
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,980
He said

178
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,420
Zhou Shenran's mother came to her home

179
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,370
to bully her

180
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,200
Only an insane person will

181
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,300
bully a girl at her home

182
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,250
We'd better find where Zhouzhou may go

183
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,090
then trace her separately

184
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,900
OK, OK

185
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,770
Mi Qiao

186
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,260
Zhouzhou will not do something silly, won't she

187
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,760
Don't be foolish

188
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,770
First case is to find her

189
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,210
It's your phone number

190
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,820
Mine?

191
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,690
It may be from your family

192
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,820
Hello

193
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,450
Zhouzhou

194
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,740
Big brother

195
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,570
I'm all right

196
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,980
Sorry for getting you nervous

197
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,210
It's Ok when you are OK

198
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,770
We thought you've been kidnapped

199
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,980
No

200
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,180
It's brother Chen An

201
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,560
who helped me out

202
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,860
That would be great

203
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,380
Now, where are you

204
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,770
At the  beach

205
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,820
So far

206
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,980
You are just getting better

207
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,890
Don't be getting a cold

208
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,450
I see

209
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,740
Well, when do you come home

210
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,260
I don't want to return home again

211
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,970
Got it

212
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,620
Just be relax

213
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,570
I will pick you up whenever you want back

214
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,570
Thank you, big brother

215
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,650
Zhouzhou,  put Chen An in, please

216
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,570
For you

217
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,620
Chen An

218
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,940
Zhouzhou is just getting better

219
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,010
Please take care of her

220
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,530
Sure

221
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,420
I will

222
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,260
and trust me

223
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,380
What did he say

224
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,650
He said as you are just getting better

225
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,930
we should be careful

226
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,530
Excuse me

227
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,260
Sorry for interrupting you

228
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,690
We are shooting a movie

229
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,330
and we need this scene

230
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,820
for our program

231
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,820
Will you please do us a favor

232
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,060
Please

233
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,980
leave it to us?

234
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,260
Hi

235
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,180
Hi, Linyang

236
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,090
We have found her

237
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,010
find her?

238
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,500
Beach

239
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,380
Beach?

240
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,650
They told me

241
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,010
it's her brother found her

242
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,050
It seemed that Chen An appeared

243
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,060
and picked her up

244
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,130
when she was bullied by those women

245
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,060
Now they're resting themselves along the beach

246
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,880
So, just they two are at the beach, aren't they?

247
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,860
Should be

248
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,010
I see

249
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,130
Well

250
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,890
now are you  at easier

251
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,820
or worrier

252
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,450
I call you later if you don't mind

253
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,980
Who are you on hell!?

254
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,820
Stop, stop

255
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,570
Xiao Li, run

256
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,210
Leave me

257
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,570
A Lang, I love you

258
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,090
Ah! stop, stop, you are awfully dirty

259
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,260
Damn it, you really want to bite me?

260
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,260
Look at my clothes

261
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,290
Cut

262
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,420
Where do you find the actress

263
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,300
Director

264
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,330
She is Mr. Liu's girlfriend

265
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,090
and wants to practice performance

266
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,820
Thank you

267
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,420
You did a good job

268
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,180
Now we have a rest

269
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,650
and then we take some close-ups

270
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,210
What's the next scene

271
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,690
There is no next

272
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,970
What on hell

273
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,090
Extras are gone

274
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,690
Why they leave us behind

275
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,620
They resented our daily wage

276
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,740
It's my first time to see making movie on scene

277
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,210
Me, too

278
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,690
I thought all directors are older men

279
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,060
with bristled beards

280
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,130
See

281
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,130
Aren't they

282
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,210
It looks finished

283
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,570
Let's go

284
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,450
Excuse me

285
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,010
Please wait a minute

286
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:06,890
Me?

287
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,810
Yes, yes

288
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,890
Well

289
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,820
As we need two roles now

290
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,530
and we found both of you are perfect options

291
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,770
for your excellent appearance

292
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,740
Are you interested

293
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,380
-No, thanks 
 -OK

294
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,560
I feel interested

295
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,130
Poem to Praise Love

296
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,570
[Poem to Praise Love]

297
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,690
The 2nd time of the 6th shot of the 25th scene

298
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,330
Help!

299
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,180
Help! Help!

300
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,690
Help!

301
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,770
Someone help me

302
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,180
Help

303
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,770
Cut

304
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,530
Whose mobile

305
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,010
Sorry, it's my phone

306
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,640
Emm

307
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,770
Chen An?

308
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,570
Are you with Yu Zhouzhou

309
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,570
Yes

310
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,380
Is she OK now

311
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,180
Where are you

312
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,010
Are you done

313
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,620
She is OK

314
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,980
I have some business to do

315
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,820
call you later

316
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,450
Done

317
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,130
Everyone mutes your phone right now.

318
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,820
Well, let's start all over again.

319
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,090
Action.

320
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,300
You ate Lang.

321
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,500
I'll avenge his death.

322
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,130
What are you doing?

323
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,770
Cut!

324
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,130
How come you said cut again?

325
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,300
Director, they didn't follow the script.

326
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,940
How could he stop me?

327
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,210
Stop you? That was good.

328
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,650
A mutant creature can have feelings as well.

329
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,530
Reaction. I need your reaction to the changes.

330
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,570
Lily, okay?

331
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,820
Lobster,

332
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
watch out.

333
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,640
Lily has already got the super power at this time.

334
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,130
Everybody, back to one.

335
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,450
You must be very uncomfortable in this outfit.

336
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,500
At least it's warm enough.

337
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,820
They said we are of good image.

338
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,770
It's fine with a painted face.

339
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,770
What's the point of

340
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,330
dressing like this?

341
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,420
And with a magic figure on your face.

342
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,210
Are you two not professionals?

343
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,260
No,

344
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,770
we were asked to come over

345
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,090
when just looking on nearby.

346
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,130
How lucky you are!

347
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,450
Lucky?

348
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,860
It took me years of struggle

349
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,530
to get this kind of role.

350
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,980
You played very well.

351
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,770
He did, in particular.

352
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,860
Right, pretty good.

353
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,690
I played well?

354
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,570
Even a ghost can't recognize me

355
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,820
when I'm dressed like this.

356
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,450
It's true. That is acting.

357
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,130
Acting requires your inner feelings.

358
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,690
Especially your fist of resistance just now.

359
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,650
Your image is good.

360
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,530
I think you can consider it as your career.

361
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,300
That's it.

362
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,260
I think I'd better not.

363
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,010
Hello, please come to reshot your close-ups.

364
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,450
Coming.

365
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,450
We're leaving now first.

366
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,420
Here we come.

367
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,090
Trust your super power.

368
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,330
Hit him on the back, the back.

369
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:19,850
Go.

370
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,500
Good.

371
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:21,820
Is that right?

372
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,690
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,330
Try harder. More strength.

374
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,980
Then you fall to the ground.

375
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,620
Hit me.

376
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,940
-Come on, come on. 
-Put in more effort.

377
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,330
-Then I'm taking it seriously. 
-Go on, go on.

378
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,130
As a child, I thought being an actor is glorious and interesting,

379
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,890
but now it seems that

380
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,210
acting is really troublesome.

381
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,420
Each job is not so easy.

382
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,690
But it's really an interesting thing.

383
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,570
Not bad.

384
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,940
Now that I think about it,

385
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,290
it never hurts not to be a protagonist.

386
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,370
You mean Game for Protagonists?

387
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,180
Now I think,

388
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,329
you can breathe a sigh of relief if being a supporting role.

389
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,450
These are the words of people who can never be the protagonist.

390
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,810
And you saw what happened to those two guys.

391
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,900
Maybe they struggle all their lives

392
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,020
but can only have some walk-on parts.

393
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,040
Chen An,

394
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,170
sometime I envy you so much,

395
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,540
and even worship you.

396
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,410
You're just like an immortal descending to the earth

397
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,260
who always gives directions of my life.

398
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,020
Why do you suddenly mention it?

399
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,380
When I was in sixth grade, I remember,

400
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,780
because of some family issues,

401
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,410
many classmates wouldn't talk to me.

402
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,250
The teacher didn't like me, either.

403
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,740
I was really overwhelmed at that time,

404
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,900
so, instead of Affiliated High School,

405
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,730
I went to No. 13 High School

406
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,330
where nobody knew me before.

407
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,290
It took me three years

408
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,210
to grow into a heroine.

409
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,620
So you're really amazing.

410
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,690
But I really think

411
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,040
it's fine not to be the protagonist.

412
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,050
Zhouzhou,

413
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,210
I'm not coming back this time.

414
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,160
Not coming back?

415
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,980
I signed a contract with my family yesterday.

416
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,020
I broke off all relations with them,

417
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,290
and demanded 200 thousand yuan

418
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,160
to set their minds at rest.

419
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,980
Do you think I went too far?

420
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,570
I don't know.

421
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:39,780
Zhouzhou,

422
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,450
I'm not an immortal.

423
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm just six years older than you.

424
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,850
I know.

425
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,290
Do you understand why you must be the protagonist?

426
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,660
Because a supporting role can never grasp the fate,

427
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,570
always supporting others.

428
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,810
Why can they make the decisions about everything?

429
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,570
They can abandon their family at will

430
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,260
and shirk their responsibilities.

431
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,090
When they feel regretful,

432
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,860
they think merely a few words

433
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,500
can make everything back to the original.

434
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,210
I don't want to be someone just supporting the play.

435
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,660
Bring Lang back to me! Bring him back.

436
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,090
Stop it!

437
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,260
Lang?

438
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,860
What happened to you?

439
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,090
After I became a zombie,

440
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,900
I got a deeper understanding of them.

441
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,570
They are not bad guys.

442
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,140
Let go of them.

443
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,290
But...

444
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,140
But they made you what you've become.

445
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,540
Do you love me if I'm a zombie?

446
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,250
Lang,

447
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,780
I love you! I love you!

448
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,330
Cut!

449
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,370
So moving, it's so moving.

450
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,020
Do you find it moving?

451
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,050
Yes, yes.

452
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,690
That's a WRAP. Thank you, everyone.

453
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,690
The wrap!

454
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,170
Congratulate for the wrap!

455
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,540
Chen An, are you really going to leave?

456
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,320
I'm leaving for the airport in a minute.

457
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:37,140
It doesn't matter to be a supporting role or a protagonist, actually.

458
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,260
One of my friends told me that

459
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,810
the most important thing is to leave no regrets.

460
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,780
Zhouzhou, you've really grown up.

461
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,620
Will you come back?

462
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,810
Maybe.

463
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,690
If you need me, I will.

464
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,570
But I think you may not need me anymore.

465
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,980
You know this number, right?

466
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,260
He called me a lot.

467
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,860
The call in the afternoon as well.

468
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,930
I have to go.

469
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,780
Chen An.

470
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,570
If it's hard to be happy, then I wish you safe and well.

471
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:28,810
Zhouzhou,

472
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,380
goodbye.

473
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,570
Goodbye, Chen An.

474
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,080
Yu Zhouzhou,

475
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,620
go to find someone to love or hate.

476
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,930
Come on. Cheers!

477
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,140
Zhouzhou.

478
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,410
Zhouzhou, time to go home.

479
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,930
Eat more.

480
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,090
Thanks, aunt.

481
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,740
Take it slow.

482
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,900
Aunt, your cooking is so good.

483
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,810
You can eat as much as you like.

484
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,140
Hello?

485
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,260
Zhouzhou.

486
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,500
When did you come back?

487
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,140
I was back for a while,

488
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,170
just finishing my dinner.

489
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,980
Do you know how worried I am?

490
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Thank you. That's none of your concern.

491
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,930
Why didn't Chen An answer the phone all day?

492
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,810
He told you that I was fine.

493
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,090
We played acting at the seaside in the afternoon.

494
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,020
What acting?

495
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,050
We just came across the cast of a play.

496
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,050
So, it's always more interesting

497
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,860
to be with Chen An than be with me, right?

498
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,050
So you can care nothing as long as

499
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,330
you stay with Chen An every day, right?

500
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,210
Lin Yang, what's wrong with you?

501
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,500
I'm worried about you.

502
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,900
Thank you, but I'm kind of tired.

503
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,890
Zhouzhou.

504
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,380
Zhouzhou.

505
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,020
Hello?

506
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,780
Are you listening, Zhouzhou?

507
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,530
Five kilos of Huanggang Simulating Tests.

508
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,050
Do you want to kill yourself?

509
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,020
Do you have Haidian Tests?

510
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,810
Chemistry for grade 11.

511
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,780
How much more do you want?

512
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,050
Give you three copies.

513
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,260
Keep it for yourself.

514
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,260
I also need the Physics for the same grade, please.

515
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,970
What made you so crazy, Lin Yang?

516
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,330
Yu Zhouzhou disappeared the whole of yesterday.

517
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,290
Disappear？

518
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,170
She was bullied by Zhou Shenran's mother

519
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,260
and in a rage, she went to the beach with Chen An.

520
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,620
completely disregarding my worry.

521
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,740
Lin Yang, wait.

522
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,730
I have to say a few words.

523
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,380
Yu Zhouzhou...

524
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,260
You shouldn't say them.

525
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,140
Even if I shouldn't say them, I still will.

526
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,410
What is Yu Zhouzhou's relationship with you?

527
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,090
What should she care about you?

528
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,450
Aren't you here worrying unnecessarily?

529
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,730
Tell me, am I right?

530
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,860
Speak up.

531
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,810
You already said what should and shouldn't have been said.

532
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,930
What else can I say?

533
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,210
No, the main point is, I was afraid that I was too direct.

534
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,780
I was just afraid that you were getting too worried. Isn't it?

535
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,050
I know.

536
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,050
What do you know?

537
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,660
I was too focused on Yu Zhouzhou,

538
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,930
causing me to lose myself.

539
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,050
These are what you've requested.

540
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,660
Alright. Thanks.

541
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,440
That's true...

542
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,660
That's why I will use every moment I have

543
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,090
to study.

544
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,170
I will use this enriching learning experience

545
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,740
to rid myself from this useless relationship.

546
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,780
I support you.

547
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:39,890
You support me, is that right?

548
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,500
I support you.

549
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,140
Help me carry those.

550
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,410
I just knew that nothing good would happen whenever you come looking for me.

551
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,570
What are you looking at?

552
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,170
Lantian High School Tuition Class.

553
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,860
Oh my, you must be crazy.

554
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,570
Let's go...

555
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,090
Hello? Is this Lantian High School Tuition Class?

556
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,410
Zhouzhou,

557
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,450
I never thought that before I leave,

558
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,570
I would be able to see you one last time.

559
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,930
And it's even you who took the initiative to contact me.

560
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,540
Indeed, I wanted to see you one last time

561
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,170
before you left.

562
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,170
Yesterday, with regards to what Ranran's mother did... I'm really sorry.

563
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,210
That is how she is.

564
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,090
I also just knew about it.

565
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,570
It's fine.

566
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,860
I'm used to it.

567
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,160
Honestly,

568
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,140
I was scared at first.

569
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,930
Afterwards, I was able to understand why she did it.

570
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,860
She also had it hard.

571
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,450
Wait a minute.

572
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,980
For you.

573
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,450
Look.

574
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,260
Last time, you left before being able to drink it.

575
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,380
Thank you.

576
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,290
I'm not drinking.

577
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,570
Try it.

578
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,810
I loved to drink this when I was young.

579
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,740
Alright.

580
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,170
When I was young, my mom rarely bought me these.

581
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,500
I especially envied the other kids for having a father.

582
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,900
Because I felt that if I had a father,

583
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,210
he would also buy me these.

584
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:04,900
Zhouzhou,

585
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:06,900
how about...

586
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,860
I perform a magic trick for you?

587
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:12,780
Sure!

588
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,210
This magic trick was performed by my father

589
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,540
when I was young.

590
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,810
Look here. On Monday, big brother is at home.

591
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,850
On Tuesday, he is also at home.

592
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,250
On Wednesday, he is no longer at home anymore.

593
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,330
Where could he be?

594
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,170
Oh, he is here!

595
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:38,980
That's it?

596
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,570
What a lame magic trick.

597
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,090
Zhouzhou,

598
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,860
I never knew how to be a good father.

599
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,860
But I feel that you were able to do it today.

600
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,500
I will give you a score of 90.

601
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,660
Then, what about the remaining 10 points?

602
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,090
I'm not sure.

603
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,860
Is 90 not high enough?

604
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:29,780
It's high.

605
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,810
Do you know how to waltz?

606
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,500
I do.

607
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,570
I saw someone waltzing by the beach the other day.

608
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,330
I found it to be very beautiful.

609
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,690
Would you like to dance with me?

610
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,330
Just walk me up to here.

611
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,660
My house is just upstairs.

612
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,290
Alright.

613
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,050
Zhouzhou,

614
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,090
we are now separating.

615
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,500
Can I...

616
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,490
I'm leaving.

617
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,860
Okay. Next, let us look at this question.

618
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,400
What should you choose? Who can tell me the answer?

619
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,740
The young lady over there, you tell us the answer.

620
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,260
Choose option C.

621
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,140
Can you explain why you are choosing option C?

622
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,970
This question is testing about the use of adverbs.

623
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,860
Firmly, something that is strong or steadfast.

624
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,330
Personally, talks about oneself.

625
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,380
Originally, the former or first one.

626
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,170
Truly, genuinely.

627
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,290
And the meaning of this statement is

628
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,690
"What I'm telling you is that your decision

629
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,980
is more aggressive than the one

630
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,980
that I initially planned to accept."

631
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,920
That's why, based on their meaning, we should choose C.

632
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,660
Good. Very good. Have a seat.

633
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,660
Thank you.

634
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,380
Very good.

635
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,380
Based on her explanation,

636
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,260
let's do another question.
