00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,210
Excuse me！

5
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,380
How dare you come in not knocking at the door?

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,330
Why it's you again?

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,770
I'm Lin Yang, a student of the Class 2, Grade 11

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,410
in Zhen Hua High School, sneaked into the director's office

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,860
the day before the summer vacation ended.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,980
Stop, please stop!

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,090
I'm not asking you to make a self-review.

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,860
You've been expelled, am I clear?

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,610
Here's your student file.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,280
Then please let your father come to my office.

I'm Lin Yang, a student of the Class 2, Grade 11

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,980
in Zhen Hua High School, has made mistakes

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:55,660
for being too green, frivolous and impulsive.

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,340
Now, getting little sympathy or understanding

19
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,500
from the society, I  have decided

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,860
to leave my last words before I go to die.

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,570
What do you mean?

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,380
I know what I've done is unforgivable.

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,660
And I haven't lived up to my teachers' guidance,

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,340
the director's cultivation,

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,570
my parents' expectation,

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,100
and my classmates' friendship.

27
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,210
I hope my death

28
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,210
could let the junior fellow students be aware

29
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,420
that such terrible behavior

30
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,930
like sneaking into the director's office,

31
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,250
should never happen  again.

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,930
Although what I secretly changed

33
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,660
is my own college application, which only concerns

34
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,740
my own future prospect

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,210
without causing any serious consequenses,

36
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,420
I don't deserve being forgiven

37
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,170
in terms of my wicked

38
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,610
and stubborn motive.

39
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,490
Director Pan,

40
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,380
since I 've being so sincere, could you please

41
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,530
say something about what I just said?

42
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,140
Very well!

43
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,610
Ah?

44
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,530
I can sign on your papaer, if you like.

45
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,700
I'm serious.

46
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,420
Me too!

47
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,979
Look, you're so good at writing, may I ask you

48
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,700
to help write down my last words  for me?

49
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,780
I'll say while you help me write down my words,

50
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,289
okay?

51
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,530
Come here,

52
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,420
please.

53
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,020
I'm Pan Yuansheng,

Director of Zhen Hua High School.

55
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:06,740
During my tenure, I've done a poor job

56
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,660
in raising students' grades and regulating them,

57
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,139
thus leading to numerous terrible events.

58
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,860
I'm too shameful to eat and drink.

59
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,090
Now, it's even a luxurious thing for me

60
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,940
to eat a bowl of Huntun

61
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,300
in my spare time.

62
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,450
My life is just a joke.

63
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,300
If my death could make my students

64
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,610
be aware of their mistakes and do some changes,

65
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,780
I would like to sacrifice my life.

66
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,810
No, no,no, you don't need to do so.

67
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,450
Actually, I have an idea, with which

68
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,860
neither of us has to die.

69
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,300
In other words, I'll correct my behaviors,

70
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,370
and you also don't need to die.

71
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:39,940
What's your idea?

72
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,980
Could you please forgive me this time?

73
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,570
I promise I'll never behave like this any more.

74
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,090
Lin Yang, to be honest,

75
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,140
I don't want to expel you at all,

76
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,650
for it can be a great loss

77
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,420
Yeah, that's right.

78
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:50,650
for both you yourself and our school.

79
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,810
But if I don't punish you, I believe

80
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,610
you'll never stop making trouble for Zhen Hua.

81
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,220
So, how are you gonna punish me?

82
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,220
You'll be kept in school but under surveillance.

83
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,580
A circulated notice of criticism may be enough!

84
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,140
FFine, maybe I should order you to leave school.!

85
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,010
Could you just make me get a demerit?

86
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,860
Fine, it seems that you should get an expulsion.

87
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,610
No, don't do that!

88
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,700
I accept to be kept under school's survillance.

98
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,090
We don't know him.

99
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,370
Mr Zhang, I seem to know him,

100
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,579
he should be the guy of the arts class.

101
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,079
Who are you!

102

You're a total stranger to us.

105
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,300
I'm sorry, man,

106
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,860
you seem to have come into the wrong classroom.

107
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,530
Your classroom is over there.

108
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,980
You should go out of the door and turn right.

109
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,610
Mr Zhang, I've already been under punishment,

110
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,940
please don't treat me like this.

111
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,060
It's the liberal arts that you want to learn.

112
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,800
If I let you in,

113
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,610
it's just like I've ruined your dream, isn't it?

114
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,300
I don't want to take the responsibility.

115
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,610
It's my mistake, Mr Zhang.

116
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,010
My biggest dream now is to stay in our class,

117

and manage to graduate.

as a gate for you to come and go as you like?

120
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,899
Mr Zhang, could you please just

121
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,580
regard me as a transfer student?

122
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,700
There is a vacant seat,

123
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,090
it's yours, my dear transfer student.

124

Okay, thank you Mr Zhang.

125
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,530
Shouldn't you make a self-introduction?

126
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,620
Right, please introduce yourself.

127

Come on, let's give him a special welcome.

128

No,it's won with everyone's contribution.

If they hadn't helped me,

136
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,450
I couldn't have even finished the drawing.

137
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,020
Ah,

138
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,290
we've forgotten a very important guy.

139
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,250
Who?

140
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,020
Lin Yang.

141

What is this to do with him?

142
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,930
Don't you know?

143
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,140
Alright, never mind.

What is the eighth question about?

145

Is it to...

146
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,900
If you don't tell me now,

147
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,810
I can't even concentrate on the class later.

148
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,650
Fine,

149
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,580
let me go straight to the point.

150
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,640
Lin Yang surrendered himself to Director Pan

in order to make time for us.

152
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,180
Without him taking the risk,

153
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,530
we're done now no matter how good we drew.

154
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,920
Get expelled?

155
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,650
Surrender himself to Director Pan?

156
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,580
What are you talking about?

157
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,300
So you really have no idea about it?

158
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,370
Lin Yang transferred into the arts class

159
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:51,620
in secret,

160
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,930
then he was forced to change class again.

161
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,480
He did all of this

162
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,570
just for one person.

163
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,980
Who?

164
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,530
How dare you do math test papaer

165
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,420
during my physics class, Lin Yang?

166
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,620
Is physics like a piece of cake in your eyes?

167
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,860
So you are very good at physics, are you?

168
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,900
Mr Zhang,

169
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,620
the math test will be held the next class.

170
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,140
I've already missed so many lessons,

171
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,250
if I get a low score for the test,

172
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,810
then Director Pan is sure to expel me.

173
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,690
So finally you're regretful?

174
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,010
Yes,

175
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,930
I can't be more regretful!

176
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,020
I really can't understand that

177
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,620
you're so good at science,

178
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,330
why did you want to enter the arts class?

179
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,090
Or you can tell me

180
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,460
what you're really thinking about, okay?

181
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,050
If you are sincere and honest enough,

182
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,530
then I can do you a favor.

183
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,650
So tell me what was that for?

184
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,930
Please don't ask me about it anymore.

185
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,490
Or maybe it's to do with someone?

186
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,420
A girl?

187
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,570
Ah, no. That's not true.

188
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,300
Alright Mr Zhang,

189
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,700
could I ask you a question?

190
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,650
Do you think you have a wonderful life?

191
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:06,930
I think I do.

192
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,210
But I don't think so.

193
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,650
I think your life is luckluster.

194
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,330
Think about it,

195
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,930
your life has been fixed from the moment

196
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,650
when you chose to be a normal college student.

197
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,140
You need to prepare for the classes,

198
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,620
teach students,

199
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,330
and work hard to get academic titles

200
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,050
in your whole life.

201
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,420
How can it be described as wonderful?

202
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,180
I think my life should have multiple choices.

203
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,860
So I want to make different tries.

204
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,700
That's why I decided to enter the arts class,

205
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,770
and then change back again.

206
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,740
If I don't try it, how can I know

207
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,490
what kind of life I want to have.

208
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,580
Is this your real real thought?

209
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,650
I mean it.

210
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,900
That who I am.

211
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
How can I do all these

212
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,700
just for a girl!

213
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,930
I'm not that boring.

214
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:39,930
Fine,

215
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,610
then it seems that I'm the boring guy.

216
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,860
As I can see,

217
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,860
you're not regretful at all.

218
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,860
So I'll not intercede for you.

219
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,370
What's up?

220
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,050
Lin Yang...

221
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,370
She just had some things to talk to you

222
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,050
But now everything is fine.

223
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,740
Oh.

224
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,460
He didn't say it. It was just my wild guess.

225
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,090
I don't know

226
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,330
Lin Yang is so frivolous a guy.

227
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,370
Next, we'll announce a notice of disposition.

228
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,370
Lin Yang from the Class 2, Grade 11,

229
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,860
sneaked into Director's office

230
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,530
during summer vacation.

231
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,860
I would not tell about the details.

232
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,770
But his behavior is really terrible.

233
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,420
Since he has admitted his mistakes sincerely,

234
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,860
we decided to make him kept in school

235
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,420
and under survillance.

236
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,460
If he make mistakes again during this period,

237
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,460
then he'll be ordered to leave school,

238
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,130
or even get expelled from our school.

239
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,450
That's all about the notice.

240
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,820
As your friend, I can forgive you

241
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,299
for your transferring the class

242
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,330
to help your beloved girl.

243
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,299
Eh.

244
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,260
It doesn't matter, I won't blame you.

245
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,500
I forgive you this time.

246
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,330
Oh.

247
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,060
Hey, Yu Zhouzhou.

248
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,060
What are you looking at!

249
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,300
I don't understand you at all.

250
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,380
Is Yu Zhouzhou really so good?

251
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,860
You are willing to change the class for her,

252
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,850
lose your mind for her,

253
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,820
and even die for her.

254
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,940
Does she really deserve your being like this?

255
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,090
That's not true.

256
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,860
Do you owe her money?

257
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,090
If you do, I can help you return the money.

258
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,770
Or I can even borrow money from our classmates

259
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,090
to redeem you back.

260
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,450
Go to hell!

261
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,120
If only it were that easy.

262
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,330
But I don't understand...

263
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,680
Nice to see you, Director Pan.

264
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,530
Nice to meet you, Director Pan.

265
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,300
Nice to meet you, Director Pan.

266
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:38,980
Good morning.

267
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,090
Nice to meet you, Director Pan.

268
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,380
Nice to meet you, Director Pan.

269
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,530
Nice to meet you, Director Pan...

270
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,090
Nice to meet you, Director Pan.

271
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,250
You, don't move.

272
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,570
Close the door.

273
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,380
You go first.

274
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,650
You are under survillance, you go first.

275
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,090
Quickly!

276
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,890
Hurry up!

277
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,650
What's the matter with you two?

278
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,570
Both of you will get a demerit for being late.

279
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,850
Yu Zhouzhou,

280
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,130
this is your first time being late for school.

281
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,690
Don't be late again. You can leave now.

282
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,860
Thank you, Director Pan.

283
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,060
Dear me!

284
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,380
You can also leave now!

285
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,380
Thank you, Director Pan.

286
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,570
Thank you Director Pan.

287
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,130
Wait,

288
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,760
It's like a martial arts assembly.

289
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,520
People on the arena

290
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,380
can't take control of their own destiny.

291
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,940
What are you talking about?

292
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,650
Full of crap!

293
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,370
Then

294
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,620
why they can take basketballs with them

295
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,820
while I can't take this with me?

296
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,090
It's just we have different hobbies,

297
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,320
why should I be treated differently.

298
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,970
They play basketball for exercising,

299
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,650
thus being beneficial to their studies.

300
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,770
But does this be of any use?

301
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,730
I like it,

302
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,650
because it can make me happy.

303
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,930
I would be more willing to study when I hold it.

304
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,690
That's enough!

305
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,860
Director Pan...

306
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,940
What are you whispering about? A conspiracy?

307
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,090
No, it's a good thing.

308
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,890
A very good thing.

309
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,330
En...

310
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,500
Come on, Zhouzhou, sit here.

311
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,420
Yu Zhouzhou,

312
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,010
your drawings on the blackboard quite have

313
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,210
Takeuchi Naoko's drawing style.

314
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,060
I've always been  imitating her drawing style,

315
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
but I never imitated well enough.

316
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,650
Look, I'm right,

317
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,410
she does like Takeuchi Naoko!

318
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,980
Then we need to reacquaint with each other.

319
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,450
Nice to meet you, I'm Mi Qiao,

320
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,330
a big fan of Takeuchi Naoko.

321
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,940
Nice to meet you too, I'm Yu Zhouzhou,

322
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,060
I've been fond of Takeuchi for three years.

323
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,450
That's great.

324
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,940
Done, she's already in.

325
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,090
From now on, you are one of us.

326
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,530
What I am in?

327
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,620
The Cartoon Club of Zhen Hua High School.

328
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,380
You'll be one of the core founding members.

329
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,060
How do you think about it?

330
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,730
I don't want to join in.

331
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,380
Why?

332
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,260
I haven't read many comic books,

333
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,010
for which you may laugh at me.

334
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,380
This reason is too bad.

335
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,260
Look at these comic books in your drawer,

336
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,940
I donn't even know about them.

337
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,010
I'm also a layman about cartoon.

338
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,300
You like it after all, so that's enough.

339
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,420
How about this,

340
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,890
from now on, we only cos

341
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,890
what you like.

342
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,420
I'd better...

343
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,180
Stop,

344
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,420
no excuse any more.

345
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,450
I appoint you as our deputy director.

346
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,130
Ah?

347
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,060
But you said I'll be the deputy director.

348
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,090
Shut up!

349
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,650
Zhouzhou, how do you think?

350
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,500
Your status is only lower than mine.

351
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,300
If you refuse again,

352
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,330
then I can only let you take my place

353
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,770
to be the director.

354
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,740
Are there so many members in the club?

355
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,420
Well...

356
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,090
Who are also in the club?

357
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,820
Apart from me, we've also got you

358
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,620
as our deputy director,

359
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,570
and Yanyi

360
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,300
as our chief painter.

361
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
I picked him up from a million of people.

362
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,570
You have a higher status than him.

363
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,010
So, you're at a very high position, aren't you?

364
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,940
So you mean,

365
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,300
there're just three members in the club?

366
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,060
Zhouzhou,

367
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,690
if you don't join in,

368
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,770
then there'll only be two members in the club,

369
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,530
what I'm gonna to do?

370
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,740
So I beg you, Zhouzhou,

371
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,010
please think about it again.

372
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,450
Since she haven't decided yet,

373
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,370
Mi Qiao,

374
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,090
let's turn up trumps.

375
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,330
Okay!

376
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,880
Yu Zhouzhou,

377
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,940
do remember this moment!

378
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,520
From now on,

379
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,210
once you walk into the room,

380
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,940
you'll totally lose your self-control,

381
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,770
and fall in love with our cartoon club.

382
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,330
Wow!

383
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,770
How doyou like it?

384
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,820
Great!

385
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,410
If you like,

386
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,860
you can cos Chiba Mamoru.

387
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,370
My favorite one is Nephrite

388
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,300
of the Dark Masters.

389
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,980
The star knows everything!

390
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,210
I remember that I watched the Sailor Moon

391
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,130
together with my cousin.

392
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,500
She was really fond of Chiba Mamoru.

393
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,860
So I joked that:" Wow,

394
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,120
is Chiba Memoru really so attractive?"

395
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,570
Then she contradicted me with a red face.

396
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,420
I thought you might also like Chiba Memoru.

397
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,060
Do you know, when I saw Nephrite died,

398
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,650
I even cried.

399
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,010
Me too.

400
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,890
I still remember the plot that:"Ah,

401
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,740
are there also Sundays

402
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,090
for the Black Organization?

403
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,650
Would you like to go eating ice-cream with me?”

404
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,620
I'd like to.

405
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,620
So, Yu Zhouzhou,

406
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,820
now do you want to join in our Cartoon Club?

407
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,420
Yes, I do.

408
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,650
Great, then this club will be the achievement

409
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,980
of both you and me.

410
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,180
Then, what kind of activities do we have?

411
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,650
Now, there's still a more criticle problem

412
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,500
waiting to be delt with.

413
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,060
What kind of problem?

414
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,560
That is to officialize our Cartoon Club.

415
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,130
So it's still an illegal organization?

416
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,080
It can not be described as illegal.

417
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,450
It's just a civil organization

418
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,420
without being officially recognized.

419
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,680
So you are deceiving me step by step.

420
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,090
But my dear Zhouzhou,

421
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,450
if you don't join in,

422
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,050
it can't even be counted as an organization,

423
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,980
let alone being legal or not.

424
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,820
So please stay and help me,

425
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,450
Zhouzhou.

426
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,090
Please stop shaking me.

427
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,770
I'm already trying to figure out a solution.

428
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,420
I know that you're the right person!

429
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,380
Director Pan.

430
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,940
Why didn't you knock at the door?

431
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,690
Director Pan, our Cartoon Club is taking shape,

432
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,980
would you please return the props to me?

433
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,770
Who allowed you to establish the club?

434
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,680
Zhouzhou is asking President of  Student Union

435
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,060
to sign off, we're going to make it.

436
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,300
Then don't come to me until you really make it.

437
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,420
I beg you, Director Pan, please.

438
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,090
Enough, if you can be so persistent in studying,

439
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,500
you'll even be admitted into Peking or Tsinghua.

440
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:45,940
I...

441
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,740
Go back to your classroom!

442
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,420
Why does this club still exist?

443
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,650
Since repeated requests have been made,

444
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,010
why it's still unapproved?

445
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,210
Clubs in our school should cater to the likes

446
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,530
of Director Pan himself.

447
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,080
If you establish a Twelve Girls' Band

448
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,420
in Zhen Hua, it'll be easier to get approved.

449
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,690
But Director Pan said he won't interfere in

450
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,810
once we get approved by the Student Union.

451
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,260
But our members are to be re-elected,

452
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,050
and the new candidates are also from Grade 11.

453
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,329
When the re-election ends,

454
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,660
you can ask for their approval.

455
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,890
Thank you.

456
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,849
So stupid she is

457
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,609
to believe in Director Pan.

458
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,660
In terms of their appearances,

459
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,980
I think Chu Tiankuo may be more easy-going.

460
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,920
[Candidates for President of Zhen Hua High School Student Union]

461
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,620
But we're more familiar with Ling Xiangqian.

462
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,640
[Chu Tiankuo, candidate for President of Student Union]

463
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,740
It's you that are more familiar with her.

464
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,290
So what's your plan?

465
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,570
What matters most in running for a election?

466
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,290
It's the support of people.

467
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,740
In Zhen Hua High School,

468
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,690
most supports come from civil organizations.

469
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,740
Then, which civil organization is the best?

470
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,930
It's certainly our Cartoon Club.

471
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,860
So if they get us to vote for them,

472
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,200
then they're sure to win the election.

473
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,260
Even the Zhen Hua Campus TV Station is helping,

474
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,740
Chu Tiankuo must be sure to win the election.

475
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,930
-It must be for his handsome look
-So you've also been an ambassador for a computer brand?

476
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,090
He's always good at studying.

477
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:04,860
Why did you have the opportunity

478
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,740
to become the ambassador？

479
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,280
I was recommended by my teacher in grade four.

480
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,090
I don't know why I was recommended.

481
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,980
It must be for your beauty and good grades.

482
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,810
I really appreciate it that Zhenhua has taught me so much.

483
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,320
-His smile's so fake. 
-It not only helps me to acquire knowledge,

484
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,380
-He's only got one facial expression. 
-but also teaches me how to be a

485
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,140
-responsible person.

486
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,810
Oh, gosh no.

487
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,620
I can't stand this.

488
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,450
He thinks he's running for American president.

489
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,660
You know what? We have to go.

490
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,890
He drives me crazy.

491
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,570
You haven't give your speech.

492
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,450
I'd rather go to Ling Xiangqian.

493
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,620
As long as you promise me,

494
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,410
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

495
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,500
Everything.

496
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,860
First of all, I might not be elected.

497
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,850
I can help you with soliciting votes.

498
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,410
But it's not up to me.

499
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,330
You don't have many people in your Cartoon Club.

500
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,980
Except for you and Yu Zhouzhou,

501
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,050
there's no other one I guess.

502
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,170
Besides, I don't think, to a small club like this,

503
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,380
the school will pay much attention.

504
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
Who cares your help.

505
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,690
You don't have the right to judge us.

506
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,810
Believe it or not,

507
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,330
I'm gonna make it.

508
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,090
Hello,

509
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,570
I'm your Messenger.

510
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,780
Please vote for my Muse, Ling Xiangqian, from Class Three.

511
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,690
She's the Goddess of Zhenhua,

512
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,980
with a beautiful voice and lovely heart.

513
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,200
Hi,

514
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,980
please vote for my Muse, Ling Xiangqian, from Class Three.

515
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,930
She's the Goddess of Zhenhua,

516
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,160
with a beautiful voice and lovely heart.

517
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,170
Goddess of Zhenhua. Beautiful voice and lovely heart.

518
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,210
Beautiful voice and lovely heart. Check it out.

519
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,170
Please vote for Ling Xiangqian.

520
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,930
Please vote for Ling Xiangqian from Class Three with a beautiful voice and lovely heart.

521
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,170
Beautiful voice and lovely heart.

522
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,260
Vote for her.

523
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,260
Jiangchuan. You!

524
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,260
You recognised me! I thought I disguised myself well.

525
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,090
Only you would do this kind of boring thing.

526
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,170
I just want more people to vote for you.

527
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,170
Save it.

528
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,450
What do you want? Tell me.

529
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,410
I want you to get away from me.

530
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,500
Mind your own business.

531
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,980
I won't leave you alone.

532
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,170
I'm not angry with you.

533
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,810
After thinking over and over,

534
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,330
now there's only you who can help us.

535
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,540
No matter who gets elected as the President,

536
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,090
we won't be free either way.

537
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,210
We'll only become teachers' puppets.

538
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,860
So what can I do?

539
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,500
It's the school's rule that

540
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,380
only students whose grades rank top 50

541
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,810
can run for the President of the Student Union,

542
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,450
and you were the 49th last time.

543
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,500
You want me to run for the President of the Student Union?

544
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,410
I'll do it myself if I were in the top 50.

545
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,620
You only saw me ranking top 50,

546
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,260
but didn't see me sitting in the blacklist of Director Pan.

547
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,320
I'm not too crazy to run for the President.

548
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,410
But we all think highly of you.

549
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,090
You have good grades, good character.

550
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,860
Kind and helpful.

551
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,500
Yeah, they're truth,

552
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,980
but not strong enough to talk me into it.

553
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,140
You know, Yu Zhouzhou

554
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,980
devotes herself to our club.

555
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,380
You don't want to see her disappointed, do you?

556
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,980
Do you think, as long as you mention her name,

557
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,380
I'd do everything you tell me to?

558
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,810
More than that.

559
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,660
Yu Zhouzhou is a switch on your body.

560
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,740
If I press it,

561
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,090
you just start running,

562
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,500
and you could do everything.

563
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,450
Hey, I take that as your acquiesence.

564
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,290
I told you to wait outside the office.

565
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,980
Are you deaf?

566
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,330
I was looking for you all around.

567
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,530
Go. Go talk to your teacher

568
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,730
so that he could think of you when there's anything good for you.

569
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,320
[Seventeen No Cry]

570
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,930
The class has begun.

571
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,620
Come on.

572
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,970
Come. Come.

573
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,410
We have two new students

574
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,410
who have recently transferred to our school.

575
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,780
Introduce yourself.

576
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,170
Hello everybody!

577
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,540
My name's Xu Zhiqiang.

578
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,050
I'm from Jiangbei High School.

579
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,930
We‘re bros from now on.

580
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,090
Let me know if you need my help.

581
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,900
I'm loyal to friends.

582
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,500
All right.

583
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,810
That's enough.

584
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,090
OK. Now your turn.

585
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,020
My name's Xin Rui.

586
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,980
What?

587
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,140
Anything else?

588
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,450
She was born in the Year of the Rabbit.

589
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,210
I'm asking her, not you.

590
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,500
Sir, she has Communication Disorder.

591
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,210
Fine.

592
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,570
Let's welcome our new classmates.

593
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,330
OK.

594
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,920
All right, without further ado,

595
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,570
let's start the class.

596
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,330
Turn your textbook to Chapter Seven.

597
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,170
The Great French Revolution and the Napoleonic Empire.

598
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,290
Director Pan,

599
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,690
I'd like to run for the President of the Student Union.

600
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,200
You want to be the President?

601
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,500
Daydreaming?

602
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,570
Think about your detention.

603
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,540
Get it done first.

604
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,810
I've submitted my application.

605
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,660
It won't work.

606
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,930
I'll disqualify you.

607
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,410
Sir, I've looked through all of the school rules.

608
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,540
There's no one that bans students in detention

609
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,980
from running for the President.

610
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,170
You did?

611
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,860
Yes.

612
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,330
Let me tell you.

613
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,500
No President of the Student Union in Zhenhua

614
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,140
ever has punishment.

615
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,500
Besides, even if you really want to make it,

616
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,900
you've got to have someone to vote for you.

617
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,050
You will see.

618
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,930
Hey, you serious?

619
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,320
You know the rule.

620
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,450
How come you did this so blatantly?

621
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,770
Tell me.

622
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,020
Who gave this book to you?

623
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,450
I found it on my way.

624
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,810
This reason is funny.

625
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,930
Can you make up a good one?

626
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,980
You found it?

627
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,140
How come I never found anything?

628
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,740
Teacher Wu sits here.

629
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,500
Go to the coordinator if you need help.

630
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,800
What's wrong with your shoe?

631
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,020
Go to the shop in your school

632
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,780
to buy a pair of shoes.

633
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,450
Pay it back when you have money.

634
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,680
Take it.

635
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,330
Come.

636
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,900
Thank you, Sir.

637
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,450
Sir, I borrowed this book.

638
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,540
Please give it to me.

639
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,260
I won't read it in class.

640
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,620
All right.

641
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,570
I'll keep it for you.

642
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,450
The book will be returned to you after the final exam.

643
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,210
OK. Go.

644
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,410
All right. Go back home.

645
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,050
Mom.

646
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,500
What's wrong?

647
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,410
Don't go to my school that often. Okay?

648
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,170
I'm here for Director Pan.

649
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,500
Parents have the right to visit teacher, right?

650
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,400
He's not here.

651
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,280
Go find another time.

652
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,050
Hey, I heard that

653
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,620
you're having the election of the Student Union.

654
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,330
I've talked about it with Director Pan.

655
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,050
Fine. I need to be back to class.

656
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,440
Don't.

657
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,930
I'm running late.

658
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,050
This.

659
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:47,930
Take it.

660
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,980
Give it to Director Pan.

661
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,860
Tell him it's a little something from our family.

662
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,810
Mom. Don't.

663
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,690
Listen to me. Take this.

664
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,780
Go back to your class.

665
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,970
Go. Move. Fast.

666
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,540
Don't forget about it.

667
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,740
Take care. Bye.

668
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,660
Go back.

669
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,780
See you.

670
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,170
Number Five.

671
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,900
To be a honest, upright, fair and selfless person

672
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,810
with a hardworking spirit and thrifty virtue.

673
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,090
I'll be consistent with my words,

674
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,930
responsible to my actions.

675
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,050
Discipline and behave well.

676
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,170
Set a good example of student leader.

677
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,540
If I'm elected as the President of the Student Union,

678
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,860
I'll try my best to provide good service to all students.

679
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,140
It'll be much appreciated that you could support me and vote for me.

680
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,740
Thank you very much.

681
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,260
Let me take a look.

682
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,380
I'm Lin Yang from Class Two Grade Two.

683
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,500
The one who got detention a few days ago.

684
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,260
You hear me.

685
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,980
No. I'm not going to make a self-criticism.

686
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,620
I'm going to make a speech.

687
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,810
I'm running for the President of the Student Union.

688
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,200
You might be boo-and-hooting now.

689
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,260
Save your energy.

690
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,380
Because after you listen to my speech,

691
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,620
you're gonna applaud wildly.

692
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,860
Today, the reason why I could be here to give my speech as a candidate,

693
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,660
I'm owing it to Director Pan.

694
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,290
-To give me this chance to make a new start. 
-Yang's lit.

695
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,250
He encouraged me to face the past.

696
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,210
Who does he think he is?

697
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,010
-I'm gonna redeem myself by good service. 
-He's still got the punishment with him.

698
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,290
I'm at your service.

699
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,810
If I'll be elected, luckily,

700
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,210
as the President of the Student Union of Zhenhua.

701
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,570
I'll be, in history,

702
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,500
the first President of the Student Union who's got stain with him.

703
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,660
That means I'll not consider myself superior,

704
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,740
issuing orders.

705
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,570
Instead, I'll take everyone...

706
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,860
Lin Yang. I'm warning you. Get out right now.

707
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,290
Second of all, I'll be the first one

708
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,810
who supports club development,

709
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,500
encouraging students to have their own habits.

710
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,380
A President like that.

711
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,210
During my tenure, you'll see

712
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,860
various clubs prospering.

713
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,860
In Zhenhua, there'll be more than study and competition.

714
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,380
We need freedom and development.

715
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,980
Thank you everyone.

716
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,410
I'm gonna end my speech now.

717
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,980
And thanks again for Director Pan.

718
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,140
Lin Yang, you're wasting time.

719
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,900
You can't be elected as long as I'm here.

720
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,290
I know I can't.

721
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,540
Just give it a go.

722
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,490
That's the President we want.

723
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,410
That's the Zhenhua we're looking forward to.

724
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,020
Cartoon Club got saved.

725
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,170
You went to Lin Yang?

726
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,080
Yeah.

727
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,330
He's the last one I'd like to go to for help.

728
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,660
Let me go talk to him.

729
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,690
I'll ask him to quit the election.

730
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,090
Zhouzhou,

731
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,400
how did my speech go?

732
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,410
Fabulous.

733
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,500
People shouted for joy.

734
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,450
It's fantastic.

735
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,050
I didn't expect you to be that self-deprecating.

736
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,410
We're looking forward to your step-up.

737
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,170
Slaves gonna be liberated.

738
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,780
Slaves gonna be liberated.

739
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Exaggerating.

740
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,330
It's true. Teacher Zhang Feng spoke highly of you.

741
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,020
He said you were a smart asshole.

742
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,140
Are you mad? Is this a praise?

743
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,090
Anyway, you're cool.

744
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,290
I asked around.

745
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,570
People wanted to vote for you.

746
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,140
Pan must have never thought of that.

747
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,170
My bad turned into good.

748
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,740
But you know that.

749
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,660
I need to support my Qianqian.

750
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,450
You could not surpass her.

751
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,140
Hoes before bros.

752
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,900
Lin Yang.

753
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,740
What's up?

754
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,170
You quit the election.

755
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,330
Why?

756
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,050
You think you're qualified?

757
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,370
So you don't, huh?

758
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,660
I mean you've got punishment with you.

759
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,330
Don't get yourself into public criticism.

760
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,140
Even Director Pan had no objection to it.

761
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,020
Don't worry about it.

762
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,140
That said, you can't win.

763
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,330
Our class all support Ling Xiangqian.

764
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,450
Zhouzhou,

765
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,170
if I continue to run for it,

766
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,570
let's say, supposing,

767
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,260
you'll vote for me, right?

768
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,730
No.

769
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,090
You good?

770
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,000
She criticised you,

771
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,020
and you're happy about it?

772
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,900
She's caring about me.

773
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,050
She suggested me to quit the election.

774
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,290
Zhouzhou cares about me.

775
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,050
I have to go for it.

776
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,450
She cares about you?

777
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,660
How come I don't see it?

778
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,450
It's so hot today.

779
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,860
Drinks on me.

780
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,620
Great!

781
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,780
Lin Yang, you're literally buying votes.

782
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,410
Give me one. I'd take a box.

783
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,410
Everyone has it.

784
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
Thanks for your support.

785
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,930
Thank you for your support.

786
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,020
Thanks for your support.

787
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,210
Lin Yang, you're way too generous.

788
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,090
It's okay.

789
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,540
Wow, that's great.

790
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,290
Now he knows who's the boss.

791
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,290
Canvassing.

792
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,930
Leave this to my Qianqian.

793
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,690
My Muse Qian.

794
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,450
Give it back to me.

795
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,140
Go away.

796
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,290
Director Pan, you looked for me?

797
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,930
Close the door.

798
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,900
Well, how's your preparation for the President election?

799
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,860
Sir, I've been planning to tell you this for a long time.

800
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,810
I'm not really into this election.

801
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,620
Your mother told me about it.

802
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,290
You have some emotional resistance.

803
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,900
Yet she's being good to you.

804
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,450
It adds points to be a good leader.

805
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,380
This will be very important at the end of the day.

806
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,210
I know.

807
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,500
Stick to it.

808
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,620
These are the random topics for the speech of the last round.

809
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,540
Be prepared.

810
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,540
Uh…Director Pan, no, thanks.

811
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,650
Don't be stressed about it.

812
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,080
It's up to you what topic you choice.

813
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,260
I just provide the scope of topics.

814
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,980
The random draw is just a process.

815
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,380
The opinion of your classmates plays a certain role,

816
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,290
but teacher's opinion is more important.

817
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,540
No matter how Lin Yang makes trouble,

818
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,980
I really hope you can be elected.

819
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,380
Ling Xiangqian,

820
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,170
did director Pan talk with you?

821
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,250
Yeah, he asked about the transfer student from our class.

822
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,780
Well, I have seen your interview.

823
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,810
It's really good.

824
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:33,980
I just talked casually.

825
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,290
That's also pretty good.

826
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:35,930
How about you?

827
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,330
How is your speech preparation?

828
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,930
Just so-so.

829
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,410
Don't be nervous.

830
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,330
Go go go.

831
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,170
What are you doing?

832
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,500
My Qianqian likes sour drink.

833
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,450
Let's encourage each other and compete fairly.

834
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,500
OK.

835
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,500
What the sour smell of love!

836
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,020
Jiang Chuan,

837
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,650
stop supporting Ling Xiangqian.

838
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,860
You can support me instead.

839

Why?

840
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,860
Have you heard that

841
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,740
there is a saying in the world,

842
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,930
the enemy of one's enemy is one's friend.

843

You never want Chu Tiankuo to be elected, do you？

844

It is I who support my Qianqian,

845

you and Chu Tiankuo won't be elected.

846
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,290
You have been chasing Ling Xiangqian since junior high school.

847
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,450
Has it taken two years?

848
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,050
Two years, three months and twenty-four days.

Sorry.

850

Do you know that

851
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,690
there is one character

00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,410
with great efforts

853
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,660
and good look,

854
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,330
but they often encourage and inspire protagonist,

855
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,410
create and resolve conflicts,

856
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,780
and protect heroine out of difficulties if necessary.

857
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,050
Only lucky one

858
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,540
will die in the arms of heroine

859
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,810
and get several drops of tears.

860
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,660
This kind of character can be called bullet bait.

861
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,850
Let Chu Tiankuo go

862
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,170
to protect my Qianqian out of difficulties,

863
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,570
but I

864
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,620
can protect her out of danger.

865
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,500
Do you have common sense to

866
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,930
dress like this to attend PE class.

867
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,780
Sir, she just came to our class

868
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,260
and didn't know there is PE class today.

869
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,650
Forget it. Just this once.

870
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,370
Remember to wear sneakers next time.

871
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,210
I picked up your book in the garden.

872

I wanted to return it to you as soon as I see you,

873
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,449
but it was confiscated.

I am so sorry.

No, I haven't.

You can listen it again to see if there is any problem.

Whether the canteen should open the stall

more in line with tastes of students?

884
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,740
I think it should.

885
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,740
For example, egg pancakes at the school gate

886
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,210
are often in short supply,

887
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,500
which greatly increases

-the chances of being late for school. -I think Lin Yang is really awesome.

889

For instance, whether the restroom

Oh, dear. You have talked Lin Yang everyday.

so we can exchange a secret.

You and Lin Yang...

899
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,610
I want to ask you a question.

900

What?

What's a secret?

Secret?

903
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,100
Secret is just a secret itself.

904
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,580
Secret is the maze

905

where you can't get out,

906

Oh! Nice metaphor.

So let's not exchange secret each other.

909

No, you have to hurry up,

00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,360
Maybe I don't even know why I am running for it,

1007
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,020
but I only know that if I don't do it,

1008
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,300
I might regret it.

1009
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,210
In addition to establishing clubs

1010
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,730
to let everyone's interests and hobbies

1011
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,130
can be understood and respected,

1012
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,170
more importantly, I have found decision

1013
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,180
[Zhen Hua Campus TV Station]

1014
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,690
to continue to keep going.

1015
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,060
Taking math as an analogy,

1016
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,730
people's life is like a curve.

1017
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,450
Time is on the X-axis,

1018
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,980
but we are on the Y-axis.

1019
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,740
If we always live in our own dimension,

1020
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,540
we must be the maximum of the dimension,

1021
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,820
but if we can find dimension of others,

1022
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,850
we may create a new dimension.

1023
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,170
The results of the election are as follows:

1024
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,450
Chu Tiankuo wins 588 votes.

1025
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,740
Ling Xiangqian abstained and counted zero votes.

1026
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,650
Lin Yang wins 102 votes.

1027
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,260
Now I announce that

1028
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,840
Chu Tiankuo is elected as

1029
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,820
the president of student union of Zhen Hua High School in 2004

1030
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,890
with 588 votes to 102 votes.
