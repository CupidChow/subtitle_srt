1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,130

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,420

4
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,930

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,020

6
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,950

Your Honor...

7
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,680
we also have additional evidence to submit.

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,070
We'll submit them now.

9
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,830
Our evidence is...

10
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,590

to prove the fact that Plaintiff Ki Seo Hee abandoned her child and husband

11
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,300
and ran away from home, not simply because of depression

12
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,500
but because of the affair...

13
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,250
that she was having at the time.

14
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,400
Your Honor...

15
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,030
That's not true.

16
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,470
That...

17
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,860
That isn't true.

18
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,710
Goo Eun Beom...

19
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,690
Goo Eun Beom?

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,390
Your Honor, one moment, please!

21
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,200
That's not true. T-That's not true.

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,730
We never had an affair.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,480
Oh, I...

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,480
I can show you right now!

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,520
I...

26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,090
L-Let me...

27
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,910
t-turn on my phone, please.

28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,410
You see, I...

29
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,010
Gosh...

30
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,700
I wanted to get a divorce...

31
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,450
so I asked her to fake an affair with me.

32
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,930
We never had an affair.

33
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,100
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,290
Ha Ra...

35
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,080
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,060
Gosh, what the heck is this?

37
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,300
Excuse me, Ki Seo Hee.

38
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,660
What the hell is he saying?

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,250
I can prove it with the evidence on my phone.

40
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,100
No, make written evidence like the defendant did and submit it.

41
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,110
Also, make your counterargument in written form.

42
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,070
Well, I'll explain everything,

43
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,390
so cancel the submission of that evidence for now—

44
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,560
Oh, please delete all of this!

45
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,230
It's better not to submit this evidence.

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,110
Attorney, wh-what's this?

47
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,300
What's this situation? Will it work like this?

48
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,740
Excuse me?

49
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,960
Hello? You have time after, right?

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,440
Just hear from Eun Beom.

51
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,550
What the hell is going on?

52
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,400
Everyone, stop!

53
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,050
What kind of an absurd trial is this?

54
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,930
What a ridiculous sight for me to witness in 20 years

55
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,260
of my life as a judge.

56
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,770

57
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,750
Wait, Attorney Oh!  What's this?

58
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,560
You ruined everything, Attorney Oh.

59
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,720
Did I know it would end up like this? I also didn't—

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,520
I hired you because you said we could win with that card, no matter what.

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,460
I'm about to lose the child now. What are you going to do?

62
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,350
I'm sorry. Just hire another attorney.

63
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,140
I don't have the time! Shit...

64
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,780
Later. I'll call you later, all right?

65
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,640
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,220
You said we could win if we prove the assault.

67
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,330
But why are they talking about adultery out of nowhere?

68
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,850
Are you sure I can win this trial?

69
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,740
Whatever. You take care of it!

70
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,750
Goo Eun Beom!

71
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,530
You can't be leaving like this.

72
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,210
Don't I have something to hear from you?

73
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,320
You two talk. Why would I—

74
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,600
Yes, talk to me.

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,550
I planned, scripted, and produced it anyway. So talk to me.

76
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,250
You see...

77
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,000
If you're really uninvolved,

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,310
why and with what evil intent did you participate in this bullshit?

79
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,240
I just don't get it!

80
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,700
What evil intent could she have? She just had...

81
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,200
- was fed up— 
 - Be quiet.

82
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,690
Please shut up!

83
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,670
Okay. I'll talk.

84
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,050
Let's do it.

85
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,960
But not right now.

86
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,750
I'm sorry, but I need to go because there's a customer waiting for me at my shop.

87
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,670
You have your phone, right? Let me see.

88
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,360
Call me.

89
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,530
I'll explain everything.

90
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,380
I'll get going.

91
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,860
Where's your car?

92
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,680
There...

93
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,830
Why?

94
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,940
I didn't bring my car. Talk on the way.

95
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,130
 The number you dialed does not exist.

96
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,380
Damn it!

97
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,910
Gosh, that nutcase! Seriously...

98
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,220
Shit!

99
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,520
Today's trial is taking longer than expected.

100
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,410
It's about time they came back.

101
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,840
Hey...

102
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,820
Betting money makes you focus this much on attorneys' trials?

103
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,780
We need to gamble on every litigation.

104
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,220
You're finally doing some work!

105
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,820
Hey, do you know what CEO Seo said to me yesterday?

106
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,020
He said I need to address him as His Majesty if I lose to him.

107
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,600
"Your Majesty..." That's what he wants me to call him.

108
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,280
- Ridiculous. 
 - He's blinded by revenge.

109
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,880
Whoa, that's real madness.

110
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,090
Wh-Where are you going?

111
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,620
- Huh? 
 - You said you'll call Attorney Goo.

112
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,880
Oh, yes, yes. I'll call him.

113
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,710
Did you two get into a fight?

114
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,270
There was something after we drank.

115
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,530
Go ahead and explain.

116
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,680
So I can understand...

117
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,520
and accept it.

118
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,540
It wasn't an affair, but...

119
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,650
I would've.

120
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,190
I just turned myself in before it actually happened.

121
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,570
What I mean is...

122
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,460
married life wasn't really for me.

123
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,200
It was tiring, too.

124
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,460
Are you saying it was a seven-year itch?

125
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,930
Well...

126
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,510
something like that.

127
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,020
That's...

128
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,290
really it?

129
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,350
There's no way.

130
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,310
I mean...

131
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,010
If the affair was a lie, there must be something worse.

132
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,550
I had so many thoughts on the way here. All kinds of thoughts.

133
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,900
Like fraud, crime, or a terminal illness...

134
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,070
"What could be worse than having an affair?

135
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,600
What was he trying to cover with such a lie?" But what?

136
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,920
Married life wasn't really for you?

137
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,010
Seven-year itch?

138
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,910
Are you kidding me right now?

139
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,220
If it's a fraud, crime, or a terminal illness...

140
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,040
I could just tell you so. Why would I lie about having an affair?

141
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,320
It would've been much easier to tell you the truth.

142
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,550
If I had such a reason for divorce, I wouldn't have had to beg you to divorce me,

143
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,020
agreeing to pay a ridiculous...

144
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,080
amount of alimony. Right?

145
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,160
As you said it was such a pathetic reason.

146
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,640
You would've never accepted it,

147
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,870
so I said I had an affair.

148
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,620
There's no other reason besides that.

149
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,060
Because...

150
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,110
I would've never accepted it means...

151
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,580
you thought I would've never let you go, huh?

152
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,420
And even if you filed a suit, since I have no cause for blame,

153
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,670
you couldn't have won.

154
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,690
That can't be.

155
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,160
N-No, that doesn't explain everything.

156
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,250
How are you going to explain this?

157
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,660
I went to your house yesterday regarding Joon Kyeong's case and happened to see

158
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,090
you and Ki Seo Hee coming out together from your house.

159
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,490
Are you saying what wasn't true before is true now?

160
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,470
Are you saying a fake affair became a real relationship now or something?

161
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,610
That's her parents' building.

162
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,310
I don't have money,

163
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,450
so they let me rent the place with a low-security deposit.

164
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,360
I need to pay them back when I make money later.

165
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,510
It's true. You can check.

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,930
Nonsense.

167
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,600
The landmine finally exploded.

168
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,920
It's karma, isn't it?

169
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,100
- Yes, it's a natural result. 
 - Of course.

170
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,090
- He RHOF-ed. 
 - Sorry?

171
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,260
I'm saying he ruined his own fate.

172
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,640
Why?

173
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,540
Does it make you sad?

174
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,760
You think I'm a psychopath?

175
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,220
Of course, I don't feel good.

176
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,040
Then you can just get back together. Do that. What's the matter?

177
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,890
I said married life isn't for me at all.

178
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,620
What have you heard so far?

179
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,040
Hey...

180
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,070
What do you dislike about married life?

181
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,220
First, you don't have to do laundry. Your wife also cooks for you.

182
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,010
Isn't it 100 times better than living alone?

183
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,650
That's why you're still not married, man.

184
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,260
Who the heck nowadays...

185
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,110
So was it better living alone after breaking up?

186
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,810
That's the life you want?

187
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,990
- At least I'm not miserable. 
 - You little...

188
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,630
I take it you weren't exactly happy, either.

189
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,340
Well...

190
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,950
Life's default setting value isn't happiness, is it?

191
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,290
Anxiety, depression, and emptiness.

192
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,640
It's those things.

193
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,290
What's with him?

194
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,840
Isn't that depression?

195
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,070
It just seems like a moral victory.

196
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,240
Wait...

197
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,830
Hear this.

198
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,890
People don't really know this, but if you're not miserable,

199
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,550
you're at a pretty good place than you think.

200
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,000
People recklessly marry because they feel lonely and empty,

201
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,710
but that's how you ruin your life.

202
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,590
It's the same as diving into a firepit out of boredom.

203
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,870
Hey, was your marriage a reckless one?

204
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,450
You dated for 10 years,

205
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,380
and you knew each other well and got married when the time was right.

206
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,130
Nope.

207
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,370
I didn't.

208
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,970
That wasn't the case.

209
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,780

210
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,910
 Fried rice...

211
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,830
 needs a lot of onion. That's what makes it delicious.

212
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,990
 Is it spicy?

213
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,100
 - Yes. 
 - What do we do?

214
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,300
 - Look here. 
 - Okay.

215
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,630
 Wait a minute.

216
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,320
 There.

217
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,830
 Unite!

218
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,030
 Where?

219
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,460
 The sofa? The table? Where?

220
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,660
 Okay.

221
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,520
It was great at first.

222
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,200
It felt like playing house.

223
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,630
 The end.

224
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,740
 Gosh, I'm stuffed.

225
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,750
 I'll go and wash up first.

226
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,870
 Again?

227
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,250
 Clean up and wash.

228
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,450
 Let's wash and clean up.

229
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,820
 I'm too full, so I need to digest.

230
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,040
But even when playing house was over,

231
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,030
I still couldn't rest at home.

232
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,110
 Where was it...

233
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:12,740
 Watching a movie?

234
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,130
 Yes, I'll watch one before going to bed.

235
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,320
 But I'm tired...

236
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,130
 You can go in and sleep. I can watch it alone.

237
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,860
 I don't want to!

238
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,120
 Let's watch it together.

239
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,940
 Do you want to watch a horror movie instead?

240
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,280
 They said it's super scary in a different way.

241
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,190
 Hey...

242
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,170
 I was going to watch this, though.

243
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,170
 This one's an independent film.

244
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,150
 Must you watch such an intense movie on a Friday night?

245
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,740
 Hey, must you watch a bloody one where people get eaten, then?

246
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,740
I'm not saying one person is wrong.

247
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,730
The problem is that she was like that with everything.

248
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,630
 I mean...

249
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,630
 you both yield to each other and try to accommodate.

250
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,120
 That asshole lacks socialization, seriously.

251
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,400
But do you know what's even funnier?

252
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,640
 What?

253
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,490
When I think about it, I didn't really...

254
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,840
yield to him that often.

255
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,460
Were you cleaning up alone? I said to do it together.

256
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,330
Well, it's not a big deal.

257
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,670
I can just do it alone.

258
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,630
Thank you.

259
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,030
Go rest now.

260
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,010
Gosh. You're so kind.

261
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,760
 This was in the lab before...

262
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,610
 Ji Hyeon...

263
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,490
 Ji Hyeon... J-Ji...

264
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,990
 Ji Hyeon...

265
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,250
In the end,

266
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,770
he accommodated me with everything.

267
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,250
 He could've just said he doesn't want to.

268
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,680
He said he didn't want to have a fight.

269
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,130
Because I abruptly became

270
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,840
too scary every time we fought...

271
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,750
He said I didn't seem like the woman

272
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,350
he really loved and married.

273
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,540
I didn't even realize that and...

274
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,710
I thought...

275
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,480
the reason...

276
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,420
we kept falling apart slowly...

277
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,760
was because we didn't have a baby.

278
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,000
They said lettuce and kiwi have lots of folate.

279
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,910
I heard you need to eat lots of folate when preparing for pregnancy.

280
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,300
Say ah.

281
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,820
Finally, I encountered the moment of decision.

282
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,370
When Ha Ra said, "Let's have a baby..."

283
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,330
Right there!

284
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:18,500
It felt like my life would end if we had a baby on top of all that.

285
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,920
That's not true.

286
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,070
That's not true.

287
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,210
If you had a baby, it could've actually been better.

288
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,090
If you had that...

289
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,220
cute, squirming thing, it could be refreshing!

290
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,330
Refreshing?

291
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,190
Hey...

292
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,230
You have no idea what it means to raise a child.

293
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,860
They grow up once you give birth.

294
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,940
One day, I went to see my nephew. Right?

295
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,700
Woo Seong! Woo Seong, come here.

296
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,320
Gosh, little man.

297
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,630
Have you been well, Woo Seong?

298
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,250
Sis.

299
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,900
Why aren't you paying attention?

300
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,110
What if he gets hurt?

301
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,310
Mom should be looking at her child.

302
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,520
You look after him for me since you're here.

303
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,600
My eyes hurt too much, Brother.

304
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,900
 I thought about it and

305
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,910
 I couldn't look after him for 24 hours, no matter how much I love him!

306
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,860
I became more and more sure. "Oh!...

307
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,230
If we have a child as is,

308
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,820
my life will go straight into the coffin!"

309
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,730
I didn't even know that and...

310
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,230
I prepared a folate party for every meal.

311
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,170
How scared... he must've been.

312
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,280
Gosh, could you imagine?

313
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,570
 Hey, stop laughing.

314
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,210
 You sound like an insane person.

315
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,630
Yes, I went insane out of shame.

316
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,720
Wouldn't you go insane, Unni?

317
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,730
 Whoa... What do you say?

318
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,630
 Should I really do something to that asshole tomorrow?

319
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,150
 Just say it. Should I just kill him or wish that he was dead?

320
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,570
 I'll do everything you want.

321
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,780
No, it's okay.

322
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,970
There's no need.

323
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,940
I also thought about it, but...

324
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,800
not wanting to live with me isn't a crime.

325
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,920
 Hey...

326
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,610
It's just embarrassing but still not a crime.

327
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:16,870
What... makes me angry is...

328
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,950
probably because I'm embarrassed.

329
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,900
For losing... my love.

330
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,440
We shouldn't have...

331
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,630
...gotten married.

332
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,970
I want to... turn back time...

333
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,970
 Yes.

334
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,700
Hey. Did the trial go well yesterday?

335
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,610
Yes, well...

336
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,320
So what do you think will happen?

337
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,800
You know all of us have high expectations, right?

338
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,200
Although I didn't place a bet.

339
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,840
What should I do?

340
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,640
I think I'll lose.

341
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,260
Did you make up with Attorney Goo suddenly or something?

342
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,040
Where did all your competitiveness go?

343
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,060
Never mind the litigation and all.

344
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,530
I want to disappear from Earth... as dust.

345
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,070
Gosh... Why do I always make the worst choices?

346
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,540
I thought I was rather smart, but I guess not.

347
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,150
Well, everyone's the same.

348
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,630
There's no one who always makes the best choice.

349
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,300
And no one ever aims to do just enough.

350
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,620
Everyone makes a choice and regrets it right after. That's life.

351
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,730
What did you regret, CEO Hong?

352
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,390
I also regretted marrying...

353
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,830
around the time we divorced.

354
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,370
To make things worse...

355
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,600
I really regretted having not just one but three children.

356
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,480
It's not like I was intending to do that,

357
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,700
but had I known we'd divorce anyway,

358
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,730
gosh, forget three? I would've had none.

359
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,220
I...

360
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,760
think I'd have been happier...

361
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,330
if I had a baby.

362
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:15,950
Because... I really wanted to... have a baby.

363
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,180
Other people seem to marry easily,

364
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,230
give birth smoothly, and

365
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:29,180
live happily ever after.

366
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,160
But why is it so hard for me?

367
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,410
Are you really a divorce lawyer who's done countless divorce cases?

368
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,340
Is that really what you think?

369
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,000
That everyone has it easy like that?

370
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,410
It's not like everyone divorces...

371
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,410
Not everyone's pretty like you and

372
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,970
grew up under great parents without worrying about money.

373
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,800
There's no one who has it all.

374
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,970
Everyone lives at a crossroads

375
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,800
of some amount of happiness and some amount of misfortune.

376
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,720
It's fine if you want to dig down,

377
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,800
but I'll hold your hand, so come back up.

378
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,920
You went too far.

379
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,670
You're done digging, right?

380
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,020
You will come back up, right?

381
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,840
No... I haven't dug enough.

382
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,430
I'll try to sort out the situation first and

383
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,360
then decide whether to dig more or not.

384
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,800
If I lose the lawsuit at this point,

385
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,960
I think Bi Chwi will bury me alive, then.

386
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,390

387
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,970
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep...

388
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,640
 Joon Kyeong...

389
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,250
 I called you to apologize for yesterday.

390
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,850
 I'll take responsibility and do my best on your side until the end.

391
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,840
 So trust me, and let's prepare for the next opportunity.

392
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,810
 Please contact me if you read this.

393
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,660
Yes, Seo Hee.

394
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,640
- Yes, it's okay. 
 -  The thing is...

395
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,710
 Jeong Joon Kyeong called me yesterday.

396
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,310
He told me to look after Da Wool this weekend

397
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,770
because he's busy next week.

398
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,250
Yes. There's no need to meet in the visitation room this week. Right?

399
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,450
I'm thinking about going to an amusement park.

400
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,980
Yes, it doesn't matter.

401
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,890
 Oh, right. Did you sort things out with Ha Ra?

402
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,830
 I gave her a random number because I was panicking.

403
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,730
Wasn't she pissed because of me?

404
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,990
Well... I talked it out with her. I think she's fine.

405
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,770
Really? That easily?

406
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,580
Well, I'm not sure when the second and third eruptions will happen,

407
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,900
- but, for now— 
  - You better make sure not to get me into this.

408
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,720
What would she think of me? It's so embarrassing.

409
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,550
Our relationships are so...

410
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,290
All right. I'm sorry for everything. It's my fault.

411
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,070
Forget it. If you're sorry, make sure you get me custody.

412
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,710
I'll forgive you, then.

413
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,580
That's almost as good as done.

414
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,040
Just wait for me with the contingent fee.

415
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,530
Okay.

416
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,670

417
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,940

418
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,330

419
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,550
Oh, Attorney Oh, how are you?

420
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,030
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

421
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,370
Whoa, Attorney Oh, you seem really busy lately.

422
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,060
Well, it's the same.

423
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,630
Right, I guess you're freer since Jeong Joon Kyeong's case wrapped up?

424
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,160
Why don't we all go for dinner tonight?

425
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,790
Jeong Joong Kyeong's case is still in progress.

426
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,630
Sorry? Wasn't it finished?

427
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,030
That's what I heard.

428
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,500
- Who did you... 
 - Oh, that's weird.

429
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,990
My sister-in-law told me he's going to the U.S. with his child.

430
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,880
That's why I thought the lawsuit was over.

431
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,140
I even sent a baseball their way to get it signed.

432
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,010
I wish you didn't have to go, Da Wool.

433
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,490
If you go, I will be so bored by myself.

434
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,030
You can go home and watch TV.

435
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,310
You didn't have fun today?

436
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:55,350
I had so much fun going to the zoo and going on rides with you.

437
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,310
It wasn't too bad.

438
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,040
You also don't want to see me go, right, Da Wool?

439
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,680
Never mind. I'm sorry.

440
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,440
You don't have many feelings for me yet, do you?

441
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,900
Da Wool, should we get off now?

442
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,550
I don't want to go to America.

443
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,950
America seems too far away.

444
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,520
Da Wool... do you want to live with me?

445
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,140
You don't want to go to America, Da Wool?

446
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,060
Say it one more time. One second.

447
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,840
It's tomorrow evening's flight.

448
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,750
Attorney Oh, just pretend you don't know, please.

449
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,530
What do you mean by that?

450
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,000
I heard it and even confirmed it with you.

451
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,790
How can I pretend not to know?

452
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,630
You wouldn't have known if PD Woo didn't tell you.

453
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,500
So just let me be.

454
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,990
As if you heard nothing.

455
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,810
If you were going to leave like this, you should've kept it from me until the end.

456
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,900
How can I pretend not to know when I have already heard it?

457
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,880
No, I can't do that.

458
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,730
I know you're not confident anymore, Attorney Oh.

459
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,530
I can't live without Da Wool.

460
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,380
The U.S. and San Francisco's coaching job all mean nothing.

461
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,320
Attorney Oh, I believe you'll understand.

462
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,370
No, please understand.

463
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,430
Jeong Joon Kyeong...

464
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,250
if you leave like this,

465
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,350
it's the same as giving them the upper hand.

466
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,680
You'll be charged with luring a minor, which is part of the criminal law—

467
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,680
I already got advice from a different lawyer about that.

468
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,790
I heard if I ignore it,

469
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,170
it won't affect me anyway.

470
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,630
Even so...

471
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,110
tomorrow is...

472
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,500
Isn't tomorrow way too soon?

473
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,250
It'll be better for Da Wool to go before the school year begins.

474
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,280
 I don't want to go to America.

475
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,100
 You want to live with me, right?

476
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,450
 Yes.

477
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,700
Hey, you'll submit this as evidence?

478
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,920
Seriously...

479
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,520
you should just live alone comfortably.

480
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,760
Why would you... volunteer for this?

481
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,140
I just don't get it.

482
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,630
You would never know. There's this thing.

483
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:18,090
By myself, it is really comfortable.

484
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,780
My body is comfortable,

485
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:25,400
but... my heart feels weak all the time.

486
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,800
If you feel weak, eat organic compounds made up of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon.

487
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,410
Carbohydrates.

488
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,910
Or you can eat meat.

489
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,800
That's not what it means to feel weak, you idiot.

490
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,250
When I'm walking down the street...

491
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,740
and see a child who looks like Da Wool,

492
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,530
I suddenly see nothing but darkness...

493
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,730
and I can't see anything.

494
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,790
Whenever I hear a voice calling out,

495
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,320
"Mom" somewhere...

496
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,290
my heart drops so much.

497
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:10,250
Even when I'm laughing like everything's fine, one thought about Da Wool...

498
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,160
makes me start crying uncontrollably.

499
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,810
It makes me lose my mind and go insane

500
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,440
because I miss Da Wool too much.

501
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,270
I didn't know I'd be like this, either.

502
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:40,150
I thought I lacked motherly love as a person.

503
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,920
Because I did run away without my child.

504
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,460
But that's not true.

505
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,140
I realized it only after running away.

506
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,030
That I'm a very ordinary person.

507
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:54,030
That I'm not strong enough to be a monster.

508
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,030
Ha Ra...

509
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,600
I'm so sorry.

510
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,640
I'm sorry.

511
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,580
What were we talking about just now?

512
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:28,090
I mean, there's a case I'm working on right now.

513
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,330
It's giving me a lot of headaches.

514
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,480
What case? Can you tell me about it?

515
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,570
This is... a lawsuit for a change of custody.

516
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,400
Just let him.

517
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,620
She abandoned her before and suddenly wants her back now?

518
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,290
That is right, but... if they go to the U.S.,

519
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:00,290
their mother-daughter relationship could be completely cut off.

520
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,490
That keeps bothering me.

521
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:09,350
You said the father solely raised the child in place of the mom, who ran away.

522
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,620
Quitting baseball, too.

523
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,040
Doing that wouldn't have been easy.

524
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,620
He's great.

525
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,750
That's what I had thought at first, too, but...

526
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,050
after hearing the mother's story, I feel sorry for her.

527
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,760
She was assaulted by her husband.

528
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,800
No family or friends, and solo childrearing...

529
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,920
Makes me wonder how desperate she was to run away without her child.

530
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,690
Of course, violence can't be justified.

531
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,280
It's indeed wrong.

532
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,990
However, I feel like this.

533
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,050
Wouldn't it have been better to resolve it at the time?

534
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,920
If she did, she wouldn't have had to abandon her child.

535
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,530
In the end, wouldn't it be better for the child to live with her dad?

536
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,260
The dad didn't abandon the child, at least.

537
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,120

538
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:35,330
 Jeong Joon Kyeong will... go to the U.S. with Da Wool tonight.

539
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,840
- Dad. 
 - Yes, what is it?

540
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,770
I need to pee.

541
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,590
- You went already. 
 - I need to go again.

542
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,470
Do you see that over there?

543
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,400
Can you go there alone?

544
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,530
Dad will be watching our stuff here.

545
00:39:06,453 --> 00:39:07,670
Okay?

546
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,200
Go ahead.

547
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,780
Nice and clean. Let's wipe them clean, okay?

548
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,100
Yes.

549
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,090
It just happened that way.

550
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,740
I'll call you when I get there.

551
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,970
Am I going for good or something?

552
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,210
Gosh, that's not how it is.

553
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm trying to get used to it there with my kid in advance.

554
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,690
I'll call you from there. I'll come back in a bit, so see you then.

555
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,300
Yes.

556
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,650
Yes. Yes.

557
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,700
Eat some. Don't focus on feeding me.

558
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,850
I want to care for you because you're like a baby.

559
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,180
Like a baby? Me?

560
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,950
It makes me full just watching you eat

561
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,650
and you're so cute when you're just eating.

562
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,440
And just watching you makes me happy.

563
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,690
What's this?

564
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,590
You're really treating me like a kid.

565
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,720
I'm saying you're that cute. You don't like it?

566
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,880
No, I don't like it.

567
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,200
Well, try something else.

568
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,520
Well...

569
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,370
when I see you...

570
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,560
my heart pounds.

571
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,120
Is this what love is?

572
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,300
Are you being shy right now?

573
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,930
That's cute, Oh Ha Ra.

574
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,660
You're blushing right now.

575
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,840
Who's blushing— No, I'm not.

576
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,070
You're so cute when you blush.

577
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,420
Come on. Eat more.

578
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,970
Their fish is good here.

579
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,760
You're driving me crazy, seriously.

580
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,530
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but...

581
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,260
there should be a seven-year-old girl inside.

582
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,900
- She's taking too long. 
 - Yes, yes.

583
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,980
- Sorry, but could you check for me? 
 - Okay.

584
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,340
Thank you.

585
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,200
 Attorney Goo!

586
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,600
 Attorney Goo, are you in there?

587
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,600
- Attorney Goo! 
  - Yes.

588
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,550
Attorney Goo, could I...

589
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,430
Could I borrow your car?

590
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:32,480
I-I need to go to the hospital quickly right now, but...

591
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,800
Oh, okay, okay.

592
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,720
 Did I tell you to delete that or not?

593
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,370
 I really tried to delete it, but...

594
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,000

they said someone tried to log in.

595
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,640
 When I contacted Google, they said to contact YouTube.

596
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,690
 And when I contact YouTube, they tell me to contact Google.

597
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,740
 I'm sorry.

598
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,020
 Come to Samjin University Hospital right now.

599
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,290
 Da Wool got seriously injured.

600
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,860
 I got to become a supervisor who bothers you. I'm really...

601
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,570
She'll be okay.

602
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,080
Don't worry too much.

603
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,670

604
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,720
H-Hey... What happened?

605
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,310
Let's talk outside.

606
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,500
Are you even a human?

607
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,710
How could you just let him when you knew?

608
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,150
The surgery will take five hours.

609
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:12,520
That small child... For five hours!

610
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,710
Yes.

611
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,340
A child getting surgery for five hours is heartbreaking.

612
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,770
However, you're overreacting right now.

613
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,010
You're not Da Wool's dad. You're an attorney.

614
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,470
- Pull yourself together. 
 - Whoa...

615
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:40,510
How could you help your client violate the law as a lawyer?

616
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:46,030
The child must've hated having to go, for her to run away alone to her mom!

617
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,180
Tell me. What did the child do wrong?

618
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,680
How can you let a child end up like that?

619
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,200
I'm Jeong Joon Kyeong's attorney.

620
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,510
Would you have told me everything, ignoring attorney-client privilege?

621
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,310
What should I have done?

622
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,630
I tried to stop him, too.

623
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:06,580
I tried to convince him so many times, saying he shouldn't be doing that.

624
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,040
But he wouldn't listen, so what could I do?

625
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,410
You think I just sat still and watched?

626
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,290
Then you should've told me in advance.

627
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:25,110
What would've been different if I had told you?

628
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:28,630
Da Wool can't live with her mom and dad anyway.

629
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,530
She can't help but choose one of the two.

630
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:41,470
It would've been okay if they didn't divorce in the first place!

631
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:44,580
Why did Da Wool's mom have to abandon Da Wool...

632
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,590
This wouldn't have happened...

633
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:49,010
Don't blame Ha Ra.

634
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,460
This is all my fault.

635
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,510
It's all my fault.

636
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,920
♫  It is still raining  ♫

637
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:20,700
♫  My cloud on my pillow  ♫

638
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:26,600
♫  In this cold dawn  ♫

639
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:32,400
♫  I want to see your smile  ♫

640
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,840
- Make sure not to skip meals. 
 - Gosh, okay.

641
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,510
Da Wool will be okay, so don't worry too much. Go home.

642
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:39,990
Okay.

643
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,540
I'll let you know, Mom.

644
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,660
- Bye now, Father. 
 - Bye.

645
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:52,620
♫  But I can't understand  ♫

646
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:59,470
♫  this empty feeling my skin has without you  ♫

647

♫  my way without your love  ♫

651
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,030
 Although we all live talking about love...

652
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:30,340
♫  I have nowhere else to run  ♫

653
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,040
 but I don't think we actually know...

654
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,740
 how to achieve it.

655
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:41,110
♫  My way without you is worthless  ♫

656
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,180
So... is the child okay?

657
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,730
Yes.

658
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,200
Fortunately, the surgery was a success.

659
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,750
That was so close, seriously.

660
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,320
What a relief.

661
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,550
What happens to custody, then?

662
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,300
Is the mom going to sue the dad?

663
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,280
There are provisions for the attempted luring of a minor.

664
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,810
Seo Hee said... she'll give up the child.

665
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:20,630
Seo Hee forced the lawsuit because she felt bad about the child in the first place.

666
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:24,780
The dad was raising her just fine. It was greed.

667
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,620
There's no need.

668
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,860
Jeong Joon Kyeong said he'll give up.

669
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,390
He said he'll talk to Seo Hee directly.

670
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,800
Do you want me to make you one, too?

671
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,720
No, it's okay.

672
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,910
Well...

673
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:04,080
I came to... say I'm sorry.

674
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,060
You know, I'm generally thoughtless.

675
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,610
Please understand.

676
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,670
Because my sister beat me up so much when we were little,

677
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,490
I think I lack some intelligence.

678
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,420
Anyhow...

679
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,210
I'm sorry.

680
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,750
It's okay.

681
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:36,850
Please tell Seo Hee that I feel very apologetic.

682
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,240
Okay.

683
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,390
She knows already.

684
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,510
You know...

685
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,350
Do you want to come with me

686
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,550
to visit Da Wool at the hospital during lunchtime?

687
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:59,930
Well... I left my car at home, so...

688
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:07,640
I'm having lunch with Jae Gyeom today, so...

689
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,300
Okay. I got it.

690
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,930
Also...

691
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,090
You don't need to send me alimony anymore.

692
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,720
I won't accept it,

693
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,020
so don't send it starting next month.

694
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,680
Huh? Where are you going, CEO Seo?

695
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,400
Do you have plans?

696
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,260
Why are you using honorifics towards me all of a sudden?

697
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,260
The case is over.

698
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,130
Goo won.

699
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:58,080
What did you... call me just now?

700
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,740
CEO Seo?

701
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,590
From now on, call me "Your Majesty," okay?

702
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,870
- I don't want to. 
 - Why not? I won the bet!

703
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:13,730
That was your demand, and I never agreed.

704
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,920
Anticipate the next bet.

705
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,910
I won't go easy on you!

706
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,490
I won't be betting.

707
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,650
Was he that spiteful about me skipping honorifics?

708
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,480
He's the one who suggested equal footing for everyone in speech.

709
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,510
I almost misunderstood him to be genuinely supportive of equal relationships.

710
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,990
Please stop teasing him.

711
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,700
He'll really start crying.

712
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,800
I know. He has a child who's almost as old as you.

713
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,370
I also have a dad who's as old as him.

714
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,700
Let's have lunch now. A 4.9 review...

715
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,240
"Almost fainted while eating the soft tofu."

716
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,860
That sounds delicious.

717
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,090
How unfortunate, though? Looks like it will be just us two.

718
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,450
- Wait, why? 
 - Everyone has plans, apparently.

719
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,150
What plans?

720
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,830
I have a blind date on the weekend, so I'm on an urgent diet.

721
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,710
- What about you? 
 - I already had plans.

722
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,980
Oh, right! I also...

723
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,750
I'm always like this, seriously.

724
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,860
I also had something to do.

725
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,470
Eat by yourself, okay? A modern woman can eat alone. Right?

726
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:26,830
Gosh, I keep doing this. Forgetting stuff like this.

727
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:33,410
Attorney Kang, what happened between you two after drinking?

728
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:35,740
Did you beat up Attorney Kwon?

729
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,460
It's similar.

730
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,210
Roughly.

731
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,290
Wait, if you—

732
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,920
Just make an announcement. Okay?

733
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,580
- Make an announcement! 
 - What announcement?

734
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,470
- Announce that we slept together! 
 - Come on now! We're in the office!

735
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,710
If you want people to know, just announce it on a speaker.

736
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:02,670
- What speaker? 
 - If not, grab your treasure and reflect.

737
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:05,760
- What reflection? 
 - Why do you annoy me so much?

738
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,960
- When did I annoy— 
 - Did I force you into it?

739
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,310
Did I force you when you didn't consent?

740
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:14,100
- I mean, you didn't force— 
 - You came at me first—

741
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,060
- Huh? 
 - O-Oh, sorry.

742
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,660
I mean... that's...

743
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:22,110
- We, at the same time... 
 - You took your clothes off first—

744
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:33,440
- You're the one who suggested the hotel! 
 - Okay, okay.

745
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,830
Okay, okay.

746
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,170
I'm sorry. Okay?

747
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:37,550
I was wrong.

748
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:42,140
You're making me angry in a variety of ways.

749
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:45,920
Even being tacky has its limits.

750
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,500
Let's do better, okay?

751
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:55,960
Do what?

752
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,530
Let's just do better at acting like nothing happened.

753
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,110
Okay?

754
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,300
Huh?

755
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,580
Where's your answer?

756
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,140
One...

757
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,890
two...

758
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,200
three!

759
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,630
I mean...

760
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,090
How could something that happened...

761
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,890
become something that didn't happen?

762
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,570
Of course, it can if you try. Why can't it?

763
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,060
It didn't for me...

764
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,720
even after I tried.

765
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,860
It keeps popping up in my head.

766
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,300
Do you think it's easy for everyone like it is for you, Noona?

767
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,690
Gosh, I'm going nuts.

768
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,780
Gosh, what do I do about this?

769
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:29,200
What's with the romantic machismo, mister?

770
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:50,210
Oppa said he'll come later.

771
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:52,440
You mean Jeong Joon Kyeong?

772
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,890
Well, what else would I call him?

773
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,200
Did I say something?

774
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,350
You should rest, too.

775
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:02,490
Da Wool opened her eyes.

776
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,200
Da Wool...

777
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,760
Da Wool, can you see me?

778
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,600
I'll get the doctor again. One second.

779
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,850
It's...

780
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,660
What did you say?

781
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,980
It's the weird uncle.

782
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,080
Yes.

783
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:42,990
It's the weird uncle.

784
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,710
Make sure not to skip meals.

785
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,450
If you need something, you can contact me.

786
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,870
Get back now. I'll be off.

787
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:08,710
Eun Byeol was also about Da Wool's age, right?

788
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,550
Doesn't seeing Da Wool remind you of Eun Byeol?

789
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,650
I wondered who you were talking about.

790
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,040
What's this? You didn't know who I was talking about?

791
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,400
Yes.

792
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,800
I guess you don't have that dream anymore.

793
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,230
You said she came in your dream when you were in college.

794
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,460
That's such an old story.

795
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,690
I'm glad.

796
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:37,560
I was worried that you might still be heartbroken about it.

797
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:45,070
In that case...

798
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:48,650
could you be Da Wool's dad, please?

799
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:02,250
Am I being too shameless?

800
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:42,290
♫  I remember your face when you came to me once  ♫

801
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:45,910
 This singer has a concert this weekend.

802
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:47,300
 Do you want to go together?

803
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,660
 I also like that song.

804
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,420
♫  You spitefully took my dysfunctional heart  ♫

805
00:58:55,130 --> 00:59:01,420
♫  And your bright smile easily opened my heart  ♫

806
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,030
 Thank you.

807
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:04,750
 Go rest now.

808
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:12,570
♫  It's true, that is how I became your man  ♫

809
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:17,140
 Let's... get a divorce.

810
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:21,110
Why do you like me?

811
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,810
I do everything as I please.

812
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,440
And I'm fickle.

813
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,420
You don't know now, but

814
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,420
you'll get bored of it after some time.

815
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,800
You'll be tired of me and

816
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,530
find me cumbersome without fail.

817
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,620
That's great.

818
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:44,300
As of now, I think I'll need to be a little tired of you.

819
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:49,590
♫  And like a dream, my heart remains in your embrace  ♫

820
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:52,960
♫  Without awakening for a single moment  ♫

821
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,680
You want to go out with me?

822
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:05,950
♫  And if you would always rest by my side like breaths  ♫

823
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,730
♫  If you would remain like that  ♫

824
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:12,130
♫  Nothing better  ♫

825
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:18,430
♫  Nothing better than you  ♫

826
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:23,900
♫  I just can't understand  ♫

827
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:30,920
♫  my way without your love  ♫

828
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,400
♫  I have nowhere else to run  ♫

829
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,690
 He keeps making me meet his mother.

830
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:44,200
 What kind of friendliness is there between in-laws?  
 -  This is ridiculous.

831
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,640
 It's hard to meet a man like me.

832
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,830
 Your ex-husband is amazing.

833
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,420
 - So many women come at him— 
 - Hey!

834
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,000
 - It's me, Seo Hee! 
 - Ki Seo Hee?

835
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,720
 Why do I care about Goo Eun Beom and Ki Seo Hee?

836
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,820
 - You're jealous. 
 - I am?

837
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,430
 You're the driver of your life.

838
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:03,470
 Who are you thinking of having in your passenger seat?

839
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:07,810
