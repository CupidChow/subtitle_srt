1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,020

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,160

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,330

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,100

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,073

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,650

7
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,470
Well, this is my junior, Jae Gyeom.

8
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,780
You already had plans?

9
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,460
You two should eat. Why invite me...

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,250
- No, the thing— 
 - It's fine. I'll leave first.

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,070
Excuse me.

12
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,400
I didn't plan to meet Hyung tonight.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
Aren't we on a blind date tonight?

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,500
Ta-da.

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,310
Surprise.

16
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,220
Are you okay?

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,170
Y-Yes.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The steak is... really thick.

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,120
May I cut it for you?

20
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,360
I'm asking just in case,

21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,880
but do you like that kind of stuff?

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,500
Do you have a fetish

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,200
where it has to be an ex-girlfriend or an ex-wife of someone you know?

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,870
Do such fetishes even exist?

25
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,050
Are you asking because you have one?

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,890
Did you date Goo Eun Beom?

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,650

28
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,620
What? Blind date?

29
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,610
Gosh, it's embarrassing to think about it even now.

30
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,460
Who would've even thought it'd be a blind date?

31
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,830
So you went ahead with it?

32
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,580
What can I do, then?

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,950
Should I cry on the floor and ask how could he do that to me?

34
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,590
Or should I filet him to pieces with the steak knife?

35
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,970
Why are you so extreme?

36
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,270
You can just ask seriously why he'd do something you didn't ask for.

37
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,800
The mood wasn't right for me to get serious.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,180
If I got angry, he'd say, "Why? What did you expect?"

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,250
Making me the only odd one out.

40
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,490
He was going, "Surprise. You like it, right?"

41
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,400
- Overreacting and exaggerating. 
 - Yes, yes.

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,410
So, you chose to have diarrhea over constipation?

43
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,900
Yeah.

44
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,380

45
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,230
What do I do?

46
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,140
Do I have to keep in touch with him?

47
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,140
By the way...

48
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,750
what's up with this weirdo who's willing to go on a blind date with a friend's ex-wife?

49
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,200
He's also ridiculous for agreeing to come along.

50
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,280
Right?

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,370
He said he watches a lot of my shows,

52
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,200
so he's been an old fan of mine or something.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,490
 And Hyung was quiet and said he knew her.

54
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,750
 I thought this was fate.

55
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,910
 So I asked him to introduce me right away.

56
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,980
 Someone he knows...

57
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,430
 Oh, I did hear later...

58
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,350
 that he knows you from having been married.

59
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,310
 But I actually lived in the U.S. for a long time,

60
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,650
 so I'm not really repulsed by these things.

61
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,740
Gosh, does he think he's the only one who lived in the U.S.?

62
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,090
Right?

63
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,920
Unni, not everyone's cool like that, even in the U.S. Right?

64
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,660
Come on.

65
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,350
Hey, people are people in the U.S.

66
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,400
There are those weirdly cool people,

67
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,020
but some people are conservative, like 19th-century Puritans.

68
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,010
That's so ridiculous.

69
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,690
So, how old is he?

70
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,380
- 32. 
 - His job?

71
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,790
He said he's a consultant.

72
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,650
In a foreign-affiliated company.

73
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,790
What about his looks? Are they decent?

74
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,670
Well, he looks sane.

75
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,970
Do you have a picture? Let me see.

76
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,410
What! He's handsome!

77
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,250
Hey, date him.

78
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,210
- What? 
 - Date him! At least, sleep with him.

79
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,630
Let's sleep! Okay?

80
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,250
Sleep—

81
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,710
Oh, my goodness, Unni!

82
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,390
Let's sleep! Let's sleep.

83
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,760
Come on! You're crazy!

84
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,230
How can I sleep with a man he introduced?

85
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,600
Why can't you?

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,300
It's going to feel like having a threesome with Goo Eun Beom.

87
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,390
Do you not like the threesome part or having Goo Eun Beom in it?

88
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,640
Both of them!

89
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,700
Am I the only one who feels uneasy?

90
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,000
Does it not matter to him if I kiss or sleep with his close friend?

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,630
You should ask him. I'm sure he'll say this 100%.

92
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,120
Two grown-ups are doing it under mutual agreement.

93
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,310
Isn't it weirder for the mediator to have feelings about it?

94
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,910
Right?

95
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,900
That's right.

96
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,900
This sister still has somewhat of a conservative side, although she lived in the U.S.

97
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,830
Don't we all know each other after six degrees of separation in this small country?

98
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,630
We're probably all connected here and there.

99
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,690
If you keep filtering, there's no one to date.

100
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,450
Isn't that true, Kwon Si Wook?

101
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,220
Not sure.

102
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
How should I put this?

103
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,700
Honestly, it's not like this is Hollywood or something.

104
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,100
Our subject matter is inappropriate to have in the office in broad daylight.

105
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,330
Oh, that's right.

106
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,140
For a fifth-generation-only son raised in a traditional Confucius city in Korea,

107
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,850
Confucius Boy Kwon Si Wook, this conversation might be lacking morals too much.

108
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,900
What was that?

109
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,420
What's wrong with an ex-wife and ex-husband talking to help each other's pursuit of happiness...

110
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,720
that this conversation is lacking morals?

111
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,260
- Now, this workspace is... where we— 
 - Attorney Oh,

112
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,890
CEO Hong's done talking on the phone and called you in.

113
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,540
Oh, okay.

114
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,350
Excuse me.

115
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,970
Welcome.

116
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,780
I have an appointment for a consultation.

117
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,120
Your name is?

118
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,440
Sang Eun?

119
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,910
Sang Eun!

120
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,480
Gosh, it's been forever.

121
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,810
Yes, hello.

122
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,650
- Have you been doing well? 
 - Yes.

123
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,850
Is it our first time after the wedding?

124
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,200
I think so.

125
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,630
- No wonder. You were in my dream last night. 
 - Sorry?

126
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,230
It's a joke.

127
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,670
Come on in.

128
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,890
Do you work here?

129
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,180
Where would I be working if not here?

130
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,290
It's so nice to see you.

131
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,450
Is Attorney Goo finally going to fetch us a client?

132
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,900
Seriously.

133
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,960
I thought he'd only waste payroll.

134
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Ye Seul, why do you look at me like that?

135
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,620
Mr. Lion, when will you take care of the receipt I gave you last week?

136
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,130
Lion?

137
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,360
Why do you call me a lion?

138
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,740
Because you're the king of the jungle, Mr. Seong.

139
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,140
Jungle...

140
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,910
Okay. I'm the only weird one again.

141
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,840

142
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,290
She said she'd be here by 10:00.

143
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,840

144
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,000
Hey, Sang Eun, it's me. Are you running late?

145
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,420
What? You're already here?

146
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,460
Where are you?

147
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,140
 By the way...

148
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,570
 I also have to, first off—

149
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,150
What are you doing with my friend?

150
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,380
You seemed to be busy, so I welcomed her in instead.

151
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,360
Why?

152
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,660
Okay. Thank you.

153
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,120
Let's go to my office.

154
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,040
Hey, Ha Ra, you know...

155
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,440
don't misunderstand when I say this.

156
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,610
What misunderstanding?

157
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,230
Wow!

158
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,710
The only attorney who takes a case by intercepting his ex-wife's client.

159
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,220
Probably no one else in the legal field of Korea.

160
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,410
You're something else, Goo Eun Beom.

161
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,730
Hey, what do you mean "intercept"? Mind your word choice.

162
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,540
We're doing it together, undoubtedly. A joint appointment.

163
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,680
But, hey...

164
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,630
What's your specialty that even we don't know about?

165
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,510
I heard you ran your mouth to Ha Ra's friend, saying it's your specialty.

166
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,710
Your specialty, my ass.

167
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,940
How can you lie so blatantly?

168
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,480
He's not even a lawyer. Are you a fraud?

169
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,920
Of course, it's my specialty. Would it be yours, then?

170
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,830
It's certainly a men's area.

171
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:49,280
As a woman, could you talk about the subtle and sensitive topic of

172
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,360
a man's decline in sexual function better than I can?

173
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,600
Oh, so you're saying

174
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,470
you're an expert on sexual dysfunction?

175
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,500
Why? Have you recently

176
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,840
developed a problem down there or something?

177
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,020
- No way. 
 - Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah!

178
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,860
What are you both talking about right now?

179
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,200
Stop fighting and explain the case properly.

180
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,020
So it's a divorce case for refusing to engage in a conjugal relationship.

181
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,400
With an issue regarding men's sexual dysfunction sprinkled on top.

182
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,110
At some point,

183
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,840
my husband won't sleep with me.

184
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,810
Even if I send him obvious signals,

185
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,820
he'll pretend to be sleeping or come home late.

186
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,460
At first, I wondered if it was my fault.

187
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,800
Wondering if I lack attractiveness as a woman.

188
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,570
 Darling...

189
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,440
 Darling?

190
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,350
 Oppa.

191
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,360
 Hey, Kim Mu Jin!

192
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,460
But my pride was so bruised later.

193
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,450
So I just gave up.

194
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,550
How long has it been since things have been like that?

195
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,430
- Four years. 
 - What?

196
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,540
For four years?

197
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,730
Hey!

198
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,460
Just divorce him. You made the right choice.

199
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,240
What do you lack to be living like a widow like that?

200
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,700
But how was it when you were dating?

201
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,970
- Did he not like it in the first place? 
 - Not at all.

202
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,380
He loved it.

203
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,290
It was also okay during our newlywed days.

204
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,130
But...

205
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:52,270
She thinks he developed a problem in having intercourse.

206
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,420
So suddenly?

207
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,020
- Was he very old? 
 - No, he isn't.

208
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,490
He's only a year older than I am.

209
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,240
Aside from age, psychological factors also have a big influence.

210
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,000
For example something like a plummeting pride as a man.

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,370
Plummeting pride?

212
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,560
Is there a reason for that to happen?

213
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,300
You know, Oppa and I work in the same field.

214
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,150
When I changed jobs last time, my salary went up a lot.

215
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,830
About two times Oppa's salary, I'd say?

216
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,960
From then on, Oppa kept saying these passing remarks.

217
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,700
That he's pressured to death because his wife is doing too well.

218
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,720
I really thought he was joking.

219
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,190
But no matter how I think about it...

220
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,360
there's no other reason I can think of.

221
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,430
How can he be so weak like a sunfish? 
  (Slang for someone with a weak mind)

222
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,340
His self-esteem plummeted so much for such a reason?

223
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,560
Is that really the reason?

224
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,610
It's quite a complicated problem.

225
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,720
It's possible.

226
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,920
- Hey, Attorney Kwon. 
 - Yes?

227
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,530
You should be happy if your wife is successful and makes more money.

228
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,840
Why are you trying to side with him, saying it's plausible?

229
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,220
Senior, you wouldn't know because you're not a man.

230
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,400
Let's look here.

231
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,650
An animal called a man lives and dies by pride alone.

232
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,660
If he lacks competence compared to the woman he's supposed to protect, then—

233
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,230
Protect what, exactly?

234
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,200
Are we in the Joseon era, where the Japanese and the barbarians invaded?

235
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,080
If you two are going to fight, get out and fight.

236
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,070
Let's have the meeting, please?

237
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,550
Let's have the meeting.

238
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,620
Could you get a divorce verdict for refusing a conjugal relationship?

239
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,620
It'll be difficult.

240
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,680
We first need to convince the husband to proceed with divorce by agreement.

241
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,680
- The husband is against the divorce, right? 
 - Yes.

242
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,550
Absolutely against it.

243
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,100
So it's not an affair?

244
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,690
Exactly.

245
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,590
My friend looked through her husband's phone and credit card history,

246
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,420
but there's nothing.

247
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,520
Moreover, if he has a problem down there,

248
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,400
I don't think he could really have an affair.

249
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,500
However, he could've used his phone and credit card carefully not to get caught.

250
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,890
Regarding intercourse, he could've done it too diligently outside the home,

251
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,410
so it might not work when it's with his wife.

252
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,690
In my opinion, this one's adultery, 100%.

253
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,900
True. You're the expert in that area.

254
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,390
Since you're so knowledgeable about the psychology of someone who cheats.

255
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,380
 Why don't you get on a time machine and play the classical scholar?

256
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,080
 Okay, I'll go!

257
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,770
Play?

258
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,180
Are we going on a vacation?

259
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,160
For now, keep looking for evidence of adultery and

260
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
schedule a meeting with the spouse.

261
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,840
We need to hear his story as well.

262
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,600
This is it for today's meeting.

263
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,680
- Shall we go eat? 
 - What are you having for lunch?

264
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,980
Go and stop Bi Chwi first. She's going to fight all day.

265
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,160
S-Shall we go for some food?

266
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,820
What do you do at night instead of sleeping?

267
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,460

268
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,900
What do I do?

269
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,560
The guy from a blind date. He keeps asking about our next date.

270
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,790
It's really driving me crazy.

271
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,710
Just meet him. Why not?

272
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,960
Even so, I still don't feel at ease.

273
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,210
With an acquaintance of my ex-husband.

274
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,400
Gosh, what a pity.

275
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,790
He had such a great physique.

276
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:38,250
If not, you should really sleep with him.

277
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,040
There you go with that nonsense again.

278
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,130
What if Goo Eun Beom hears about it?

279
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,960
I'm telling you, let him hear it.

280
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,980
Sleep with him and say this.

281
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,320
"I slept with him and... yeah... he was good.

282
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,650
Way better than you."

283
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,220
You must've heard what Kwon Si Wook was saying earlier.

284
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,600
If men find it sensitive and delicate enough to make them feel so fragile,

285
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,080
you can do it, too.

286
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,090
You should humiliate him, so he won't be able to stick it out anywhere else.

287
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,460
What do you say?

288
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,490
To your mad ex-husband who dares to introduce another man to you,

289
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,790
isn't it such a perfect innovative revenge?

290
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,770
I'm not sure. For me to go that far?

291
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,050
Also, would Goo Eun Beom even react to something like that?

292
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,830
He's just so full of confidence.

293
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,220
Just wait and see.

294
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,650
Even if his heart is made of stone,

295
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,100
probably not down there.

296
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,900
Has it been 10 or 20 years since you last had intercourse?

297
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,200
Aren't you being too impatient as a wife?

298
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,630
I mean it'd be different if they had a kid.

299
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,960
It's not like they're DINK or something. In that case...

300
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,000
isn't engagement in conjugal relationships obligatory?

301
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,120
DINK? What the heck is that?

302
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,330
DINK.

303
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,810
Double Income, No Kids.

304
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,510
We can...

305
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,060
have a kid through artificial insemination, right?

306
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,450
Sir.

307
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,510
That's something you should consider after attempting to resolve the

308
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,190
fundamental problem, sexual dysfunction, and if you fail at that.

309
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,220
Do you know how hard it is?

310
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,760
Look.

311
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,970
I don't have any problem with my function.

312
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,310
You have no idea.

313
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,060
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

314
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,400
You have no problem in functioning?

315
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,620
No, not at all.

316
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,590
Did Sang Eun slander you without any grounds, then?

317
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,060
- These people are being so rude— 
 - Come on.

318
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,830
By the way, do the two of you know this?

319
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:06,270
Our country is number one in the world for sexless marriages.

320
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,000
We're busy trying to make a living these days, right?

321
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,940
Attorney, that isn't normal, though.

322
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,730
Are you going to insist they accept it since the statistics say so?

323
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,690
Then, how many times...

324
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,800
do ordinary married couples need to have sex per week?

325
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Attorney Oh, how many times do you do it per week?

326
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,740
Huh?

327
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,550
Huh?

328
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,700
Gosh, he's such a perverted nutcase.

329
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,710
He dared to sexually harass an opposing attorney he met for the first time?

330
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,890
I should've recorded it and sued him.

331
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,130
Even if you sued him, these things are vague.

332
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,770
There you go again.

333
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,450
Judge Goo Eun Beom strikes again.

334
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,800
Didn't I tell you all the time?

335
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,000
If you're not going to relate, then just be quiet, please.

336
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,430
Are you working overtime today?

337
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,240
Do you want to grab dinner?

338
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,390
There's the spicy cold noodle place here.

339
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,380
The one we used to go to often.

340
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,050
What dinner, out of the blue?

341
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,070
- I'm fine. 
 - Why?

342
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,470
You need to eat spicy stuff when you're stressed.

343
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,000
I have a dinner plan.

344
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,030
With Min Jae Gyeom.

345
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,310
He's not bad, right? Now that you've talked to him.

346
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,820
I thought you'd be able to talk to him.

347
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,950
You said you like a man you can talk to.

348
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,250
That was so long ago.

349
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,610
Talk?

350
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,690
Why would I talk to a man?

351
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,000
Unless it's talking with my body.

352
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,100
Talking with your body?

353
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,700
Your values became very proactive.

354
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,930
Well, thanks to you know who.

355
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,170
Wait...

356
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,280
You mean, me?

357
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,010
What did I do exactly?

358
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,790
Oh, no. What I mean is...

359
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,190
After living with someone like you, I had

360
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,700
lost interest in conversations with the opposite sex.

361
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,470
It's not like I suddenly opened my eyes because you excelled in something.

362
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,100
Whoa, that's why...

363
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,760
That's why you began to actively engage in body talk?

364
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,080
Wait...

365
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,810
Why is our talk going in that direction?

366
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,080
It's not like that. Not at all.

367
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,260
Don't have any weird thoughts.

368
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,760
What thoughts am I having?

369
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,030
It's not.

370
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,260
- Your face is turning red— 
 - I said it's not!

371
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,460
How was dinner tonight?

372
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,010
Yes, well...

373
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,580
The mackerel sashimi was exceptionally good. Right?

374
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,300
It reminded me of the mackerel I had on Jeju Island.

375
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,670
Their mackerel stew was great.

376
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,130
Whoa...

377
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,890
I'd have to go all the way to Jeju to feed you what you like.

378
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,590
Well, it's no big deal. We'll go.

379
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,470
Let's go to Jeju sometime for mackerel stew.

380
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,820
I've been to Jeju a few times.

381
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,810
I thought it was great every time I went.

382
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,200
The ocean and the sky...

383
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,820
It had a kind of foreign vibe.

384
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,810
If we go to Jeju,

385
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,600
- will we be sleeping there? 
 - Sorry?

386
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,340
Of course, we will. Right?

387
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,800
It's not like we'll be making a day trip for mackerel stew.

388
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,520
I'm not sure. I don't think it's a necessarily required condition.

389
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,310
There's no need to go...

390
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,750
all the way to Jeju to sleep.

391
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,690
I'm okay with it even tonight.

392
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,270
Deal?

393
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,000
I guess you don't like me.

394
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,860
I like you, Ha Ra, but you don't have to force yourself to see me if you don't want to.

395
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,930
I don't make it a hobby to ask a man I don't like to sleep with me.

396
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,920
You're not asking to sleep with me because you like me. Right?

397
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,420
You're smart and... your face is handsome.

398
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,330
You probably have many women around you.

399
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,860
You don't intend to have a serious relationship with me, either.

400
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,480
Ha Ra, you're also pretty, smart, and awesome.

401
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,250
Although it sounds like an inferiority complex,

402
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,920
I have a flaw, to be frank.

403
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,000
You've never been married.

404
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,800
I'm a divorcee.

405
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,540
Perhaps... did you make a bet with Goo Eun Beom or something?

406
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,200
To be rewarded if you seduce me?

407
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,660
I'm not sure if this is the right thing to say here,

408
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,770
but my mother remarried three times.

409
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,090
I'm not saying I understand you, but...

410
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,690
it also doesn't mean my mother has a flaw.

411
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,120
Well...

412
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,650
The mackerel sashimi we had tonight...

413
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,750
was delicious.

414
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,690
Same here.

415
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,950
Thank you for driving me home.

416
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,400
Not at all.

417
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
Please take care.

418
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,870
I had fun tonight.

419
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,000
You know...

420
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,080
Can I drop the honorifics next time when we meet?

421
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,790
You can say no to dropping the honorifics,

422
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,530
but I hope you won't say no to meeting again. 
  (Spoken without honorifics)

423
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,880
Okay.

424
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,480
Yes!

425
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,590
Since I granted your favor, Jae Gyeom,

426
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,900
could I also ask you for a favor?

427
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,690
Sure. Anything.

428
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,440
You said anything just now.

429
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,450
You can't dodge it, okay?

430
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,180
N-No, we can't.

431
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,400
Whoa, amazing!

432
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,370
I guess he seriously didn't want to.

433
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,000
Right?

434
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,630
Unless he seriously didn't want to, he couldn't have done that. Right?

435
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,650
It hurts my pride.

436
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,600
This isn't about your pride hurting.

437
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,350
How do I put it... It's about respect for the mackerel or...

438
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,420
What I mean is...

439
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,420
There are people who don't like to kiss without brushing their teeth.

440
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,950
But still, I took great courage to approach him like that.

441
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,110
How can he dodge that?

442
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,280
Okay.

443
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,160
Try to avoid mackerels from now on.

444
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,020
I'm going on ahead.

445
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,730

446
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,500
 You can't do that. You shouldn't skip meals.

447
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,600
 Do you want to go eat something delicious next time?

448
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,980
Hey, I guess that gentleman doesn't loath you as a filthy woman

449
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,900
when you came onto him without brushing your teeth.

450
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,510
He's a decent person in many ways.

451
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,720
No bias as well.

452
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,430
Gosh, you're both so diligent.

453
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,910
Hi.

454
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,180
- Welcome. 
 - Have you eaten?

455
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,860
Yes, of course, we did.

456
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,260
Did you have a good date?

457
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,540
Of course, I did. You think I wouldn't have?

458
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,990
A date? What date?

459
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,140
Don't you know?

460
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,220
Goo introduced his junior friend to Oh.

461
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,500
What?

462
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,260
- You crazy— 
 - Why?

463
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,640
It must be great to be you...

464
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,790
since you have many people to spit on your grave.

465
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,550
The grass will probably grow without a problem.

466
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,250
Should I spit on your grave if you want, CEO Seo?

467
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,620
Shit!

468
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,600
Everyone's here, right?

469
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,480
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

470
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,230
Inquiry of financial transaction details,

471
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,790
inquiry of international travel records,

472
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,260
and inquiry about call details.

473
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,800
I don't know if they'll accept all of these.

474
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,140
But why did you leave out the sexual dysfunction issue?

475
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,760
During the meeting,

476
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,900
it was bothering me a little bit

477
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,520
how the husband was trembling, saying that it was not true.

478
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,700
It's hard to prove in the first place, and if it turns out that he's fine,

479
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,260
we just give them a reason to—

480
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,500
The tables will turn in their favor.

481
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,900
So, you plan to pressure them by bombarding them with inquiries first?

482
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,400
Right.

483
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,000
I disapprove of all of the inquiry requests.

484
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,100
What do we do then? Am I doomed? I can't divorce him?

485
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,430
No.

486
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,810
That's why we also just used the last resort.

487
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,030
In fact, we also have something to add to the cause of the suit.

488
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,060
There's one more imputation on the defendant, Kim Mu Jin, Your Honor.

489
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,640
Besides refusing to engage in conjugal relationships?

490
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,460
Yes. His reason for refusing to engage in conjugal relationships has been specified.

491
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,190
What is the reason?

492
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,690
We suspect Defendant Kim Mu Jin...

493
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,640
to be suffering a severe sexual dysfunction.

494
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,690
A sexual dysfunction?

495
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,890
The plaintiff is currently suspecting her husband

496
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,520
is avoiding intercourse because he developed sexual dysfunction.

497
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:25,080
Refusing intercourse can't be a reason for divorce, but sexual dysfunction can?

498
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,680
You should've used that as the reason for divorce in the first place.

499
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,610
But the thing is... proving that issue is quite problematic.

500
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,190
Because of the burden of proof.

501
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,540
What is that?

502
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,000
To put it simply,

503
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,010
in the end, a trial is similar to a game of tennis.

504
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,110
While you're hitting the ball over the net,

505
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,654
you're telling each other to prove their point.

506
00:28:48,654 --> 00:28:52,879
And if one side misses the ball and fails to prove their point,

507
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:54,579
then that side loses.

508
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,580
So that means... it's our turn to prove the claim we put out.

509
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,740
Your Honor, to prove his sexual dysfunction,

510
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,810
I'd like the defendant to submit his urology examination results to the court.

511
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,250
Could I request a discovery, please?

512
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,090
I said my client doesn't have sexual dysfunction.

513
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,100
You're determined to humiliate this man.

514
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,000
Your Honor, it's inevitable for people to have a difference in libido,

515
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,980
but they're trying to find one flaw by abusing requests.

516
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,800
You mustn't allow that!

517
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,270
Also, although my client doesn't have an issue down there,

518
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,740
to add to my argument,

519
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,830
sexual dysfunction is a temporary problem that can be treated.

520
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,900
So it can't serve as a reason for divorce.

521
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:44,800
In short, I'm saying there isn't any reason to accept the request for discovery.

522
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,290
Of course, a treatable, temporary problem is not a reason for divorce.

523
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,220
But if he does have sexual dysfunction,yet he neglected treatment

524
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,950
and didn't fulfill his duty to his spouse,

525
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,960
then this becomes a problem.

526
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,560
So, if the defendant brings his urology examination results,

527
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,900
everything will become clear.

528
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,940
Your Honor, if his sexual dysfunction is proven,

529
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,500
it will also prove that the defendant, who has continuously denied and avoided the matter,

530
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,700
hasn't been fulfilling his duty of integrity between a married couple.

531
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,060
 Yes!

532
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,000
I think it's better for the defendant to get tested.

533
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,860
For an efficient progression of the trial, please cooperate.

534
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,400
Yes, Your Honor.

535
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,560
Gosh, what a relief.

536
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,220
Then, we just need the test results?

537
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,930
But...

538
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,290
there are still two problems with that.

539
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,540
What problems?

540
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,860
First, discovery isn't mandatory but encouraged.

541
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,530
If they insist on not doing it,

542
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,240
then we have no way of forcing them.

543
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,870
Second,

544
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,990
if they do the test...

545
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,180
and it's not sexual dysfunction...

546
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,020
If it's not?

547
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,560
There's a chance he could be fine when getting tested at the hospital.

548
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,260
If it's psychology-related anyway,

549
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,510
it might be a problem with your relationship.

550
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,050
In that case, sexual dysfunction will be harder to prove.

551
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,550
What about you?

552
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,210
What are you doing?

553
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,710
You claimed to be an expert in male problems.

554
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,930
You should contribute something, too.

555
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,460
You insisted it was a 100% affair,

556
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,110
but you haven't discovered anything.

557
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,610
She's right.

558
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,980
I agreed to the joint appointment because you said a man knows men's issues.

559
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,500
But I don't really see your merit.

560
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,780
Sang Eun, you can't be so quick to judge.

561
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,520
For now...

562
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,090
For now, should I meet with your husband?

563
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,850
Then what? What will you do?

564
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,290
I'll convince him.

565
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,990
If you want to win, just take the test.

566
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,210
No, don't get the test.

567
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:36,710
You... You do know what you're saying, right?

568
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,740
Yes, of course.

569
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,620
Sang Eun, could you give me your husband's phone number?

570
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,590
For now, I'll—

571
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,200
You better not make this harder by meeting him and provoking him.

572
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,650
You're dead meat, then.

573
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,370
Got it?

574
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,600
Thank you.

575
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,830
Have some.

576
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,930
Why are you bothering me at work when I'm so busy?

577
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:22,190
Sir, the reason I asked to meet with you today

578
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:27,120
was to give you some honest advice, man to man.

579
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:32,630
Sir, will you do the sexual function test?

580
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,640
Why? You said I should.

581
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,550
Did your attorney tell you to?

582
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,680
Wait... Why should I tell you that?

583
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,270
Did you come here to sound it out?

584
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:47,100
Sir, I just want to help you.

585
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,340
You don't know...

586
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,000
how hurtful that can be to a man's soul.

587
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,650
That exam is more difficult than you'd expect.

588
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,990
Do you know how it's done?

589
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,200
I'm very familiar with it.

590
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,520
My previous client had it done it before.

591
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,000
Well, so...

592
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,230
The reason why it's difficult...

593
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:16,130
The consultation makes you feel so ashamed by asking such detailed questions.

594
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:19,650
Do you know how mortifying that exam is?

595
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,270
Angle test, hormone test,

596
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,100
and be admitted overnight to make sure there's no problem in the early morning...

597
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,800
On top of that,

598
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,220
they also perform a rigidity test and etc.

599
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,350
So what I want to say is...

600
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,900
avoid a traumatic experience trying to prove you're healthy.

601
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,180
Instead of discovery, move on to an adjustment and quickly draw an agreement...

602
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,550
So, you're telling me to divorce her?

603
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,470
The judge will rule in favor of divorce, anyway.

604
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:58,290
The court wouldn't like it if you ignored them when it requested a discovery.

605
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,200
So, should you have the exam?

606
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,150
You get scared when you're getting tested.

607
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,700
Even the healthiest men, out of nervousness,

608
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,020
they can't get it up when it really should.

609
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,740
If you take the exam and still end up divorcing,

610
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,410
the verdict will blatantly state you divorced

611
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,910
because of sexual dysfunction.

612
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,970
In that case, you might have to pay alimony as well.

613
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,900
Sir...

614
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,790
Yes.

615
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,030
Do you know why I'm going to this extent?

616
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,060
Of course not.

617
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,290
I feel it's a shame.

618
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,760
I know very well...

619
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,180
where you're coming from.

620
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,950
That thing, you know...

621
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,360
Other people would never know.

622
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,110
Wow... there are all sorts of divorce lawsuits, huh?

623
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,230
This isn't even the worst.

624
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,750
There are so many more ridiculous cases.

625
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,270
That's why I try not to file complaints outside of work.

626
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,930
Why?

627
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,550
Because fighting is work for me.

628
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,750
In writing and at the court, too,

629
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,200
always arguing, "I'm right, and you're wrong."

630
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,310
It must make you think since they're all divorce cases.

631
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,160
You only listen to many people's stories about their breakups.

632
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,590
You must not have any fantasies about marriage and love.

633
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,400
Even if I'm not a divorce lawyer,

634
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,440
am I not too old to have fantasies like that?

635
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,820
Do you have that, Jae Gyeom?

636
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,820
Well, I can't say that I don't.

637
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,070
I have a fantasy about a complete family.

638
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,220
Since I never had one.

639
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,990
If I get to create a family,

640
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:02,020
I'm confident I can cherish it more than anything I have.

641
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:08,800
Of course, there's no guarantee it'll be perfect just because I'll be cherishing it.

642
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,000
I sound too childish now that I'm talking about it.

643
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:22,060
I think you're pure, Jae Gyeom.

644
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,350
Is that a compliment or an insult?

645
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,830
It's a secret.

646
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,040
Oh, right. Why didn't you drop the honorifics?

647
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,160
You declared so happily last time.

648
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,380
O-Okay. 
  (Spoken without honorifics)

649
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,500
I will.

650
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,470
But what about your answer to my question?

651
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,220
Is it a compliment or an insult?

652
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,780
It's a total...

653
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,290
a compliment.

654
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,990
It's nice to drop... honorifics, isn't it?

655
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,060
Jae Gyeom.

656
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,960
Y-Yes, it's nice to...

657
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,920
drop honorifics, Ha Ra.

658
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,630
It was so much fun tonight.

659
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,160
For me, too.

660
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,830
I'll be going.

661
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,580
Ha Ra...

662
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,710
Oh, w-wait.

663
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:03,350
Well... let's stop here today.

664
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,150
Why?

665
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,200
My heart's starting to flutter.

666
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,980
So tell me...

667
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,760
is he... a good kisser?

668
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,080
Very.

669
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,070
What a relief. I don't need to lie.

670
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,120
You know, Goo Eun Beom.

671
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,400
You need to tell him Jae Gyeom is way better than him

672
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,850
to deflate that ego of his. Aren't I right?

673
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,690
But you suck at lying.

674
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,000
He'll catch on if you tell him a lousy lie.

675
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,490
I'll catch on to what?

676
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,460
It's nothing.

677
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,510
I got a call from Kim Mu Jin's attorney just now.

678
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,700
Did you get a call, too?

679
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,260
No, not yet. Why?

680
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,510
I'm Goo Eun Beom.

681
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,740
You said you have a problem down there?

682
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,400
Of course.

683
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,880
That much of a lie seemed to be needed to build some rapport.

684
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,000
You're crazy.

685
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,350
Whoa, hey! What the—

686
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,900
What the—?

687
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,620
What... What's happening?

688
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,660
Hold on.

689
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,130
There it goes again.

690
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,240
You can just pull the lever on the side.

691
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,120
Where?

692
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,910
It keeps breaking down since I bought it dirt cheap.

693
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,300
Hold on. I'll fix it at the next red light.

694
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,470
Hey, did this car get flooded before or something?

695
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,620
Did you do your research before buying it?

696
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,730
Flooded cars... aren't always bad.

697
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,420
Hold on.

698
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,420
Okay.

699
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,600
One, two, three.

700
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,700
One, two, three.

701
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,090
Geez, why isn't it working?

702
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,320
One, two...

703
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,600
Okay, one, two...

704
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,010
Gosh. Hold on.

705
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,990
Hold on.

706
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,980
Hey, just take the subway.

707
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,310
Do you want to risk your life in this lousy car?

708
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:53,430
Why? Does it worry you?

709
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,550
If you're worried, you could decrease the alimony money.

710
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,090
So I can buy a car through installment payments.

711
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,520
Just take the subway.

712
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,000
I think it's that woman.

713
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,400
- Who? 
 - Ki Seo Hee.

714
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,300
- You didn't see her? 
 - I didn't.

715
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,190
Was I mistaken?

716
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:06,870
Whenever I look at you,

717
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:11,120
I feel that karma really does exist.

718
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,100
Who knew you'd end up like this when we divorced?

719
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:20,900
You probably believed you'd start a new, happy life with your first love.

720
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,600
You had no clue your mom would take your studio and amend her will.

721
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,370
I couldn't... fathom how you could be fine with Jae Gyeom and me

722
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:34,880
hitting it off, but...

723
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,050
now I think I can understand you.

724
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,980
I used to tremble with anger when I thought about that woman, Ki Seo Hee.

725
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:47,990
But now... I just think... that was terrible of her.

726
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,900
Shouldn't she take responsibility if she stole you from me?

727
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,500
I wonder if she even has a conscience.

728
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,100
Don't we truly seem like friends now?

729
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,650
Sorry.

730
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,430
Her betrayal knows no bounds!

731
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,860
Did you read it? Did you read everything?

732
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,330
How could a woman be so thick-skinned, huh?

733
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,480
She's the one who cheated,

734
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,900
so she makes a big deal out of their sex life,

735
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,290
and goes crazy about a divorce. Geez.

736
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:36,030
I knew something was odd from the get-go.

737
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:39,910
Sang Eun, is this... really true?

738
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,960
Go ahead and try denying it.

739
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,980
I'll show you something worse.

740
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:53,770
Is the other party aware? That you're... filing for divorce?

741
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:58,840
Yes. He says he'll take care of me once I get divorced.

742
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,260
- Is he married or single? 
 - He's single.

743
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,720
You and he both are... not in your right minds.

744
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,460
- What does he do? 
 - He's still a student.

745
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,200
- He's young. 
 - By how many years?

746
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,000
- 10 years. 
 - He's 25 years old?

747
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,120
He says he's confident he can make me happy if I get divorced.

748
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:30,220
Sang Eun... do you really believe that?

749
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,200
He's 25 years old!

750
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,480
Do you really believe what a 25-year-old kid says to a married woman 10 years his senior?

751
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,060
I believe him. I love him.

752
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,420
Gosh... Goodness... Are you really Yim Sang Eun?

753
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,120
Are you the Yim Sang Eun I know?

754
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,080
You... Y-You've gone mad. You're not in your right mind.

755
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,740
Ha Ra, my decision to get divorced isn't because of him.

756
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,510
That's not what I intended at first. While preparing for the divorce—

757
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:05,610
Then if that's the case, then you should've told me earlier.

758
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:08,850
How in the world do you expect me to trust you now?

759
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:13,010
I wanted to tell you, too. But I couldn't!

760
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,990
I'm embarrassed of myself, too.

761
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,110
I felt empty.

762
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,410
I also questioned...

763
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,780
why I should go on living.

764
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,090

765
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,560
I met him through an app.

766
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,040
My life was so dull,

767
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,920
so I kept having bad thoughts.

768
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:56,260
But Ha Ra... that person made me want to live again.

769
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,770
He told me...

770
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:01,380
he can definitely make me happy, no matter what others say.

771
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,130
He tells me he loves me every day.

772
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,370
He says I'm so lovely he could die.

773
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,960
But do you know how I felt...

774
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,680
when I heard him say that?

775
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,540
I also deserve to be loved.

776
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,390
I'm still a desirable person.

777
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,830
I wasn't the one at fault.

778
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:45,670
Many people will... judge you.

779
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,380
You know that, right?

780
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,290
But... as long as you can endure that,

781
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,940
it's okay... to break up.

782
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,360
Every decision comes at a price.

783
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:07,410
But also... every decision comes with a payoff.

784
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,230
Oh, boy...

785
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,680
- Where are you going? 
 - I'm going to take a cab.

786
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,280
Why?

787
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,170
You asshole. You jerk!

788
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,040
W-What's wrong with you?

789
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,860
What? "As long as you can endure that...

790
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,610
it's okay to break up"?

791
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:54,740
You're practically an adultery consultant now.

792
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:59,300
You could soothe the hearts of all the adulterers in the world!

793
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,270
Asshole.

794
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,790
Sir.

795
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,700
What did you want to discuss?

796
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,460
Well, I got divorced two years ago because

797
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,210
my husband cheated on me.

798
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:48,160
Did Sang Eun ever tell you this?

799
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,400
No, she didn't.

800
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,300
I see. Well, to put it bluntly,

801
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,490
I was once in your shoes.

802
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:01,660
Stabbed in the back by... a cheating bastard.

803
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,950
As someone who's been there, let me tell you, straightforw—

804
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,570
Excuse me. Please don't.

805
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:10,930
I'm never getting a divorce.

806
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:15,200
Sir, what do you have to gain by devoting your life to revenge?

807
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,440
I tried all that, so I know. You won't become happier by doing that.

808
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,590
Taking revenge... doesn't make you happier by ruining her life—

809
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:26,750
Revenge? You think I'm doing this for revenge?

810
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,450
I just want Sang Eun to come back to me.

811
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:36,270
I still love... Sang Eun.

812
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,860
Wait... It doesn't add up.

813
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,160
If you love Sang Eun, why did you neglect—

814
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,980
Let me ask you this.

815
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,300
Do you have to have sex a lot to signify love?

816
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,090
Does love mean having lots of sex?

817
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:53,390
No. Nope. Not necessarily, but...

818
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,900
there's also no reason not to if you love her.

819
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,070
I would if I could. You think I'm choosing not to?

820
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:08,150
Wait, Sir. Then acknowledge your sexual dysfunction and get treat—

821
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:11,490
How many times do I have to tell you it's not that?

822
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:23,800
Sir, I mean... Mu Jin, so...

823
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,530
you want to, but you can't because you can't get it up,

824
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:33,610
society has agreed to diagnose that as sexual dysfunction.

825
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:38,010
I don't have a problem with my function.

826
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:40,800
There's a reason I can't.

827
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,160
You don't even know.

828
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,740
What is it?

829
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:48,990
It's okay. You can tell me, honestly.

830
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,380
I take medicine for...

831
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,340
 Hair loss?

832
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:01,270
So... that medicine is what caused a problem down there.

833
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:04,790
That's why he's been claiming he doesn't have sexual dysfunction.

834
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,940
He couldn't admit it, which is why he was so frustrated.

835
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,620
Why couldn't he admit it?

836
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,740
"I'm suffering the side effect of hair loss medication."

837
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,810
He could just be honest and stop taking the medication.

838
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,750
Did someone force him to take it?

839
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,360
Well, I listened to his story and...

840
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,970
I feel sorry for him.

841
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:26,830
I mean, his wife changed jobs and is doing well,

842
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:28,840
but he can't even get a promotion.

843
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,120
He was stressed about this and that,

844
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,320
when even his hair started to fall out.

845
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,190
He felt the need to protect at least his hair.

846
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,690
But to salvage his social reputation and save face with his wife,

847
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:44,850
"Could I choose my hair over our sex life?"

848
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:47,520
He couldn't bring himself to ask her that.

849
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,230
Because it hurt his pride.

850
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:52,890
Man, isn't it heartbreaking?

851
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:55,750
You consider that heartbreaking?

852
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,850
I consider that to be crazy selfish.

853
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,120
- Huh? 
 - Welcome.

854
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,000
What the?

855
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Whoa, how nice. The meat's all cooked.

856
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,730
Let's eat together.

857
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,440
Gosh, what's up...

858
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,700
You pay the bill.

859
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,800
Eat. How much could you eat?

860
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,950
Pass me a spoon.

861
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,860
So...

862
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,900
how does he plan to proceed?

863
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,520
What?

864
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,110
Sang Eun.

865
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,100
I met her husband.

866
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:37,120
I mean, I could understand him until this point,

867
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,180
but things start to get ridiculous from here.

868
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,430
 - Mu Jin. 
 - Yes?

869
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,910
 I really don't think this is right.

870
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:49,150
 You should tell her directly.

871
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,130
 How much you love Sang Eun,

872
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:53,360
 and how you want to work things out with her.

873
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,940
 You should tell her directly with all your heart.

874
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,320
 Why should I deliver the message to her?

875
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,860
 Attorney Oh, I'm really not that eloquent.

876
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,220
 I feel like I'll just be more pitiful, so—

877
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,830
 How would you live with her then?

878
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,800
 If you can't even explain your own feelings,

879
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,310
 how will you live together? It'd be frustrating.

880
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,570
 Well, no matter how important physical connection is

881
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,730
 you'll never stay together if you can't communicate your feelings.

882
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,120
 Communicate your feelings for now,

883
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,230
 and when the atmosphere is right,

884
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,700
 start attempting to connect physically.

885
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,950
 She'll probably connect with you better than that guy she just met

886
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:33,890
 who's still wet behind the ears.

887
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:35,790
 Don't you think so?

888
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:37,380
 Probably, right?

889
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,300
 You can do it!

890
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,770
 - Fighting! 
 - Yes.

891
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,360
 I'll do my best.

892
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,780
 Go on.

893
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,120
 Okay.

894
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,990
 - Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

895
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,450
What is communication?

896
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,430
What is hair loss?

897
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,350
It's a matter directly related to pride.

898
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,160
A man's hair count, that is.

899
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,680
Hey, of course.

900
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,710
I feel sorry for that husband.

901
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,700
- Imagine how inferior he— 
 - Gosh!

902
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,330
I hate men with inferiority complexes.

903
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,900
They disgust me!

904
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,180
Senior, is there any man you don't hate?

905
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,330
Does he even exist?

906
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,620
You always complain about this and that.

907
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,220
What is he saying?

908
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,840
I'm... crazy about men who don't have inferiority complexes,

909
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:42,510
are handsome and have healthy minds and bodies.

910
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:43,890
Where will you find a man like that?

911
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:46,210
That's why you're still single—

912
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,730
- Wait, wait. 
 - Give me a shot.

913
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,720
I heard that. I heard that.

914
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,300
You take that back.

915
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,140
I could've married if I set my mind to it.

916
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,600
But I didn't, not couldn't!

917
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,900
- Are you sure? 
 - Shit, this bastard...

918
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,670
Put that down.

919
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,300
Put that down now.

920
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:09,130
How are you two more hostile than the divorced couple?

921
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,690
That's enough.

922
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,300
Let me drink in peace.

923
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,340
Don't you know why?

924
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:20,040
They like each other's shells but hate their insides.

925
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,100
That makes them mad.

926
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,650
What? What?

927
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,310
Hey, how could you say that?

928
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,610
I told you it was a secret.

929
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:32,370
It was a secret?

930
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:35,110
That he looks like Senior's ex-boyfriend?

931
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,330
All right, all right.

932
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:40,860
All right! Stop those outbursts.

933
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,990
What is he saying?

934
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,970
Your ex-boyfriend looks like me?

935
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,560
Nope.

936
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,800
What the hell, Kwon Si Wook?

937
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,000
- He's happy. 
 - Who?

938
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,390
- Kwon Si Wook is happy! 
 - Hey!

939
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,060
This guy...

940
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:01,100
About three days after joining the company, he was lovesick.

941
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:05,690
If you hadn't cursed him out for not calling you senior,

942
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:08,030
he would've even confessed to you.

943
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,870
Spewing nonsense every time you open your mouth.

944
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,320
Hey,

945
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,950
lettuce is expensive these days.

946
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,150
What are you saying?

947
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:21,180
I hate it. Absolutely hate it.

948
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,240
- Auntie... 
 - I hate it.

949
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,960
Auntie!

950
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,670
Hey, Sang Eun.

951
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,340
What?

952
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,040
Are you sure you won't regret this?

953
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,290
 Who knows?

954
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,900
 I might end up regretting this.

955
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:53,650
 But every decision comes with a price.

956
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:56,990
 If regret is the cost, then I have no choice.

957
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,090
Ha Ra.

958
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,570
The key.

959
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:25,430
Mr. Kim Mu Jin...

960
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:28,710
no longer wants to meet the other party.

961
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:32,090
Let's just quickly proceed with the adjustments by ourselves.

962
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:36,680
I'll apply for the earliest date for adjustments.

963
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,830
Gosh, how bittersweet.

964
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,730
No matter how many times I go through divorce cases,

965
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:47,270
it feels bitter when they end up breaking up.

966
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:53,170
And... just among us...

967
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,240
isn't your friend being too harsh...

968
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,900
over their sex life?

969
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:02,170
Is sex that important to women these days?

970
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,890
Are you like that, too, Attorney Oh?

971
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,350
Look here—

972
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,250
Mister,

973
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,890
if... there's a problem with your package,

974
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,500
how about getting treatment at a hospital?

975
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:26,510
Even if you claim depression,

976
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,520
paranoia, or mental and physical weakness due to sexual dysfunction,

977
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,220
we won't negotiate...

978
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,380
your settlement money out of pity.

979
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,200
The transcript of...

980
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,870
a conversation with the direct participation of the involved party isn't illegal evidence.

981
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,510
You know that, right?

982
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,430
You didn't win your law license by playing Go-Stop, did you? 
  (Korean card game)

983
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:18,060
 I'm curious about something.

984
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,830
 About what?

985
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,040
 To be honest,

986
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,790
 I lived without thinking about you.

987
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:28,590
 I had zero interest in what you were up to

988
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,820
 or who you met with.

989
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,820
 But... now you're curious?

990
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:45,160
 What are you curious about?

991
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,810
 I wonder about...

992
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:52,110
 the deciding factor that made you choose to abandon me for that woman.

993
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,120
 That's what I'm curious about.

994
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,480
- Did something happen? 
 - Oh...

995
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,630
No, nothing happened.

996
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:23,870
I must be tired since it's Friday.

997
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,970
Should we go home if you're tired?

998
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,260
Should we?

999
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,250
If it's okay with you... we can go to my house.

1000
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:33,030
You know, since it's the weekend.

1001
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:51,530
Ki Seo Hee...

1002
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:09,080

1003
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,170
♫  I was fine  ♫

1004
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,380
 Attorney Oh Ha Ra against Attorney Goo Eun Beom.

1005
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,220
 How could the same firm represent both defendant and the plaintiff?

1006
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,120
 - Pardon me. 
 - Let's mind our manners.

1007
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,830
 Don't you know a battle for custody means war?

1008
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:29,980
 Do you plan to keep cutting me off?

1009
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,380
 You cut us off first.

1010
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,000
 - Defendant Representative! 
 - Yes!

1011
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,210
 - Let's just kill him. 
 - That sounds better, right?

1012
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:40,170
 I don't think I've gotten over Goo Eun Beom.

1013
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:44,240
 I think Ha Ra still isn't over you, Hyung.

1014
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,210

♫  Why are you shaking me now?  ♫
