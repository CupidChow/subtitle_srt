1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,340

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,560

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:24,970

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,200

5
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,910

6
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,830

7
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:05,443
You look good.

8
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:08,423
You must be doing well after your divorce.

9
00:01:08,423 --> 00:01:12,843
Well, you're looking pretty dark and gloomy, Father.

10
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:15,963
Is something distressing you?

11
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:18,503
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

12
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:19,588
Too smooth.

13
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:21,363
I am quite consistent.

14
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:23,263
I never liked you from the start.

15
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:24,823
You never said it out loud, but

16
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:27,793
your eyes always conveyed enough of your dislike.

17
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:32,843
I'm also aware you first opposed our marriage because

18
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,863
my mother was divorced.

19
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:46,853
You have no business seeing your ex-son-in-law,

20
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:51,963
but did you call me out to say stuff like that?

21
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:03,463
Who is she?

22
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:05,223
That child.

23
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:11,903
Give me some time.

24
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:17,803
A dead fish won't revive even if you give it some time.

25
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:20,973
It'll only rot more over time.

26
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:27,103
Of all people,

27
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:30,073
why did it have to be you?

28
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:35,043
Look, to Ha Ra—

29
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:38,463
We might be divorced,

30
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:42,453
but not estranged enough to leave her ignorant

31
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:46,113
like a fool yet.

32
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,820

33
00:02:57,623 --> 00:02:59,283
Oh, Ms. Jeon!

34
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:02,003
It's a beautiful day. Good morning.

35
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:02,983
Did you have a good weekend?

36
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,613
Yes. What about you, Ms. Han?

37
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:07,913
By the way, Dear...

38
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:10,753
I heard there's some romance going on in your office.

39
00:03:10,753 --> 00:03:12,553
Such big news!

40
00:03:12,553 --> 00:03:15,393
- Why didn't you tell me? 
 - Huh?

41
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:18,583
You really don't know?

42
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,703
Is this supposed to be a secret?

43
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:24,033
Come on!  What romance are you talking about?

44
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:30,113
Our office is full of people who are sick of each other.

45
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:32,543
They all pounce on each other upon eye contact.

46
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:35,113
Romance, my ass...

47
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:38,273
Wh-Why?

48
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:44,653
Isn't there something different about me today?

49
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:45,873
- I don't know. 
 - Look at me.

50
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:47,783
It's you two, isn't it? The romance.

51
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:49,613
- What? 
 - What?

52
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:51,933
What are you talking about? Over my dead body.

53
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:54,853
Ms. Jeon, Mr. Seong went on a blind date last week.

54
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:55,893
You know better than I do.

55
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:59,343
Isn't that all a ruse?

56
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:03,873
We're nothing more than coworkers. I swear it.

57
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:05,813
Gosh, then, who could it be?

58
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:09,703
- Good morning. 
 - Besides you two, everyone else is enemies.

59
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:11,193
- Oh, you're here? 
 - Yes.

60
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:12,753
- Good day. 
 - Yes, good morning.

61
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,423
Good morning, everyone.

62
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:16,743
- Fighting. 
 - Fighting!

63
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:20,483
- No way... 
 - No way, my foot.

64
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,033
Stop being ridiculous.

65
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:23,043
Why not?

66
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,893
One is divorced, and the other graduated from marriage.

67
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:28,883
- They're both single. 
 - You're right.

68
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:32,233
They even carpool to work every morning.

69
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,483
And they live near each other.

70
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:37,353
CEO Seo never works and loafs around every day like a bum.

71
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:39,643
Is that why CEO Hong always overlooks that?

72
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:43,083
- She's always coming at me. 
 - Gosh, come on now!

73
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,983
Who's going to go, then?

74
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,443
Huh?

75
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:49,573
Everyone, applaud.

76
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:51,853
What? Why?

77
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:53,223
- Why? 
 - Wipe your mouth.

78
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:56,953
- Come on now. 
 - Why did they all...

79
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:58,923
Could it be true?

80
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,923
No, it can't be.

81
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:04,803
I heard CEO Hong owes CEO Seo a big debt from long ago.

82
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:07,223
- What debt? 
 - It's a long story.

83
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:12,133
Anyway, in my opinion, it's not those two.

84
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,223
Let's just ask Ms. Han.

85
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:16,103
- Ask her who it is she saw. 
 - Yes.

86
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:18,283
She's not sure because she heard it through the grapevine.

87
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:20,393
- So she won't tell me. 
 - Hello.

88
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:23,863
- Hello. 
 - Yes, you're here?

89
00:05:23,863 --> 00:05:25,603
- You're here? 
 - Y-Yeah.

90
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:26,953
I heard you made up with your mother.

91
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,963
Hey, I'm full of regrets for acting out of character.

92
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,473
Why? Did something happen?

93
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:34,973
It's the same story. "Go on a blind date and get married."

94
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:36,563
You can go on a blind date.

95
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:39,143
It's too early for this. Are you serious?

96
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:42,433
That couple is...

97
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:44,413
A pass.

98
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:51,383
Hey, knock!

99
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:53,933
Geez.

100
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,693
What's wrong with him?

101
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:59,473
I've seen everything there is to see. What's the fuss?

102
00:06:00,553 --> 00:06:02,243
That couple is also...

103
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:06,603
If they date, I'll burn my fingers.

104
00:06:07,473 --> 00:06:08,513
Let's have some morning coffee.

105
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:11,383
- Oh, yes. 
 - I'd love to.

106
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:15,343
I'm good now. What?

107
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:19,260
Well...

108
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,813
Why couldn't I reach you yesterday and the day before?

109
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:26,623
Oh, I dropped my phone on Saturday and it broke.

110
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:28,113
Why? Was there something urgent?

111
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:30,673
No, nothing urgent.

112
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,243
Then you should've let me know that was the case.

113
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:36,973
You have no consideration for me waiting.

114
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:39,093
Waiting for what?

115
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:41,173
My call?

116
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:43,003
Why?

117
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:47,883
We're in a relationship, aren't we?

118
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:55,873
A relationship?

119
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,903
You and me?

120
00:06:57,903 --> 00:06:59,723
We're not?

121
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,313
Is your mother sick anywhere?

122
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:07,633
She had high blood sugar levels before.

123
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:10,313
Well, that's chronic.

124
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:13,433
There's nothing else besides that.

125
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,373
Gosh, your mother needs to exercise as well.

126
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:20,513
My mother's blood sugar level got better after she started working out.

127
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,353
Excuse me for a second.

128
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:25,423
Yes, Jae Gyeom.

129
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:28,983
I'm at work, of course.

130
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:32,113
 It was a mistake.

131
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:33,653
 Just once.

132
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,843
 A mistake?

133
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:39,883
 There's a child, a woman living as a single mother,

134
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:43,273
 your wife who's been living in deception for decades,

135
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:45,703
 and Ha Ra who has absolute trust in you.

136
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:48,123
 If you say it like that,

137
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:53,073
 it's not weird for anyone to come and harm you.

138
00:07:56,603 --> 00:08:00,683
 She gave birth without me knowing, raised her alone,

139
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:03,563
 and came to me after five years.

140
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:04,853
 What can I do?

141
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:08,403
 I thought I needed to take responsibility

142
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:11,453
 although she wasn't born out of love.

143
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:14,893
 I'll need to tell.

144
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,913
 Of course, I'll need to tell. That's what I thought.

145
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,753
 You know it, too, don't you?

146
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:21,563
 Ha Ra's mother got...

147
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:25,593
 breast cancer right around when Ha Ra graduated from college.

148
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:28,813
 I was going to tell her after she got better, but...

149
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:33,373
 after she got cured, the child was already 10 years old.

150
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:40,213
 By then, you and Ha Ra had passed the bar exam

151
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:44,543
 so there were talks of marriage going on.

152
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,873
 I kept delaying it further and

153
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:52,643
 things ended up like this.

154
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:59,753
 The heavens must be telling me to tell the truth now.

155
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:05,943
 Of all people, you get to find out this way.

156
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:18,483
 I'll let my family know soon.

157
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:21,873
 So please look the other way.

158
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,573
 I called you to make that request.

159
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:46,533
 I don't think I can do it for that long since...

160
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:50,593
 I don't have a talent for fooling Ha Ra.

161
00:09:57,753 --> 00:09:59,333
Hey.

162
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,663
Hey!

163
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:08,683
Why are you looking at me so lost in thought?

164
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:10,673
There's nothing new.

165
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:11,993
Am I pretty?

166
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:13,583
No.

167
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:19,413
Did you agree to go on a blind date?

168
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:22,223
You said your mom keeps telling you to go on one.

169
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:23,983
Blind date, my foot.

170
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:25,253
I'm not even interested in marriage.

171
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:29,263
I mean married life with me might have been bad

172
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,023
but it might be okay with a different woman.

173
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:35,733
Hey, don't be like that and just take it lightly and try dating someone.

174
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,663
Aren't you bored with life?

175
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:39,473
Dating...

176
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,693
Hey, why would you date, no matter how bored you are?

177
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:46,173
You only get backstabbed when you date.

178
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:47,933
It's not even love.

179
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,843
You were backstabbed?

180
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:51,373
You?

181
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,813
I was the one who was backstabbed

182
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:59,003
so why are you the one who's twisted and rejecting love?

183
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:01,003
I know, huh?

184
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:14,533
Gosh... Where do I start?

185
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:20,013
Attorney Kwon, your idea is more flustering for me.

186
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,963
Don't you know me, Attorney Kwon?

187
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:24,413
Also, do I not know you, Attorney Kwon?

188
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:26,913
How can we be dating?

189
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:28,513
There's nothing we have in common.

190
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,723
What are we, then?

191
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,933
Just say it. What are we?

192
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:36,273
Are you saying we'll just be coworkers with benefits?

193
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:38,173
Why not?

194
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:40,553
Friends with benefits.

195
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,663
Isn't it nice and convenient?

196
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:45,443
That's some nonsense you're talking—

197
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:50,723
How energetic, so early in the morning.

198
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,393
You two aren't busy, are you?

199
00:11:52,393 --> 00:11:54,623
- Shall we take a case together? 
 - Sorry?

200
00:11:54,623 --> 00:11:56,793
Come to my office.

201
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:06,723
What case is it?

202
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:09,203
Must we work on it together?

203
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:11,303
This is a rather dynamic case.

204
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:15,013
So it'd be better for you two to work together.

205
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:18,503
A client will come today for a divorce lawsuit.

206
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,523
However, you must stop that divorce.

207
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:23,243
Stop the divorce?

208
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,703
He's the landlord's nephew and

209
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,323
apparently, he wants to get a divorce.

210
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:29,133
However, the elders think otherwise.

211
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:32,243
But the landlord doesn't like our law firm? Right?

212
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:35,383
His jaw was destroyed last year while boxing with CEO Seo,

213
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:37,663
so I thought he didn't even say hi.

214
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:38,733
Exactly.

215
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:42,533
Wouldn't this be the golden chance to make up for that?

216
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:46,293
I went to him to talk about raising the rent

217
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:49,533
and I bluffed, saying I'll figure something out somehow.

218
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,503
A divorce is something for the couple to decide, though.

219
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:56,383
Convince him to the best of your abilities when the client comes, okay?

220
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:58,473
Let me request of you.

221
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:00,863
I get what you're saying, but—

222
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,753
Isn't couples' therapy a better option?

223
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:07,103
They tried it but only fought more. I guess it didn't work.

224
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:10,333
So how could we solve what therapy couldn't?

225
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:14,213
In my opinion, you two are perfectly suited.

226
00:13:14,213 --> 00:13:16,123
Because...

227
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:20,083
they're just like you two, the couple.

228
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,753
- Sorry? 
 - Sorry?

229
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:25,673
My wife is usually like...

230
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:28,273
a little condescending.

231
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,613
She looks down on everyone, which is a given.

232
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:34,073
She's always right, and others are wrong.

233
00:13:34,073 --> 00:13:38,233
If anyone says she's wrong, a disaster...

234
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:40,333
A catastrophe awakens.

235
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,143
She isn't called the Barbaric Hen for no reason.

236
00:13:43,143 --> 00:13:45,733
On the other hand, what's good is good for me...

237
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,543
letting things go if they're not too bad.

238
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:49,333
More like that.

239
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,423
Your personality is more well-rounded.

240
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:53,903
Yes, a little more than my wife.

241
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:56,683
They're polar opposites just like us.

242
00:13:56,683 --> 00:13:59,473
I found these things attractive when we were dating

243
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,463
but in married life...

244
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:04,373
I couldn't overcome the difference in personalities.

245
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:07,453
I think I can understand why people...

246
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:14,663
get a divorce.

247
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:24,013
Yes.

248
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,093
Let's have a word.

249
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:29,673
Oh, I'm working right now, so I can't—

250
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:41,763
I'm totally... against this personnel... appointment.

251
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:44,603
Honey, it's only one year.

252
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:47,983
It'll only take a year's trouble in Busan to get a promotion.

253
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:50,013
How could you ask for better conditions?

254
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:51,403
No way. You can't.

255
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:54,673
If you go there like that, what about the kids and me?

256
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:58,153
Also, does it make sense for a family to live so far apart?

257
00:14:58,153 --> 00:15:00,443
It's not even for life.

258
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:04,663
- Also, it's the company telling me to go. 
 - Darling!

259
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:09,723
You can also transfer jobs.

260
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,143
Is transferring jobs that easy?

261
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:16,593
What's so hard about it?

262
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,613
Ji Hye! Ji Hye!

263
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:22,353
Why do you say it's difficult without even trying?

264
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:26,363
- Prepare for the transfer first— 
 - What if it doesn't work?

265
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:28,783
What are you going to do then?

266
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:30,593
Are you telling me to give up my career?

267
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:33,723
No, I'm not telling you to do that.

268
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:36,223
You going down to Busan isn't a solve-it-all.

269
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:37,963
Why isn't it a solve-it-all?

270
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:40,003
If I get a raise from getting promoted for the move,

271
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:42,840
- it's not something that benefits only me! 
 - Gosh!

272
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:48,813
Hey, if you go down there like that,

273
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:52,073
what are you telling the rest of the family to do?

274
00:15:52,073 --> 00:15:53,673
It's only one year.

275
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:54,763
Can't you even last one year?

276
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:58,123
Whether it's one year or 10 years,

277
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:03,433
there are your roles as a mom and a wife.

278
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:07,753
Do the father and husband roles not exist?

279
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:12,443
You can't... do anything yourself?

280
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:21,993
I said, "Why does a career matter to someone who has a family?" and

281
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:25,003
she called me a narrow-minded person in return.

282
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:28,033
Words just don't get to her.

283
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:33,913
So you chose divorce because that issue wasn't resolved?

284
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:35,203
Yes.

285
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,363
I told her this.

286
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,873
"I can't accept what you decided.

287
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,833
If you want to go there that badly, divorce me and go."

288
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,933
After I said that...

289
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,833
she packed her things and left in the dawn.

290
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,523
What about the kids and me?

291
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:50,403
This is totally saying...

292
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:52,283
she'll go through with the divorce.

293
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:55,133
This morning? All of a sudden?

294
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:58,233
The kids must've been so surprised.

295
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:01,753
I guess she told the kids, so they weren't surprised.

296
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:04,813
But I don't know what to do from now...

297
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:08,683
They're still at the age where they need a mom.

298
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,403
Need a mom?

299
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:21,703
Excuse me, Sir.

300
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:26,823
There are weekend couples who live apart due to inevitable reasons. Right?

301
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:29,793
Usually, the father is the one who's away.

302
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:36,723
However, kids grew up just fine without their dad being around.

303
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:41,663
These things usually aren't the cause of a family falling apart.

304
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:47,333
But you, Sir, because they need a mom,

305
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,133
are pushing a divorce your wife doesn't even want—

306
00:17:53,023 --> 00:17:55,253
I'm not so sure...

307
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:59,963
about who the barbaric chicken is here?

308
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:06,103
B-Barbaric... Chicken?

309
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:12,523
You crazy? How can you call the client a barbaric chicken?

310
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:13,663
Well, was I wrong?

311
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:15,893
- Besides who's right and who's wrong— 
 - Why go besides that?

312
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:17,303
Wrong and right are important.

313
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:20,183
Are we a judge? We're not trying to come up with a verdict.

314
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,683
Excuse me, Attorney Kwon.

315
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:27,603
Is asking to be a weekend couple the same as she'll abandon the kids?

316
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:30,733
Did the wife say she'll never see her kids again?

317
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,903
- That's not it— 
 - If that's not it...

318
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,343
Oh, the weekend couple works, but...

319
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:39,323
the mom must never leave her children's side?

320
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:41,383
But it's okay for dads?

321
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:44,173
The kids are still young.

322
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:47,903
Realistically, a dad's care isn't as good as a mom's care.

323
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:50,793
Why isn't it as good?

324
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:57,303
Hey! Should you be proud...

325
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,853
of being unable to do parenting when you're a parent?

326
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,853
Is that something to support?

327
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:04,040
I'm not saying I support him

328
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,460
If that's not it, then...

329
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:10,083
boasting how narrow-minded and inflexible of a person you are?

330
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,303
Just in case I don't know?

331
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:17,233
Gosh, Si Wook...

332
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,253
I know very well.

333
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,813
That is why I'm not dating you.

334
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:24,323
Whenever you open your mouth,

335
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:27,763
you're so tacky. It makes me nauseous.

336
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,063
Are you done talking?

337
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:36,453
Why did you sleep with a man who's so tacky?

338
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:37,903
Why?

339
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:43,573
Just say you're playing a game with me, then.

340
00:19:53,563 --> 00:19:55,073
CEO Hong...

341
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:59,793
put you two together to convince the client...

342
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:02,033
not to fight each other, probably. Right?

343
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,733
He keeps saying nonsense, making me mad.

344
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,603
Still...

345
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:10,223
She said the client is the landlord's nephew.

346
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:15,453
She said we might have to move because of the rent.

347
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:22,523
Gosh, I don't know, either.

348
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:26,173
How did they end up marrying in the first place?

349
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:27,763
When their personalities don't match at all.

350
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:31,343
- They're just like you and Kwon Si Wook— 
 - Hey...

351
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:34,173
how dare you pair me up with him?

352
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:35,963
Schopenhauer once said

353
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:38,893
there's a theory of attraction between men and women.

354
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:40,413
What is that theory about?

355
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:42,323
When we're attracted to someone,

356
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:47,533
we're very often attracted to someone on the opposite end of the spectrum.

357
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:50,903
This is because we have a hidden instinct deep in our subconscious,

358
00:20:50,903 --> 00:20:53,453
which prioritizes benefits for our species.

359
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,703
Species, what?

360
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:56,833
Benefits for the species.

361
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:01,443
Benefits for the species, which is about prioritizing successful proliferation.

362
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:04,263
You need to give birth to a healthy child.

363
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,323
Think about this.

364
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:11,583
How would it have been when they didn't have family trees and lineage info?

365
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:15,303
Those people experienced the side effects of inbreeding in person.

366
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:19,863
Therefore, they probably avoided... people who look or...

367
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,293
just similar to them in general.

368
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:24,793
And that has been engraved in our DNA.

369
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:26,723
That's why we're also...

370
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:29,403
often attracted to someone who's...

371
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:32,773
completely different and the polar opposite.

372
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:38,443
Because the will of the species is a lot more strong and instinctive than the will of an individual.

373
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,333
What's the name of the book again?

374
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,543
Gosh, it must be nice.

375
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:47,573
A dating relationship where you respect each other.

376
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:50,483
But why are you so calm about it?

377
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:53,033
Unlike someone who's dating.

378
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:55,003
There's no excitement.

379
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:59,443
We're past the age where we get fired up.

380
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,953
Hey, you still don't get it after all those years?

381
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:05,703
People going blind for adultery, saying they found real love in their last years of life?

382
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:09,703
I even saw a grandpa who cried, saying he couldn't live without his mistress.

383
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,333
Are those kinds the only true love?

384
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:15,503
Being comfortable and cozy when you're together...

385
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:17,913
could also be a form of love...

386
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,693
Wh-Why?

387
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:37,483

Eun Beom, do you have time this evening?

388
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:50,763
Hey, aren't you tired?

389
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:52,813
You must be tired from your business trip.

390
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:54,783
We could meet tomorrow—

391
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:57,283
How can I wait when I miss you?

392
00:22:57,283 --> 00:23:00,393
I had to see your face to relieve the fatigue.

393
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:12,433
I brought mackerel stew to go.

394
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,543
How did you—

395
00:23:16,423 --> 00:23:18,693
You're so crazy.

396
00:23:20,383 --> 00:23:22,653
Let's cook it at my house and eat it.

397
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:26,923
Oh, is it too late for a weekday?

398
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:29,893
No, that's not it, but...

399
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:32,803
Of course, I want to be with you because

400
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:34,733
we were apart for a week, but...

401
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:37,873
if you're uncomfortable, I'm okay, Babe.

402
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,423
N-No, it's okay. Let's go to your house.

403
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,603
What are you saying?

404
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:48,573
It's, "Let's go, Honey."

405
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:26,823
Long time no see.

406
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:30,993
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

407
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:33,153
You're well, right?

408
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:37,663
Who knew I'd see you again here.

409
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,333
I'm going to pretend not to know.

410
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,213
He said he'll wrap up the situation.

411
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,433
No matter how much I think about it,

412
00:24:56,143 --> 00:25:00,723
although I'm at a loss for words for the years of lies...

413
00:25:00,723 --> 00:25:03,343
and my world has fallen apart...

414
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:08,343
- A divorce won't happen. 
 - Mother...

415
00:25:08,343 --> 00:25:10,263
You know it, too.

416
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:15,133
How will I be compensated for my 40 years if I get a divorce?

417
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:17,653
It's not like I'm financially capable.

418
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:21,073
Mother, didn't Ha Ra tell you?

419
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:25,463
Even if you divorce, you can easily get half of the assets—

420
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:30,403
I'm not going to tell Ha Ra.

421
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:33,323
We can't.

422
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,003
Ha Ra loves her dad so much.

423
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:39,363
She'll be more shocked than me.

424
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:41,193
Even if that's true, still...

425
00:25:41,193 --> 00:25:43,033
He said he didn't put her on the family register.

426
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,363
And the kid's mom is a single mother.

427
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:48,713
Will Ha Ra find out about this?

428
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,503
Is it inevitable for her to find out?

429
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:54,833
If you...

430
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:58,253
Only if you'll look the other way...

431
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:02,853
I want to just... let Ha Ra remain ignorant to this.

432
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:20,223
 Mother, how can you cover the sky with your palm?

433
00:26:20,223 --> 00:26:22,833
 Even if she's shocked... rather than being fooled,

434
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:27,233
 she needs to know the truth about marriage, dating, and romance...

435
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:30,863
 She should know how ridiculous these things are.

436
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:32,703
 About the kind of person her dad is...

437
00:26:32,703 --> 00:26:34,573
 and how ugly humans are...

438
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:36,743
 Teaching her that love between humans

439
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:39,763
 could never be deemed noble.

440
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:44,853
 Wouldn't letting her know about this be for Ha Ra's sake?

441
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,433
I understand.

442
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,343
If you've decided to do so,

443
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,723
it's not in my place to meddle.

444
00:27:01,723 --> 00:27:03,943
Thank you.

445
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:07,803
Thank you so much.

446
00:27:08,913 --> 00:27:11,063
Thank you so much.

447
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:18,403
If this matter gets resolved well,

448
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,893
there won't be any rent issues for a while.

449
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:23,803
So please pay extra attention and wrap it up nicely, you two.

450
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:27,853
Geez, how petty of him... to do that over rent when he's so rich and young...

451
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:29,973
He's not being petty.

452
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:32,473
It was cheaper here than in other places nearby in the first place.

453
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:34,893
He also didn't raise the rent for 10 years.

454
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:37,453
Still, he has money rotting away!

455
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:40,993
But does he still need to raise the rent?

456
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,623
Okay, let's say you're right.

457
00:27:42,623 --> 00:27:45,203
However, I want to spend more years with that

458
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:48,593
landlord who is generous in heart and in spending.

459
00:27:48,593 --> 00:27:53,353
If you don't like that, go find an office cheaper than this place.

460
00:27:53,353 --> 00:27:54,973
I-I'm sorry, CEO Hong, but...

461
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,053
I think you'll have to raise the rent.

462
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:58,123
Why now?

463
00:27:58,123 --> 00:28:00,003
Gosh, don't even get me started.

464
00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:02,163
That nephew is so narrow-minded and

465
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:04,093
inflexible. You can't get through to him.

466
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:09,383
Didn't you get used to that while working with Attorney Kwon, Attorney Kang?

467
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:11,713
- Sorry? 
 - CEO Hong, what do you mean?

468
00:28:11,713 --> 00:28:16,463
I mean, the husband is a little conservative.

469
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:21,663
The wife is more progressive, like Attorney Kang.

470
00:28:22,223 --> 00:28:24,613
It's better to go ahead than to lag behind.

471
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:27,363
Yes, so how are things going?

472
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:30,573
There's a meeting with the client and his wife at 5:00.

473
00:28:30,573 --> 00:28:33,403
Attorney Kang angered the client last time, so

474
00:28:33,403 --> 00:28:35,063
I pretty much begged him for a meeting

475
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:38,093
when he was asking for the divorce complaint.

476
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,743
All right, let's not fight and do a good job. Okay?

477
00:28:40,743 --> 00:28:43,303
- I'll try my best. 
 - To be honest, I'm not confident.

478
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:46,053
It's not like we're a couple's therapy clinic.

479
00:28:46,053 --> 00:28:49,883
If you're a divorce lawyer, you're almost as good as a therapist.

480
00:28:49,883 --> 00:28:52,223
Don't you already get a rough idea?

481
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:55,763
- If it's only that bad, it's not bad enough— 
 -  "Only that bad?"

482
00:28:55,763 --> 00:29:01,113
Whoa, you two are perfectly in sync.

483
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:04,923
They say polar opposites are actually similar—

484
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:07,493
- Or something. 
 - Okay.

485
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:09,073
Attorney Oh, go ahead.

486
00:29:09,073 --> 00:29:10,433
You said you have a consultation in the afternoon. Right?

487
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:12,383
Yes, at 2:00—

488
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,973
Oh, she should be here, actually.

489
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:16,753
Okay, okay. Give me the quick details. What's this case?

490
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:19,873
It's a de facto marriage in a bigamy relationship.

491
00:29:19,873 --> 00:29:21,943
The client gave birth to a married man's child.

492
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:24,233
His wife doesn't seem to know.

493
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:26,933
She wants to cut off ties with the guy and

494
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:31,603
seems to be intending to get child support and alimony since it was a de facto marriage.

495
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,963
Child support?

496
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:34,843
 He said he didn't put her on the family register.

497
00:29:34,843 --> 00:29:37,103
 And the kid's mom is a single mother.

498
00:29:37,103 --> 00:29:40,483
Oh, I guess he acknowledged the child as his?

499
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:42,113
He needs to pay child support as well, then.

500
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,383
No, that's what I'm going to explain today.

501
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,743
That we need to request acknowledgment first.

502
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,753
 You need to dress young.

503
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,743
 - I look pretty young. 
 - What?

504
00:29:59,743 --> 00:30:01,893
 Gosh, come on.

505
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:04,333
 What's he thinking?

506
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:07,213
Attorney Oh, your client is here.

507
00:30:07,213 --> 00:30:09,413
Oh, right.

508
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:10,883
Hello.

509
00:30:10,883 --> 00:30:13,093
You came earlier than expected.

510
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:16,083
Let's talk...

511
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,183
over here, please.

512
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:32,313
He tricked me for over 10 years.

513
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:36,563
Saying he'll get a divorce if I just wait a little longer...

514
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:39,883
and that he'll put the child on the family register.

515
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:42,223
But now...

516
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:44,633
he's telling me not to contact him.

517
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:48,903
He said he'll pay for college later when the child gets older, but...

518
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:52,283
he's telling me to be gone, basically.

519
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:57,363
He's a... lost cause.

520
00:30:57,363 --> 00:31:01,213
Even you think so... as an attorney, right?

521
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,793
Oh, sorry.

522
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:24,523
What are you doing in someone else's empty office?

523
00:31:24,523 --> 00:31:26,313
You know the migraine meds

524
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:29,083
you bought me when I had a bad headache last time?

525
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,473
Could you tell me its name?

526
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,133
Why? Do you have a headache?

527
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:36,833
Yes, a little. Just a little.

528
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,853
And you're looking for medicine?

529
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:42,133
It hurt a lot last night, but it's okay now.

530
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,903
I want to get its name while I remember.

531
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:48,103
- Just take this. I can just buy another one. 
 - Oh, okay. Okay.

532
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:50,103
Gosh, thank you.

533
00:31:52,283 --> 00:31:57,373
- Did your... consultation go well? 
 - Yes.

534
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,993
I had a similar case before, so I know, but...

535
00:32:00,993 --> 00:32:02,560
isn't it hard to get alimony?

536
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,650
The court doesn't really acknowledge...

537
00:32:04,653 --> 00:32:07,143
because she knew he was a married man.

538
00:32:07,143 --> 00:32:10,033
That's true. I told her it was hard.

539
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:12,993
I told her to just file for acknowledgment and get the child support.

540
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:15,443
Yes... I see.

541
00:32:15,443 --> 00:32:18,853
The guy acted like a father and a husband for over 10 years.

542
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,183
And do you know what he said now?

543
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:26,353
He told her he'll pay for the kid's college tuition so don't contact him again.

544
00:32:26,353 --> 00:32:28,303
Gosh, seriously. What trash.

545
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:34,773
What's this? What's wrong?

546
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,523
That's really so harsh.

547
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:41,343
How could he be like that?

548
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:43,863
That's what I mean.

549
00:32:43,863 --> 00:32:50,053
Still... he probably was trying to protect his first family...

550
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:53,373
- Are you siding with him? 
 - Gosh...

551
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:55,333
I'm not siding with him.

552
00:32:56,123 --> 00:32:58,693
How old is the kid?

553
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:00,393
In middle school.

554
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:03,173
In eighth grade, by any chance?

555
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:06,433
I don't know that much. It was only a consultation today.

556
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,333
By the way...

557
00:33:09,483 --> 00:33:13,613
why are you so interested in my case?

558
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,873
- Do you have nothing to do? 
 - I do.

559
00:33:23,873 --> 00:33:25,963
I have a lot to do.

560
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:32,913

561
00:33:33,993 --> 00:33:36,023
What's his deal?

562
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:58,853
It's me, Sir. Y-Yes.

563
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:01,893
I heard from Mother that...

564
00:34:01,893 --> 00:34:06,143
you said you'll end things with the other side?

565
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:11,683
Yes. Yes, that doesn't matter, but...

566
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,563
by any chance, did you break the news...

567
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:16,343
to the other person as well?

568
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:19,263
Yesterday?

569
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,653
Can you tell me what she looks like?

570
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:33,283
She's about the same height as Ha Ra...

571
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:38,963
has short hair and...

572
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:44,363
her eyebrows are on the thicker side.

573
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:46,763
She has double eyelids, too.

574
00:34:53,963 --> 00:34:55,583
Father...

575
00:34:57,623 --> 00:35:02,793
- It seems... the lady came to meet Ha Ra today. 
 - What?

576
00:35:02,793 --> 00:35:04,723
 She also knows Ha Ra is a lawyer, right?

577
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:07,893
I-Is that really true?

578
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:11,053
Gosh, this w-woman, seriously...

579
00:35:11,053 --> 00:35:14,290
O-Okay, okay. Hang up.

580
00:35:15,183 --> 00:35:19,893
You're aware your husband wants to get a divorce. Right?

581
00:35:19,893 --> 00:35:21,293
Yes.

582
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:23,933
But you, the wife, don't want it.

583
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:26,073
Divorce, my foot...

584
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:28,323
He's just blackmailing me...

585
00:35:28,323 --> 00:35:31,983
to manipulate me to do what he wants.

586
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:35,033
But your husband here...

587
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,840
doesn't understand how you decided on parenting

588
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,550
and the weekend couple...

589
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:44,623
matters on your own and ran away from home.

590
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:48,873
If you look at civil law, among the causes of divorce...

591
00:35:48,873 --> 00:35:52,003
there's one that says a divorce lawsuit

592
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:56,173
is accepted when a spouse abandons the other with ill-intentions.

593
00:35:56,173 --> 00:35:58,763
You understand what it means. Right?

594
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:02,483
- Attorney Kwon... 
 - Yes.

595
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:06,613
Simply leaving home can't be deemed as ill-intended.

596
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:08,173
Don't you know what ill intention means?

597
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:11,513
Attorney Kang, I'm not done talking. What I'm saying is...

598
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:15,293
If you arbitrarily proceed with living apart,

599
00:36:15,293 --> 00:36:18,073
- it could suffice as a cause for divorce— 
 - Excuse me.

600
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:19,863
- Attorney Kwon. 
 - Yes?

601
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:23,153
Aren't you being too biased here?

602
00:36:23,153 --> 00:36:25,843
I gave him enough options.

603
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:27,513
What kind of...

604
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:34,903
I asked about living as a weekend couple, although it may be hard at first.

605
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,603
And he said he'd rather die.

606
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:40,383
Then I asked about transferring and moving to Busan altogether.

607
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:42,390
And he didn't like that, either.

608
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,443
He said he'll bury his bones in Seoul, so I said...

609
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:49,903
"Is that so?' Then quit your job and become a stay-at-home dad.

610
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:54,153
I can make money by myself in Busan."

611
00:36:54,153 --> 00:36:57,293
But he said no to everything.

612
00:36:57,293 --> 00:37:00,863
He's ignoring my career and whatnot, doing whatever he wants.

613
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:05,103
I went down because my start date for the position came.

614
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:07,633
Is that ill-intended and arbitrary?

615
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:12,033
- Running from home? 
 - Ji Hye... Ji Hye!

616
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:15,093
Do you think that makes sense? Me, a stay-at-home dad?

617
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:18,033
- A stay-at-home dad? 
 - You can take your time.

618
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:20,453
You really think that's an option for me?

619
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:23,203
That's what you call true manipulation where you—

620
00:37:23,203 --> 00:37:26,813
Is it a problem for you to be a stay-at-home dad?

621
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:29,043
Well, you know.

622
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:32,193
You said it can't be an option for you.

623
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:35,613
You're not mocking stay-at-home dads, are you?

624
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:37,263
No, not at all.

625
00:37:37,263 --> 00:37:41,033
Could it be that you take it as an insult?

626
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,983
In that case, you're insulting stay-at-home dads.

627
00:37:44,983 --> 00:37:48,083
- No, it's not that— 
 - N-No, no. That's not what I mean—

628
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,723
Yes, he probably thinks so.

629
00:37:50,723 --> 00:37:53,563
Since he has never even wet his hands.

630
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:56,573
He thinks doing chores is a big deal.

631
00:37:57,563 --> 00:38:00,443
Wait!  Then, don't you split the chores?

632
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:03,063
Splitting chores?

633
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:06,443
I wish he'd do a single chore for once.

634
00:38:27,663 --> 00:38:30,153
 If you're not going to wash dishes, then fold the laundry, at least.

635
00:38:30,153 --> 00:38:33,393
 Okay, I'm almost done.

636
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:41,183
 Please finish it while I'm doing the dishes, okay?

637
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:46,973
 - Okay? 
 - Yes, yes. I said I'll do it. Stop saying it.

638
00:39:41,323 --> 00:39:43,253
 Hey, Shim Jae Hyeok!

639
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,623
 I told you to fold the laundry, and you're sleeping here?

640
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,963
 Just do it tomorrow.

641
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:55,643
 I'm too tired today.

642
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,663
 Are you the only one who's tired?

643
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:59,313
 We worked the same hours and

644
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,933
 I fed the kids, looked at their homework, and cleaned the house.

645
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,693
 I'm also tired!

646
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,383
 Gosh, you can just lie down here, too.

647
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:08,103
 Just sleep.

648
00:40:14,603 --> 00:40:17,013
Wait!  You're working the same hours, but

649
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:20,893
why does the wife do parenting and chores by herself?

650
00:40:20,893 --> 00:40:23,973
That's what I'm saying here.

651
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:27,523
You think divorce is easy, huh?

652
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:30,203
We even have two kids.

653
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:32,653
What makes you think you deserve a divorce?

654
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:35,933
How did she live like this?

655
00:40:37,623 --> 00:40:40,173
Excuse me, Sir.

656
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:41,973
In my opinion...

657
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,243
you shouldn't be asking for divorce right now.

658
00:40:44,243 --> 00:40:45,983
- Lower your voice. Lower. 
 - You know?

659
00:40:45,983 --> 00:40:49,153
Please come to your senses!

660
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:56,023
E-Excuse me... Excuse me!

661
00:40:57,453 --> 00:41:00,653
Isn't she my attorney, by the way?

662
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:07,473
Gosh...

663
00:41:09,923 --> 00:41:12,203
Senior, the client told me to fire you.

664
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,923
If we want to keep his case.

665
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:18,613
How great. I didn't want to do it, either.

666
00:41:18,613 --> 00:41:20,933
His wife will be better off divorcing him.

667
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:26,163
Come on. I barely convinced him out of objecting to CEO Hong.

668
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,603
- What? 
 - Let's get dinner.

669
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:38,903
I don't want to.

670
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:40,433
Do you think I want indigestion?

671
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:43,053
Let's eat, so we can talk.

672
00:41:43,053 --> 00:41:46,163
I'll go out first. Hurry up and come.

673
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,163
Gosh, I'm so full.

674
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:53,583
Why? What do you want to talk about?

675
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,223
- Are you done eating? 
 - Yes.

676
00:41:55,223 --> 00:41:59,933
I mean, w-weren't the two of them just like us?

677
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:02,733
Seriously, he was just as headstrong as you.

678
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:04,993
The lady also was hitting it off with you.

679
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:06,833
- She was just like you. 
 - What's this?

680
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:08,783
Are you asking for round two?

681
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:11,383
No, I'm not.

682
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:22,730
I thought about this and...

683
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:25,703
Yes, you're right, Senior.

684
00:42:25,703 --> 00:42:29,703
Even if we're attracted to each other,

685
00:42:29,703 --> 00:42:31,943
we're just not grooved the same way.

686
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:35,173
However...

687
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:39,093
I did want to give it a try, you see?

688
00:42:39,093 --> 00:42:43,223
What matters to me is I even had a thought like that...

689
00:42:43,223 --> 00:42:45,333
I only thought about that, but...

690
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:47,093
Oh, I still agree it'd be difficult for each other...

691
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:49,863
since we're just too different.

692
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:53,503
Never mind the long introduction.

693
00:42:54,163 --> 00:42:57,053
Senior, you have no intention to yield,

694
00:42:57,053 --> 00:43:00,313
make compromises and put in effort for each other,

695
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:04,703
no matter how... different we are, do you?

696
00:43:12,243 --> 00:43:14,053
I'm sorry, Si Wook.

697
00:43:14,053 --> 00:43:18,693
I only stated my opinion at first because I was flustered.

698
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:24,253
But when I thought about it, it must have been hurtful to you.

699
00:43:26,383 --> 00:43:29,313
But we're just too different. Right?

700
00:43:29,313 --> 00:43:32,283
Even efforts have a limit and...

701
00:43:32,283 --> 00:43:35,373
- these talks aren't really meaningful— 
 - O-Okay.

702
00:43:35,373 --> 00:43:37,603
I understand what you mean.

703
00:43:37,603 --> 00:43:40,283
Gosh, I did it again.

704
00:43:44,943 --> 00:43:46,863
However...

705
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,923
friends with benefits?

706
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:53,143
I can't do those things.

707
00:43:53,143 --> 00:43:55,393
Putting body and mind apart, without a care...

708
00:43:55,393 --> 00:43:58,593
I can't do that because I'm tacky and old-fashioned.

709
00:43:59,913 --> 00:44:05,483
I'm not someone who can pretend something didn't happen, but...

710
00:44:10,873 --> 00:44:13,233
I'll try my best this time.

711
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:23,973
Let's go now. Take your time. Okay?

712
00:44:52,903 --> 00:45:00,590
♫  Still filling up my day to its fullest  ♫

713
00:45:01,935 --> 00:45:04,435
What lovely weather tonight.

714
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:07,403
Shall we go on a trip?

715
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:09,923
A trip? Where to?

716
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:13,313
Well, anywhere seems good. The mountain or the ocean.

717
00:45:13,313 --> 00:45:15,133
Well... in that case...

718
00:45:15,133 --> 00:45:18,353
Say mountain or ocean at the count of three.

719
00:45:18,353 --> 00:45:20,003
One, two, three!

720
00:45:20,003 --> 00:45:22,143
- Ocean! 
 - Ocean.

721
00:45:25,543 --> 00:45:27,483
I love you.

722
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:36,123
You don't love me?

723
00:45:37,473 --> 00:45:41,483
That's weird. Why do you date me when you don't love me?

724
00:45:42,803 --> 00:45:47,843
♫  Hold it in there  ♫

725
00:45:47,843 --> 00:45:50,033
 Because your diligence and...

726
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:54,483
 your good nature... are attractive.

727
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:58,633
 Also, because you give me love with all you have.

728
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:05,233
♫  I know it's a dream I'll wake from  ♫

729
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:08,593
I love... you...

730
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:16,173
I'm so happy.

731
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,773
Is it okay to be this happy?

732
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:27,493
Yeah, so... since he confessed to me...

733
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:31,403
I did say I love him, but...

734
00:46:31,403 --> 00:46:34,143
I feel like I lied.

735
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,783
 Is there a problem?

736
00:46:36,783 --> 00:46:39,503
 Or is there something you don't like about him?

737
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:42,693
No, there isn't. The issue with his mother was resolved.

738
00:46:42,693 --> 00:46:43,843
 Am I the only one aging?

739
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,913
That's it, then. You said you get along well, too.

740
00:46:46,913 --> 00:46:50,323
 Well, it's more like...

741
00:46:50,323 --> 00:46:51,813
 It's not too bad.

742
00:46:51,813 --> 00:46:53,783
Well.

743
00:46:54,483 --> 00:46:56,723
Isn't that the first problem, then?

744
00:46:56,723 --> 00:46:57,843
 What is?

745
00:46:57,843 --> 00:47:02,913
Makes me think... you don't really love Jae Gyeom yet.

746
00:47:02,913 --> 00:47:05,413
Gosh, that's right.

747
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:07,383
Why don't I love him? Why not?

748
00:47:07,383 --> 00:47:09,803
 How would I know?

749
00:47:09,803 --> 00:47:12,553
I just think it's not love.

750
00:47:12,553 --> 00:47:14,323
What do I do, then?

751
00:47:14,323 --> 00:47:17,483
- Do what? 
  - What do I do when...

752
00:47:17,483 --> 00:47:19,893
 we're dating, but I don't love him?

753
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:26,283
Unni...

754
00:47:26,283 --> 00:47:27,293
Yes?

755
00:47:27,293 --> 00:47:29,863
 What is love?

756
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:32,373
 What was love?

757
00:47:32,373 --> 00:47:34,930
How does one love?

758
00:47:35,513 --> 00:47:37,823
Please tell me what love is. I beg you.

759
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:41,983
Gosh... I'm just as clueless.

760
00:47:41,983 --> 00:47:45,693
I'm also curious about what love is.

761
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,393
Goo Eun Beom said... that love doesn't exist.

762
00:47:50,393 --> 00:47:53,703
Tell him to shut up. It exists.

763
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:55,543
It does.

764
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,243
Really?

765
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:00,533
Am I the broken one?

766
00:48:00,533 --> 00:48:03,503
 Have I become unable to love?

767
00:48:03,503 --> 00:48:06,323
Technically, I'm way more broken.

768
00:48:06,323 --> 00:48:08,403
Why would you be, Unni?

769
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:12,603
Gosh, I don't know.

770
00:48:12,603 --> 00:48:16,333
Why did I have to fall for that tacky guy?

771
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:20,383
 Unni... Are you dating, Unni?

772
00:48:20,383 --> 00:48:24,523
No! You're saying some ridiculous things.

773
00:48:24,523 --> 00:48:26,773
Just go to sleep!

774
00:48:39,723 --> 00:48:41,223
Gosh...

775
00:48:41,223 --> 00:48:44,833
 Were you taught they're different, huh?

776
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,193
 I mean it. I'll count for ten seconds.

777
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:49,523
 Ninety nine...

778
00:48:50,903 --> 00:48:53,173
Forget it all and submit the litigation right away.

779
00:48:53,173 --> 00:48:54,503
I can't compromise anymore.

780
00:48:54,503 --> 00:48:56,513
All right. Let's just get a divorce.

781
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:58,833
How can you live together when you're that different? No way.

782
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:01,103
Seriously. That's what I'm saying.

783
00:49:01,103 --> 00:49:04,743
Okay. Did you bring the documents I asked you to?

784
00:49:05,373 --> 00:49:08,753
I prepared everything. Details of our assets.

785
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:12,123
Okay, let's take a look.

786
00:49:15,123 --> 00:49:17,413

787
00:49:23,853 --> 00:49:27,123

788
00:49:29,123 --> 00:49:31,193
What's this?

789
00:49:31,193 --> 00:49:33,183
Sorry? What do you mean?

790
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,893
They're mostly your wife's assets. Even the car.

791
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:39,913
O-Oh, yes. My wife did buy the car and the house in the beginning.

792
00:49:39,913 --> 00:49:44,143
I heard you can claim 50% of the assets after living together for 10 years.

793
00:49:46,563 --> 00:49:49,583
Your wife has more income as well.

794
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:50,983
The 50% claim was...

795
00:49:50,983 --> 00:49:56,063
for when the husband bought the house, and the wife was a full-time homemaker.

796
00:49:56,063 --> 00:49:58,163
But it's not like the wife loiters around all day at home.

797
00:49:58,163 --> 00:49:59,963
So it was made to recognize the wife's contribution.

798
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:04,023
N-No, I still worked anyhow and earned money for the family.

799
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:05,920
But your wife did the same. Even more, actually

800
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,493
She bought the house and the car, too.

801
00:50:07,493 --> 00:50:08,573
So what?

802
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:11,533
But you don't do any chores or childcare.

803
00:50:11,533 --> 00:50:14,243
No, no. As I told you earlier, Attorney Kwon,

804
00:50:14,243 --> 00:50:15,743
it's not that I didn't help.

805
00:50:15,743 --> 00:50:17,283
It's because she's good at homemaking, so—

806
00:50:17,283 --> 00:50:21,253
Okay, I understand. I understand what you're saying.

807
00:50:21,253 --> 00:50:24,683
So what asset are you trying to claim here?

808
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:27,323
The house.

809
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:32,973
But your wife bought the house. So why...

810
00:50:34,893 --> 00:50:36,993
He's so weird.

811
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,083
How does this...

812
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,763
guy have no conscience?

813
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:44,533
Sorry?

814
00:50:46,383 --> 00:50:49,603
How can he be such a nutcase?

815
00:50:49,603 --> 00:50:51,373
He has jackshit to call his own, so

816
00:50:51,373 --> 00:50:53,383
he better go along with whatever his wife says. Be a stay-at-home dad.

817
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,683
How can he even think of a divorce?

818
00:50:55,683 --> 00:50:57,853
Gosh, seriously.

819
00:50:57,853 --> 00:51:01,613
That was why... Because the man lacks too much

820
00:51:01,613 --> 00:51:05,683
that the elders took charge of dismissing the divorce.

821
00:51:05,683 --> 00:51:08,903
I was also furious, so I just rammed him.

822
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:12,603
I just couldn't get through to him.

823
00:51:13,463 --> 00:51:17,553
Even if he says he'll fire us, there's nothing I can do.

824
00:51:17,553 --> 00:51:19,633
Please understand.

825
00:51:20,763 --> 00:51:23,863
But I'm sorry. You requested like that...

826
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:26,813
It's okay. You did well.

827
00:51:26,813 --> 00:51:29,463
It can't be helped.

828
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:32,273
I can just agree to raise the rent

829
00:51:32,273 --> 00:51:35,193
or just move out if push comes to shove.

830
00:51:36,253 --> 00:51:41,523
There, there, there. Shall we set the mood for once?

831
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:50,303
Kwon Si Wook! I heard you pulled one off!

832
00:51:50,303 --> 00:51:51,413
Sorry?

833
00:51:51,413 --> 00:51:54,233
The landlord thanked me.

834
00:51:56,163 --> 00:51:59,853
Wow, this, this. Look at this.

835
00:51:59,853 --> 00:52:01,623
This is really expensive, you know?

836
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:03,003
What was he thankful for?

837
00:52:03,003 --> 00:52:06,203
I heard that his nephew said he won't divorce.

838
00:52:06,203 --> 00:52:10,093
He said he respects his wife's decision or something.

839
00:52:10,573 --> 00:52:13,423
Wait a second.

840
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:14,803
Hello?

841
00:52:14,803 --> 00:52:16,773
Yes, yes.

842
00:52:16,773 --> 00:52:19,493
Yes. Gosh.

843
00:52:19,493 --> 00:52:21,390
Really?

844
00:52:22,943 --> 00:52:25,453
Gosh, that's so great. Yes.

845
00:52:25,453 --> 00:52:26,463
Okay.

846
00:52:26,463 --> 00:52:29,213
Also, he apologized to me about the last time

847
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:34,393
and asked to golf together next time instead of boxing.

848
00:52:34,393 --> 00:52:38,323
That punk wasn't a completely hopeless case, huh?

849
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:41,223
Gosh, okay. Thank you.

850
00:52:42,093 --> 00:52:44,373
You did so well.

851
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:49,213
We won't have to move out for a while, thanks to Attorney Kwon.

852
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:52,363
He cursed me out before he left just now, though.

853
00:52:52,363 --> 00:52:54,503
Oh, is that so?

854
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:56,613
He must've been embarrassed.

855
00:52:57,323 --> 00:52:59,693
- All right. 
 - Gosh.

856
00:53:25,633 --> 00:53:29,623

857
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:40,243
I still need to tell her.

858
00:53:40,243 --> 00:53:42,183
What do I say?

859
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:45,553
 He said he won't divorce.

860
00:53:45,553 --> 00:53:47,633
 He was such a crazy punk.

861
00:53:49,003 --> 00:53:50,803
No, no.

862
00:53:50,803 --> 00:53:53,923
It doesn't make sense to act like nothing happened.

863
00:53:53,923 --> 00:53:55,753
Yes.

864
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:02,610
 Client Shim Jae Hyeok's case...

865
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:06,253
Gosh... it's too r-rigid, too rigid.

866
00:54:17,723 --> 00:54:19,973

867
00:54:22,523 --> 00:54:24,733
It's not even a big deal...

868
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,550

869
00:54:40,073 --> 00:54:41,963
What shall we have for lunch today?

870
00:54:41,963 --> 00:54:44,253
Oh, I'm still on a diet.

871
00:54:44,253 --> 00:54:45,983
- I'll have a salad. 
 - What?

872
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:47,443
Are you on a diet every day?

873
00:54:47,443 --> 00:54:50,393
Come on, just call it a cheat day.

874
00:54:50,393 --> 00:54:53,903
I can't. I'll be damned if the next blind date doesn't work out.

875
00:54:53,903 --> 00:54:56,033
You can't. You're only bones even now.

876
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:58,933
- W-Wait— 
 - She's right.

877
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:01,203
Did you make an appointment for a consultation today?

878
00:55:01,203 --> 00:55:02,393
No, I didn't...

879
00:55:02,393 --> 00:55:03,903
Gosh, so stressful.

880
00:55:03,903 --> 00:55:06,313
I'm craving something spicy.

881
00:55:08,903 --> 00:55:11,573
- Did you have an appointment— 
 - No...

882
00:55:11,573 --> 00:55:13,330
I didn't make an appointment,

883
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:17,280
but... I stopped by to ask an urgent question.

884
00:55:17,283 --> 00:55:18,993
- Go ahead without me. 
 - Okay, okay.

885
00:55:18,993 --> 00:55:21,103
- Let's go. 
 - Please come this way.

886
00:55:34,683 --> 00:55:36,523
He threatened me.

887
00:55:36,523 --> 00:55:38,723
He threatened you?

888
00:55:38,723 --> 00:55:44,603
He said he won't leave me or my daughter alone if I request acknowledgment.

889
00:55:44,603 --> 00:55:47,743
He'll really do what he says he'll do.

890
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:50,873
Ga Eun... he'll never really do it.

891
00:55:50,873 --> 00:55:54,233
I said he does what he says!

892
00:55:54,233 --> 00:55:55,753
What do I do?

893
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,983
How can I exact my revenge on him?

894
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:01,863
Attorney Oh, you know the method, don't you?

895
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:03,623
Please tell me.

896
00:56:03,623 --> 00:56:05,653
First off, relax.

897
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,523
Please relax and

898
00:56:07,523 --> 00:56:10,173
take a seat. Let's sit down and talk.

899
00:56:15,693 --> 00:56:17,133
What are you doing?

900
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:20,823
Well, I was hungry, so I wondered when you'd be done.

901
00:56:20,823 --> 00:56:22,663
I'll be on my way now.

902
00:56:22,663 --> 00:56:23,903
Okay.

903
00:56:23,903 --> 00:56:25,913
Please don't worry too much.

904
00:56:25,913 --> 00:56:28,043
Okay. Thank you.

905
00:56:29,293 --> 00:56:31,233
Please take care.

906
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:35,863
She cried?

907
00:56:58,203 --> 00:56:59,953
Let's eat.

908
00:56:59,953 --> 00:57:02,013
Why did she come back today?

909
00:57:02,013 --> 00:57:04,813
Out of nowhere without an appointment.

910
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:08,343
The guy keeps threatening her not to request acknowledgment.

911
00:57:08,343 --> 00:57:13,333
She came in furious, asking how to screw him over.

912
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:14,753
Screw...

913
00:57:15,793 --> 00:57:17,343
Never mind that.

914
00:57:17,343 --> 00:57:21,603
Why did you wait for me instead of going with other people?

915
00:57:21,603 --> 00:57:23,893
Do you have something to tell me?

916
00:57:23,893 --> 00:57:26,443
I also got a call from a client.

917
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,173
So I was held back.

918
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:34,533
So... did you tell her how to screw him over?

919
00:57:35,943 --> 00:57:37,973
Hey, are you crazy?

920
00:57:37,973 --> 00:57:39,553
Should you be doing that as a lawyer?

921
00:57:39,553 --> 00:57:42,293
You could get in big trouble doing that.

922
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:44,673
What do you care?

923
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:47,513
What did you say? What did you tell her to do?

924
00:57:47,513 --> 00:57:52,483
But... why are you so interested in my business?

925
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:55,223
When did I ever not have interest?

926
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:00,873
You know...

927
00:58:02,263 --> 00:58:04,503
I have a lot to learn from you.

928
00:58:04,503 --> 00:58:06,463
Since you're way better than I am in divorce lawsuits,

929
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,753
so I need to learn with my full attention.

930
00:58:08,753 --> 00:58:10,243
In that case,

931
00:58:10,243 --> 00:58:12,453
you need to beg politely for me to tell you the know-how.

932
00:58:12,453 --> 00:58:15,253
How dare you raise your voice?

933
00:58:19,703 --> 00:58:21,153
So...

934
00:58:22,573 --> 00:58:26,593
what did you... tell her, the client?

935
00:59:02,203 --> 00:59:04,053
I told you not to call me anymore.

936
00:59:04,053 --> 00:59:05,843
Don't hang up.

937
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:09,783
This will be my last call.

938
00:59:11,563 --> 00:59:16,643
There is only one... method I know that causes...

939
00:59:16,643 --> 00:59:18,673
the most damage.

940
00:59:18,673 --> 00:59:22,513
What... is that method?

941
00:59:41,693 --> 00:59:43,803
I'm sorry!

942
01:00:15,373 --> 01:00:18,233
 Forgetting that man and...

943
01:00:19,613 --> 01:00:22,453
becoming happy now.

944
01:00:25,693 --> 01:00:27,333
I see.

945
01:00:29,473 --> 01:00:31,783
You're really...

946
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,363
Who am I to be worried about you?

947
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:47,453
Why are you... worried about me?

948
01:00:51,223 --> 01:00:54,973
If you... keep doing this,

949
01:00:56,503 --> 01:00:58,443
I will take it the wrong way.

950
01:01:03,673 --> 01:01:06,783
Do you think...

951
01:01:08,413 --> 01:01:10,973
I'm too good to throw away now?

952
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,443

953
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:23,083

954
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:33,910

955
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:49,513
 Oh Dae Han did what now?

956
01:01:49,513 --> 01:01:52,783
 I'm tasting the moment of going to hell.

957
01:01:52,783 --> 01:01:55,133
 - I need to help my mom with her divorce lawsuit. 
 - H-Ha Ra...

958
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:56,983
 Laugh.

959
01:01:56,983 --> 01:01:59,553
 - I'm not getting a divorce. 
 - Mom, are you insane?

960
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:01,433
 Please...

961
01:02:01,433 --> 01:02:02,723
 You can't be getting soft-hearted.

962
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:05,443
 Do you even know what the situation is?

963
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:09,063
♫  Without me, everything  ♫

964
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:10,813
 Please raise me, Father.

965
01:02:10,813 --> 01:02:13,383
 Eun Beom, I really want to die.

966
01:02:13,383 --> 01:02:14,633
 Where are you right now?

967
01:02:14,633 --> 01:02:18,143
