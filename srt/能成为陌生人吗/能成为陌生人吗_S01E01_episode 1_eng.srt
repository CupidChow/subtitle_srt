00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,010

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,220

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,350

4
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,100

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,190

6
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,930

Help!

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,460
 Help!

8
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,180
 There's a person here!

9
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,640
 Please help!

10
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,650
 Please...

11
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,380
 Help me!

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,710
 Please help...

13
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,830
 Here!

14
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,280
 Over here!

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,640
 I'm here!

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,250
 There's a person here!

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,300
 Here—

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,140
 Over here!

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,210
 Ha Ra!

20
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,360
 Ha Ra, please help me. I'm begging you!

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,730
 Ha Ra... please help me.

22
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,820
 - Goo Eun Beom... 
 - Yeah.

23
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,660
 Why didn't you give me... this month's alimony?

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,700
 I-I'm sorry.

25
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,300
 B-But right now...

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,920
 that's not the important thing—

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,650
 Ha Ra, I'm sorry. I'll send it right away.

28
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,640
 Please help me. Please...

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,620
 Give it to me now.

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,910
 Smile.

31
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,430
 It's not recognizing you.

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,240
 Hey... How can I smile right now?

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,510

Could you smile in this situation?

34
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,140
 Then...

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,670
 you can die.

36
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,280
 I'll smile! I'll smile!

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,210
 I'll smile. Please don't go.

38
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,780
 I'll smile.

39
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,280

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,970

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,840
 It's working! It's working!

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,910
 Please help me!

43
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,760
 Help—

44
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,703

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,020
 Farewell, Goo Eun Beom.

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,460
 Let's not meet...

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,610
 even as strangers in our next lives.

48
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,780

49
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,290

Everyone, I would like you to meet...

50
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,750
the divorce lawyer who's the most trustworthy to have on my side.

51
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,560
The goddess of litigation,

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,110
Attorney Oh Ha Ra, please come out.

53
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,720
American journalist, Helen Rowland, said this.

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,050
"When two people decide to get a divorce,

55
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,400
it isn't a sign that they don't understand one another,

56
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,200
but a sign that they have, at last, begun to."

57
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,570
All of you who decide to get a divorce,

58
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,240
I, Oh Ha Ra... will help you.

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,700

60
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,550
Tell him, word for word,

61
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,080
that I'll get him... and kill him.

62
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,390
Did he leave?

63
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,120
Yes.

64
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,100
Is it my fault for losing?

65
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,920
He even lied to his own lawyer.

66
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,650
He's not thinking about what he did wrong.

67
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,210
But, Attorney Goo, what do we do about that?

68
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,980
Don't we have to pay for it before we go?

69
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,560
Why should I pay for it when I'm not the one who broke it?

70
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,980
I can't spare a single penny right now.

71
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,160
All better.

72
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,120
Hurry and pack your things.

73
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,740
Good job thus far, everyone.

74
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,020

75
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,450
As the adultery law was repealed,

76
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,850
I heard you can't even punish people now.

77
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,570
Attorney Oh, so if you...

78
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,390
take revenge by spreading rumors,

79
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,970
could you be punished for libel?

80
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,030
Unfortunately, that is true.

81
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,500
Wait, Attorney Oh.

82
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,200
Although it's clearly a fact that adultery was committed,

83
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,410
you'll be found guilty of libel if you tell anyone?

84
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,430
Yes.

85
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,850
You'd think you wouldn't be guilty of libel

86
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,180
since the other person clearly committed the adultery,

87
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,400
but you have to be careful because a violation called

88
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,170
factual defamation exists. 
  (Defamation of character by speaking the truth.)

89
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,580
Isn't the law a bit ridiculous in this case?

90
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,060
The concerned party is very angry because of the spouse's affair.

91
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,130
But you have to just hold it in,

92
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,810
regardless of how angry and frustrated you are. Right?

93
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,140
Exactly. The unfaithful person didn't do anything right.

94
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,250
So why does the other person have to endure everything?

95
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,270
Seriously. If that's the case,

96
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,110
then you can't do anything even if everyone commits adultery.

97
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,480
- That's right. 
 - Yes.

98
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,500
 People who commit adultery generally

99
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,640
 can be identified by their ability to spew bullshit.

100
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,370
 Not even knowing their place.

101
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,080
 The revocation of adultery law doesn't mean we should

102
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,160
just hold it in and look the other way.

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,540
It means we can easily f*** them up in a civil court.

104
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,970
F***...

105
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,950
- F*** them up? 
 - F*** them up.

106
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,270
- Why, yes. 
 - How, exactly?

107
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,480
Against your spouse, file a divorce with maximum alimony.

108
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,210
And file a claim for damages against the affair partner.

109
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,800
- Whoa, it's more complicated than I thought. 
 - Yes.

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,350
This is only the beginning.

111
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,840
In this process, to those two f***ers—

112
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,840
To those two people's workplaces,

113
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,970
through several fact checks and document submission orders,

114
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,340
you can kindly let them know

115
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,050
what kind of litigation is happening

116
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,290
for what reason, in real-time.

117
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,280
Wow, if you do that you'll at least feel better.

118
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,750
When you get that far, those two people will start demeaning you.

119
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,020
Because you were a crazy person, a demon...

120
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,410
or a psycho, they had no choice but to have an affair.

121
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,800
They'll run their mouths, speaking all this nonsense.

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,820
As I said before, how do we identify those adulterous people?

123
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,360
Yes. They're very good at spewing bullshit.

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,760
- How can you just listen to those slanderers? 
 - Right.

125
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,830
When you start hearing these things, you're almost at the end.

126
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:38,560
You collect evidence piece by piece now and file a suit for defamation of character.

127
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,910
 Unlike them, don't pretend to be the victim.

128
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,520
 Just prove you're the true victim.

129
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,130
 In front of whom?

130
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,060
 In front of the judge.

131
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,210
 Wow...

132
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,450
Who are— Why? What's the matter?

133
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,730
Why are you doing this?

134
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,320
Where do you think you're going?

135
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,290
Gosh, this little cutie.

136
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,650
Dear Client...

137
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,560
Where are you trying to go?

138
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,230

Don't you know my first cousin, twice removed, is a judge?

139
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,130
 100,000 won for the broken window.

140
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,530
 Deposit it immediately.

141
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,990

142
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,500

143
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,350

144
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,910
What's this?

145
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,980

146
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,090
Why is this still not canceled?

147
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,330
Yes, hello? This is Green Heart Foundation, right?

148
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,700
Yes, how do you do? I called because...

149
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,020
I'd requested cancellation of periodic donation, but it must not have gone through.

150
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,280
I'm Goo Eun Beom.

151
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,840
Yes.

152
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,710
The reason?

153
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,240
Well... I have become less fortunate, so...

154
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,810
helping others is... a bit funny.

155
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,910
I'd be biting off more than I can chew.

156
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,180
Yes.

157
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,380
Oh, and also...

158
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,110
could you perhaps refund the charge just now?

159
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,630
It was just 30 seconds ago.

160
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,230
Oh, yes. Thank you.

161
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,910
Okay. Thank you.

162
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,290
Attorney Oh, a lot of people must recognize you these days.

163
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,400
- No, there aren't. 
 - There aren't?

164
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,660
Really? You're the most popular one in our field nowadays.

165
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,670
Other PDs are also dying to meet you,

166
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,850
but they're not even worth mentioning.

167
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,400
I said, "No way in hell.

168
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,510
Attorney Oh needs to meet someone who's at least as good-looking as a celeb."

169
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,780
Gosh, what do you mean "celeb"? You're overestimating me.

170
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,360
Why? Someone like you is more than enough.

171
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,040
Thank you. I'll treat you to some beef.

172
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,400
Thank you. Great job today. Please take care.

173
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,720
- You take care as well. 
 - Okay.

174
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,710
Attorney Oh?

175
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,350
Hello, Attorney Oh.

176
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,700
My name is Lee Dong Hyeon.

177
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,100
Oh, I see.

178
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,600

179
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,100
I came to you because my actor wants to see you for a second.

180
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,540
Are you available?

181
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,200
Brother.

182
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Oh, Attorney Oh?

183
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,400
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Hello.

184
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,900
My name is Oh Ha Ra.

185
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,000
I've been a fan for some time now. It's a pleasure to meet you.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,620
Will you give me a discount, then?

187
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,220
 No way!

188
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,190
They're going to divorce?

189
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,720
Han Do Woon and Na Soo Yeon?

190
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,680
How long has it even been since they married?

191
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,730
It's only been like three or four years now.

192
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,500
Gosh, what news.

193
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,400
But why would a top star like Han Do Woon

194
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,300
bother to ask Attorney Oh instead of the bigger firms?

195
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,100
Could it be that all the other places rejected his case?

196
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,350
I think that is the case.

197
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,580
The issue here is quite complicated.

198
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,100
 We signed a prenup agreement before getting married.

199
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,910
Give it to me.

200
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,720
I failed my first marriage because of the other person's affair.

201
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,680
I'm sure you're well aware.

202
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,970

So, this time, I wanted to be more careful.

203
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,500
 Cut!

204
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,100
 - Okay! 
 - It's an okay.

205
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,370
 - Next scene. 
 - Okay!

206
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,700
 Prepare for the next scene!

207
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,680
 - Preparing for the next scene! 
 - Soo Yeon isn't here yet?

208
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,140
 - She's here. 
 - Soo Yeon.

209
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,770
 - Do you know what time it is? 
 - I'm sorry.

210
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,480
 All these people are having a hard time because of you!

211
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,320
 A rookie should know better and come—

212
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,670
My wife used to be a nameless actor before marrying me.

213
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,390
 Everyone has a shot?

214
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,670
 Good job, everyone!

215
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,290
 Good job, everyone!

216
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,010
 - Thank you for your work. 
 - Okay, thank you.

217
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,250
 Thank you for your work.

218
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,900
 Have some meat.

219
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,640
 At home, I look at actors...

220
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,400
I met her through work,

221
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
- and she seemed pure-hearted. 
  - You can dry it.

222
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,100
 Meow.

223
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,860
 What's her name?

224
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,450
 I don't know, either.

225
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,600
 You don't know the cat's name...

226
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,980
 Then what's your name?

227
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
 It's Soo Yeon. Na Soo Yeon.

228
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,680
 Soo Yeon...

229
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,220
 She doesn't seem to have friends.

230
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,930
 She's been alone since earlier.

231
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,820
 Then shall we become her friends?

232
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:39,080
At first, we just started out lightly.

233
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,530
But as I continued to see her, I became certain she was the one.

234
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,330
 Open your eyes.

235
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,690
 Ta-da...

236
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,340
If it's her I could trust her.

237
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,600
It'll be okay to love her.

238
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:08,180
I felt a wave of emotions overcome me like a high tide.

239
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,530
It was warm and I was happy.

240
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,610
Although it ended because of the same reason anyway.

241
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,090
I don't have an eye for women.

242
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,140

Na Soo Yeon had an affair, right?

243
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,380
Please get me that money.

244
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,050
You can win, right?

245
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,700
I heard you're the goddess of litigation.

246
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,330
- Attorney Park Ha Ra? 
 - No, it's Attorney Oh Ha Ra.

247
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,310
Oh, yes. Attorney Oh Ha Ra.

248
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,900
Why don't I try to get it? That five billion won.

249
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,150
- Oh, no. You can't get it, can you? 
 - Why not?

250
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,400
Our country doesn't acknowledge prenups yet.

251
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,570
- Unlike the US. 
 - Oh, my.

252
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,330
Is that true?

253
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,900
There isn't precedence yet.

254
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,000
Then, why did you accept? If you know you couldn't get the money.

255
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,310
On top of that, the evidence is too vague to prove adultery.

256
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,620
That must be why all the other places turned down the case.

257
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,630
Well, it's infuriating!

258
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,750
Hearing him out, the circumstances clearly indicate an affair.

259
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,220
She suddenly goes to the countryside for a shoot and goes off the grid.

260
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,840
Rumors about her affair with a young actor are rampant.

261
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,780
Everything from her speech to her gaze has changed.

262
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,910
After gaining fame thanks to her husband, she tells him

263
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,120
he can sue her since there's no evidence to fulfill the prenuptial agreement.

264
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,080
Isn't she so shameless?

265
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,110
Her frenzy button's been pressed again.

266
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,620
You know, it's adultery.

267
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,930
Attorney Oh's frenzy button.

268
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,730
What?

269
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,670
Frenzy button?

270
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,020
Excuse me. Then should we let those penniless pieces of shit,

271
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,710
happily run off after stabbing him in the back?

272
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,300
We must make them both go bankrupt

273
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,780
and clearly show them that karma exists in this world!

274
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,510
Pieces of shit, penniless...

275
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,370
Attorney Oh, isn't that too harsh?

276
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,908
You're a star attorney, so you need to mind your language.

277
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:28,110
What... What's this?

278
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,940
Piece of shit who's...

279
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,750
Penniless...

280
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,830
A live witness of karma...

281
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,870
Aren't you Oh Ha Ra's ex-husband?

282
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,800
That's quite enough.

283
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,400
- Goodness. 
 - You did great.

284
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,410
Oh, you're here?

285
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,760
What's the matter?

286
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,800
 You cannot.

287
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,120
CEO Seo, how could you do this to me?

288
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,700
- Well, the thing is— 
 - You cannot. You can't. Never!

289
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,550
You want me to work with an ex-husband who ran off after having an affair?

290
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,970
Does that even make sense?

291
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,110
We already signed the contract when we were drunk.

292
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,790
Don't you know a legal action performed with no mental capacity is absolutely powerless?

293
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,910
For now, take a seat. Okay?

294
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,140
There are two CEOs at this firm.

295
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,900
CEO Hong and CEO Seo.

296
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,150
- It's not something you can insist— 
 - You shut up.

297
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,200
I'll tell you clearly.

298
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,280
The moment he comes in, I'll be going out.

299
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,990
What?

300
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,960
Choose between the two of us.

301
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,710
Is it me or Goo Eun Beom?

302
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,130
Goo Eun Beom is so shameless.

303
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,540
How dare he come here?

304
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,180
Well, as someone who has nowhere to go,

305
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,600
he'd be thankful CEO Seo offered a hand.

306
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,670
Even so, to come here? Where Ha Ra is?

307
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,030
Then, should he just starve and die?

308
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,890
I heard Attorney Oh even gets alimony payments without fail.

309
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,950
So what, huh?

310
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,700
An ex-husband who cheated should at least apologize with money.

311
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,660
I mean, he has his circumstances, too.

312
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,410
How could Attorney Oh step on his pride when she clearly knows about it?

313
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,780
Then should she welcome her cheating ex-husband,

314
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,820
by saying, "Welcome. What took you so long?"

315
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,650
Do you even have a grasp of the situation?

316
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,950
As a man myself, I wonder if he has to go that far, but

317
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,300
he has that much guts because he's a man.

318
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,060
Gosh, you're using the wrong phrase here.

319
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,140
That's not having guts. That's having no guts.

320
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,210
Gosh, you always say, "man this" and "man that."

321
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,120
Forget it. Why am I even talking to you?

322
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,850
I say I'm a man because I'm a man.

323
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,980
I am a man.

324
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,540
Ms. Jeon, is he the guy?

325
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,730
The one who cheated on Attorney Oh and

326
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,370
started his own legal office, the Bada-Jinjoo?

327
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,390
Bada-Jinjoo?

328
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,010
Bada means sea.

329
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,800
Jinjoo means pearl.

330
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,350
Sea-pearl. 
  (Sounds like "f***" in Korean)

331
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,840
That's right. He is that Bada-Jinjoo.

332
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,290
According to what I heard,

333
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,670
the two of them dated for a long time before marrying.

334
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,390
- Is that true? 
 - As far as I know for about 10 years?

335
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,090
- They were a campus couple in college. 
 - 10 years?

336
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,440
Gosh, I don't know if I should be saying this.

337
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,930
From what I know,

338
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,890
Attorney Goo followed her around, begging her to date him.

339
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,920
Whoa... How long did they live together?

340
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,440
Was it three years?  I think it was even less than three years.

341
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,630
Amazing.

342
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,690
He even followed her around that much.

343
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,300
He's such a bad guy.

344
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,890
- Hey, Ha Ra. 
 - If you come here one more time,

345
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,520
I'll knock out all your teeth and make popcorn with them.

346
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,300
Get lost while I'm being nice.

347
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,100
Hey, wait!

348
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,980
Then I can't pay you alimony.

349
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,620
I have no source of income.

350
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,840
Is that okay for you?

351
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,010
Three million won per month wasn't a small amount.

352
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,040
I paid it every month, never a day late.

353
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,520
Yes.

354
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,860
That's your way of apologizing.

355
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,060
Calling it even with money.

356
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,810
Exactly.

357
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,930
Can't you recognize my sincerity now?

358
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,560
Wait.

359
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,020
- I don't even expect your forgiveness. 
 - Forgiveness?

360
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,060
Forgiveness?

361
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,800
Try paying 30 million, not three million won, until you die.

362
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,100
See if I'd forgive you.

363
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,700
He couldn't have... been that hurt, could he?

364
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,040
Why do you care? He's not even yours anymore.

365
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,380
Who cares if he gets hurt?

366
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,610
Gosh, I really can't understand CEO Seo.

367
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,740
His betrayal knows no bounds.

368
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,250
How could he bring him in without even a word to you?

369
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,700
Could he have something on CEO Seo?

370
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:40,170
- Unni, I think... he wants to try getting back with me. 
 - What?

371
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,200
CEO Seo called me in earlier before I got off work.

372
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,610
And then he said...

373
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,320
 Hey, Attorney Oh.

374
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,970
 In my opinion, I think he's done a lot of reflecting.

375
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,640
 Did you call me in to say that?

376
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,110
 - I feel sorry for him. He's going that far. 
 - CEO Seo!

377
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,630
 Ha Ra, can't you just give him one more chance?

378
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,980
 Please take him back again.

379
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,530
 Please?

380
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,120
Gosh, this is nuts.

381
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,080
This fogey, seriously...

382
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,810
He has seriously gone mad, hasn't he?

383
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,170
Hey!

384
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,050
You can't. Okay?

385
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,650
Once a cheater, always a cheater. You know this.

386
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,020
You think I'm crazy?

387
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,920
There are things I see and learn from this line of work.

388
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,570
That's right.

389
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,890
You can't change someone. That's the truth.

390
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,490
Don't worry.

391
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,990
I'll never take him back in.

392
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,340
I'm not some pushover.

393
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,730
You're already a pushover.

394
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,130
You've become a pushover.

395
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,400
Gosh, my alcohol's about to go bad.

396
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Let's stop talking about Goo Eun Beom now.

397
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,470
Just don't take him back in, right?

398
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,830
Right. You're right.

399
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,120
That's that, and to our left...

400
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,770
What do you think about them?

401
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,220
When did you even notice them?

402
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,400
Weren't you having a serious talk with me?

403
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,970
You think it's impossible to scan men while having a serious talk?

404
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,320
I can do everything.

405
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,850
Come on, look. Aren't they cute?

406
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,120
What do you say?

407
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,100
We're feeling down anyway...

408
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,820
Shall we join them?

409
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,580
I can't help but feel like I'm being used.

410
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,930
It's all in your head.

411
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,610
Kissing is the best for the forced collection of dopamine.

412
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,580
A deep kiss.

413
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,240
You're sober, right?

414
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,050
No, I don't want to. I can't.

415
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,340
You're an actor, aren't you?

416
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,640
Of course, I'd do it if it was acting.

417
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,610
But why do I have to go all the way there to act and shit?

418
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,810
Exactly.

419
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,010
You can just do it with gusto like a drama.

420
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,010
"I still love you. I'll never break up with you."

421
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,650
Like that.

422
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,120
Why are you suddenly telling me to change my words?

423
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,300
At this point, we lack valid physical evidence to convince the judge right now.

424
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,400
If things go wrong, we might end up losing.

425
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,550
That's what other law firms also said, isn't that so?

426
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,640
So, it's hard to make this a winning case because

427
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,260
Na Soo Yeon's responsibility hasn't been proven.

428
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,300
Fortunately, since we also don't have the responsibility.

429
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,940
Even if they file a suit, it isn't easy for them to win, either.

430
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,700
If Na Soo Yeon's affair is certain,

431
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,400
the one who's more urgent for a divorce is them, not us.

432
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,920
But is there a reason to give your opponent what they want?

433
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,300

Sorry?

434
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,260
My client doesn't want the divorce, I said.

435
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,540
What is she saying? That's not what you said.

436
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,480
You're the one who first brought up divorce.

437
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,300
I said it out of anger. I didn't mean it.

438
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,880
I still love you.

439
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,530
I understand.

440
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,760
Then we'll file a suit on our end.

441
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,140
Seeking agreement or adjustment will be difficult anyway.

442
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,330
Asking to proceed to trial right away would be better, right?

443
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,180
The responsible spouse is filing for a divorce?

444
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,860
I guess you're trying to appeal to a non-fault divorce by proving it,

445
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,070
but wouldn't that be in vain?

446
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,720
Recently, there was a precedence where the responsible spouse

447
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,420
has no right to divorce even after proving a there was no fault in the marriage.

448
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,810
I guess you didn't get to check yet?

449
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,800
Why are we the responsible spouse?

450
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,850
Rather, responsibility for the breakdown of marriage is on Han Do Woon,

451
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,220
not Na Soo Yeon.

452
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,660
Whoa, things are getting interesting.

453
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,210
I got a call from a colleague a couple of days ago for the first time in forever.

454
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,330
Asking whether our firm is on this case or not.

455
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,800
As expected, it's drawing attention because it's a celebrity lawsuit.

456
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,950
CEO Seo, you came to this meeting instead of going to your tango lesson today.

457
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,560
Seriously...

458
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,110
even my dance teacher grabs me, saying

459
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,380
"Na Soo Yeon would never do that" and

460
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,700
asking if Han Do Woon has morbid jealousy. 
  (Also known as "delusional jealousy")

461
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,860
So, I said I'll look into it for sure.

462
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,160
Attorney Oh, doesn't that guy have morbid jealousy 
  (Also known as "delusional jealousy")

463
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,520
and has caused things to come this far because of delusions?

464
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,810
Are you really sure she cheated on him?

465
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,880
CEO Seo, what are you saying?

466
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,240
Is this our first time seeing this? The last straw strategy?

467
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,910
The media's going at it because it seems entertaining.

468
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,070
Morbid jealousy, my foot.

469
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,570
If they had proof, they'd have quietly submitted it to the court

470
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,290
instead of letting the media know.

471
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,910
And there's no decisive evidence for adultery yet?

472
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,640
I guess she prepared for a lawsuit for a long time.

473
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,150
There's nothing more.

474
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,600
Han Do Woon talked about hiring a private detective, but

475
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,410
I stopped him saying things would be harder for us if things backfired.

476
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,150
For now, we requested fact-checks on Na Soo Yeon's

477
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,400
financial transactions and travel history.

478
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,570
I'm sure we'll get something—

479
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,570
What's this?

480
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,190
- Did you call him in again, CEO Seo? 
 - No.

481
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,810
It wasn't me.

482
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,020
Why did you come? I said I was out of options now.

483
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,950
Hey... Han Do Woon's morbid jealousy, is that true?

484
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,700
No, it—

485
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,850
No, it isn't.

486
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,090
Did you come to ask that?

487
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,320
Then you were blindsided.

488
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,650

The other party requested a psychiatrist as a witness.

489
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,710

Does this make sense to you?

490
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,590
That you forgot about a psychiatric treatment because it's been too long?

491
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,220
I went about twice. That's all.

492
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,400
I went for insomnia because I couldn't sleep.

493
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,830
But you said you were struggling because of your ex-wife.

494
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,970
That's because my emotions back then—

495
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,340
Do Woon,

496
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,070
people will say whatever they want to say to make their point.

497
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,980
You should've told me about this.

498
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,170
So you're telling an actor to say he saw a therapist to a lawyer he met for the first time.

499
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,700
"Hello, I'm actor Han Do Woon. I've been seeing a therapist lately.

500
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,610
That doesn't matter, right?" Like that?

501
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,220
Will you take responsibility if it gets leaked? Huh?

502
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,600
Come on, Brother. Please calm down.

503
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,220
It was leaked, though?

504
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,110
I can't take responsibility even if I want to. They've got all the information.

505
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,750
Attorney Oh, please calm down, too.

506
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,310
Anyway, I don't have morbid jealousy.

507
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,830
So you take care of it.

508
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,510
That's what I hired you for.

509
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
Whoa, seriously.

510
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,100
Is a lawyer a god or something?

511
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,840
That's what I'm saying.

512
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,780
Should I apply for a trial postponement?

513
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,870
What? And then what?

514
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:58,090
I'll be thinking about it after applying for the postponement.

515
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,030
Is there a cause to apply for postponement?

516
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,760
I'll need to start thinking about it now.

517
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,290
Isn't the deadline tomorrow?

518
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,410
 Gosh, this is crazy.

519
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,750
- Whoa, going home? 
 - Yes.

520
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,780
 I'm going nuts here, seriously!

521
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,670
Attorney Goo, please leave today.

522
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,440
You picked the wrong day.

523
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,110
What are you talking about?

524
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,670
Attorney Oh is having a mental breakdown because of the witness examination tomorrow.

525
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,150
Looking at the list of questions, it seems the other party

526
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,730
already got a plan with the psychiatrist.

527
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,470
Okay.

528
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,300
Oh? No, no...

529
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,720
- Hey, it won't end with just a bruise today. 
 - Okay.

530
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,290
Hey, it'll be hard to come out alive.

531
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,950
- Just for a moment. 
 - Hey, not today. For real.

532
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,510
Hey! Come on.

533
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,970
Okay, I understand. I got it.

534
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,290
Geez...

535
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,810
Whatever.

536
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,390
Please just leave me alone today.

537
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,400
I don't have the energy to argue with you.

538
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,880
How sad. What do you mean argue?

539
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,320
I didn't come to argue with you. I'm here to help you.

540
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,290
I heard the witness examination's tomorrow, but you're stuck.

541
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,820
Because there's no loophole.

542
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,310
You'll create a loophole that isn't there for me?

543
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,040
Sure.

544
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,580
We have a great synergy when we think together, don't we?

545
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,030
Did you ever lose when you worked with me? Probably not.

546
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,380
However, even if we're close, it's hard to do this for free.

547
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,110
I'll help you, so if you win the trial,

548
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,780
let me join the firm.

549
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,500
- Get out. 
 - I mean...

550
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,770
I said get out of here!

551
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,620
See? I told you it won't take a minute.

552
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,960
She'd rather work with her parents' foe than get help from you.

553
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,290
Didn't I tell you? She's really a time bomb today.

554
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,100
But still, how can she throw her nameplate?

555
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,950
Let's call it a day and go. I'll get my jacket from my office.

556
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,520
We can grab a drink tonight.

557
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,730
Let's do that next time.

558
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,620

That's my office—

559
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,310

560
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,490
Yes, Professor. It's me, Ha Ra.

561
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,260
How have you been—

562
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,900
Oh, I'm sorry for calling at this late hour.

563
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,100
It's just that there's precedence I need to find.

564
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,390

565
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,380

566
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,880

567
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,530

568
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,000

569
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,090

570
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,410

571
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,200

572
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,150

573
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,260
This won't do, either.

574
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,510
- Is it going well? 
 - You still haven't left?

575
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,940
Where would I go? I told you I'd help.

576
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,920
- How the heck will you 
 - I think I found the sneakiest loophole.

577
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,690
What do you say?

578
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,000
Do you want to do it or not?

579
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,440
Han Do Woon, is it true you're suffering from morbid jealousy?

580
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,720
Han Do Woon, how do you plan to respond to the other party's defense?

581
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,060
Han Do Woon, please say a word about your current situation.

582
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,130
Han Do Woon, are there any hardships in defending yourself?

583
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,250
Han Do Woon, is there a reason why you entrusted this case to Attorney Oh Ha Ra?

584
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,400
Are you certain the one you treated was Han Do Woon?

585
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,740
Of course. I've been his fan for a long time.

586
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,390
There's no way I wouldn't recognize him.

587
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,670
Do you remember the date of his last treatment?

588
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,500
I remember it being about two years ago.

589
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,200
Then, could you explain to us the reason for the defendant's visit?

590
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,800
Yes.

591
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,490
He sought to get zolpidem prescribed for his insomnia, which had worsened.

592
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,310
- Did you prescribe him the medicine? 
 - No, I didn't.

593
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,070
I can't prescribe the medicine right away.

594
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,550
I need to consult the patient first.

595
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,840
In that case, what could be the cause of his insomnia?

596
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,000
Perhaps, was it because of Han Do Woon's circumstances back then?

597
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It was caused by his ex-wife's adultery and

598
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,280
and he had gotten worse at the time of his visit.

599
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,230
Is that so? Then, why do you think his insomnia worsened?

600
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,700
His relationship with the person who cheated on him was over.

601
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,200
At the time, I heard he was seeing someone new.

602
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,850
If he couldn't reach her

603
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,180
or away from her too long, he felt anxious.

604
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,910
I think his insomnia worsened because of that.

605
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:42,030
Why would he get insomnia for not being able to reach someone?

606
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,700
It's simple.

607
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,000

You become anxious about the other person engaging in an affair.

608
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:00,200
I see. Could you perhaps explain using a medical term?

609
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,640
I guess you can say it's a symptom of delusional jealousy or delusion of infidelity.

610
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,390
One moment.

611
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,460
I think you can regard this one as a leading question.

612
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,430
Defendant, are you okay with that? Any problems with that?

613
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,970
No, there is no problem.

614
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,780
Since the defendant's representative says it's okay, we'll move on as is.

615
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,010
Please go on.

616
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:27,890
This is the end of questions for the witness. Thank you.

617
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:31,030
Defendant's Representative, counter-examination, please.

618
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,030
There's no counter-examination.

619
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,230
 - What's this? 
 - What is she doing?

620
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,270
 What's the meaning of this?

621
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,300
 Has she gone mad?

622
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,620
- Not a single counter-examination question? 
 - No, there isn't.

623
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,440
I think you can move on to the examination of parties.

624
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,530
Aren't you being too rash? She hasn't even won yet.

625
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,640
You're really full of worries.

626
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,500

If she loses, I'll give it back to you.

627
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,840
Hey, anyway, if you recover your principal this time,

628
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,730
uninstall all the stock apps, and don't even look at them.

629
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:11,660
- That's gambling, you know? 
 - I told you this isn't for averaging down my stocks.

630
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,640
This is for alimony payments to Ha Ra.

631
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,390
Why would I do stocks when I don't even have the money for alimony?

632
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,780
- I'm a crazy bastard. 
 - That wasn't it?

633
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,810
You were right, but I'm not that crazy.

634
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,900
My ex-wife is crazier than I am, so

635
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,490
I have a strong feeling I'll get to see the reincarnation of Shylock.

636
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,770
So, you should just get back together!

637
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,420
Or you can just marry her off to someone.

638
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,650
I heard you have to pay until Ha Ra dies or remarries.

639
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,680
The alimony agreements.

640
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,880
Is it even possible... to be pimping for your ex-wife?

641
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,850
Of course, it's easier to get back together.

642
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,200
You still love Ha Ra, don't you?

643
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,020
You must be learning how to read minds.

644
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,160
Hey, it's obvious.

645
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,640
I've been a divorce lawyer for 30 years now!

646
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,370
In my opinion, you two are not over each other yet.

647
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:12,830
Well, to put it in other words... hate is also love.

648
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,990
Hotter than love, actually.

649
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,400
Do you know what Ha Ra said if she'd lost this case?

650
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,510
She said she'd apply for a restraining order from the court.

651
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,780
Last night, I wrote a note saying I won't come near her if she loses

652
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,600
and even put my fingerprint on it.

653
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,020
She said she'll submit it as evidence when she's applying for it later.

654
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,300
- What are you doing? 
 - Hey...

655
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,450
What if she intentionally loses to get rid of you?

656
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,040
Geez! Write this after it's over.

657
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,690
When she wins.

658
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:02,900
How did your marriage life with Han Do Woon affect your work, Plaintiff?

659
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,400
Ms. Na Soo Yeon?

660
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,440
Ms. Na Soo Yeon!

661
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,200
Communication is important between actors,

662
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,400
but it became hard to maintain a relationship with my partnering actors.

663
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,070
Obviously, the atmosphere on the set couldn't have been good.

664
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:31,320
It wasn't easy to focus on acting as time passed by.

665
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,230
Did you talk to the defendant about how your work was affected

666
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,520
and implored for his understanding?

667
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,640
Even if I tried...

668
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,410
nothing changed.

669
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:46,050
Ultimately, I ended up concealing and giving excuses.

670
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,290
And then, we'd fight and scream without fail.

671
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:55,080
I understand. That will be all.

672
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,570
Defendant's Representative, will you pass on the counter-examination again?

673
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,570
No, I'll proceed with a counter-examination.

674
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:18,080
Plaintiff, how did you find out the defendant had psychiatric treatment history?

675
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,090
I heard it from the defendant.

676
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,520
When did you hear about that fact from him?

677
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,150
It was about three to four months after I met him.

678
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,290
He said his insomnia was severe,

679
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,580
so I suggested he try going again.

680
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,600
Since it's not a bad thing to see a therapist.

681
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,530
By chance, did you also recommend a hospital to him?

682
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,330
No, he looked into it himself.

683
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,120
Saying he needs to be careful since he's an actor.

684
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,360
As he was getting psychiatric treatments,

685
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,290
did Han Do Woon's symptoms seem to improve?

686
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,010
No. He became busy with work,

687
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,200
so he went to the hospital less often.

688
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,200
His symptoms were still the same.

689
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,700
Then, why did you decide to marry him?

690
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,530
If his mental health was concerning enough to recommend psychiatric treatment,

691
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,240
why not just break up?

692
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,780
Why would you decide to marry him?

693
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,360
It's like jumping into a fire with hay on your back.

694
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,790
Because...

695
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,020
I loved him.

696
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:38,430
I thought he would... get better if I tried hard.

697
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,460
You really did love him a lot, huh?

698
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,570
 What is it?

699
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,170
 That method you thought of.

700
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,250
 Admit to...

701
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,490
 morbid jealousy.

702
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,730
 Wh-What?

703
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,370
 I said, admit to morbid jealousy.

704
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,910
 Admit to morbid jealousy and make the morbid jealousy frame powerless.

705
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:13,370
 After that, you'll move the frame from morbid jealousy...

706
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,340
 to change of heart.

707
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,400
Now then, let's summarize.

708
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Defendant Han Do Woon was a poor man suffering from morbid jealousy,

709
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,660
captivated by trauma from the past, before and after marriage.

710
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,290
In short, nothing about him had changed.

711
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,760
But you are the one who changed.

712
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,200
So, the real cause of this divorce isn't Han Do Woon's morbid jealousy,

713
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,740
but your change of heart.

714
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,770
That's the real reason, right?

715
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,140
 What is she saying?

716
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,780
 Does that mean she's to blame?

717
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,020
I object, Your Honor.

718
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,880
Defendant's Representative is describing her opinion instead of questioning.

719
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,890
I admit. I'll change to questioning instead of describing.

720
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:12,800
What's the reason for the change of your sacrificial and beautiful love that wanted

721
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,000
to embrace everything about your loved one?

722
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,310
Perhaps, you found a new person after being emotionally drained because of

723
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,440
endless doubts from your beloved husband.

724
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,400
Is that the reason?

725
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,850
Ms. Na Soo Yeon, please answer.

726
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,420
Is that... the reason?

727
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,400
Don't answer.

728
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
I object!

729
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,000
 That's it!

730
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,820
That will be all.

731
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,450
What do you think about the controversy regarding adultery—

732
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,720
Is it true you were already lovers?

733
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,020
Na Soo Yeon, do you plan to continue your movie acting career?

734
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,230
Please give us a word, Na Soo Yeon.

735
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,200
- Na Soo Yeon! 
 - Na Soo Yeon!

736
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,700

All right. Verdict.

737
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,020
Although there's difficulty in

738
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,700
maintaining the marriage because one in the married couple displays symptoms of illness,

739
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,780
if such symptoms are only light in degree or

740
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,270

when recovery is a possibility—

741
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:29,160
There's a duty to fully devote yourself to your spouse's recovery.

742
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,560
Without such proper endeavors, you may not file for divorce

743
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,370
with symptoms of illness as the cause.

744
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,640
You may not. You heard, right?

745
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,560
Let's settle.

746
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,500
We won't accept conditions other than those mentioned in the prenuptial agreement.

747
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,540
Alimony of five billion won. Do you agree?

748
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,790
- We're willing to provide half the amount. 
 - Gosh...

749
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,540
you don't seem to get what I'm saying.

750
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,100
Shall we go home now?

751
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,120
We're not able to communicate at all here.

752
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,430
Okay.

753
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,350
I'll give it to you.

754
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,340
I just need to give it to you.

755
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,810
Let's end it now, Oppa.

756
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,020
We'll pay 1.5 billion won first.

757
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,620
We'll pay the rest in installments with the salary from the second half of the year.

758
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,980
Let's have you pay for the legal fees and

759
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,750
calculate the number of days to pay the liquidated damages

760
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,680
at the legal interest rate, please.

761
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,300
Okay.

762
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,110

763
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,370

764
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,000
You didn't think I'd really get you that money, did you?

765
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,100
Realistically speaking, it's not easy to get five billion won in alimony.

766
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,750
Are you satisfied with just getting the money without proving adultery?

767
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,430
Do Woon, we have no evidence of her adultery.

768
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,550
It's a miracle we won, and the heavens helped—

769
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,260
Do you think I have morbid jealousy?

770
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,720
No, that's not what I mean.

771
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,210
I'll find the evidence and prove it no matter what.

772
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,830
So wait.

773
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,180
Do Woon, forget about the person from your past and live your life now.

774
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,530
Why would you go this far—

775
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,930
Yes, go on.

776
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,120
Lee Dong Hyeon?

777
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,870
Dong Hyeon that I know?

778
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,360
You aren't mistaken, are you?

779
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,070
Are you sure?

780
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,500
Okay. Hang up.

781
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,810

782
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,360
What's the matter?

783
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,000
 The person you are calling is on another line.

784
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,470
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

785
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,610
What's the matter?

786
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,970

The one who had an affair with Na Soo Yeon is my manager, apparently.

787
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,830
 The person you are calling is on another line.

788
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,900
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

789
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,120

790
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,300
 My name is Lee Dong Hyeon.

791
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,410
 The one who's more urgent for a divorce is them, not us.

792
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:24,160
 But is there a reason to give your opponent what they want?

793
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,840
 The person you are calling is on another line.

794
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,510
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

795
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,970
You two are on the phone, aren't you?

796
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,770
Gosh, cut it out.

797
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,590
She's laughing.

798
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,460
Hey, turn it off! Turn it off!

799
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,900
Turn it off!

800
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,390
Hey, hey, hey!

801
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,020
Hurry up and turn it off!

802
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,910
Are you okay?

803
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,990
Open the door.

804
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,940
Open the door right now!

805
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,060
Have you really gone mad?

806
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,460
You almost hit a person—

807
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,130
Listen carefully.

808
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:07,470
Revenge isn't... ruining the person who broke me down.

809
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,290
They said the real revenge...

810
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:12,610
is becoming happy regardless of the other person.

811
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,140
What do I need to do...

812
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,830
What do I need to do to become happy?

813
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,020
When I wake up from sleep...

814
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,410
I have to open my eyes.

815
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,360
But I can't open my eyes.

816
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,050
I don't want to open my eyes.

817
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:48,090
That's how I am these days.

818
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,020
You want me to become happy on top of that?

819
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,720
Don't talk so easily just because it's not you.

820
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,230
I...

821
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:07,410
I wasn't talking about it so easily.

822
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:11,650
I was also... in the same boat as you once.

823
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,290
No...

824
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,820
I was betrayed by a man I was with for 10 years.

825
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,600
What do you need to do...

826
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,490
First off...

827
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,850
you just need to open your eyes.

828
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:34,640
Every single day, open your eyes.

829
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,330
After that,

830
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,230
and then...

831
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,050
when you find out...

832
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,620
what you need to do to become happy...

833
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,970
please let me know as well.

834
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,900
♫  Congratulations. Congratulations  ♫

835
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:50,320
♫  Congratulations on your win, Attorney Oh  ♫

836
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,610
-  Whoa!  
 - Congrats!

837
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,530
- Congratulations! 
 - Why isn't it working?

838
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,900
This one's broken.

839
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,680
That's too loud.

840
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,300
Five billion won in alimony...

841
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,700
Isn't that our record highest?

842
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,660
You're right. Five billion won in alimony is...

843
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,590
- You're the best! 
 - That's Attorney Oh for you!

844
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:07,750
That's Attorney Oh for you!

845
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,610
- You're the best. 
 - Wow, bravo.

846
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,480
Congrats.

847
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,560

848
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,000
Cut it out now.

849
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,660
Every single day, I brainwash myself before sleep.

850
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,710
"I'm happy."

851
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:28,730
"I'm...

852
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,400
happy."

853
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,620
But still, that doesn't mean I'm really happy.

854
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,350
If becoming happy is the completion of revenge, then

855
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,040
I haven't ever completed revenge.

856
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,210
I don't think I should be the one to advise anyone.

857
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,530
I think it was more than enough help.

858
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,900
I was spewing bullshit and didn't know what to say anymore.

859
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:55,560
So I said, "When you find out, please let me know."

860
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,190
Do you know how embarrassed I was?

861
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,740
CEO Hong...

862
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,410
please tell me right now.

863
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,250
What is happiness?

864
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,310
How can I...

865
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,200
exact my revenge on Goo Eun Beom?

866
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,580
I'll buy happiness with money if I can, even if it's fake.

867
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:23,580
Because I want to... show it to him and brag to him.

868
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,090
If that's the best revenge.

869
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,220
As far as I can tell, Attorney Oh,

870
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,680
you already know the answer.

871
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,690
You open your eyes every day, don't you?

872
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,720
You're struggling every day to become happy, aren't you?

873
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,900
That's enough.

874
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,960
For some questions, the process of finding the answer

875
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,400
is more important than the answer itself.

876
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,560
You're living out the question in your life.

877
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,100
In search of your own answer.

878
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,120
CEO Hong, have you found it?

879
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,600
Your own answer?

880
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,900
I'm also on the way.

881
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:09,870
What's that?

882
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,400
If it takes that long, then it was faster to hit him with a car.

883
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,410
Is that so?

884
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,880
- Good morning. 
 - Hello.

885
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,840
Attorney Oh...

886
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,320
Han Do Woon is going to Hollywood.

887
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,700
 I got to make a great career comeback.

888
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:27,230

I heard many actors in Hollywood wanted to take this script.

889
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:30,250
- Perfect Revenge. 
 - Yes, I also liked the title.

890
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:33,250
What do you think is the reason

891
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,460
you got the main role in this great comeback project?

892
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,400
I heard that...

893
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,800
what I said during the audition had moved the director's heart.

894
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,700
Oh, the words that moved the director's heart.

895
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,540
Would you mind telling us what those words were?

896
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,970
Well...

897
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,740
Real revenge is...

898
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,250
 becoming happy regardless of the other person.

899
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,260
 Right this moment.

900
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,320
 What is happiness?

901
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,830
 I live as a confident person wherever I go.

902
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,440
Oh, CEO Hong, CEO Hong! You remember Attorney Oh's first trial, right?

903
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,600
Come on, Attorney Oh didn't get nervous at all.

904
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,530
- She didn't tremble, but she just froze still like this. 
 - I also froze, didn't I?

905
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:28,200
 I also have colleagues I can spend working all day laughing.

906
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,910

907
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:32,120
Thank you.

908
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,590
 I love my work and

909
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,800
 I also got acknowledged.

910
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,820

If this is the way to happiness...

911
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,310
Yes.

912
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,500
Are you free tonight?

913
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,760
Why?

914
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,250
I want to treat you to dinner.

915
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:53,850
Commending a mutually achieved victory after a long time.

916
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,630
 I'll become happy no matter what.

917
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:02,450
Regardless of you.

918
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,870
What?

919
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,660
Sure. Let's have dinner.

920
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:12,600
But one thing you must know clearly is that...

921
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,500
the reason we're having dinner together is...

922
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:21,270
because I decided to think of you as a coworker, not my ex-husband.

923
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:22,310
Do you understand?

924
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:24,710
Did I say something else?

925
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:28,190
7:00 at Moonlight.

926
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,150
I'll make the reservation.

927
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,400
Why do I have to eat with a coworker at such a romantic place

928
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,290
even by bothering to make a reservation?

929
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:42,400
Did he understand what I said or not?

930
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:53,630
Hey, it's been such a long time.

931
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,560
You like this place. Not really these days?

932
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,130
No, that's not it.

933
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:03,200
Why would we, as coworkers, have dinner at a blind date spot—

934
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,040
He came early.

935
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,970
You're here early.

936
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:13,160
There was no traffic.

937
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,080
Well, this is my junior, Jae Gyeom.

938
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,460
You already had plans?

939
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,120
You two should eat. Why invite me...

940
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,940
- No, the thing— 
 - It's fine. I'll leave first.

941
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,730
Excuse me.

942
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:45,100
I didn't plan to meet Hyung tonight.

943
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,600
Aren't we on a blind date tonight?

944
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:56,640
Ta-da. Surprise.

945
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:29,350

946
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,720
 What? Blind date? He's handsome!

947
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,450
 Let's go! Let's go!

948
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:38,690
 What's wrong with an ex-wife and ex-husband talking to help each other's

949
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,450
 pursuit of happiness...

950
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:42,100
 Am I the only one who's uneasy?

951
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,320
 The only attorney who takes a case by intercepting his ex-wife's client...

952
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,060
 - Ta-da. 
 - Are you a fraud?

953
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,020
 We're working together, undoubtedly. A joint appointment.

954
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,700
 - This is adultery, 100 percent.  
 -  Don't misunderstand what I have to say.

955
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,890
 Why would you have a conversation with a man?

956
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,520
 Unless it's talking with your body.

957
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,740
 Talking with your body? Talk, you say?

958
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:02,140
