1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,090

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,150

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,300

4
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,010

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,290

6
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,600

It's because of Ha Ra, isn't it?

7
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,750
Think whatever you want.

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,870
Fine, I'll ask Ha Ra.

9
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,450
Don't ask her!

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,790
Fine, I'm the one who ended things.

11
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,240
I dumped Ha Ra, not the other way around. Happy?

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,230
And you know... technically speaking,

13
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,740
I never came here with impure intentions from the beginning.

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,460
It just ended up that way.

15
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,470
Oh, you dumped her?

16
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,170
Why?

17
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,150
Why are you so interested in your employees' dating lives?

18
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,680
Hey, you should get some therapy, at least.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,610
There's a place I go to, so try paying a visit.

20
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,910
And why should I do that?

21
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,820
Hey! Whenever I see you, I—

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,970
You don't even know what you really want and

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,070
just keep going around, twisting your life.

24
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,570
You can't keep playing around with your life

25
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,010
like that, twisting it around.

26
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,610
You'll only get hurt by whomever you meet.

27
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,160
Eun Beom, there's no paradise on the run.

28
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,860
You need to keep that in mind, punk.

29
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,840

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,190

31
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,890

32
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,630
Why did you guys break up this time?

33
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,180
- S-Sorry? 
 - I heard from Goo.

34
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,770
I heard you two dated again.

35
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,560
Why did you break up this time?

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,070
I heard you got dumped again.

37
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,180
What excuse did that bastard use this time?

38
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,520
You should've heard the whole story from him.

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,440
Why are you asking me after only listening to half the story?

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,820
Must I say everything with my own mouth?

41
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,580
Well, he says he dumped you, but he's acting like it was the other way around.

42
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,530
And you... seem to be doing better than he is.

43
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,800
Is he even playing the victim now?

44
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,240
Who would be okay?

45
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,890
It's not like it was just a fling.

46
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,170
I'm doing my best to look okay.

47
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,600
But I'm not... exactly doing well, either.

48
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,770
He says he'll leave our firm.

49
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,420
Why are you two doing this when you like each other?

50
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,470
Why did you break up again this time?

51
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,830
I don't think liking each other alone...

52
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,660
is enough for it to work.

53
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,790
Between him and me.

54
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,630
Our personalities are too different and...

55
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,400
Different and?

56
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,950
He doesn't want kids...

57
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,220
and I do.

58
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,260
Our outlooks in life are different.

59
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,130

60
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,220

61
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,110
- Hello? 
  - Mom, are you nuts?

62
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,190
You must be very bored.

63
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,030
Why are you putting effort into doing such a meaningless thing?

64
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,840
What? A meaningless thing?

65
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,850
 That's my last warning to you.

66
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,690
 If you don't listen to me again this time,

67
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,370
I'm going to completely disown you.

68
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,110
-  You know Ji Yoon, don't you?  
 - Who?

69
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,170
 She's Mrs. Hwang's daughter.

70
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,340
Gong Ji Yoon.

71
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,960
She got divorced this spring.

72
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,030
Her husband screwed up.

73
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,170
Go on a blind date with her and marry her.

74
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,260
 She said she's all right with it.

75
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,140
 Mrs. Hwang's okay with it, too.

76
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,400
Mom... is marriage a joke?

77
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,530
Did you tell her and Mrs. Hwang that I don't want to have kids?

78
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,580
 Why won't you have any kids?

79
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,190
Stop talking back and marry her.

80
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,250
Then have just two kids.

81
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,770
 I'll do everything you want me to do after.

82
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,300
 Instead, if you refuse...

83
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,120
 I also don't need a son...

84
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,650
 who wants to live as he pleases...

85
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,300
in such an ungrateful manner.

86
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,000
So I'm going to file a suit and

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,520
disown you from the family register!

88
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,280
 Money spent on raising you...

89
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,580
 your college expenses...

90
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,800
 all of the money I spent on you!

91
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,630
 I'll get all of it back.

92
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,440
I'm not joking, all right?

93
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,970
Go ahead and file the suit.

94
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,020
Go ahead and do whatever you please.

95
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,950
I'm the one who wanted to completely cut ties, to begin with.

96
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,860
I'm also—

97
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,510
I also held back a lot!

98
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,900
Did he go to the restroom?

99
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,540
What's this?

100
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,810

101
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,540

102
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,140

103
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,340
What are you doing with someone else's stuff?

104
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,860
Hey...

105
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,790
What the heck is that?

106
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,670
I don't know.

107
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,800
Didn't you make up with your mother last time?

108
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,890
How the heck did it come down to this?

109
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,200
I don't know, either!

110
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,310
About why she keeps harassing me after giving birth to me.

111
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,710
So what will you do?

112
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,850
What else? I'll have to go with it since she wants a suit.

113
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,800
In my opinion...

114
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,630
it's a luxurious expression of...

115
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,430
something like...

116
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,570
a threat, honestly.

117
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,230
This is luxurious?

118
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,280
I've never seen such a lowly threat in my life.

119
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,780
Should we help him at the office level?

120
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,510
I saw that the other party...

121
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,570
had hired five or six lawyers.

122
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,750
He told you not to care about it, didn't he?

123
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,960
Saying he'll take care of it.

124
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,820
Then just let him be.

125
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,300
Would he want the whole office to know about his family business?

126
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
It's Attorney Goo we're talking about.

127
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,940
Even so... it's because he might pull some weird shit off by himself out of anger.

128
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,720
Keep an eye on him, you know?

129
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,610
Why are you so caring about Attorney Goo, though?

130
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,540
People would think he's your son.

131
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,830
Not an employee.

132
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,870
I feel like I'm looking at myself.

133
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,600
When I broke up with Mi Ok...

134
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,020
So, because you feel his pain as yours,

135
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,440
you want to hold his hand?

136
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,320
I do want to.

137
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,490
Just like how you held my hands, CEO Hong.

138
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:48,460
In my case...you helped me first when I was bumming around after getting a divorce

139
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,570
since my career was on a break, CEO Seo.

140
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,880
However... don't you think I'm paying back that debt for too long?

141
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,210
What do you think?

142
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,900
I hope Goo Eun Beom, that punk, will understand my feelings.

143
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,510
Gosh, why do I even bother arguing?

144
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,390
Yes, Mom.

145
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,030
Oh, you're already there?

146
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,740
I'm almost there. Very close.

147
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,210
Yes. Yes, see you later. Okay.

148
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,350
Oh, hello. I'm here for a reservation under Im Sook Jeong.

149
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,710
Oh, come this way, please.

150
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,340
This is the table.

151
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,280
- Wait, excuse— 
 - Hello.

152
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,050
My name is Joo Sung Yoon.

153
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,010
O-Oh, I think he brought me to the wrong table.

154
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,750
N-No, he didn't.

155
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,180
This is the right table, Ha Ra.

156
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,700
Well, yes.

157
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,290
It's a blind date our mothers scheduled behind our backs.

158
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,340
I also didn't know and found out after coming here.

159
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,260
Wait...

160
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,210
You already parted ways with him?

161
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,090
Mom, what are you trying to do? It's so tacky.

162
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,990
Do you know how flustered I was?

163
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,860
It's because you wouldn't go unless I do that.

164
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,100
I told you I'm seeing someone right now!

165
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,350
- Why on Earth— 
 - But that's Eun Beom.

166
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,880
I don't like him.

167
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,190
I absolutely don't want Eun Beom!

168
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,710
I called him over to tell him I don't like him and to break up with you.

169
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,940
Didn't he tell you about it?

170
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,380
What?

171
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,180
You called him over?

172
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,970
I heard from my church's deacon that you two seem to be dating again.

173
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,280
What can I do?

174
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,130
I knew you'd never tell me the truth, so...

175
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,160
I called him over and confirmed it.

176
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,620
He said I was right.

177
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,370
 In the meantime, your mother is telling you to break up with me.

178
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,930
When?

179
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,830
When was it?

180
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,010
It was last week or the week before that.

181
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,660
Mom, how could you—

182
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,330
You should've called me over and talked to me.

183
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,220
Why would you call him and—

184
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,900
 For not letting me get held up by a nutcase like you...

185
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,660
 I'm really way too thankful.

186
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,160
I didn't even know that and...

187
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,140
What did you say to him, exactly?

188
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,840
What could I possibly say?

189
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,900
I just told him to break up with you.

190
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,820
I didn't even beat around the bush.

191
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,680
I was watching him sitting in front of me and it made me so furious, so—

192
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,840
Mom, please!

193
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,820
This is really unbelievable.

194
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,880
I'm really disappointed in you today, Mom.

195
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,670
For the first time in my life, I'm seriously disappointed in you, Mom!

196
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,980
Ha Ra...

197
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,030
Ha Ra... Ha Ra...

198
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,530
Ha Ra!

199
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,960
It's my fault.

200
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,790
Ha Ra...

201
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,850
H-How can you leave like this?

202
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,620
 Well, he says he dumped you, but he's acting like it was the other way around.

203
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,640

204
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,620

205
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,510
If you've something to say to them, just say it!

206
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll take care of things after.

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,380
- One second. 
 - Sure.

208
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,390
Yes, Ha Ra.

209
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,130
What's wrong with your voice?

210
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,150
I-I'm at the family meet-and-greet right now.

211
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,710
Oh, that's right. Your families were meeting today.

212
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,880
I-I don't think I can talk for too long.

213
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,510
They're almost here...

214
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,070
Yes, let's talk tomorrow.

215
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,100
Yes. Bye.

216
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,110
What are you doing in a room without its owner so early in the morning?

217
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,830
You were summoned by mom and told to break up with me, weren't you?

218
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,890
Why... didn't you tell me?

219
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,110
What's the use? Nothing good will come out of it.

220
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,710
Are you a mama's boy for your mother-in-law?

221
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,070
Just because my mom told you to break up with me, you do it right away?

222
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,370
I didn't break up because of your mother.

223
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,990
- Don't be mistaken. 
 - I'm mistaken?

224
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,410
You wanted to break up with me.

225
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,350
It's because of that, not your mother.

226
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,290
If we didn't have a problem, I would've convinced...

227
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,200
your mother, no matter what.

228
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,040
I wanted to break up with you?

229
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,710
What the heck are you saying?

230
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,840
I mean...

231
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,970
Anyhow, it's all said and done.

232
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,950
Do we have to replay it again?

233
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,390
Forget it.

234
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,940
Then just tell me this.

235
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,710
What's your basis for saying that I wanted to break up with you?

236
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,360

237
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,240
I...

238
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,470

Hurry up and call me.

239
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,360
 Mom's going to submit the complaint to the court right now.

240
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,680
 You should know when to stop, too!

241
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,290
What's up? Is something wrong?

242
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,090
It's nothing.

243
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,500
Then finish what you were saying.

244
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,490
What were you about to say about yourself?

245
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,020
I...

246
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,750
I felt it wholeheartedly.

247
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,990
After seeing that shit between my mom and me...

248
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,190
 I told you so many times, Mom. Whenever you do this, I get so sick of you!

249
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,580
 How dare you say you get sick of your own mom in front of her.

250
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,810
 Is that something you should say?

251
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:10,730
 It's too scary that a family you can't cut ties with will be created.

252
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:17,940
After I told you everything about my family honestly, you wanted to end things with me.

253
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,610
Hey... h-how could you know my feelings even I don't know—

254
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,740
After chasing after a person so crazily,

255
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,970
you started thinking about how to back out after a certain point.

256
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,030
How do you think...

257
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,310
I felt watching that happen?

258
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,980
Chasing after so crazily?

259
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,640
On top of that, I thought about backing out?

260
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,950
I did?

261
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,750
You didn't?

262
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,970
In the end, you got back together with me because...

263
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:05,290
I chased after you crazily and broke up with me because...

264
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,250
of my fault only, huh?

265
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,890
You're really—

266
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,320
Forget it. Never mind.

267
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,410
What you said is right. It's a replay.

268
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,260
Let's quit it.

269
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,000
What was I hoping to gain?

270
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,240
What are you doing?

271
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,430
I-I was just curious about what you were talking about.

272
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,150
Let's get a meal together later.

273
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,140

274
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,460
A Claim for Disconnection of Parental Relations?

275
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,090
Such a claim exists?

276
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,420
Apparently, there is.

277
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,430
Although they were all rejected due to lack of eligibility.

278
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,170
In that case, the one Mother filed against Eun Beom would also be rejected.

279
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,250
We don't know about that.

280
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,330
We can't guarantee anything, you know?

281
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,980
She had a lot of lawyers on it, too.

282
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,170
Why would Mother go that far against Eun Beom?

283
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,390
That's exactly what I'm saying!

284
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,570

285
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:48,150
 Why are they so aggressive against each other?

286
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,100

287
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,650
After his younger sister died,

288
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,870
Eun Beom has always lived with a sense of guilt and

289
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,930
Mother seems to have been trying to raise Eun Beom with

290
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,400
a strong control, rather than treating him kindly.

291
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,930
Against his personality, that must've been the worst.

292
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,170
Exactly.

293
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,500
Their mother-son compatibility was the worst.

294
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:36,490
He and his mother should both try getting some counseling, at least.

295
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,650
It wouldn't be easy to make them get it, right?

296
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,590
Probably.

297
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,680
If he was still dating you,

298
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,080
he would've listened to you, at least a little.

299
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,760
I'm also not confident, CEO Seo.

300
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,090
To support and embrace him...

301
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,360
I'm too weak and shabby.

302
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,440
I don't think I can do it.

303
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,300
All right.

304
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,710
You two must've broken up because that wasn't possible.

305
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,150
- I'm sorry. 
 - Gosh.

306
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,840
No need to be sorry about that.

307
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,790
You don't need to be sorry for such things.

308
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,140
Well... you know...

309
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,140
I actually have another favor to ask of you.

310
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,370
Ha Ra...

311
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,960
Why don't you... leave the firm instead of Eun Beom?

312
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:02,190
 To be honest, our firm is too small for you.

313
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,570
 It's about time... for you to go play...

314
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,490
 in the deep waters now.

315
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,830
 If you don't intend to get back together with Eun Beom anyway,

316
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,200
 that's the more constructive way in many ways.

317
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,580
 So give it some thought.

318
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,680
I've been to the otolaryngologist, internal medicine, and neurosurgeon.

319
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,910
But they all said I was fine, more or less.

320
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,910
Does psychological stress cause a symptom like this, too?

321
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,550
Of course. Your body and mind are connected.

322
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,710
This is also known as physicalization.

323
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,630
It's common for cerebral reaction to stress

324
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,180
and appear as a physical symptom.

325
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,760
Have you experienced severe stress lately?

326
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,480
 Stop standing there and go.

327
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,920
 I said, get lost!

328
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,230
 Eun Beom... thank you.

329
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,100
 Let's live happily. Both of us.

330
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,810
 I'm going to hang up first.

331
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,590
 Goodbye.

332
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,430
I did... experience one.

333
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,180
Mr. Goo?

334
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,720
Y-Yes. The thing is...

335
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm being sued by my own mother.

336
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,930
That is giving me a lot of stress.

337
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,340
Gosh, you must've been stressed severely.

338
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,230
Will the symptom get better if I take medicine?

339
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,310
That's possible.

340
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,380
Should I prescribe you some tranquilizers?

341
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,140
Yes, and also, regarding that...

342
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,240
I'd like to get a letter of opinion.

343
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,190
 What? A countercomplaint?

344
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,260
I filed for five billion won, and he filed for ten billion won?

345
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,260
Mom, I left something at home.

346
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,700
- Please look after Woo Joo for a second. 
 - Okay.

347
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,070
Compensation for mental damage?

348
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,910
Attorney Song, change our complaint, too.

349
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,600
No, this won't do.

350
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,670
Raise it to 20 billion won.

351
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,660
I'm saying... it doesn't matter how you do it.

352
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,870
So just get it done!

353
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
Woo Joo!

354
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,150
No, Woo Joo!

355
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,370

356
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,140
Yes, Unni.

357
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,700
Oh, Ha Ra...

358
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,290
Long time no see.

359
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,490
Yes, long time no see.

360
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,920
 The thing is, my mom got into an accident, so...

361
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,400
Sorry? Mother did?

362
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,800
So she's getting diagnosed right now, but...

363
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,300
Eun Beom, that punk, must've blocked off mom's number and mine.

364
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,440
He can't be reached!

365
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,750
 Could you please tell Eun Beom to come to Onyoo Hospital right away?

366
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,600
Yes. Okay, I got it.

367
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,140
Okay.

368
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,880
- What's up? 
 - Hurry up and get up.

369
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,430
You have to go to the hospital right now.

370
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,270
What?

371
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,530
They said your mother collapsed!

372
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,260
I just got a call from Unni.

373
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,000
Give it.

374
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,130
You can't drive right now.

375
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,280
Go in my car.

376
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,350
Ms. Seon Myeong Hwa, please.

377
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,000
Please go to General Ward.

378
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,840
They said her brain was fine, according to the CT.

379
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,210
But it looks like some people don't recover consciousness for a long time.

380
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,240
So, if she doesn't wake up after six hours...

381
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,900
they need to do another MRI and

382
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,520
see if she has diffuse axonal damage...

383
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,710
or whatever it is they said.

384
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,230
- What's that? 
 - I don't know, either.

385
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,040
If she has it, they said it might be more serious.

386
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,260
After six hours... When will that be?

387
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,660
10:00.

388
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,260
She collapsed around 4:00.

389
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,510
She'll be okay. Don't worry.

390
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,580
She'll come to.

391
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,940

392
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,400
You should head back now, too. I can stay here by myself.

393
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,220
It's okay. I want to stay with you.

394
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,100
Why are you so good to me?

395
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,500
I always treat you like a mess every day.

396
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,710
Still... we were family once.

397
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,200
You would've done the same.

398
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,950
No...

399
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,570
You did do the same, too.

400
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,800
Also, to tell you one more thing...

401
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,680
it's because I don't want to regret it.

402
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,330
Regretting is a really terrible thing.

403
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,130
After divorcing you like that,

404
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,700
I had so many kinds of regrets.

405
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,010
You wouldn't ever know.

406
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,940
So I did my best this time not to regret.

407
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,540
Not to leave even a speck of regret.

408
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,530
Since I did that...

409
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,210
it felt a lot better...

410
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,410
even after breaking up.

411
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,090
I don't have any regrets.

412
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:51,670
Of course, when I thought it happened because of my mom,

413
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,250
I did get stuck for a moment.

414
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,300
Eun Beom...

415
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,540
for that reason... don't regret it

416
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,730
and say everything you want to say to your mother right now.

417
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,160
I don't want to watch you regret it.

418
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,220
You do resent your mom but in fact... you love her a lot.

419
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,030
Go to Mother and tell her you love her a lot,

420
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,740
to hurry and wake up,

421
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,860
and that you'll do better from now on.

422
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,720
Okay?

423
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,300
Okay. I'll do it once you leave.

424
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,400
Will you really be okay by yourself?

425
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,310
I'll be fine.

426
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,860
I really just want to talk to Mom alone.

427
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,660
Oh, right. Let me know when Mother wakes up.

428
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,070
I'll be waiting.

429
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,870
Okay.

430
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,900
Ha Ra...

431
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,950
You're thankful?

432
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,570
I'm going.

433
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,850

434
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,370

435
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,940

436
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,170
Mom! Mom!

437
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,740
Why aren't you answering your phone?

438
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,790
You called me?

439
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,910
My phone's acting weird nowadays.

440
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,280
It must be broken. It doesn't really ring.

441
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,810
You should've told me sooner, then. To get it fixed or replaced.

442
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,430
You got me spooked.

443
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,990
What's up all of a sudden?

444
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,450
You haven't called once after leaving like that.

445
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,960
I was busy. Just so busy.

446
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,780
I happened to have time, so I was going to ask you out to dinner.

447
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,570
Why are you eating such a shabby meal alone?

448
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,920
I told you to eat a proper meal, even if you're eating alone.

449
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,980
This is enough for me.

450
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,050
You should've let me know you were coming.

451
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,910
So I can shop for groceries in advance.

452
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,810
I can't let you know if you don't pick up your phone.

453
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,650
Is that so?

454
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,690
Since you're also at that age now, Mom...

455
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,120
my heart skips a beat when you're not picking up your phone.

456
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,640
So make sure to pick up your phone from now on. Okay?

457
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,420
Such needless worries. Gosh, seriously.

458
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,440
You mind your own business, please.

459
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,990
I'm always worrying about you, day and night.

460
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm doing well.

461
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,520
- So don't worry. 
 - Goodness.

462
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,790
You're doing well? Really?

463
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,270
To be honest... I broke up with Eun Beom.

464
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:26,210
I'm saying we broke up a long time ago.

465
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,390
Are you happy now?

466
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,600
It's not because of you, though.

467
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,180
We're just too different.

468
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,600
Eat up. Take big bites.

469
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm not the only one. You need to eat, too.

470
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,500
My belly is out of control.

471
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,470
 You! H-How could you...

472
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,140
 I missed you so much, Mom.

473
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,490
 I couldn't hold it in anymore.

474
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,960
 You missed the money, not your mom.

475
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,470
 That's an option.

476
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,870
 How great is it for your son to come with you to the hospital?

477
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,100
 Or you'd have to go alone.

478
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,510
 You need to get an endoscopy, too.

479
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,280
 Did I tell you to come? You came on your own.

480
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,230
Mom, let's...

481
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,180
Let's get up and have just one...

482
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,350
more conversation, please. Okay?

483
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,880
You only worked your whole life because of us.

484
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,980
You can't go like this. It's unfair.

485
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,330
Given your personality.

486
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,390
Mom... Mom, is Eun Byeol telling you to come, perhaps?

487
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,790
Saying she's lonely?

488
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,680
You still can't go, okay?

489
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,540
Not yet...

490
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:21,500
You can meet... Eun Byeol again later, right?

491
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,790
I'm sorry for making you...

492
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,760
let go of Eun Byeol early, Mom.

493
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,230
I'm really...

494
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,320
I'm really sorry about that, Mom.

495
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,890
I thought you'd know even if I didn't tell you.

496
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,430
But you didn't seem to know...

497
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,540
I'm sorry.

498
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,110
Eun Byeol... wasn't...

499
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,140
Mom! Mom...

500
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,000
It's not your fault...

501
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,130
that Eun Byeol... left this world early.

502
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,170
You idiot.

503
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:29,430
Why would you... think it's... your fault, like an idiot?

504
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,520
Mom, are you okay?

505
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,130
Mom, how many fingers am I holding up?

506
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,810
I thought... you wouldn't come even if I died.

507
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,810
What the heck are you saying?

508
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,120
Come here.

509
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,180
Mom...

510
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:21,170
Mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

511
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,850
 Senior, I have the proposal ready. I'll send it to you.

512
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,190
 I'll look at it later.

513
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,200
My daughter... withered a little.

514
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,830
I'll use expensive products.

515
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,540
Are you busy? Why do you keep looking?

516
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,960
A client is supposed to send me something.

517
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,940

My mom woke up.

518
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,480
 Thank you so much for earlier.

519
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,700

Thank you for letting me know.

520
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,990
 I'm so glad.

521
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,930
Have you practiced a little?

522
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,060
Hey, what about your mother?

523
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,320
She was discharged yesterday. She's fine now.

524
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,310
Did she withdraw her complaint? The disowning complaint.

525
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,050
Well, she'll need to submit the withdrawal soon.

526
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,580
Hurry up and get it done.

527
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,760
The fight between you and your mother is meaningless.

528
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,440
What I mean is...

529
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,900
Anyhow, you don't know what will happen tomorrow.

530
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,160
So I think it'd be better to get it done quickly.

531
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,150
I got it. I'll have it withdrawn today right away.

532
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,780
Thank you for... taking care of me in this way and that, CEO Seo.

533
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,430
I mean it.

534
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:40,160
Gosh... Seriously...

535
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,180
You make me... age faster than I should.

536
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,200
- I have one more request to make, CEO Seo. 
 - What is it?

537
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,400
Let me postpone indefinitely my quitting the firm.

538
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,830
I think I was a little... carried away

539
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,870
by emotion when I told you back then.

540
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,430
- You don't need to leave the firm. 
 - Sorry?

541
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,120
Didn't you hear?

542
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,340
Ha Ra will be leaving the firm.

543
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:20,000
What are you doing? Get changed and ready for a game.

544
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,740
- All right, you can see here, right? 
 - Yes.

545
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,950
- Feet... 
 - Feet.

546
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,550
- These are calves. 
 - Yes, right above.

547
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,810
- And thighs right above. 
 - Th-The thighs are there, too.

548
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,440
- In between them... 
 - In between?

549
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,610
You can see, right?

550
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,590
Whoa... Yes!

551
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,200
Noona, what did I tell you? Huh?

552
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,730
I told you it's a son, didn't I? I'm right, am I not?

553
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:58,090
- You're so lovely! Come here— 
 - Why are you doing this?

554
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,580
What the heck? O-Oh, my, he's gone mad.

555
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,290
- Oh, my goodness! 
 - It's a son.

556
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,740
What are you doing in the office?

557
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,390
Was that too much? Chan Young and Ye Seul,

558
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,480
starting today, Korea is an island, not a peninsula.

559
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,850
Why? Because there are four seas.

560
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,320
East Sea, West Sea, South Sea, and Kang Bi Chwi I love you. 
  (Hae also means sea, saranghae means "I love you")

561
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,940
Kang Bi Chwi, I love you! Kang Bi Chwi, I love you!

562
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,450
Where did she go?

563
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,420
Where did my baby go?

564
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,950
He's completely in love, hopelessly.

565
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,950
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

566
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,930
Oh, you're here?

567
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,230
How are you so lovely even when you're drinking juice?

568
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,920
You hit a new high every single day.

569
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,340
Is it your goal to become a better you each and every day?

570
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,830
Please cut it out.

571
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,370
This is no joke.

572
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,490
Congrats, Unni.

573
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,170
Sunny really happens to be a son, huh?

574
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,860
Your parents are overjoyed, too, aren't they?

575
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,070
Hey, don't even mention it.

576
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,360
My mother was making a scene, saying they needed to

577
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,620
have an ambulance ready since my father might collapse from happiness—

578
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,530
It's crazy— What's this now?

579
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,580
My father is calling me again.

580
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,190
Hello?

581
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:25,560
Herbal medicine? Can she just take them?

582
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,030
I'm so jealous of you.

583
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,010
A beloved wife, right?

584
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,300
A beloved daughter-in-law!

585
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,470
Everything is sailing smoothly.

586
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,320
How do you always fall onto a flower field every time?

587
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,270
You're not one to say. You're the one in a flower field.

588
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,530
Going to Moon and Jin with that groundbreaking salary—

589
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,350
Whoa, I'm seriously jealous of you.

590
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,960
I'm on my way to the thorn field, getting paid more money.

591
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm in a thorn field, all right?

592
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,290
With a man whose head is full of flowers...

593
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,060
I need to give birth and raise the child.

594
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,140
You don't need to be like that.

595
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,960
Just say you're happy if you are.

596
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,190
All of this might look great to you since you want to marry...

597
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,620
but well? I'm not really sure.

598
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,280
Sometimes, I keep thinking

599
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,580
if it's okay for me to go this way

600
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,500
or if this is right.

601
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,610
Huh?

602
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,940
Ha Ra, can we talk for a minute?

603
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,400
I heard... you're going to leave the firm.

604
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,170
Oh, y-yes.

605
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,160
You heard?

606
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,130
It was decided yesterday.

607
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,600
Can I ask you why you're leaving?

608
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,270
Because you said, you'll leave.

609
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,000
CEO Seo said since you don't really have a place to go to,

610
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,200
why don't I think about leaving instead?

611
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,200
I already had an offer at the time, so I just went in for the interview.

612
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,560
Luckily, things worked out well.

613
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:16,680
That man is really no help at all.

614
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,150
- What? 
 - No, nothing.

615
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,440
If, by any chance,

616
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,550
it's entirely because of me, you don't need to leave.

617
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,600
I thought about leaving for only a moment

618
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,850
because you might be uncomfortable.

619
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,910
But you didn't really seem that way,

620
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:38,130
so I decided again not to leave.

621
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:39,810
So, if you're doing this because of me,

622
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,030
we can just keep working together like now.

623
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,720
I-If you want to.

624
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,340
Well...

625
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,690
But when I think about it,

626
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:57,500
it's a little awkward for you and I to be working together like this indefinitely.

627
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,470
I don't know when, but

628
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:03,060
we'll both start dating again, probably.

629
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,310
If I say I work in the same office as my ex-husband, who'd be happy about it?

630
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,570
Isn't that true?

631
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,220
That's true. You have a point.

632
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:23,500
Also, I do want to tread... the deeper waters now.

633
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,990
My world has been too small so far.

634
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,630
- You'll root for me, right? 
 - Huh? Yes.

635
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,650
Of course. I will.

636
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,330
Fighting.

637
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:43,440
Thank you.

638
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:52,080

639
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,980

640
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,700

641
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:15,090

642
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,460
Yes?

643
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,580
Oh, what's up now?

644
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,780
What are you doing this evening?

645
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,570
This evening... Why do you ask?

646
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,490
I owe you from this time and

647
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,310
I also have something to say.

648
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,140
So I want to treat you to a meal. An expensive one.

649
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,280
I have plans today. I'm sorry.

650
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,390
Really?

651
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,700
What about tomorrow, then?

652
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,790
Tomorrow...

653
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,110
Gosh, I also have plans tomorrow.

654
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,290
What about the day after tomorrow?

655
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:31,880
♫  Still filling my day to its fullest  ♫

656
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,920
♫  I keep repeating your name  ♫

657
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:47,580
♫  On the street where we walked hand in hand  ♫

658
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:55,500
♫  I stay alone and think of you  ♫

659
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:03,500
♫  Can't have it  ♫

660
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:09,800
♫  The warmth of that day  ♫

661
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,780
♫  Close your eyes and look through them  ♫

662
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,210
♫  and put it in them  ♫

663
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:22,530
♫  Dazzlingly shining  ♫

664
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,670
♫  I see you and me  ♫

665
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:29,540
♫  When the morning comes  ♫

666
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:38,000
♫  I know it's a dream that will disappear  ♫

667
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,990
♫  Then we say goodbye  ♫

668
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,470
- You came early. 
 - You, too, Mom.

669
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:50,710
Thinking about a date with my daughter at a good place,

670
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,240
I got ready quickly out of excitement.

671
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,530
What's this?

672
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,570
Your pickup lines are getting better after you started dating.

673
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,060
- Let's eat delicious stuff. 
 - Okay, okay.

674
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,540

675
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,330
Welcome. Did you make an appointment?

676
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,340
Yes. It's Goo Eun Beom.

677
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,900
Eun Beom, one second, please.

678
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,770
But why are you suddenly buying me an expensive meal

679
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,410
at a place like this when there's no occasion?

680
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:54,690
Well, I don't know. What could it be?

681
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,020
Anything come to mind?

682
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:13,150
Is this your first time getting counseling?

683
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,470
Y-Yes.

684
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,910
What made you come?

685
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,890
Because my heart was in distress.

686
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,460
What could have made you distressed?

687
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,610
There's a woman...

688
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:40,630
I broke up with more than about five times...

689
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,130
and she is now really trying to become

690
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,470
strangers with me.

691
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,710
It's my ex-wife, whom I divorced.

692
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,730
I'm sorry, Mom.

693
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,730
I can't go on blind dates.

694
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,510
I gave it a lot of thought...

695
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:10,640
I've lost a lot of hair because of Eun Beom

696
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,160
I still...

697
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,300
think I'll break up with him.

698
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:21,370
Who could I date with such feelings?

699
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:23,250
Perhaps...

700
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:29,050
it might be that I... just want to love...

701
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:37,830
not... marry or date.

702
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,020
But I still can't figure out what love is.

703
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,020
Although I might just... wander around aimlessly and confused

704
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,500
about everything in life,

705
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,590
ending up unmarried without any children...

706
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:05,950
and eventually, die a lonely death alone...

707
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,820
I can't help it.

708
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,850
I can't do it anymore when I don't know what love is.

709
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,840
I'm sorry.

710
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:27,380
It's okay.

711
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,040
It's okay, Ha Ra.

712
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,170
I must've given you a really hard time, Ha Ra.

713
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:38,130
Because... I had a lot of hopes and wishes...

714
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,440
Regardless of... what kind of life you live,

715
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,690
I'm going to trust you and cheer for you.

716
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:52,240
So, Ha Ra... it's okay.

717
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,710
Wander around a little more...

718
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,720
until you find the answer.

719
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,120
You can do that.

720
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,300
What you need to know clearly is that...

721
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,300
my heart, when I say that, is trembling in fear.

722
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:21,380
Still, since I love you... I know I have to...

723
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,800
say this as your mother.

724
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,310
I'm sorry for telling you this too late, Honey.

725
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,960
Although I don't really know, either,

726
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,030
if love means these things that I do for you...

727
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:43,650
love is a really hard thing.

728
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:47,730
So do it when... you're ready.

729
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,260

730
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:38,230

731
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:49,990
 ~Thank you to our Channel Manager: jiminnie_347~

732
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:55,030
 ~Thank you to our English Team and Seggers~

733
00:56:55,030 --> 00:57:00,110
 ~Thank you to all the Other Languages Moderators~

734
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,840
What's the big deal now? Telling me to wear a bow tie.

735
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,720
Don't open your eyes.

736
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,110
- D-Do I go this way? 
 - Wait, I'm scared.

737
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,240
- I'm scared. 
 - Are we there?

738
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,710
Where is it?

739
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,850
- All done? 
 - What's this?

740
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,630
Open your eyes!

741
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,860
Congratulations!

742
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,270
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

743
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:33,090
- Gosh, preparing all this... 
 - My goodness.

744
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,880
As you live together,

745
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,920
you'll find yourself getting sick of each other, disappointed in each other,

746
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:44,070
and things you just can't understand about each other constantly.

747
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,780
Just like our clients.

748
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,660
However, if you keep trying to avoid

749
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,190
and evade those things,

750
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:55,750
your married life gets rocky.

751
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,570
Just like our clients.

752
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,260
As you two probably know already,

753
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,080
what I particularly want to tell two divorce lawyers

754
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,260
facing marriage is...

755
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,790
a quote from the literary giant Shakespeare,

756
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,260
who's way smarter than I am.

757
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,410
If you can't avoid it,

758
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:24,460
you might as well embrace it.

759
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,400
If you do that, you'll probably have to hug each other quite often.

760
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,100
And in the end, you'll have to love each other.

761
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,690
Since you two are doing this marriage thing,

762
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:43,150
which is a hard and complicated choice to make,

763
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:45,230
in this day and age where one

764
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,260
can be happy even without marrying.

765
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:56,180
I sincerely congratulate you two on becoming a married couple,

766
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,640
Bi Chwi and Si Wook.

767
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,390
 Thank you!

768
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,500
- Cheers. 
  - Congratulations!

769
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,720
Gosh, CEO Hong, when did you prepare all this?

770
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,590
Goodness, what can't I do for a Doohwang family?

771
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,990
You're still having a proper wedding after giving birth to Sunny, right?

772
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,690
Not sure. If we're still living together, then, maybe?

773
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,880
Gosh, after all the things I said!

774
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,920
When did you meet Jay? Tell me about it.

775
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,130
Wasn't this expensive?

776
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,590
I'm sorry. This is the best I can do.

777
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:32,850
CEO Hong did all of it. CEO Seo doesn't know anything.

778
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,750
I'm sorry.

779
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,650
 - Seriously. 
 - I love it so much.

780
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,350
 - You have to do well. 
 - Does it look good on me?

781
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,870
 How did you know my size to prepare this?

782
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,140
 Those two did all the work.

783
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,350
 I'm going to defend myself.

784
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,730
 It looks great on you.

785
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:50,390
 How did you know my size to prepare this?

786
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,570
 - Those two did all the work.  
 - Gosh, it's tiring.

787
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:55,340
It's a battlefield. A war.

788
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:59,220
Gosh, I think I need to go now. I have a filming schedule.

789
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:03,760
Ha Ra, thank you.

790
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,090
- Be happy, Unni. 
 - Okay.

791
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:07,800
- I'll call you. 
  - Please look this way!

792
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,730
All right, make sure to show them what you got at Moon and Jin, too.

793
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:13,300
- I'll do my best. 
 - Good.

794
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,110
 I got it.

795
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:18,070
- Let us not meet at the court. 
 -  Let's not do that.

796
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:21,460
- I'll be on my way now. 
 - Okay, take care.

797
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,990
 He's boasting, saying he did it.

798
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:29,160
All right, I brought you your beautiful bride.

799
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:31,800
Gosh, not at all.

800
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,450
 It's nice, even if it's

801
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,970
 just us gathering to do this. Right?

802
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,280
- You're leaving? 
 - Yes.

803
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,240
I'll take off first.

804
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,790
Are you doing well?

805
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:45,930
You seem to be.

806
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,520
Of course, I'm doing well.

807
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,080
What's a reason not to be?

808
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:54,540
Where are you going?

809
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:59,090
O-Oh, I have a filming schedule today. What about you?

810
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:04,330
I'm babysitting my niece and nephew these days. Woo Sung and Woo Joo.

811
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,220
To go play with them.

812
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:08,820
They must love you.

813
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,920
They're so cute.

814
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,040
It's here.

815
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:24,930
 ~Thank you to all the subbers~

816
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:29,930
 ~Thank you for watching~

817
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:34,930

819
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,020
I'll be off now.

820
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,890
See you next time.

821
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,470
When?

822
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,220
Not sure.

823
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,000
At court?

824
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,880
Can I ask you one thing?

825
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,190
 What I really want to ask is...

826
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:14,190
 - Can we really... 
 - ...become strangers again?

827
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,480
 That's what I want to know, too.

828
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,810
♫  At the sound of dawn coming  ♫

829
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:27,540
♫  I finally had realized  ♫

830
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:34,400
♫  Among my hidden pains  ♫

831
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:42,200
♫  Another me was in there  ♫

832
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:49,050

♫  The light from the window  ♫

833
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:55,400
♫  My heart that was in darkness  ♫

834
01:02:55,420 --> 01:03:00,450
♫  Shines a new hope into it  ♫

835
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:07,190
♫  Everything is so radiant  ♫

836
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:16,160
♫  All the times we spent together  ♫

837
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,190
♫  Becomes a strength for me  ♫

838
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:26,400
♫  All of the happy memories  ♫

839
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:34,180
♫  My way, at the same place  ♫

840
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:39,420
♫  Able to smile brightly  ♫

841
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,780
♫  My way  ♫

842
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:45,600
