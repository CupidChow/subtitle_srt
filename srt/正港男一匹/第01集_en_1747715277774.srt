The Man Who Kills the Woman

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Tatsuo Uchimura.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't have any money.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You have money?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hey, come here.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Rokemasa?

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Rokemasa is said to be the strongest in Gachirin.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's just a rumor.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What do you want?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I just came to get the money.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Are you his bodyguard?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are you going to help your son?

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Please.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He's just a bad boy.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He doesn't like bad things.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I just came to pick him up because my mother asked me to.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The gun of revenge is my great weapon.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hey.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you say something stupid, I'll kill you.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Who's going to kill Satoshi Sawada?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Tell me.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You can't do anything.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Do it.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Come on.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's go.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's go.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you stupid?

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The Gachirin company has a lot of drugs.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you going to do with the bad guys?

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm really sorry.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll never sell Maribara again.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So?

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How much did you earn in the grass?

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How much did you earn?

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
400,000 yen.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, it's about 400,000 yen in total.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hey, Shibuya.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What?

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you have any complaints?

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No, sir.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Then go to your mother and tell her.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hurry up.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, you're the boss of the Gengetsu Group.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're already out of the office.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, you're the one who bought my house and my house.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You can't take advantage of the Gengetsu Oda.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hey, hey.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're a real bastard.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're going to beat the boss of the Gengetsu Group.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I told you to tell me you were dead.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll beat you up.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're going to cry.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're a real bastard.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Masaya

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Masaya

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Masaya, I'm talking to you.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Really?

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm not going to beat you up this time.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're a hero.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're a good student, but you're not a good man.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're not a good man.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So, what's my job?

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're retired.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You don't need money or support.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm not doing anything.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm not retiring.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can't do that.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't be a fool.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you retire, I'll get you back.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hey.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Masaya.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Even if you're going to take revenge,

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you do something to your father, Masaya will come to you.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll never call you.

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Masaya.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Idiot.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What?

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're a man?

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't like the organization.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're a big man.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're a good man.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why are you so upset?

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll make a guren team and get rid of you.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Tatsuo.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You'll be killed someday.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I want to see if there's anyone who can kill me.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're a poor man.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Wait.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're talking about me now.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Masaya's super 15 team.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Then I'll do it.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll kill you.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're cool.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What kind of team are you?

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We're not Yakuza.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're an amateur.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're a fool.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're a fool.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Give me the wallet.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll give you the wallet.

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll give you the wallet.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Even if you quit Yakuza, you're a good guy.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're a fool.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What's that?

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you like, I'll take one.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, a holo-kuman.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Make one for each of us.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I only have one.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're a fool.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're a fool.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're an amateur.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're a fool.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Aren't you ashamed?

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That punk is a good guy.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why are you teaching me when I'm being asked off?

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Muramatsu from Kagetsu told me to take your stuff.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He bowed his head to the president.

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hey, Ben.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Muramatsu from Kagetsu is here.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Good morning.

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Good morning.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm looking for you.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Muramatsu, I'm glad you're here.

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't worry about me.

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I have a lot of fans.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You can leave me alone.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Leave it to me.

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't be mad.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're a fool.

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Mr. Atasui, tomorrow the heroes of Kagetsu will come back.

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm just saying this to celebrate.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sorry to have you worried.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, no.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Kaneda.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The heroes of Kagetsu?

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Who are they talking about?

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's obvious who they are.

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That idiot is already here.

152
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Kaneda, you go with them.

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why me?

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He's a senior in the group.

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're classmates.

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You can go with the others.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Shin's brother will hate you.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're annoying.

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
In exchange,

160
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you should attend Shin's celebration.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You!

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't answer me!

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The Heroes of Kagetsu

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Welcome back, Shin.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you for your hard work.

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you.

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why isn't your boss here?

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't be mean.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If your boss comes,

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
you have to be careful.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm just kidding.

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You know what I mean.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'll bring my bag.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Boss.

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm just kidding.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Just kidding.

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Shin's here.

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He's a good old man.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's been five years.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He's still a good old man.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Chaka?

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Shin's brother.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He's called Chaka Shin because he's a good old man.

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's scary.

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He's in the department?

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He's in the group of the Yoso who despises Kagetsu.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He's a bad guy.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's scary.

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Chaka Shin is amazing.

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Where are you going?

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're always acting like a fool.

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You're a stupid.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You look like you're having fun.

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're a bad guy.

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Maruo's father-in-law is here.

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Hey, Rokemasa.

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I've been hearing about you lately.

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're retired because you're too lazy.

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What's this?

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You can hang this up.

201
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's a good one.

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't do it.

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If you're going to annoy me, do it again.

204
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Do you know the law of the violent group?

205
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
In that law, you can punish the person who is close to Yakuza.

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll destroy your hospital.

207
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No way.

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't be a jerk.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Say it.

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You've never seen it before?

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Is it the new Yoso?

212
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No.

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm the only one in Rokemasa.

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What's your name?

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Tatsuo Uchimura.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm the head of the office.

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm old and fat.

218
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm not stupid.

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Shut up.

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're old.

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Tell Tatsuo Uchimura.

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's been ten years since he's heard a word from a god.

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Dad.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm fine.

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I didn't hear anything.

226
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yakuza is a jerk.

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
A jerk.

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He's just sucking the air out of them.

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The largest Yakuza organization in Kyushu.

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Gachirin Association.

231
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They've been saving this town for years.

232
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They've been destroying the society.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No matter how popular they are,

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
they're nothing but bad.

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The worst of all idiots.

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
They can do anything with their strength.

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They're just Yakuza.

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Hey.

241
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Shinnosuke Yamakura.

242
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He's back.

243
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Good work.

244
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Thank you.

245
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What are you staring at?

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What are you staring at?

247
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm not staring at you.

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What are you staring at?

249
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You're talking nonsense.

250
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're talking nonsense.

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You're talking nonsense.

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Stop it.

253
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Stop it.

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You're a kid.

255
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Bring more sake.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Sorry.

257
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Bring more sake.

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Cheers.

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Cheers.

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Cheers.

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Cheers.

262
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Cheers.

263
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Shinji.

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Welcome home.

265
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
How's the situation?

267
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's pretty tough.

268
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The club is in a bad spot.

269
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Shinogi is having a hard time.

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What's going on?

271
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The gang is being eliminated.

272
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This guy is in trouble.

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What's going on?

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Shinji.

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's a shame.

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The Yantai are not as popular anymore.

277
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What's going on?

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You're still fighting?

279
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I can't help it.

280
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I wonder if you're going to find a match.

281
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

282
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I can't help it.

283
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm a useless guy like you.

284
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can't help it.

285
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I have to fight.

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I have no reason to exist in a fight.

287
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I can't even fight Shinogi.

288
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I can't even fight a group of people.

289
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm just a downer.

290
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry to be swallowed by the waves of the times.

292
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll give you another shot.

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Whether it's inside the Kachurin Club or in other groups.

294
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I want an enemy.

295
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't want to.

296
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You're always saying things like that.

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If you want to fight, you can start from here.

298
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If you're not thinking straight,

299
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
you can hit me from one side.

300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What are you laughing at?

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
No.

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I see.

304
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay!

305
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll go if I get paid tomorrow.

306
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Shut up!

307
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm getting paid every day.

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Nice to meet you.

309
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm Aso, the head of the 15th squad.

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm the young leader, Odagiri.

311
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I've heard a lot about you.

312
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm honored to meet you.

313
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You came from Tokyo?

314
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes.

315
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I was picked up by the head of the squad three years ago.

316
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What?

317
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You're the young leader in three years?

318
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That's a strange appearance.

319
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I've contributed to the squad for a short time.

320
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Contributed?

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
With money?

322
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes.

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I've been making money and increasing the number of young people.

324
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I was recognized for that.

325
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The boss entrusted me with the squad.

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What were you doing in Tokyo?

327
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I was a cadet in Kanto.

328
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I was a part-time job.

329
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You were a gunman?

330
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Is there a problem?

331
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No.

332
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm glad to have a reliable friend in the same organization.

333
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm happy to hear you say that.

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How much is it?

335
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
150,000 yen.

336
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's cheap.

337
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't want to buy a cheap product.

338
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Don't worry.

339
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's a copy of the Philippine version.

340
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's a origami.

341
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's a Gaba maintainer.

343
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's full of bullets.

344
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I like it.

345
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll get two bullets.

346
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Don't be so generous.

347
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
If you're going to try it, do it elsewhere.

348
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What?

349
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What's your purpose?

350
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Why did you sneak into the 15th squad?

351
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What are you trying to do?

352
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We're not trying to...

353
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You're so annoying.

354
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Even if you're a 15-year-old father,

355
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I can't do that.

356
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Don't mess with me.

357
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
We're not here to welcome guests.

358
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We're here to get into the 15th squad.

359
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We're going to the 15th squad.

360
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What's this?

361
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Are you going to do it?

362
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's a joke.

363
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm not going to admit it if I just say it.

364
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Don't be surprised.

366
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm looking forward to working with you.

367
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Me too.

368
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Stop joking.

369
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm serious.

370
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
They're not just people.

371
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What?

372
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I found the enemy.

373
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm telling you.

374
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Is that Chaka Shin?

375
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Let's get rid of him.

376
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't panic.

377
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's still early.

378
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll report to Noedari.

379
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Osaka is the No. 3 in the heaven's world.

380
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Today, Shin Shaki's army is coming here.

381
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I was told by the president to let you play the role.

383
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Is that wrong?

384
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm just a guard of the heaven's world.

385
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The No. 3 in the heaven's world.

386
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Why are you like me?

387
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
When they were about to come here a few years ago...

388
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm going to get rid of you and Masa.

389
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm going to get rid of you with a rocket launcher.

390
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I thought you'd be the one to take care of the president and the prosecutor.

391
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You're a bastard.

392
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What's wrong?

393
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You're scared because you're a big guy?

394
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What are you talking about?

395
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm just a guard of the heaven's world.

396
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm going to ask you to do something about the president.

397
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I understand.

398
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll make sure he's a good man.

399
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm going to get rid of you.

400
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm going to get rid of you.

401
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm going to get rid of you.

402
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Please tell the president.

405
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's only natural to entertain customers.

406
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Next time I'll do it more grandly.

407
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Please forgive me for today.

408
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You're so lame.

409
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Mr. Watase, you've been talking about customers for a while.

410
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
If you're treating customers, why are you here?

411
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You're not the one who's supposed to be the president.

412
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The president of the Heaven's World is here.

413
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Even if you don't say the president, the office class is popular.

414
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You're the one who's been trying to get customers to feel the extra pressure.

415
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You're right.

416
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

417
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I understand that you're trying to get customers.

418
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Please forgive me for today.

419
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Cheers.

425
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You're used to living in a difficult time.

426
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I heard that you're a martial artist.

427
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You're good at fighting.

428
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You can't fight easily.

429
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I can't fight.

430
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You're a real fighter.

431
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You can't beat us.

432
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If you're lying, you can try.

433
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It'll be fun.

434
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You've been talking about getting customers.

435
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You're fighting with us.

436
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What are you doing?

437
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Don't be ridiculous.

438
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Please don't say anything rude.

440
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I can fight, too.

441
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What are you doing?

442
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It's a big mistake if everyone thinks they're scared of the Heavenly Realm.

443
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You shouldn't have heard that.

444
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I heard you're underestimating the Heavenly Realm.

445
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Excuse me.

446
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Excuse me.

447
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
There you are.

448
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
What's going on?

449
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I heard you're recruiting people to the Heavenly Realm.

450
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm Masatoshi Sawada from the Gachirinkai Kogetsu.

452
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Masatoshi Sawada.

453
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm here to see what the most famous martial artist in Japan is like.

454
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Shut up!

455
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What's up?

456
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
What do you think of Masatoshi Sawada?

457
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
What do you think of him?

458
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
He's got a good vibe.

459
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
He's a famous martial artist in Japan.

460
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I like that.

461
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So?

462
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You want to quit Gachirinkai and come home?

463
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm fighting.

464
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What are you talking about?

465
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Kaneda, close the shop.

466
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'll be your

467
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Shut up!

468
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm talking to Mr. Joshima.

469
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
If you keep talking like that, I'll fight as you wish.

470
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I don't care if it's a team or a personal match.

471
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Mr. Joshima.

472
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You can't fight with each other.

473
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm a bodyguard of a high-class group.

474
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I just want to test your skills.

475
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You want to fight me?

476
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I wanted to fight you 20 years ago.

477
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
What's that? Don't treat me like an old man.

478
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm the bodyguard.

479
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm the bodyguard.

480
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Kaneda.

481
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm going to find a good place to stay.

482
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Are you serious?

483
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I can't come all the way here and get water.

484
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I want to make a little fuss.

485
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Boss.

487
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Is this guy dead?

488
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yes.

489
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll take care of the rest.

490
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
He's the former Japanese ranker of the heavyweight division.

491
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
If you're going to fight, you're a bodyguard.

492
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Mr. Joshima.

493
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
That's my line.

494
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Let's go.

495
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm sorry.

496
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You're not as good as I thought.

497
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm weak.

498
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You're too weak.

499
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You're talking about yourself?

500
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm talking about you.

501
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You guys.

502
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Let me get serious.

503
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Let me get serious.

504
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm the only one on my back.

505
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm sorry to make you fight more.

506
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I remember.

507
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I knew Masato Sawada.

508
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
He shot a rocket launcher into our Yodoh group.

509
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's a rocket launcher.

510
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'll kill you.

511
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll kill you.

512
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's not over yet.

513
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Stop.

514
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You're in the way.

515
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll decide how far you can go.

516
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'll stop.

517
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Don't come near me.

518
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm on my way.

519
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
The End

520
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It's a game.

521
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
If you keep doing this,

522
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
the Tengokai and Gachirinkai will be at war.

523
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
How old are you?

524
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm 65.

525
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You're too old to be a puncher.

526
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You're something.

527
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You're the best in Japan.

528
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I wanted to fight you 20 years ago.

529
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You're talking to me, the number three in the Tengokai.

530
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You're funny.

531
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I like strong men like you.

532
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm excited.

533
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'll show you how strong you are.

534
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Hey, boss.

535
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'll have a drink with you in my office.

536
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Hey, boss.

537
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You idiot.

538
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't decide on your own.

539
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Don't be rude.

540
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
What's wrong with you?

541
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You're a good guy.

542
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
He's a good guy,

543
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
but he's as cute as a bad guy.

544
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Why?

545
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Fujino was beaten up by a guy who was a film director.

546
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That useless guy

547
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
put a lot of dirt on my gold plate.

548
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Here's the gyoza.

549
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You're a film director?

550
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
A few years ago,

551
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I was a rocket launcher.

552
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You're a good guy.

553
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'll pay you back.

554
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
They're a bunch of yakuza.

555
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
They're monsters.

556
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
They're trying to get the gyoza.

557
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Something's going to happen.

558
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
My bug is whispering.

559
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,900

560
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
He's going to play theifica.

561
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
To make gyoza for theghita.

562
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
He's a savior.

563
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Hetırimitone

564
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You're totally innocent.

565
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Let's dance to the music, one for both of us

566
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Let's throw our fat hands into the road

567
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
If we die, we'll all become beggars

568
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Let's live in a world of differences

569
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Laugh and laugh, oh yeah!

570
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I don't need any excuses

571
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'll protect the ones I love

572
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'll kill the ones I hate

573
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'll destroy the path of men

574
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'll eat them all!

575
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Let's run, you dirty bastard

576
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Run up to the road, put your life on the line

577
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Don't cry about the justice of the times

578
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Let's burn up again

579
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The dirty work of the world will eventually become a star

580
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
If it's going to become a star, then it'll shine in that sky

581
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Beyond the sun, become my beloved

582
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:51,000
