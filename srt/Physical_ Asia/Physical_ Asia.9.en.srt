00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,927
Subtitles are color-coded by country,
and this setting cannot be changed.

2
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,099
Let's go!

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,267
Okay, let's go.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,019
Let's do it, let's do it.

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,063
- Yes!
- What've we got?

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,483
What is this?

7
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,485
- Beats me.
- What are these?

8
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,446
- Is that ropes?
- What is this?

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,905
I think we're doing ropes.

10
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:31,990
There's boxes too.

11
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,080
What is this?

12
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,832
<i>Each lane had two ropes</i>

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,543
<i>attached to some kind of box.</i>

14
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,795
They're battle ropes.

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,005
More endurance?

16
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,799
It's another power game.

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,009
With a pulling motion.

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,679
<i>A dark room, and there's four lanes.</i>

19
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,640
<i>And I'm like, "There's gotta be more."</i>

20
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,517
What if we're standing on there?

21
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,811
What if our team's standing on this?

22
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,939
We're gonna have to
drag it across the thing?

23
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,524
Maybe it weighs like a ton or something.

24
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,154
So, it's endurance?

25
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,656
Or maybe… It's all resistance?

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,993
I don't know. Maybe someone
from the other team stands on the box

27
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,161
and we pull them?

28
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,537
That'd be a first.

29
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,748
Physical: Asia.

30
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,250
<i>- Your fourth quest is…</i>
- Listen up.

31
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,504
What's it gonna be?

32
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,841
<i>The battle rope relay.</i>

33
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,302
<i>The battle rope relay.</i>

34
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,096
Battle rope relay?

35
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,347
So it is a relay.

36
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,474
Oh, my God. Relay?

37
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,975
Battle rope relay.

38
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,860
- This is crazy.
- Oh, man.

39
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,737
This one is gonna be tough.

40
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,947
It's all in the arms.

41
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,573
Seems doable.

42
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,867
- You've gotta be kidding.
- That's gonna hurt.

43
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,038
It's a team game, isn't it?

44
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,083
<i>I've done similar</i>
<i>training exercises before.</i>

45
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,711
Even if they're not exact,
the familiarity puts me at ease.

46
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,465
<i>Battle ropes are actually</i>
<i>a frequent part of wrestling training</i>

47
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,883
<i>for the National Team.</i>

48
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,761
So, I'm familiar with them
and I'm really good at them.

49
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,140
If I had to bet on us winning one game,
this would be my pick.

50
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,809
- Oh, there's ropes? You've got this.
- Mmm.

51
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:26,521
I have done some battle ropes before.
A lot of stuff that is arm endurance,

KATELIN VAN ZYL
HYROX RACER

53
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,816
So I think I would still probably
be pretty decent.

54
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,109
It's tough on arms.

55
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,735
- But we're good, right?
- Yeah.

56
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,863
MMA fighters do this all the time.

57
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,575
In my experience, as an exercise,
it's very intimidating.

58
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,201
It's like ripping your arms off.

59
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,579
<i>In the battle rope relay,</i>

60
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,747
<i>contestants will</i>
<i>whip the ropes up and down</i>

61
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,377
<i>in order to strike the device</i>
<i>attached at the end of the rope.</i>

62
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,087
Oh, okay. We hit the red pads.

63
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,590
Stay consistent. Be precise!

64
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,924
Use both hands! Okay?

65
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,177
Use both of them! Just like that!

66
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,012
You've gotta hit the sensors!

67
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,974
<i>If the contestant fails to strike</i>
<i>the sensor with sufficient power,</i>

68
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,935
<i>the strike will not be counted</i>
<i>towards the total.</i>

69
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,520
Da-da-da-da-da!

70
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,023
Hit the sensor.

71
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,650
I see. So we're gonna
have to hit the sensor.

72
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,444
Bang, bang, bang.

73
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,613
- Or you could do twos.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,993
<i>Before we begin,</i>
<i>we will explain the participant rules.</i>

75
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,084
<i>For the battle rope relay,</i>
<i>the number of participants allowed…</i>

76
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,844
<i>will be limited to three.</i>

77
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,804
- Three?
- That's it?

78
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,181
Just three?

79
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,432
What? Only half?

80
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,060
What about the other three?

81
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,269
Do they just watch?

82
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,022
<i>The alarm bells started to go off</i>
<i>in my head.</i>

83
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,982
I mean, it's a relay race.
It's a team game.

84
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,359
So why cut half the team?

85
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,610
Three people.

86
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,154
That seemed very intentional.
There had to be a reason.

87
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,656
<i>I just didn't know what it was.</i>

88
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,284
<i>Only one teammate can compete at a time.</i>

89
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,577
<i>Once their time is up,</i>

90
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,081
<i>they will switch to the next person</i>
<i>in the predetermined order.</i>

91
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,209
<i>Each turn will last one minute.</i>

92
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,463
- All right. One minute?
- That's gonna hurt real bad.

93
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,717
<i>I typically do some rope training</i>
<i>before every judo match.</i>

94
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,511
SOICHI HASHIMOTO
NATIONAL TEAM JUDO FIGHTER

95
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,013
But normally, I do 20, maybe 30 seconds,
so I don't burn out.

96
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,557
That's a long time.

97
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,686
<i>This game was gonna be</i>
<i>excruciating to play.</i>

98
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,481
- It's going to come down to fitness, so…
- And strength.

99
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,857
<i>When it's time to switch,</i>

100
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,152
<i>we will announce "change"</i>
<i>over the speaker.</i>

101
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,657
<i>You must then switch out</i>
<i>within ten seconds.</i>

102
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,409
Change, change.

103
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,912
<i>This game will consist of two rounds.</i>

104
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,041
<i>The duration of the first round is</i>
<i>five minutes.</i>

105
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,919
So two of us go twice.

106
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:59,424
<i>In the first round,</i>
<i>all four countries will compete.</i>

107
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,593
<i>But in the second round,</i>
<i>only the top two countries will compete.</i>

108
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,847
Sick.

109
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,518
<i>The duration of the second round is</i>
<i>four minutes.</i>

110
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,396
One of us goes twice.

111
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,065
<i>At the end of round two,</i>

112
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,569
<i>the team who manages to score</i>
<i>the most points during that round</i>

113
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,487
<i>will be declared the winner.</i>

114
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,493
<i>Among the four competing teams, the team</i>
<i>that manages to take first place…</i>

115
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,335
<i>will advance directly to the fifth quest.</i>

116
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,753
Wow.

117
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,963
- Ah.
- Oh.

118
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,673
Oh.

119
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,050
Directly.

120
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,218
Go straight to the fifth quest.

121
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,512
The other three teams will
have to play again.

122
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,805
What a sick challenge.

123
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,307
- Yeah.
- Fun.

124
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,934
It's probably another Death Match.

125
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,354
Between the three-participant limit

126
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,231
and announcing that only
the winning team gets to advance,

127
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,610
they were definitely setting us up
for an elimination game.

128
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,780
So the only way to survive
is to win the game, right?

129

KIM MIN-JAE
SSIREUM WRESTLER

130
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,825
If we came in first place here,
it'd be like winning the jackpot.

131
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,287
<i>Contestants, please take a moment</i>
<i>to meet with your team</i>

132
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,414
<i>and hold a brief strategy meeting.</i>

133
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,751
<i>You must decide who is participating</i>
<i>and in what order.</i>

134
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,921
Just clean up. Just absolutely
decimate in this first one.

135
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,506
So we need our strongest.

136
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,757
- Right.
- You three.

137
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,509
You, you, you. What do you think?

138
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,885
What do you think?

139
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,261
Yeah.

140
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,971
- Sweet, let's do that.
- Yep.

141
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,934
<i>My mind's always</i>
<i>a little bit skeptical. If we did lose…</i>

ALEXANDRA
FITNESS COACH

143
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,604
…whether we should keep one boy out

144
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,565
just in case of what the next thing is.

145
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,109
There's gonna be something.

146
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,111
Yeah, there's going to be
something for after this.

147
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,529
<i>I'm not overawed at all.</i>

148
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,697
<i>I've got full confidence</i>
<i>and faith in my team.</i>

149
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,990
ELONI VUNAKECE
FORMER RUGBY PLAYER

150
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,369
So, we're gonna go for it. We're gonna
send in our biggest and fastest guys

151
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:56,374
<i>who are gonna be able to win us the most</i>
<i>amount of repetitions for this quest.</i>

152
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,127
'Cause that's how we picked our side.

153
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,753
Gotta go straight to quest five.

154
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,173
Are you good at this?

155
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,466
I do it for training.

156
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,552
I think we should put Nonoka in there.

157
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,389
We had to consider what would happen
if we didn't win,

158
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,015
and needed to play the next game.

159
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,602
<i>If both trios weren't well-balanced,</i>
<i>we could disadvantage ourselves.</i>

160
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,064
So then, as we were discussing
whether Nonoka should play or not…

161
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,113
- What's Australia doing?
- Hey, wait. Look over there. Whittaker.

162
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,614
They've got an all-male team.

163
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,074
- Three guys?
- Looks like it.

164
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,120
<i>Australia had a very obvious strategy.</i>

165
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,915
Just judging by their lineup,
they wanted maximum power.

166
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,835
<i>That's why they picked</i>
<i>their heavy-hitters, including Whittaker.</i>

167
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,754
<i>And while I knew we had</i>
<i>the man power to compete with that,</i>

168
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,256
<i>doing so would be risky.</i>

169
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,847
I think Australia's
banking on their big guys.

170
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,141
They're trying to win as fast as possible.

171
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:59,562
But it's a poor strategy. There's a
75 chance we'll be up for elimination.

172
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,105
We need to prepare for that.

173
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,608
We shouldn't just put all our strongest
in this game.

174
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,784
Remember, they're trying to take
the lazy way out,

175
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,579
but we know better.
You've just gotta be patient.

176
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,457
Okay. Patience, endurance and speed.

177
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,917
<i>Ultimately, we ended up…</i>

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,543
DULGUUN ENKHBAT
NATIONAL TEAM BASKETBALL PLAYER

179
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,128
<i>…swapping Orkhonbayar with Ochir.</i>

180
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,048
<i>We thought he'd would do well</i>
<i>with his stamina and upper body strength.</i>

181
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,175
<i>So Ochir would go first,</i>

182
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,927
<i>Enkh-Orgil second</i>

183
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,428
<i>and Dulguun third.</i>

184
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,850
<i>That way, I can be on standby</i>
<i>if we end up having to play another game.</i>

185
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,270
Australia has their own strategy,
and we have ours.

186
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,732
All right, huddle up.

187
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,359
Australia's team is stacked.

188
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,986
It's Eloni, Whittaker and Eddie.

189
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,741
With those three,
Australia's gonna be tough to beat.

190
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,244
<i>Objectively,</i>
<i>when looking at all the teams,</i>

191
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,746
Australia's team had the most power.

192
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,997
I knew they could win this.

193
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,875
I just didn't know
what would happen to us if they did.

194
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,546
It's driving me crazy.

195
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,881
Do we copy them, or is that a bad idea?

196
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,008
Would it be a guaranteed win?

197
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,885
I know it's a hard pill to swallow.

198
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,889
But realistically?
We can't match their power.

199
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,724
So this is gonna be a tough one.

200
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,936
<i>This concludes the strategy meeting.</i>

201
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,273
<i>Battle rope relay contestants,</i>

202
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,318
<i>please make your way</i>
<i>to your team's designated lane.</i>

203
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,406
LANES WERE DETERMINED
BY DRAWING LOTS

204
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,243
<i>Lane one: Australia.</i>

205
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,956
<i>Eloni Vunakece, Robert Whittaker</i>

206
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,416
<i>and Eddie Williams.</i>

207
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,753
<i>I don't see how we lose this.</i>

208
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,964
Let's go, boys!

209
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,966
- Bring it home.
- Come on. Q5.

210
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,259
Let's go straight there.

211
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,349
<i>We're good at this.</i>
<i>We know we have what it takes to do this.</i>

212
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,684
<i>We're very confident.</i>

213
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,942
<i>Lane Two: Mongolia.</i>

214
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,571
<i>Lkhagva-Ochir Erdene-Ochir,</i>

215
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,575
<i>Enkh-Orgil Baatarkhuu and Dulguun Enkhbat.</i>

216
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,288
Stay strong! You can do it!

217
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,831
Believe in yourselves!

218
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>The key to victory is strategy.</i>

219
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,669
<i>You can't just rely on power.</i>

220
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,589
<i>You have to pick the people</i>
<i>who have the best skills for the job.</i>

221
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,091
Nobody stands a chance against you three.

222
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,011
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>you should expect the unexpected.</i>

223
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:41,098
<i>We may not be the strongest,</i>
<i>but we're gonna stand tall and win.</i>

224
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,189
<i>Lane Three: Korea.</i>

225
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,072
<i>Yun Sung-bin, Choi Seung-yeon</i>
<i>and Jang Eun-sil.</i>

226
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,449
Let's go, Team Korea!

227
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,910
They've got two girls.

228
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,748
<i>I found it interesting</i>
<i>that Korea put up two girls.</i>

229
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,043
<i>Eventually, we settled on a plan.</i>

230
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,795
So this is gonna be a tough one.

231
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,756
Only three of us are gonna be
in the first game.

232
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,676
<i>At this point in the competition,</i>
<i>nobody would be sitting out.</i>

233
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,345
We need to prioritize the second game.

234
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,808
Why should we go all out in the first game
if we weren't gonna win?

235
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,059
<i>We had to be smart.</i>

236
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,646
<i>And that's why we sent out Seung-yeon,</i>
<i>Eun-sil and Sung-bin.</i>

237
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,150
<i>No matter the challenge,</i>
<i>we've always come out the other side.</i>

238
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,777
<i>So I had faith in our team.</i>

239
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,326
<i>Lane Four: Japan.</i>

240
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,706
Soichi Hashimoto, Yoshio Itoi

241
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,541
- and Yushin Okami.
- Let's go!

242
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,878
<i>Well, you know, at the end of the day,</i>

243
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,589
<i>we decided it was too crucial of a match.</i>

244
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:01,345
If we wanted to be the champions, we had
no other choice but to beat Australia.

245
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,849
We were already facing them,
so why wouldn't we go for it?

246
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,016
Let's give it a shot.

247
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,768
<i>Nobody's invincible,</i>

248
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,270
<i>and we wanted to prove it.</i>

249
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,023
<i>So our team decided</i>
<i>that Soichi, Itoi and I would play,</i>

250
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,193
<i>even though we suspected there'd be</i>
<i>some kind of Death Match if we lost.</i>

251
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,406
<i>We are strong individuals</i>
<i>who are stronger together.</i>

252
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,784
<i>And it's our combined strength</i>
<i>that will lead us to victory.</i>

253
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,253
<i>Battle rope relay: round one.</i>

254
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,603
<i>The game will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

255
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,569
<i>Ready…</i>

256
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,489
Grab the ropes.

257
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,308
PHYSICAL: ASIA

258
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,772
9. INESCAPABLE HELL

259
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,816
<i>Ready.</i>

260
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,363
Go!

261
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,114
Good, good! Nice.

262
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,784
Come on, Loni, let's go!

263
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,661
Yes, keep that pace!

264
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,621
Okay.

265
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,998
All right, Sung-bin!

266
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,375
Good, good, good.

267
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,462
You got it. Good!
Keep it going. That's right.

268
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,383
You're doing great!

269
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,343
- Good job, brother!
- You monster!

270
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,304
- Keep up the pace!
- Just keep it up!

271
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,723
Come on! Keep up the pace! Keep it up!

272
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,933
Loni, keep up the pace!

273
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,356
- See how he's pulling tight on it?
- Yep.

274
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,191
Yeah, that's it, just pull tight on it.

275
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,443
Perfect! Just like that, man.

276
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,153
<i>It felt really weird.</i>

277
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,614
<i>I was using my body weight,</i>
<i>which made my body shake.</i>

278
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,451
<i>And as I kept whipping the ropes,</i>
<i>the momentum kept pulling me forward.</i>

279
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,412
Nice, Sung-bin!

280
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,582
<i>It was extremely challenging.</i>
<i>I'd never done this before,</i>

281
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,084
so I was surprised at
how heavy the ropes were.

282
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,504
I didn't know how long it would take
for my body to start feeling the strain,

283
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,215
<i>so I wasn't sure how to pace myself.</i>

284
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,843
Let's go, faster!

285
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,761
<i>Since I was the first one on the ropes,</i>

286
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,223
<i>I felt like the pressure was on me</i>
<i>to set us up for success.</i>

287
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,895
<i>So I jumped. I dove right in.</i>
<i>My arms were flying as fast as they could.</i>

288
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,951
He's getting tired.

289
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,454
<i>As soon as I hit the halfway point,</i>

290
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,206
<i>it felt like my arms were completely</i>
<i>detached from my body.</i>

291
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,709
<i>My biceps were completely destroyed.</i>

292
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,502
So, to try and compensate,

293
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,465
I started using my shoulders
and swinging the ropes simultaneously.

294
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,467
<i>Slower, but it gives my arms a rest</i>

295
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,886
<i>to rip in back</i>
<i>to the single-arm technique.</i>

296
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,225
Itoi. They're all doing this.

297
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,982
You might want to do that too if
you're burning out. But wait until then.

298
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,443
<i>I wanted to help,</i>
<i>but all I could do on the sidelines</i>

299
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,030
<i>was analyze the other teams</i>
<i>and try to share anything I found useful.</i>

300
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,990
<i>It was a frustrating position to be in.</i>

301
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,993
Good rhythm! Good rhythm, Loni!

302
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,995
Twenty seconds! You're almost there!

303
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,623
- Seventeen seconds!
- Okay, lift!

304
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,085
- Stay there till I tell ya!
- Stay there, stay there!

305
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,587
- C'mon, Ochir! Just a little bit more!
- Go! Ten seconds left!

306
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,214
Go, go! Push, push!

307
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,465
Nine seconds!

308
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,509
Come on!

309
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,969
Six, five…

310
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,137
Four, three…

311
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,014
Two, one! Okay!

312
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,599
- Hey, hey.
- <i>Change.</i>

313
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,393
<i>Change.</i>

314
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,728
- Switch!
- Change! Change!

315
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,980
Go, go, go!

316
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,316
Move, move!

317
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,698
<i>I knew I had to do it again,</i>
<i>but I wasn't sure I could.</i>

318
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,242
That's it, that's it. Feel the…

319
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,577
Yeah, nice, Robbie!

320
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,287
Rob, holy shit!

321
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,497
Oh, my God!

322
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,417
His speed was phenomenal when watching.

323
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,293
<i>Just spectacular to watch as well.</i>

324
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,671
- That's it!
- That's good.

325
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,964
Whittaker's really good.

326
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,633
<i>Team Australia was mesmerizing to watch.</i>

327
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>You could hardly see their ropes.</i>

328
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,139
<i>It looked like they were going</i>
<i>twice as fast as we were.</i>

329
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,559
Look at Mongolia's MMA guy.
He's just incredible.

330
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,521
<i>He's just this unshakable force of nature,</i>

331
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,356
<i>and it's exciting to see him in action.</i>

332
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,774
<i>He was going so fast,</i>

333
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,152
<i>it looked like we had</i>
<i>a real chance of winning.</i>

334
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,946
You're a machine! An absolute machine.

335
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,489
Itoi's really fast.

336
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,783
Nice pace! Just keep it going!

337
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,328
<i>At the start, it looked like</i>
<i>I wasn't always hitting the sensor.</i>

338
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,788
So I tucked my arms in…

339
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,500
<i>like this, which allowed me</i>
<i>to better control my hits,</i>

340
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,835
<i>with increased speed too.</i>

341
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,212
Very nice, Itoi! There you go!

342
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,008
Smaller movements, Seung-yeon!

343
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,969
Very nice work, my friend.

344
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,846
That's it, use both hands.

345
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,556
Rip it, Rob!

346
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,641
Keep going, keep going!

347
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,939
- Thirty seconds! You're halfway! Let's go!
- Thirty seconds, Rob!

348
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,777
Thirty seconds! Come on!

349
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,695
You're killing it! Orgil, come on!

350
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,072
Keep up your form!

351
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,867
<i>At one point,</i>
<i>I turned to look at the clock.</i>

352
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,871
<i>I thought I was halfway done,</i>
<i>but it had only been maybe five seconds?</i>

353
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,706
<i>Time passed really slowly.</i>

354
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,374
Come on! All or nothing!

355
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,545
You've got it, you've got it, boy.
That's it. Just keep that going.

356
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,674
<i>Honestly,</i>
<i>the one minute didn't feel that long.</i>

357
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,177
<i>But it was a sprint, it was tiring.</i>

358
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,848
<i>I could feel my body start to slow down,</i>

359
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,726
<i>but if my speed slowed,</i>
<i>then our score would be lower.</i>

360
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,147
<i>It was really, really tough.</i>

361
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,901
<i>I was screaming, "Wake up! Wake up!</i>
<i>Seriously, wake up!" in my head.</i>

362
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,071
<i>I really had to rely on my mental strength</i>
<i>to get myself through it.</i>

363
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,407
- Let's push through!
- Think of the win!

364
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,617
Ten more seconds!

365
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,745
Nine, eight, seven…

366
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,622
Six, five…

367
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,207
Four, three…

368
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,292
Two, one!

369
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,002
- Go, go, go!
- <i>Change.</i>

370
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,087
Change!

371
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,380
<i>Change.</i>

372
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,341
- <i>Change.</i>
- Hey! That's time.

373
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,385
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

374
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,053
Nice, nice, nice!

375
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,306
Let's go, Eun-sil!

376
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,516
You got this!

377
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,976
That's it!

378
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,270
Yeah, let's go!

379
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,526
Go, go, go!

380
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,194
Good shit, good shit.

381
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,529
Take us home!

382
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,448
Come on, Eddie, take us home! Yes!

383
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,617
- He's fast.
- He's just unbelievable.

384
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,703
He won't even budge.

385
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,205
- Smashing it, Eddie.
- Come on, Eddie!

386
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,959
<i>It was not only pulling</i>
<i>the ropes up and down.</i>

387
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,754
<i>It was making sure</i>
<i>that the rope was hitting the bar.</i>

388
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,590
<i>So, we just gave it our all.</i>

389
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,966
Yeah, that's the one.

390
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,051
That's it, Okami.
Find your pace and keep it steady!

391
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,012
Control your breathing! Try go faster!

392
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,931
<i>It was exhausting,</i>
<i>but I couldn't let my team down.</i>

393
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,393
<i>I only had one minute</i>
<i>to try and score as much as possible,</i>

394
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,479
<i>and that meant hitting the sensors</i>
<i>as many times as I could.</i>

395
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,358
<i>I couldn't afford to slow down.</i>
<i>I had to keep pushing.</i>

396
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,027
<i>I could rest when time was up.</i>

397
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,862
Way to go, man! Way to go!

398
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,906
- C'mon, keep going!
- Nice!

399
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,033
Hang on till the end. You can do it.

400
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,534
Awesome job!

401
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,786
- Nice!
- Thirty seconds.

402
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,332
<i>I could taste blood in my mouth.</i>

403
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,709
<i>Oh, it's tough.</i>

404
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,129
<i>For a big guy, who's got</i>
<i>a lot of muscle on my hands,</i>

405
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,006
<i>it burns very quickly.</i>

406
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,509
<i>So, it gets so heavy,</i>
<i>it feels like I got metal arms.</i>

407
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,470
Yes!

408
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,222
Yeah! Keep going.

409
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,015
<i>My hands were worn and shaky.</i>

410
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,769
<i>But I had no intention of</i>
<i>letting go of those ropes.</i>

411
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,437
- Q5!
- Everything here!

412
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,147
Ten! Last ten!

413
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,149
Eight, seven…

414
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,068
Five seconds!

415
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,237
Four, three…

416
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,405
Two, one! Okay!

417
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,909
- <i>Change.</i>
- Change!

418
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,744
- <i>Change.</i>
- Change!

419
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,080
Let's go, transition, transition.

420
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,124
Go, Loni! Let's take us home!

421
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,335
Come on, all here, everything here!

422
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,837
Man, Australia is insane.

423
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,216
Good job, bro.

424
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,262
Watch your left side!
It's not making contact!

425
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:10,269
<i>It didn't seem to be</i>
<i>hitting the sensor, which was bad.</i>

426
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,938
- Okay!
- Okay.

427
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,234
- Let's go!
- You've got it, Hashimoto!

428
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,070
Keep fighting! Use your momentum!

429
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,740
- Let's keep up the support!
- Let's keep it going, Ochir!

430
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,202
Wait, tell him to go faster.
We need speed. You gotta speed up!

431
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,329
Come on, Eloni, keep going!

432
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,539
Am I good?

433
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,748
You have contact.

434
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,877
<i>Round one was all about speed, and round</i>
<i>two was all about hitting those sensors.</i>

435
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,839
<i>He's a judoka with a very small physique,</i>

436
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,799
<i>but his body control was astounding.</i>

437
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,718
<i>I wish I'd focused more on that.</i>

438
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,596
Sung-bin, you've gotta use
your whole body! Come on!

439
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,433
<i>Honestly, I wasn't</i>
<i>really listening to anyone.</i>

440
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,060
All I cared about was staying alive
and whipping that rope.

441
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,979
<i>You're praying to the laws of motion,</i>

442
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,148
<i>like, "As long as</i>
<i>I don't let go of the rope,</i>

443
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,191
<i>my body will move,</i>
<i>and I'll get to the end."</i>

444
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,028
Good shit.

445
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,905
- Yeah, boy, ride it, ride it.
- Come on, Eloni!

446
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,660
<i>It was probably the hardest one, because…</i>

447
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,329
<i>20-second mark with plenty of energy,</i>

448
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,123
<i>and then boom,</i>
<i>it punches you square in the face.</i>

449
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,459
<i>Better to release all the energy</i>

450
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,878
<i>in the hope of winning</i>
<i>than holding anything back.</i>

451
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,172
Thirty seconds left, Eloni!

452
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,507
C'mon, keep it up, keep it up!

453
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,633
Lighter movements!

454
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,179
Tighten it up a bit. You got it!

455
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,805
- Come on, come on!
- Yeah!

456
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,599
Go, go, go, go! Don't stop!

457
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,479
C'mon! Let's show 'em!

458
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,688
Everyone's tired!

459
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,857
So don't give up now. You can do it!

460
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,239
No, no! Why are you stopping?

461
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,743
<i>At that point, you just think,</i>
<i>"What now? What are we gonna do?"</i>

462
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,539
Keep going, keep going. Go, go, go!

463
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,376
I was really afraid
of giving up from exhaustion.

464
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,420
<i>So I promised myself that,</i>
<i>even if I was doing terribly,</i>

465
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,256
<i>I had to keep going, no matter what.</i>

466
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,009
Only 20 seconds left!

467
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,845
<i>To be honest, I was really anxious</i>
<i>watching them.</i>

468
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,723
<i>But I needed them to do well,</i>
<i>so I just kept cheering.</i>

469
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,601
<i>I just wanted to get through</i>
<i>the first round,</i>

470
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,686
<i>so we could prepare for the second round.</i>

471
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,980
Come on! Let's show 'em!

472
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,862
<i>That one minute was the most</i>
<i>painful minute of my life.</i>

473
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,115
Sung-bin, ten seconds left!

474
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,451
<i>At some point, I stopped trying</i>
<i>to push him and just gave him the time.</i>

475
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,538
<i>He'd pushed himself far enough.</i>
<i>I didn't want to make it worse.</i>

476
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,749
That's it! Yeah, nice!

477
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,000
Let's go!

478
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,919
Go, go, go!

479
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,712
Nine, eight…

480
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,091
- Just a little bit more!
- Keep it moving!

481
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,843
Four, three…

482
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,803
Two, one!

483
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,971
Switch!

484
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,806
- <i>Change.</i>
- Go, go, go!

485
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,142
<i>Change.</i>

486
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,936
- <i>Change.</i>
- You're good, Ochir!

487
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,646
Last minute, boys. Last minute!

488
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,189
- <i>Change.</i>
- Last one!

489
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,566
Good job!

490
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,068
Come on, Rob! Rip in!

491
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,570
Rob! Rip in!

492
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,951
Seung-yeon!

493
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,120
- Fight on!
- Yeah!

494
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,997
You've got it, Itoi.

495
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,666
Ten seconds in, 50 to go.

496
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:23,044
Come on!
All the way home, all the way home.

497
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,838
Just keep moving, no matter what.

498
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,340
You're doing great!

499
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,719
All or nothing! All or nothing!

500
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,891
<i>So in my second go around, in round one,</i>

501
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,143
<i>I didn't start with the alternating whips</i>

502
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,354
<i>because the lactic acid</i>
<i>just hadn't moved enough.</i>

503
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:45,066
<i>I needed to use different muscles,</i>
<i>I needed to use a more body approach</i>

504
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,735
<i>so that I could keep…</i>

505
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,862
When you go,
copy Whittaker and use your body.

506
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,198
- Got it.
- Yeah, Mongolia's doing it too.

507
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,408
Great! Keep it up!

508
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,285
<i>Enkh-Orgil did an incredible job.</i>

509
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,954
<i>He maintained his momentum</i>
<i>by using his legs,</i>

510
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,625
<i>even though the use of body weight</i>
<i>was probably more exhausting.</i>

511
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,669
Twenty seconds!

512
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,463
Twenty to go!

513
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,466
All right, 15 seconds!

514
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,967
Let's go.

515
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,387
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

516
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,140
Keep going, keep going!

517
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,769
- Just a few more seconds!
- Four, three…

518
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,772
- Two, one! Okay!
- Okay!

519
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,403
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

520
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,782
- Good effort, boys. Good effort.
- Good effort.

521
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,661
Recover.
We've got another round after this.

522
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,623
<i>I was so physically tired,</i>

523
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,251
<i>I was actively trying my best</i>
<i>not to vomit.</i>

524
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,839
Nice job, Seung-yeon!

525
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,384
<i>Out of all the challenges</i>
<i>I've faced in this competition,</i>

526
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,302
this one was the most brutal.

527
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,264
- I'm gonna pass out.
- Great job, guys!

528
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,015
Keep it up!

529
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,684
- I'm so exhausted, man.
- Good job.

530
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,851
You killed it!

531
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,271
It's harder than I thought.

532
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,606
Nice work, guys.

533
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,528
<i>…that I've ever done</i>
<i>and it felt like an eternity.</i>

534
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,405
<i>Out of this world, but it was, yeah,</i>

535
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,533
the hardest iteration of battle ropes
that I've ever done in my life.

536
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,160
Man, so much emotion.
I'm just like, "f***."

537
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,666
Proud of you guys. Proud of you.
Absolutely drilled it.

538
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,876
<i>Doing battle ropes for a minute</i>

539
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,962
<i>is way harder than people think</i>

540
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,715
<i>and it takes a lot of muscular endurance.</i>

541
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,010
<i>Everyone out there</i>
<i>had incredible power and speed.</i>

542
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,221
<i>Here are the results for round one.</i>

543
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,062
<i>As a reminder,</i>
<i>only the first and second place countries</i>

544
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,231
<i>will be advancing to the next round.</i>

545
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,360
It's okay. We'll be fine.

546
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,030
Yeah, I hope so. Let's just see.

547
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,075
<i>The first country</i>
<i>to advance to the next round…</i>

548
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,416
<i>In first place…</i>

549
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,798
<i>with 1,336 points is Team Australia.</i>

550
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,302
Yes, boys! Come on!

551
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,512
- Q5 is on the cards.
- Let's go!

552
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,140
<i>Hearing the scores just blew our minds.</i>

553
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,267
We're a strong team.
I saw how hard everyone was ripping in,

554
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,979
and it makes me, yeah,
really proud to be on the leaderboard.

555
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,397
That's crazy.

556
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,566
- Oh, man…
- They're too strong.

557
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,318
<i>I mean, they're impressive.</i>

558
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,696
It's just another reminder
of how strong they actually are.

559
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,114
<i>In fourth place…</i>

560
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,535
<i>is Team Korea, with 763 points.</i>

561
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,371
Yeah, we had no chance.

562
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,415
- Proud of you two.
- We did good. Come here.

563
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,584
- Really good job.
- We did great.

564
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,212
<i>I held out hope</i>
<i>that we'd at least get third,</i>

565
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:55,090
<i>but as soon as I heard the scores,</i>
<i>I thought, "Ah."</i>

566
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,301
<i>At the very least, I can take some comfort</i>

567
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,513
in knowing it's not really
anyone's individual fault.

568
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,559
It's okay.
Hopefully we made the right choice.

569
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,481
<i>We will now announce the scores</i>
<i>and placements of the final two teams.</i>

570
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,776
<i>Second place: 1,194 points.</i>

571
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,695
<i>Third place: 1,143 points.</i>

572
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,029
Wow…

573
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,156
<i>The margin was razor thin.</i>

574
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,033
<i>Either one of us could've pulled ahead.</i>

575
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:26,413
<i>If we win, we get to advance, and</i>
<i>we don't have to stress about elimination.</i>

576
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,456
<i>In second place…</i>

577
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,127
<i>Please! Please, please</i>
<i>let Team Japan be second place.</i>

578
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,170
<i>I thought we did very well for ourselves,</i>

579
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,881
<i>so of course I thought we placed second.</i>

580
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,342
<i>In second place…</i>

581
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,348
<i>is Team Japan.</i>

582
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,560
- All right!
- Fantastic!

583
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,311
That was really close.

584
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,480
- It must've been right near the end there.
- Oh, no.

585
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,733
<i>In third place is Team Mongolia.</i>

586
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,736
<i>I thought we'd at least done</i>

587
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,780
<i>well enough to beat Korea and Japan.</i>

588
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,116
As for why we got third…

589
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,952
<i>It was my fault. I was really slow,</i>

590
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,747
<i>and I didn't perform as well</i>
<i>as I thought I could.</i>

591
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,331
<i>I let my team down.</i>

592
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,460
And so for that,
I'd like to apologize to them.

593
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,880
We smashed them by 200, easy. Easy.

594
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,673
Physically, there is no one
that can beat us.

595
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,468
<i>So with the results of round one,</i>

596
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,137
it gave us the confidence
going into round two.

597
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,473
We knew they had more in them and…

598
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,850
Hey, no risk, no reward, right?

599
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,104
<i>Look, we knew</i>
<i>how strong Team Australia was.</i>

600
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,482
<i>But we came here to win this competition.</i>

601
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,276
<i>So losing just wasn't an option.</i>

602
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,404
We couldn't afford
to consider that possibility.

603
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,656
We just had to win it.

604
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,500
<i>Battle rope relay: round two.</i>

605
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,254
<i>The match time is four minutes.</i>

606
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,883
Everything we have here, all on the table.

607
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,385
Come on! Again, all or nothing!

608
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,262
Everything we've worked for.

609
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,515
<i>We're banking on winning this event.</i>

610
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,350
Same tech, guys. Same tech.

611
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,393
- We wanna do same setup then.
- Sweet.

612
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,437
<i>We had such success with the first one</i>

613
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,024
that we thought let's just keep it
the same and just strive for victory,

614
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,818
strive for number one.

615
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,570
<i>So we're gonna throw</i>
<i>everything that we've got at this</i>

616
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,739
<i>and, uh, that's what we're banking on.</i>

617
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,658
I'm betting it all on this.

618
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,453
Itoi, if you're up for it,
you should go first.

619
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,499
I think you were the most consistent
with scoring, and you had great technique.

620
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,042
He really killed it.

621
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,545
<i>After that first round, I think all of us</i>

622
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:42,382
<i>realized that Itoi was the stand-out</i>
<i>in the battle rope game.</i>

623
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,635
<i>So for round two,</i>
<i>we decided to send him out twice.</i>

624
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,262
I'm sorry you have to go twice.

625
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:51,099
<i>I knew that Australia was</i>
<i>probably feeling pretty confident,</i>

626
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,851
<i>but they looked almost complacent.</i>

627
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,271
<i>So I thought, "Why not</i>
<i>take advantage of the situation?"</i>

628
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,690
<i>If they're going to underestimate us,</i>

629
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,191
<i>then we're going to win.</i>

630
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,903
<i>The match will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

631
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,864
Whoo! Come on!

632
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,575
- Let's go, guys. You've got this.
- Let's show 'em!

633
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,952
Straight through, boys. Straight through.

634
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,161
<i>Stand by.</i>

635
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,080
You can win this. Give it your all.

636
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,373
Everything here.

637
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,334
All right!

638
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,671
<i>Ready…</i>

639
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,839
Let's rip in, boys!

640
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,923
Come on!

641
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,351
- Let's go, Itoi!
- Nice, nice!

642
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,520
- Keep it up!
- Let's go!

643
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,400
- Eloni, let's go! One minute!
- Let's go! One full minute!

644
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,693
That's it, Els.

645
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,362
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Lock in, lock in, lock in.

646
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,115
Let's push, let's push.

647
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,700
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

648
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,119
- That's it.
- Let's go.

649
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,704
<i>We've got some history between Japan,</i>

650
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,957
<i>and we've crushed them before,</i>
<i>and that's what we're gonna do here.</i>

651
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,542
<i>We're gonna crush them again.</i>

652
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,588
Let's go, let's go!

653
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,548
<i>I could hear my teammates cheering,</i>

654
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,550
<i>"You can do it! We're counting on you!"</i>

655
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:11,471
<i>And hearing those words, knowing that they</i>
<i>believed in me, made me fight even harder.</i>

656
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,847
<i>I wasn't gonna let them down.</i>

657
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,433
Let's show them what this old man can do.

658
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,937
Itoi's strong.

659
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,480
How is he so good?

660
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,814
Especially at his age.

661
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,358
Twenty!

662
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,817
Twenty seconds!

663
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,403
- Let's go, come on!
- Let's go, Eloni!

664
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,238
Everything, I want everything!

665
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,115
You can do it!

666
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,451
Keep lifting! Don't slow down!

667
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,788
As fast as you can!
Come on, last ten seconds!

668
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,499
Come on, Loni! Hold it, hold it!

669
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,584
Win this for us! Win this for us!

670
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,379
Five, four, three…

671
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,090
- Two, one!
- Switch out!

672
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,174
<i>Change.</i>

673
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,717
Change, go, go, go, go!

674
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,178
<i>Change.</i>

675
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,058
- Rip in, Rob! Rip in!
- Yeah! Come on, Rob!

676
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,269
Go faster, Rob!

677
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,897
Wow, Whittaker's crazy.

678
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,482
Man, just look at him go.

679
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,901
- That's insane.
- He's a monster.

680
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,697
Look at Whittaker.

681
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,073
He's gonna whip up dust.

682
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,033
- Seriously, look at that! It's incredible.
- Yeah.

683
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,328
I mean, the faster you are, the more
you score. There's no beating that.

684
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,668
As I look over at the Japan Team,
I see they're definitely slowing down.

685
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,295
We beat them in the first round.
We'll beat them in the second.

686
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,756
<i>Australia was going</i>
<i>much faster than we were,</i>

687
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,717
<i>but I guess that's no surprise.</i>

688
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,802
<i>I knew they were faster than us,</i>

689
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,846
<i>but that didn't really bother me at all.</i>

690
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,015
<i>Sure, I wanted to go as fast as I could.</i>

691
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,518
<i>But if I was going too fast to hit</i>
<i>the sensors, I'd be screwing us over.</i>

692
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,353
<i>There was no sense in rushing.</i>

693
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,481
- Keep raising the score, Okami!
- Steady, pace yourself.

694
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,816
Keep it up!

695
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:51,279
This is your last minute!
This is your last minute!

696
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,031
Go into the dark place!

697
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,950
Rip in, rip in, rip in!

698
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,915
Japan's done.

699
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,459
No, I don't think so.

700
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,835
It's too close to call.

701
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,338
- But they slowed down.
- Twenty seconds.

702
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,758
But it's gonna
come down to Eloni and Itoi,

703
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,551
and Itoi has more stamina.

704
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,181
Ten! Go, go, go!

705
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,183
Look at Whittaker. This guy's insane.

706
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,893
He just started whipping it like crazy.

707
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,897
He's alternating
between the waves and this…

708
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,733
Ten! Go, go, go!

709
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,818
Seven! Six!

710
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,321
Five, four, three,

711
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,281
two, one!

712
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,742
- Good shit, Rob! Good shit!
- <i>Change.</i>

713
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,826
Good!

714
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,911
Now, now, now!

715
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,413
<i>Change.</i>

716
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,751
Yeah!

717
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,337
- Wow!
- He's so fast.

718
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,713
- Seriously.
- Look at that.

719
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,757
- He's not even moving.
- He's like some kind of machine!

720
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,426
He's just standing there. That's crazy.

721
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,596
<i>And then Eddie comes in</i>
<i>and backs us up with that speed.</i>

722
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,141
<i>We were on form, on fire,</i>
<i>and they represented.</i>

723
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,226
<i>Proud of the guys.</i>

724
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,979
Just keep up the pace.

725
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,692
<i>I just focused on concentrating</i>
<i>all of my power, all of my strength,</i>

726
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,237
<i>everything, on whipping those ropes.</i>

727
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,697
- Check out Japan!
- Dude, look. Look at him go.

728
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,407
There's no way!

729
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,535
Come on, Soichi! Keep it up!

730
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,331
Hey. I think Eddie's slowing down.

731
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,876
<i>Pump your arms,</i>
<i>and they just get so heavy.</i>

732
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,920
<i>It's like sand's filling up in your hands.</i>

733
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,255
<i>And it gets harder.</i>

734
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,132
Japan's faster!

735
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,675
- I'm serious, look!
- Keep lifting!

736
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,718
Just breathe! Everything here!

737
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,762
Thirty seconds. You're halfway done!

738
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,058
Come on, Eddie, this is your last bit!

739
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,561
- Keep pushing yourself, but be careful!
- Come on, Soichi!

740
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,146
This is your last bit!

741
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,230
Last 20 seconds!

742
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,649
- It's gonna be a toss-up.
- Absolutely.

743
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,025
We'll have to see.

744
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,946
- Get it.
- You're doing great, keep going!

745
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:00,992
- For the fam, G! Come on!
- Six, five, four…

746
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,953
Three, two, one!

747
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,205
<i>Change.</i>

748
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,082
<i>Change.</i>

749
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,005
Longevity!

750
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,507
Let's go!

751
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,092
- Straight to the end!
- Go!

752
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,969
You can do it!

753
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,224
- What do you think?
- Let's go, Itoi!

754
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,976
- Keep it up!
- I think it might be Japan.

755
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,061
Come on!

756
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,106
Man, I think it's still too close to call.

757
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,902
You're nearly done! Bring it home!

758
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,740
- Keep pushing!
- Why is my heart racing?

759
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,824
Keep pushing!

760
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,702
Let's finish it! Right here, right now!

761
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,704
<i>Was actually much harder than I thought.</i>

762
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,748
<i>My arms were absolutely dead.</i>

763
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,875
Last 30 seconds of your life!

764
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,543
Go, Lon!

765
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,466
- Go, go, go!
- Twenty, twenty!

766
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,176
Now's your chance! Raise the score!

767
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,428
- You can do it!
- Australia stopped!

768
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,430
- Keep going!
- Twenty seconds!

769
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,849
Come on! Make or break!

770
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,686
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

771
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,481
Come on. You're so close, Itoi! Hurry!

772
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,983
Six, five, four,

773
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:20,613
- three, two!
- Two! One! Go!

774
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,782
- Whoo!
- Bloody proud of you, bro.

775
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,368
- Let's go!
- <i>Stop. Game over.</i>

776
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,869
- Proud of you, bro.
- Let's go!

777
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,956
- Itoi.
- Come here! I think we won, man.

778
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,000
- All right!
- We might have the best endurance here.

779
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,877
That was intense.

780
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,089
<i>I was in so much pain.</i>
<i>It was indescribable.</i>

781
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,757
<i>I hadn't felt that kind of pain before,</i>

782
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,218
<i>but I'd never pushed myself</i>
<i>that hard either.</i>

783
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,429
- That was an amazing battle.
- Yeah. That was insane.

784
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:56,691
<i>Fourth quest: battle rope relay.</i>

785
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,027
<i>We will now reveal the final results.</i>

786
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,238
Let's go. Australia.

787
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,365
- Australia.
- Australia.

788
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,449
Japan.

789
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,201
Say Japan.

790
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,665
<i>First place: 1,116 points.</i>

791
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,960
<i>Second place: 961 points.</i>

792
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,422
It's gotta be Australia.

793
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,679
Japan did really well too, so who knows?

794
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,765
I think that was our better round,
so maybe…

795
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,187
<i>I honestly couldn't make a call.</i>
<i>It was too close.</i>

796
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,857
Whoever wins is done for the day.

797
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,941
Lucky them.

798
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,278
I really do envy them.

799
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:46,407
<i>In first place with 1,116 points…</i>

800
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,087
<i>Team Japan.</i>

801
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,512
<i>Team Japan.</i>

802
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,349
What?

803
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,433
Really?

804
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,060
Wow.

805
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,812
It didn't look like it.

806
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,735
<i>I am very surprised</i>
<i>about the result for round two.</i>

807
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,070
It was a shock to us.

808
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,615
<i>I know me and the boys,</i>
<i>we ripped in as hard as we could.</i>

809
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,868
You know, I was still very confident
that we had it in the bag.

810
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,828
<i>I remember I dropped the rope,</i>

811
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,997
<i>albeit very, very briefly.</i>

812
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,750
<i>It is what it is.</i>
<i>It's a hard movement to do,</i>

813
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:41,337
<i>and that fourth repetition overall</i>
<i>for the day was tricky.</i>

814
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,050
It was not an easy thing to grasp onto
and hold onto for that amount of time.

815
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,343
I hate losing.

816
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,137
That hurts, but…

817
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,264
Japan really did it.

818
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,724
Yeah, they deserved that.

819
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,976
That's incredible. I'm really impressed.

820
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,228
Wow.

821
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,397
- Genuinely, good for them.
- They're insane.

822
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,732
Wow.

823
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,234
Yeah! Great job, team!

824
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,071
- All right!
- We're so proud of you guys.

825
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,699
We won!

826
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,620
<i>I might be the team captain,</i>

827
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:18,249
<i>but part of that means listening to</i>
<i>and learning from my team.</i>

828
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,667
<i>They've taught me so much,</i>

829
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,421
<i>and it's reassuring to know that I get to</i>
<i>work alongside these incredible athletes.</i>

830
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,713
<i>I'm grateful for them today.</i>

831
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,721
Physical: Asia.

832
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,142
<i>Captains of the three defeated countries,</i>

833
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,394
<i>please step forward.</i>

834
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,479
Wait. Step forward?

835
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,730
Why? What's happening?

836
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,537
<i>Captains of the three defeated countries,</i>

837
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,873
<i>please step forward…</i>

838
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,377
<i>and open your box.</i>

839
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,964
What are those?
Look at 'em. They're so small.

840
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,218
What is that? What do you think is inside?

841
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,305
All right.
What do you think is in the box?

842
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,017
- Drawing lots maybe?
- Like a lottery?

843
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,816
I opened it as fast as I could.

844
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,819
- What is it?
- Let's see it.

845
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,946
No way, are you kidding me?

846
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,908
And I found shackles.

847
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,494
Oh, it's… No, handcuffs.

848
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,621
Why in the world do we need shackles?

849
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,457
- What?
- We'll see what it is.

850
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,918
Physical: Asia.

851
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,337
<i>Fourth quest.</i>

852
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,219
<i>The Death Match…</i>

853
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,846
Oh, no…

854
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,182
<i>…will begin momentarily.</i>

855
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,266
- Huh?
- Huh?

856
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,601
Now?

857
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,107
What is it?

858
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,085
What is it?

859
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,551
I knew it!

860
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,720
What is it?

861
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,099
<i>I can't say I had any expectations.</i>

862
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,477
Physical: Asia.

863
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,271
<i>Fourth quest:</i>

864
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,273
<i>Death Match.</i>

865
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,080
<i>I got chills.</i>

866
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,792
<i>It felt like a scene straight from hell.</i>

867
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,962
They really wanted us to work for it.

868
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,341
<i>It was really surreal and also amazing.</i>

869
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,135
<i>I mean, we were all shocked.</i>

870
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,970
<i>I was not expecting that.</i>

871
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:21,974
<i>The Death Match will determine</i>
<i>the team that gets eliminated.</i>

872
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,809
Yeah, but what is it?

873
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,686
<i>This Death Match was different.</i>

874
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,979
Wow.

875
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,023
<i>They were gonna push us to our limits.</i>

876
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,487
<i>The 1,200-kilogram Pillar Push.</i>

877
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,823
- 1,200 kilograms?
- You push?

878
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:38,949
A ton?

879
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,951
One metric ton.

880
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,036
1,200.

881
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,829
It'd blow out your hammies.

882
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,041
<i>Your team must push the pillar…</i>

883
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,840
<i>for 100 laps.</i>

884
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,425
- 100?
- Yeah.

885
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,260
Just walking that is exhausting.

886
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,347
Just the thought of pushing it that much
made me tired.

887
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,556
- We have to do what?
- 100?

888
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,308
- No, no. Not us.
- That's insane.

889
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,477
100? 100?

890
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,939
I was in severe denial.
Like, "No. Please, no. Try again."

891
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,527
Just thinking about it was intimidating.
It seemed Herculean.

892
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,904
100 laps.

893
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,742
Hey, you're made for this shit, bro.

894
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,869
Another one made for us.

895
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:24,953
I got excited.

896
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:28,332
Straightaway,
I was like, "I'm meant for that."

897
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,211
<i>The first two teams to make 100 laps</i>

898
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,589
<i>will be moving on to the fifth quest.</i>

899
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,467
<i>The country in last place</i>

900
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,387
<i>will immediately…</i>

901
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,472
<i>will immediately…</i>

902
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,891
<i>be eliminated.</i>

903
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,605
Easy. Easy.

904
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,815
Wow.

905
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,692
We can do this. I know we can.

906
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:58,445
<i>Participants, please enter the arena.</i>

907
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,322
Be ready, guys.

908
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,076
All right. Here we go.

909
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,496
Let's go!

910
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,832
<i>Very confident.</i>

911
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,084
<i>We have the guys for this challenge,</i>

912
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,879
<i>and in a Death Match,</i>
<i>this stuff is made for us.</i>

913
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,631
<i>We had to survive.</i>

914
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,761
<i>We'll show everyone</i>
<i>how fearsome our team is.</i>

915
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,230
All three teams

916
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,607
are evenly matched.

917
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,193
So who knows what'll happen.

918
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,323
Physical: Asia. <i>Death Match.</i>

919
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,910
<i>The 1,200-kilogram Pillar Push.</i>

920
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,914
<i>The number of participants allowed</i>
<i>for this match…</i>

921
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,879

<i>…is three.</i>

923
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,760
<i>Additionally…</i>

924
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,929
Come on. Just tell me.

925
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,391
<i>…any teammate who was involved</i>
<i>in the battle rope relay</i>

926
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,770

00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,772
<i>…may not participate.</i>

928
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,658
Are you f****** serious?

929
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,035
Nah, it's bullshit.

930
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,661
What?

931
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,663
My heart sunk.

932
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,584
The thing that I was made for,
I couldn't even do.

933
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,878
<i>I'm kind of shattered.</i>

934
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,047
<i>They were pretty concerned, I think.</i>

935
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,715
<i>I do a lot of this stuff, you know,</i>

936
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,259
<i>which is my jam.</i>

937
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,303
You guys can do it.

938
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,347
- You can do it.
- Yeah, easy.

939
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,684
What about Team Mongolia?

940
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,938
Yeah, they've got some strong contestants.

941
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,815
Who's that again?

942
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,067
Their judoka. She's something else.

943
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,781
<i>Our strategy paid off.</i>

944
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,283
We figured whoever didn't play
in the first game

945
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,952
would have to play in the Death Match.

946
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,371
That's why I put myself on the bench.

947
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,790
<i>We wanted to be prepared for anything.</i>

948
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,377
<i>Obviously, I think</i>
<i>our team works well together.</i>

949
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,964
<i>But we wouldn't have gotten this far</i>
<i>without being careful and strategic.</i>

950
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,926
Wow, Korea's strong.

951
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,636
Let's do this.

952
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,304
Our plan actually worked.

953
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,724
We made the right call. Thank goodness.

954
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,351
BATTLE ROPE STRATEGY MEETING

955
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,894
We have to be strategic.

956
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,105
All of the clues were there, you know?

957
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,650
If only three people can play,
and you can only advance if you win…

958
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,318
They're planning another game.

959
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,487
And whoever doesn't play this game
plays that one.

960
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,699
I can't even begin to express
how relieved I was.

961
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,033
Your turn, Min-jae.

962
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,828
- Ready?
- Extra loud for Min-jae.

963
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:53,912
Korea!

964
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,497
Fight on!

965
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,500
<i>One hundred laps.</i>
<i>No breaks. Simple, but daunting.</i>

966
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,419
I say "cattle," you say "dog."

967
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,628
- Cattle!
- Dog!

968
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,382
<i>I had nothing but confidence.</i>
<i>I know the heart and grit of our team.</i>

969
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,136
- Warriors!
- Mount up!

970
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,556
<i>Even though</i>
<i>instant elimination was looming,</i>

971
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,016
I still felt confident.

972
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,397
- Yeah, fight on!
- Come on!

973
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,274
- All right!
- You can do this!

974
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,359
<i>Team Korea:</i>

975
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,403
<i>Kim Dong-hyun,</i>

976
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,988
<i>Amotti,</i>

977
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,364
<i>and Kim Min-jae.</i>

978
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,659
We've been here before,
so we can do it again.

979
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,328
We'll come out on top.

980
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,871
All right! Let's go!

981
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,497
Did you see where they put the wrestler?

982
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,125
The wrestler?
Yeah, they put him in the center.

983
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,712
<i>The person on the outside</i>
<i>will exert the most force.</i>

984
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,965
And even though I'm the strongest,
I don't have Amotti's stamina.

985
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,176
And so, he did an incredibly kind thing

986
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,802
<i>and took my place on the end.</i>

987
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,681
<i>Team Mongolia.</i>

988
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,684
<i>Orkhonbayar Bayarsaikhan,</i>

989
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,520
<i>Adiyasuren Amarsaikhan,</i>

990
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,898
<i>and Khandsuren Gantogtokh.</i>

991
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,317
I know Mongolia will win this match.

992
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,152
Even so, we wish our opponents luck.

993
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,322
- Whoo!
- Let's go! Whoo!

994
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,783
<i>Team Australia.</i>

995
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,118
<i>Dom Tomato,</i>

996
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,870
<i>Katelin van Zyl,</i>

997
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,664
<i>and Alexandra.</i>

998
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,125
We've proven before that our women
are as strong as their men,

999
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,877
and we're definitely taking this one out.

1000
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,171
We ain't going nowhere.

1001
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,589
Let's go!

1002
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,301
<i>Seeing Korea line up,</i>
<i>by a long shot, they were gonna win.</i>

1003
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,471
I guess the biggest heat for us
was with Mongolia.

1004
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,723
You and I could do this alone, Adiya.

1005
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,226
Add Khandsuren, we're even stronger.

1006
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,646
<i>I knew we'd be able to beat Australia.</i>
<i>It wasn't gonna be hard.</i>

1007
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,982
We were just objectively more powerful.

1008
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,693
We can take Mongolia, easy.

1009
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,278
- They ain't got the stamina we do.
- We've got this, guys.

1010
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,447
<i>With Mongolia, I feel like</i>

1011
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,616
<i>they probably don't have</i>
<i>the endurance we've got.</i>

1012
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,119
<i>So we were very confident</i>
<i>that we'd win that.</i>

1013
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,246
Australia has two women.

1014
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,623
She does CrossFit or something similar.

1015
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,792
So she's got power and endurance.

1016
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,837
But also,
those pillars they're moving are huge.

1017
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,047
You gotta have enough strength to push it.

1018
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,800
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

1019
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,343
This looks like hell.

1020
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,309
They look like the shackles of hell.

1021
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,522
<i>It felt like</i>
<i>I was about to be tortured or something.</i>

1022
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,607
<i>Honestly, it freaked me out a bit.</i>

1023
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:32,112
<i>I felt this overwhelming sense</i>
<i>of dread. Like we were being punished.</i>

1024
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,407
This is gonna be a long match.

1025
