00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,364
THE HISTORY OF MANKIND BEGAN
WITH THE HUMAN BODY

3
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,829
<i>We kept fighting</i>
<i>until we exhausted our strength.</i>

4
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,582
<i>Whoever makes it through,</i>
<i>we'll crush them.</i>

5
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,916
Get off me!

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,501
IT SERVED AS SPEAR AND SHIELD

7
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,254
<i>From the outside,</i>
<i>they may have looked formidable,</i>

8
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,338
<i>but they were easy prey.</i>

9
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,840
Hey, grab it now. Grab it, grab it!

10
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,509
No one takes this from us, dude. No one!

11
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,219
IT WAS THE KEY TO SURVIVAL

12
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,934
<i>We came here to win the championship.</i>

13
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,480
UNDER THE FLAGS OF EIGHT COUNTRIES

14
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,397
Let's go!

15
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,275
Go, go, go! No time! Gotta go, gotta go!

16
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,693
ONLY THE COUNTRY
THAT EMBODIES THE PERFECT PHYSIQUE

17
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:12,489
<i>I'm representing my country,</i>
<i>so I'll do whatever it takes to win.</i>

18
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,450
<i>Our people were born to fight and win.</i>

19
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,286
Let's go! Yes!

20
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,914
WILL BE ACCORDED A NEW PLACE IN HISTORY

21
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,124
<i>It was like watching a slow death.</i>

22
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,212
<i>A type of excruciating pain</i>
<i>I've never experienced before.</i>

23
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,841
<i>But we just take on</i>
<i>whatever comes on towards us,</i>

24
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,220
<i>headstrong, headfirst,</i>
<i>with that fighting spirit that we have.</i>

25
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,972
<i>We're a strong team,</i>
<i>from a strong country.</i>

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,934
<i>This wasn't a game anymore.</i>

27
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,561
<i>It was a war.</i>

28
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,522
<i>No mercy…</i>

29
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>…no surrender.</i>

30
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,484
<i>To the death.</i>

31
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,528
Let's go!

32
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,947
Attack!

33
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,118
PHYSICAL: ASIA

34
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,211
1. WHERE THE SUN RISES

35
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,763
<i>Anyone who's seen the past two seasons</i>

36
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,473
<i>will try to keep us in check.</i>

37
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,104
<i>Even in an all-out physical brawl,</i>

38
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,898
<i>I doubt we'd lose.</i>

39
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,529
<i>All I know</i>
<i>is that this season will be different.</i>

40
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,906
<i>Very different.</i>

41
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,868
Wow.

42
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:29,250
Oh, wow. Man, this is insane.

43
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,376
Seriously.

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,003
Wow.

45
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,838
Hey, there.

46
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,091
Korea's first UFC fighter,
Kim Dong-hyun, at your service.

47
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,384
KIM DONG-HYUN
MMA FIGHTER

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,347
I was in the welterweight division
and retired after 28 fights.

49
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,017
I won 22 matches, and only lost four.

50
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,188
In my opinion, if you really wanna
prove how strong you are,

51
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,689
the UFC's where it's at.

52
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,650
It's good to be back. And this season,

53
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,278
I'm excited for the opportunity
to show my physical prowess once more.

54
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,239
I'm ready to jump in.

55
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:03,201
Getting eliminated towards the end
of last season was disappointing.

56
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,620
I still dream about it sometimes.

57
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,914
Second place!

58
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,375
Sling your legs over!

59
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,757
<i>It was a real shame. We were close.</i>

60
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,635
I still remember the last thing I said:

61
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,262
I'm gonna live out the rest of my days

62
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,472
with the body I had as the "Stun Gun".

63
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,309
That was the promise I made to myself.

64
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,728
And ever since last season,

65
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,980
I've been hard at work

66
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,274
training and getting back into shape.

67
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,986
I've tasted the bitterness of defeat once.

68
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,948
So I've made another promise,
to never taste defeat again,

69
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,449
and I intend to keep it, too.

70
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,369
I'm here to show you just how terrifying
true determination

71
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,620
can really be.

72
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,038
Seriously…

73
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,748
Wow.

74
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,334
It's giving me the chills, man.

75
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,794
<i>Hello.</i>

76
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,629
I'm Amotti.

77
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,008
Crossfit lover and winner of
<i>Physical: 100 Season 2</i>.

78
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,344
I think I was the only one
who did every quest last season.

79
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,804
From the treadmills…

80
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,019
…to the finals.
By the end, I'd done it all.

81
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,145
Amotti!

82
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,813
So I'd say I'm…

83
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,481
feeling pretty confident.

84
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,489
I'm Yun Sung-bin: Olympic gold medalist
and former national team skeleton racer.

85
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,992
Wow! It's huge.

86
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,535
The scale's insane.

87
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,872
I'm Jang Eun-sil, former wrestler
for the national women's team.

88
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,416
If you've seen previous
<i>Physical: 100 </i>seasons…

89
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,169
I'm sure that we look a little familiar.

90
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,589
The man with the crazy physique:
Yun Sung-bin.

91
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,058
If you've seen me, I think
you'd agree that I'm pretty strong.

92
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,352
Watching it from home

93
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,188
is one thing, but going up
against someone, skin-on-skin,

94
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,981
is a whole different experience.

95
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,399
I dare you to try it.

96
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,110
We Koreans have got a mean kick to us.

97
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,112
Wow.

98
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,198
Australia. Thailand?

99
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,157
Indonesia, right?

100
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,367
Indonesia.

101
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,951
Türkiye, Japan…

102
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,370
- Mongolia.
- Mongolia.

103
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,871
- Philippines.
- Ah, Philippines.

104
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,207
Wow.

105
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,541
That's crazy…

106
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,169
Well, let's check out
the torsos. Who do we got?

107
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,128
Let's see.

108
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,047
Has anyone heard of this

109
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,964
Australian CrossFitter?

110
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,299
Ka… Katelin.

111
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,717
- Is she famous?
- Katelin?

112
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,968
Do you know?

113
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,928
I'm more famous.

114
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,806
- Okay, okay!
- All right, nice shade.

115
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,890
All right.

116
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,059
I mean, this is <i>Physical: Asia</i>, right?

117
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,602
You've gotta have Asia's number one.

118
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,520
CHOI SEUNG-YEON
CROSSFITTER

119
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,480
In the world of CrossFit,

120
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,024
there's the international CrossFit Games.

121
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,527
If you wanna compete,
you need to place third

122
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,239
or higher in your region. And for us,
that's the entire Asian continent.

123
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,949
Lucky for me, I made it.

124
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,286
I went in 2021, 2022, and 2024.

125
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,579
Welcome, Seung-yeon Choi!

126
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,917
I'm the only person from Korea who's
competed three times. I'm proud of that.

127
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,838
If you're into CrossFit at all,

128
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,590
you know what an amazing athlete
Seung-Yeon is.

129
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,008
She's incredible.

130
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,095
Honestly, out of everyone else
on our team,

131
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,763
she's the most reliable.

132
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,598
She can do anything.

133
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,435
I like your fighting spirit.

134
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,894
That's good, let's keep it up.

135
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,813
Whoa. Dong-hyun!

136
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,608
Whittaker!

137
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,320
- Whittaker?
- Is it really?

138
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,615
He's a UFC Champion!

139
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,117
- What?
- A champion!

140
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,785
And still active!

141
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,038
Seeing that Whittaker, of all people,
would be here,

142
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,957
that blew me away, like…

143
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,501
Wow. He's actually coming?

144
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,171
Things are starting to heat up already!

145
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,381
Wow. They brought out their big guns.

146
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,633
I'm so glad I get to be here

147
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,719
for the first international season.

148
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,012
I can't wait to see who

149
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,513
we're competing against.

150
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,057
Japan.

151
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,436
When it comes to mixed martial arts,
I've got most people beat.

152
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,521
But there's one exception.

153
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,065
Ah!

154
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,401
Ah!

155
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,653
Ah!

156
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,031
Mr. Yushin Okami.

157
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,826
He's a renowned fighter,
very accomplished.

158
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,954
I used to have the most wins in Asia,

159
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,915
and then Okami beat me by one.

160
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,209
He's got 14 wins, I've got 13.

161
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,835
Just one win, man.

162
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,338
And now he's here.

163
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:29,592
He's really competing, huh?

164
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,470
- Team Philippines.
- 102?

165
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,805
- What? Kilograms? Oh wow…
- Justin Coveney.

166
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,225
- There's two guys over 100 kilos.
- 102, huh?

167
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,060
They're 140.

168
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,062
- 140?
- Yeah, look. It's right there.

169
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,314
- 140?
- Yeah, look. It's right there.

170
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,357
No kidding!

171
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,236
Min-jae could take him!

172
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,656
I think you could do it!
You'd totally take him!

173
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,370
I'm 190 centimeters tall
and weigh 140 kilos.

174
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm a ssireum wrestler.

175
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,957
Competing in Baekdu,
the highest weight class.

176
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,958
KIM MIN-JAE
SSIREUM WRESTLER

177
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,835
They call me,
"The Monster of the Sand Pit."

178
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,507
As an active fighter, I currently have
the most wins in my weight class.

179
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,842
Ssireum is Korea's sport,

180
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,011
and I'm its best representative.

181
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,513
It's up to me

182
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,765
to help secure Korea's victory.

183
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,021
All right, it's begun.

184
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,273
Nervous. I'm so nervous.

185
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,233
Oh, here they come.

186
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,901
Let's see.

187
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,700
I was born to fight. It's in my bones.

188
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,621
When it comes to sports, we're the best.

189
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,790
We're a nation of warriors.

190
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,667
- Let's see.
- Who is it?

191
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,252
Ah!

192
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,546
It's Dong-hyun!

193
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,381
I knew he would be in there.

194
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,800
Just how I wanted it.

195
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,011
I am the giant of Japan, Yushin Okami,

196
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,680
MMA fighter, 23 years' experience.

197
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,059
In the UFC, I got 14 wins.

198
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,895
In Asia, that's a record number.

199
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,439
Nobody's managed to break it yet.

200
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,609
Okami!

201
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,447
Let's see, what else… Oh, right.

202
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,365
There's this manga
called "Attack on Titan"

203
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,160
that's pretty popular.
And when the protagonist transforms

204
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,622
into his "Titan" form,
the model is actually based on me.

205
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,167
No active fighter can take him on.

206
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,335
Hmm.

207
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,128
Okami! Hello.

208
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,713
- Hi.
- Hey! What's up?

209
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,632
- Hello. Hello.
- Nice to meet you!

210
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,633
What's up?

211
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,260
It's good to see ya.

212
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,514
Absolutely, I'd love to fight him!
Can you imagine?

213
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,267
It would be the ultimate showdown
of physical strength.

214
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,769
Of course I'm down.

215
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,520
But I plan on beating him.

216
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,814
And doing so at our physical peaks.

217
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,151
- Good luck to you.
- Good luck, guys.

218
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,944
Wow, what a looker.

219
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,571
Handsome, handsome.

220
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,698
- You too.
- Wrestling?

221
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,408
- No, swimming.
- Swimming, oh.

222
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,119
I'm the national record holder
for the 100 meter freestyle,

223
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,497
Katsumi Nakamura.

224
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,124
KATSUMI NAKAMURA
NATIONAL TEAM SWIMMER

225
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,335
- Oh. MMA? MMA fighter?
- MMA, uh…

226
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,795
Yeah, that's right.

227
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,881
My name's Kana Watanabe, MMA fighter.

228
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,842
It's nice to meet you.

229
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,386
Our baseball player.

230
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,970
That's me. I play baseball.

231
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,264
- Well, used to play.
- Oh!

232
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,558
Hey, how's it going?

233
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,519
My name is Yoshio Itoi,

234
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,145
and I play baseball.

235
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,483
It's going all the way to the upper
stands! That's a home run!

236
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,860
National Team player, and slugger.

237
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,654
When I was active,

238
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,906
they called me the "Superman".

239
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,241
Yeah.

240
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,411
I often led in stolen bases.

241
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,748
So when it comes to power and speed,
I'm still confident in my abilities.

242
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,376
If that's what you need,
then leave it to me.

243
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,920
See? Superman.

244
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,090
- Wrestling?
- Wrestling, wrestling.

245
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,633
Yep. That's me.

246
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,009
What's your weight class?

247
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,344
- As in kilograms?
- Yes, that's what I meant.

248
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,179
Olympics, 68.

249
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,764
Now, 65.

250
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,807
Hey guys!

251
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,309
I'm Nonoka Ozaki, national team wrestler.

252
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:12,022
I competed in the 2024 Paris Olympics
in the second-highest weight class,

253
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,108
and I walked away with the bronze.

254
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,069
Nice to meet you.

255
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:17,987
Nice to meet you.

256
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,905
When it comes to women's wrestling,

257
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,991
Japan's the best, I can't deny it.

258
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,202
So I knew going up against her
would be a challenge.

259
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,288
- Judo!
- Nice to meet you!

260
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,622
He's an Olympic medalist.

261
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,749
A medalist?

262
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,042
- Yes. Silver, and, uh, bronze.
- Yeah, medalist.

263
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,711
In Paris.

264
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,297
I'm captain of Japan's judo team,
Soichi Hashimoto.

265
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,298
SOICHI HASHIMOTO

266
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,967
Our team won silver, and I won a bronze.

267
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,802
"Soft and fair goes far."

268
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,221
That's our philosophy.
Technique over strength.

269
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,768
Even Dong-hyun can be taken down.

270
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,146
Bronze medal, silver and bronze.

271
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,148
Wow, two Olympians on one team?

272
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,735
Japan!

273
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,615
Strong!

274
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,824
Korea strong!

275
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,621
The way he said "strong" was adorable.

276
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,622
You're cute, guys.

277
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,540
Did you hear him?

278
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,833
Cute, huh?

279
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,919
Careful guys, don't underestimate us.

280
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,338
I guess we'll see you in the finals.

281
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,799
- Final match. Let's go!
- Yeah, yeah, final match. Final match.

282
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,758
Yes.

283
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,967
Good luck, guys.

284
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,887
Yeah, Japan, Korea, we're rivals.
Let's go.

285
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,723
Honestly? If it really
came down to Japan and Korea…

286
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,849
Obviously…

287
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,645
- Korea and Japan?
- Oh, it's on, man. They're goin' down.

288
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,313
We can't lose to Japan.

289
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,731
No way.

290
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,691
Bring it on!

291
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,485
I'm so excited for this.

292
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,111
Japan's gonna be a real challenge.

293
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,197
Yeah, I know. Man…

294
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,698
But come on, we have a gold medalist!

295
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,158
Yeah, but

296
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,952
they have so many Olympic medals.

297
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,579
I think they all have at least one.

298
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,249
They have four contestants
in combat sports.

299
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,167
Yeah, I noticed that.

300
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,044
Four? That's a lot.

301
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,338
- That might be too many.
- Yeah, I hope so.

302
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,508
Korea's athletes are pretty small.

303
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,009
That's a good sign.

304
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,680
I don't know. I think Japan's gonna be
the least of our worries.

305
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,640
The teams get stronger from here.

306
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,351
We need a strategy

307
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,436
Oh, here they come!

308
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,329
- What's this?
- Muay Thai fighters!

309
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,457
- Look at that
- It's Thailand.

310
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,085
- Wait, that guy. He's-- Yeah, that.
- The ONE Champion?

311
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,546
Oh! ONE Championship!

312
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,089
He's gonna be strong.

313
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,134
It's Superbon.

314
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,927
- Superbon?
- Yeah, it's him.

315
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,138
Super strong and super famous.

316
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,309
Name fits, right?
He's the Muay Thai champion.

317
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,977
Champion?

318
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,690
Hey there. I'm Superbon,
professional Muay Thai fighter

319
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,235
and kickboxer, previous IFMA champion
with 4 consecutive wins.

320
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:07,531
Superbon!

321
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,577
As a fighter, I'm known for knocking out
my opponents with a kick to the neck.

322
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,833
<i>High kicks are one of my specialities,</i>

323
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,753
<i>and that's a skill that's hard to master,</i>
<i>especially in Muay Thai.</i>

324
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,715
<i>Good night, Irene!</i>

325
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,931
<i>As a professional</i>
<i>Muay Thai fighter from Thailand,</i>

326
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,559
<i>I'm here to represent my country</i>
<i>and our people's fighting spirit.</i>

327
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,395
<i>The only thing on my mind is victory.</i>

328
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,650
- The man's a living legend.
- Really?

329
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,819
I mean, he's Thailand's superstar. Yeah.

330
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,365
This is some fierce competition, huh?

331
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,455
The statue's bigger than us.

332
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,084
Hey, check out that guy over there.
He's wearing heels.

333
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,628
Oh, yeah. He is wearing heels.

334
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,338
He certainly stands out,

335
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,173
though it's not exactly athletic.

336
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,300
Second from the back?

337
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,678
He looks like he could be
some kind of sorcerer, right?

338
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,847
- He's gonna use magic.
- Magic?

339
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,058
Yeah, magic. Definitely.

340
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,477
Abracadabra!

341
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,021
I'm more curious about that guy.

342
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,856
Heel guy.

343
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,735
What… What's your… What's your job?

344
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,238
- Me? Volleyball.
- Yeah. Huh?

345
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,823
- What was that?
- Water ball?

346
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,866
- Volleyball. Think, Kim Yeon-gyeong!
- Oh! Volleyball!

347
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,576
Beach volleyball?

348
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,329
Hey there, I'm James Rusameekae Fagerlund.

349
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,998
JAMES RUSAMEEKAE
FORMER VOLLEYBALL PLAYER

350
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,626
And I'm a professional volleyball player.

351
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,753
<i>A flick, then it's Rusameekae!</i>

352
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,257
<i>Blocked in front of the set,</i>
<i>but that's a set point!</i>

353
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,967
<i>Which means the set is theirs!</i>

354
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,762
I'm just a really athletic person
in general, you know?

355
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,141
One time I joined
this celebrity boxing competition

356
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,184
<i>just for fun. And, well, I won that.</i>

357
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,816
I do call myself the "Thai King Kong".

358
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,485
<i>King Kong has a big, black body like I do.</i>

359
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,196
<i>But that makes him strong. He's a leader.</i>

360
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:16,076
But I'm also this joyful, cheerful,
fun-loving person at the same time.

361
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,996
<i>Currently, I'm a working actor.</i>

362
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,790
<i>And I'm also an entertainer.</i>

363
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,002
Let me tell you something
about Team Thailand, okay?

364
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,211
<i>We came to win.</i>

365
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,381
<i>So we brought it all: The big guns,</i>
<i>the thick guns, the best of the best.</i>

Well, that's me. That's James.

373
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,612
- What-What sport are you doing?
- Me?

374
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,782
I'm a comedian. Korean comedian.

375
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,949
Oh, comedian! Me too!

376
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,701
TV show. Oh, yeah, nice to meet you.

377
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,038
- Good to see you too. Ah, yes. Uh, me too.
- TV show, TV, yeah.

378
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,669
All right, here we go: Korean comedian
versus Thai comedian. It's on!

379
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,963
With his cauliflower ears?

380
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,216
Any thoughts?

381
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,592
I think they're scared.

382
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,260
- They look intimidated.
- They'll be easy.

383
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,763
- We can take 'em, it'll be fine.
- Easy? You think so?

384
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,516
It's always about combat with you.

385
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,518
All right, look, the way I see it,

386
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,686
they're looking at us
like we're the ones to beat, right?

387
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,856
- They're already watching us.
- That's 'cause you're so loud.

388
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,653
We don't need to worry about Korea.
They're actors.

389
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,155
- Black shirt guy is handsome…
- They look like a team of influencers.

390
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,240
They might not be,

391
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,118
but I'd believe they were fitness
influencers before they were athletes.

392
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,244
I hope you're right.

393
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,204
Of the two of them,
Japan's the bigger threat.

394
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,042
Well… I know who we should fight first.

395
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,090
Who's next?

396
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,759
Let's cheer when they enter. Who's there?

397
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,859
Here comes Mongolia!

398
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,236
Mongolia, Mongolia!

399
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,539
Wow!

400
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,000
Look at that!

401
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,126
Amazing.

402
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,128

<i>They were just built different.</i>

409
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,269
Physically, structurally, they were huge.

410
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,772
<i>They were all physically strong.</i>
<i>You could tell.</i>

411
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,153
<i>Honestly, I think there must be</i>
<i>something in their DNA.</i>

412
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:01,074
Anytime I've been up against someone
from Mongolia, it's… really tough.

413
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,035
<i>Even in my own weight class,</i>

414
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,953
<i>it can feel like fighting</i>
<i>a male colleague.</i>

<i>I hate to admit it,</i>
<i>but they're gonna be a real threat.</i>

You all look so incredible!

Oh…

424
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,768
He's a Bökh wrestler.

425
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,437
His outfit, he's in traditional garb.

426
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,442
Hello, I am Orkhonbayar.
I am a Bökh wrestler

427
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,069
and a national champion.

428
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,658
<i>As a form of folk wrestling,</i>
<i>Bökh is very traditional.</i>

429
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,868
<i>It has a very long history.</i>

430
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,248
<i>It's said to have originated</i>
<i>from ancient Mongolian warriors</i>

431
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,666
<i>and their cultural practices.</i>

432
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,837
<i>I've competed in</i>
<i>the national Naadam festival five times.</i>

433
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,881
And every time I've competed,

434
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,300
I've done really well
and ranked really high.

435
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:04,179
Each of my stripes represents
one of my accomplishments.

436
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,642
In 2022, there was another tournament.

437
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,063
<i>It was a national competition</i>
<i>for the President's Cup,</i>

438
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,314
<i>and I ended up winning.</i>

439
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,567
<i>Everyone in Mongolia's heard of me.</i>

440
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,490
Most people who study Judo also do
some cross-training with Bökh wrestlers.

441
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,951
- And they're really, really strong.
- Yeah.

442
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,870
<i>It left an impression. Sure.</i>

443
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,664
<i>But,</i>

444
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,458
<i>to be honest, I'm not stressed</i>

445
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,462
<i>They have their traditional wrestling,</i>
<i>but we've got ssireum.</i>

446
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,299
<i>I think Min-jae can handle him.</i>
<i>I'm not too worried.</i>

- Min-jae, have you been to Mongolia?
- Huh?

449
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,012
Yeah, I've been once.

450
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,680
- To compete?
- Yeah.

451
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,931
How was it?

452
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,101
It was tough.

453
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,561
Don't get in your head.

454
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,939
<i>I once traveled to Mongolia to study Bökh.</i>

455
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,899
<i>I loved the physicality.</i>

456
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,028
<i>But it's really hard,</i>

457
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,405
<i>and their athletes are</i>
<i>at the top of their game.</i>

458
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:08,910
I'm pretty sure that's a judo uniform.
The Olympic one, I recognize it.

459
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,662
Was she the 100 kilo bust?

460
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,207
Oh.

461
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,792
- She weighs a hundred kilograms.
- That's crazy.

462
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,336
- Wait, seriously?
- Crazy.

463
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,005
Wait a sec.
This team's really big, aren't they?

464
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,173
They're heavyweights.

465
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,299
She is for sure.

466
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,967
She's in really great shape.

467
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,261
Man, Mongolia's athletes are huge.

468
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,931
<i>Judo's an interesting combat sport.</i>

469
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,309
When you've got a good hold
on your opponent,

470
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,186
you have the power
to block their movements.

471
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,605
<i>And I've got the best grip strength here.</i>

472
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,483
<i>Through hard work and dedication,</i>

473
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:43,111
<i>I ended up winning the silver medal</i>
<i>at the Ulaanbaatar Grand Prix.</i>

474
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,657
<i>The blood of Genghis Khan flows</i>
<i>through every Mongolian, we're warriors.</i>

475
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,327
<i>And as warriors, we're here to conquer.</i>

476
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,746
They've got incredible strength.

477
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,206
Judging from what we see, yes.

478
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,376
- I think these ones are ours.
- Wow, look at that.

479
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,044
What's up, brother? Whoo.

480
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,923
All right,
so any guesses for the silver suit?

481
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,883
He kinda looks like Elsa.

482
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,218
He's like a prince.

483
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,308
<i>My name is Lkhagva-ochir.</i>

484
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,726
LKHAGVA-OCHIR ERDENE-OCHIR
ACROBAT

485
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:19,272
<i>I do Cirque du Soleil, and I perform</i>
<i>in the Kooza and Crystal shows.</i>

486
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,110
<i>My speciality is acrobatic stunts.</i>

487
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,361
<i>The trick I'm most known for</i>

488
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,739
<i>is one in which I build</i>
<i>an eleven-meter stack of chairs</i>

489
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,449
<i>and balance on top.</i>

490
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:33,036
<i>It's an incredibly difficult stunt,</i>
<i>and something that only I can really do.</i>

491
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,081
He's incredibly ripped.

492
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,125
- Yeah. Ripped.
- That's acrobatics.

493
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,918
Hey man, don't worry.

494
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,254
Those muscles aren't for fighting.

495
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,755
Wow.

496
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,466
I don't think he'll have
much stamina though.

497
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,468
He's just light on his feet.

498
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,264
<i>I might be</i>
<i>a bit smaller than the other athletes,</i>

499
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,224
<i>but I know I can keep up.</i>

500
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:58,437
As an acrobat, I've been training
since I was a very young child.

501
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,190
<i>I'm at the top of my game,</i>
<i>and I'm not afraid of anything.</i>

502
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,986
Hi, hi! Japan!

503
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,362
Hi. Hi.

504
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,448
- Mongolian wrestling?
- Yeah, Bökh.

505
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,532
You're huge.

506
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,534
- That's awesome.
- Hello!

507
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,994
Very impressive.

508
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,871
- Oh.
- What is it?

509
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,374
Nice to meet you! In judo? We do--

510
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,045
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
- That's it! Good match!

511
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,255
- You got this!
- Let's go!

512
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,381
Go for it!

513
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,466
Fight!

514
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,221
They're all smiling,
but you can feel the tension.

515
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,514
For sure.

516
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,808
They're trying to get information.

517
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,560
They're lifting each other.

518
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,313
Oh yeah. You're really strong.

519
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,316
- Nice legs.
- How was it?

520
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,276
- He's strong.
- He is, huh?

521
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,986
Yeah, he'd be tough to take on.

522
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,279
Ah, I see.

523
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,157
- They're gonna be a challenge.
- Absolutely. Oh man.

524
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,241
They're stacked.

525
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,704
Hey, did you see that torso over there?
That big one?

526
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,664
- What'd you think?
- Yeah, that's massive.

527
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,582
It's huge…

528
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,793
- Look at how big his pecs are.
- Oh.

529
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,717
- What?
- Wow.

530
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,302
Who is it?

531
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,470
It's Indonesia.

532
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,596
Is it?

533
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,600
Wow.

534
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,560
That's an incredible physique.

535
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,523
<i>His muscles were unreal,</i>
<i>his chest was huge.</i>

536
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,277
<i>I am Igedz.</i>

537
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,614
<i>And I am Indonesia's</i>
<i>heavyweight body building champion.</i>

538
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,160
<i>I've been on this journey</i>
<i>for many years now.</i>

539
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,454
<i>And this whole time,</i>
<i>up to the present day,</i>

540
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,332
<i>I've never been defeated</i>
<i>in my home country.</i>

541
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,295
<i>Professionally speaking, I'm more</i>
<i>commonly known as Igedz Executioner.</i>

542
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,132
So just know that,
if you try to confront me head-on,

543
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,926
I'll slaughter you.

544
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,181
Indonesia!

545
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,391
We are capable!

546
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,977
- Indonesia!
- We are strong!

547
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,186
He's got a big voice.

548
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,188
Look at that build.
That guy is something else.

549
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,699
<i>They entered with this…</i>
<i>dance-like fluidity.</i>

550
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:22,038
<i>They commanded the space.</i>
<i>It was very intimidating.</i>

551
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,256
Indonesia!

552
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,883
We'll take you down!

553
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,181
I've got goose bumps.

554
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,020
They're powerful.

555
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,188
- His physique is amazing!
- Wow, they look so angry.

556
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,399
Why do they look mad?

557
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,280
The woman in black has a similar uniform
to yours. She does jiujitsu…

558
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,574
Yeah, she's in a jiujitsu gi._

559
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,494
<i>I do mixed-gender fighting all the time.</i>

560
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,831
<i>So sparring with men isn't new to me.</i>
<i>It doesn't intimidate me.</i>

561
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,416
<i>Honestly, I'm not scared of anybody.</i>

"Mister International Indonesia", huh?

565
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,258
- With that face? I'm not surprised
- That lady's pretty too.

566
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,719
W-What kind of… training sports?

567
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,262
- Swimming.
- Swimming? Oh!

Are you badminton? Oh, yeah.

574
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,742
Indonesia's a badminton powerhouse.

MARCUS GIDEON - FORMER
NATIONAL TEAM BADMINTON PLAYER

576
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,795
Are you sure those are our opponents
over there?

577
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,589
They look like models.

578
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,717
Seriously.
Did they send two models to compete?

579
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,888
Dulguun can manage 'em. Right?
You're just as good lookin'.

580
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,644
<i>If I had to pick out</i>
<i>the weakest team, I'd say Indonesia.</i>

581
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,646
<i>When I look at them…</i>

582
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,232
<i>I see a team that's full</i>
<i>of really pretty people,</i>

583
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,442
<i>but I don't see a lot of great athletes.</i>

584
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,364
<i>I don't really care.</i>
<i>They can underestimate us, that's fine.</i>

585
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,034
All that matters to me is
that we give it all we've got out there.

586
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,036
The whole reason we're here is to win.

587
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,288
<i>That's been our goal from the start.</i>

588
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,624
<i>To come here to </i>Physical: Asia

589
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,002
with the fighting spirit of Indonesia,
and work together,

590
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,047
as one unified body to achieve victory.

591
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,468
Who's up?

592
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,684
Wow.

593
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,064
Oh, they're real big!

594
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,734
Oof, Türkiye…

595
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,119
<i>I'd never seen anyone</i>
<i>with that build before.</i>

596
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,330
<i>Their builds are crazy.</i>
<i>It's gonna be challenging.</i>

597
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,211
- For Türkiye!
- For Türkiye!

598
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,713
- With strength.
- With strength.

599
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,381
- We fight!
- We fight!

600
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,307
- Brother, brother. Brother.
- Brother.

601
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,601
We're so dead.

602
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,061
- Look at that.
- Another 140?

603
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,688
- Look at that core…
- Hey, Min-jae!

604
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,732
Min-jae, we're counting on ya!

605
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,485
You're the same weight,
so why does he look bigger?

606
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,320
- I'm getting wrestler vibes.
- This one?

607
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,905
- That guy?
- Yeah.

608
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,533
<i>It was almost cartoonish,</i>
<i>how sturdy he was.</i>

609
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,703
<i>His torso was thick,</i>
<i>like a wall of solid muscle.</i>

610
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,039
Man, he is solid, isn't he?

611
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,957
Wow, his body is completely insane.

612
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,252
He's an oil wrestler.
He's all oiled up too!

613
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,712
What sports?

614
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,422
Oil wrestling!

615
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,382
Oh! O-Oil wrestling?

616
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,218
Wow.

617
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,053
How's it going?

618
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,472
I'm Recep Kara,

619
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,266
national team wrestler
and a Kirkpinar champion.

620
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,187
<i>In Türkiye I'm a four-time champion</i>

621
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,439
<i>of the Kirkpinar Oil Wrestling Tournament.</i>

622
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,066
<i>My title is "Chief Wrestler",</i>

623
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,194
<i>which is the highest</i>
<i>one can earn in the sport.</i>

624
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,074
<i>I think </i>Physical: Asia's <i>a great</i>
<i>opportunity for a cultural exchange.</i>

625
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:30,078
<i>And I'm here to introduce</i>
<i>our traditional sport to the world.</i>

626
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,957
<i>We're here to make our country proud.</i>

627
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,961
Wow.

628
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,171
- He's really big.
- They all have crazy physiques.

629
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,714
I'm scared to shake hands.

630
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,133
They're all monsters, even the women.

631
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,552
Is that one a wrestler?

632
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,762
I heard she's a world champion!

633
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,847
Which one?

634
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,807
It's the woman in red. The one down there.

635
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,642
Apparently,
their ace is the female wrestler.

636
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,977
- Really?
- Yeah, I heard.

637
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,230
I swear, she wins every championship!
Every one.

638
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,108
Ah, Ms. Adar is so strong!

639
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,902
Hello.

<i>I'm a seven-time European champion,</i>

643

<i>and a two-time world champion.</i>

644
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,710
Just the idea of beating
my opponents excites me.

645
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:23,381
<i>It's not enough to win, I need to be</i>
<i>a champion in every way possible.</i>

646
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,468
Judo! Judo!

647
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,387
Actually, I think that's karate.

648
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,930
Okay, okay!

Allah willing,
we'll be leaving as the winners.

660
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,556
How many are left?

661
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,766
Just two.

662
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,727
Come on, Australia.
Do you think they're last?

663
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,187
Fifty percent chance.

<i>Seeing my other team members,</i>
<i>I am confident of victory.</i>

665

- He's UFC, right?
- Yeah, UFC.

671
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,710
Oh no, we're doomed. Oh boy.

672
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,295
- Lots of team spirit.
- Oh.

00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,978
You can't become a world champion
and not be competitive.

690
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,021
My goal's to win.

691
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,106
I flew to Korea to win this competition.

692
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,441
That's why I'm here.

693
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,319
All right, where's me little torso?

694
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,739
That rugby player's a giant too!

695
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,199
ELONI VUNAKECE
FORMER RUGBY PLAYER

696
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,618
Wow, okay. Guys, check out his legs.

697
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,205
<i>I think,</i>
<i>among all the ceramic torsos here,</i>

698
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,582
<i>theirs are the biggest.</i>

699
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,126
Ooh.

700
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,878
There I am, we got some abs!

701
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,755
We're going this way!

702
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,591
Let's go, quick five!

703
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:15,511
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,
bam, bam, bam, bam.

704
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,473
- Huh?
- Yes! Yes! C'mon!

705
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,852
- They've got lots of energy!
- It's all new to me.

ALEXANDRA - FITNESS COACH

00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,397
High five! I'm going, long run!

708
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,940

00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,151
Big, big fan of you. And same, bro!

00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,375
- What's she doing?
- Hey, Seung-yeon! You should go!

714
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,086
- Seung-yeon!
- C'mon! Go show off!

715
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,378
Let's go Seung-yeon!

716
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,380
Show them, show them, that's it!

717
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,341
Do a turn!

718
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,093
You wanna try, Anil?

719
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,177
Yeah, let's go, man!

720
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,558
They're putting on a show.

721
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,317
You need to strip down and step up!

722
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,778
- Are you serious?
- C'mon! Get going!

723
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,197
Ochir! Ochir! yeah!

724
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,160
Holy moly! One-handed!

725
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,995
Oh, what is this?

726
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,372
Circus dudes…

727
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,715
LKHAGVA-OCHIR ERDENE-OCHIR

728
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,302
Go on, go on. Go do it, do it!

729
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,518
Team Australia! Let's go!

730
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,063
What's his deal?

731
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,024
Australian jumping boy, the restless one.
What does he do?

732
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,110
Oh, that guy? Parkour, right?

733
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,529
Yeah, he does parkour.
That's how those athletes jump.

734
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,573
I've seen him on Instagram.

735
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,994
<i>I'm Dom Tomato and I'm the biggest name</i>
<i>in parkour and free running worldwide.</i>

736
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:03,953
Yeah!

737
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,044
<i>And I boast over three million followers</i>
<i>on Instagram.</i>

738
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,508
Parkour is fundamentally
learning how to use your body.

739
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,387
<i>It's really about learning to overcome</i>
<i>obstacles with your body.</i>

740
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,392
<i>And that physical challenge</i>
<i>and that physical discipline</i>

741
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:30,104
<i>takes a lot of strength</i>
<i>and a lot of resilience.</i>

742
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,196
Parkour takes a huge amount
of physicality, but it's also mental.

743
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,240
So the way it will fit
into the games will work really well.

744
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,201
We might be friendlier now,
but make no mistake,

745
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,703
<i>Team Australia is here to win,</i>
<i>so watch out.</i>

746
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,333
I just wanna fight some people.

747
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,761
<i>That team… is gonna be a problem.</i>

748
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,973
- Oh, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

749
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,226
- I'm middle weight.
- Yeah?

750
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,644
Middleweight.

751
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,730
Nice to meet you! I'm thrilled!

752
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,233
Big fan! Big fan. Legend.

753
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,406
- Same, same, same.
- Yeah, yeah.

754
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,409
- Big!
- Very physical!

755
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,327
Nice to meet you!

756
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,912
I figured baseball, my man.

757
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,830
- Rugby, rugby.
- Oh, rugby!

758
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,500
- Whoa, his hands! Try it!
- Very strong!

759
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,670
Whoa!

760
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,464
Oh, my God! So huge! What weight?

761
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,548
What weight?

762
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,800
Oh, 175.

763
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,386
- Whoa!
- Kilos, kilos.

764
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,931
That's a huge difference!

765
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,937
Amongst the <i>Physical: Asia </i>athletes,

766
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,772
I'm definitely the heaviest,

767
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,065
I'm definitely the biggest,

768
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,442
and I'm definitely the strongest.

769
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:03,114
<i>Representing Australia, Eddie Williams!</i>

770
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,157
EDDIE WILLIAMS
STRONGMAN

771
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,492
My name is Eddie Williams,

772
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,327
I am two-time Australia's strongest man,

773
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,122
I have a Guinness World Record
for pulling a tank.

774
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,502
I currently have six world records.

775
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,217
I would be ranked
in top-three biggest guys

776
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,261
in the world for strongmen.

777
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,263
People expect you,

778
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,598
"Oh, he's big. He's dumb,"

779
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,891
or, "He's slow."

780
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,476
But then, when they see me move…

781
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,397
it almost surprises them.

782
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,568
Growing up, I played rugby.
And that's what's helped me

783
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,446
be able to move quicker
and be different from everyone else.

784
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,072
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi.

785
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,075
Keep underestimating me,
and you'll find out.

786
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,121
The final team!

787
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,914
If there's one left,

788
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,875
that means it's gotta be Team Philippines.

789
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,002
Oh, it's time. Let's bring him in.

790
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,007
- Whoa.
- Oh?

791
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,133
No way!

792
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,384
That man's a legend,

793
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,553
conquered 8 different weight classes,
yeah?

794
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,389
He's not just a boxing legend,
he's a legend among legends.

795
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,559
I just kept looking at it over and over.

796
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,562
His torso was there,
but no matter how much I looked,

797
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,898
I still couldn't believe it
that he'd actually be here.

798
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,733
That's gotta be

799
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,817
why Philippines is last.

800
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,694
- Oh, absolutely.
- They actually got him to come here.

801
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,821
- Yeah. It's like one last surprise.
- Is he the president? Or…

802
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,531
I kept asking myself,

803
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,325
"Is this really happening?"

804
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,826
I've always wanted to meet him.

805
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,869
I've seen all his fights.

806
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,871
You know, he's a-- he's a living legend.

807
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,999
In combat sports,
and-and in the boxing world.

808
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,897
Whoa!

809
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,524
What the heck!

810
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,712
- Pacquiao is here!
- What?

811
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,797
Wow!

812
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,632
- Pacquiao!
- Pacquiao!

813
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,551
Let's go!

814
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,802
I can't believe he's here.

815
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,970
You're kidding!

816
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,763
This is awesome!

817
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,934
Man, I've got chills right now
just seeing him.

818
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,144
Unbelievable.

819
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:42,064
Having Manny Pacquiao with us, competing?

820
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,607
What an experience.

821
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,651
To see him leading his team,

822
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,111
it's-it's exciting to watch.

823
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,489
- Hello!
- PacMan!

824
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,116
Team Philippines, bringin' it!

825
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,869
I'm Manny "PacMan" Pacquiao,

826
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,912
former world boxing champion.

827
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,080
Nice to meet you.

828
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,835
Became a champion first, 112, flyweight.

829
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,045
After flyweight, super bantamweight,

830
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,883
featherweight, junior lightweight,
and then lightweight,

831
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,469
super lightweight, welterweight,

832
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,429
and then 154 junior middleweight.

833
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,891
<i>PacMan! PacMan!</i>

834
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,559

00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,269
<i>Pacquiao!</i>

836
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,980
Became a champion
in eight different weight divisions.

837
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,232
I'm so passionate with boxing.

838
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,903
That's why I'm still accepting fights.

839
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,031
I'd heard that <i>Physical: Asia</i>
was about to start filming,

840
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,240
and I went,

841
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,450
"Okay, why not?"

842
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,912
My body's still strong,
so I can still fight.

843
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,416
Nice! Let's go, Philippines!

844
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,501
Sambo! Sambo!

845
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,294
Their sambo fighter did MMA.

846
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,253
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

847
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,340
Um, my name is Mark Mugen,

848
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,758
combat sambo champion.

849
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,010
I've always believed

850
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,720
that I am one of the strongest.

851
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,598
And I couldn't say no to the opportunity.

852
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,268
I think we have
a very strong, balanced team.

853
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,646
We have a-a Philippines strongman,

854
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,106
I think he's the biggest Filipino
I've ever seen.

855
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,942
Rugby player, JC.

856
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,818
He's very big and strong.

857
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,238
He's on our national rugby team,
the Volcanoes.

858

864
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,837
I want to show the world

and athletes. And talented.

866

let's introduce ourselves.

870
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,856
Come on, let's go meet the man himself.

871
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,859
I have to.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

872
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,027
I wanna shake his hand!

873
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,655
I'm a big fan! Big fan, Pacquiao.

874
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,242
- Everyone wants to shake Manny's hand!
- Let's go see Manny!

875
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,329
Ah! Big fan, nice to meet you!

876
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,707
Legend. Legend of legend.

877
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,958
Hi, guys.

878
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,084
Big fan!

879
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,086
Hello! Big fans, brother!

880
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,170
Jesus bless!

881
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,756
Oh, legend!

882
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,093
He's a superstar, man.

883
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,970
The gang's all here.

884
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,388
I can't believe he's here!

885
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,889
Too many superstars!

886
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,728
We came here to win the championship.

887
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,314
We're gonna go toe-to-toe
with everyone here.

888
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:32,192
And my hope is that they give us
everything they've got.

889
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,612
So when we win, we'll have earned it.

890
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,621
Physical: Asia.

891
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,627
<i>South Korea.</i>

892
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,838
Goosebumps.

893
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,175
<i>Japan.</i>

<i>Australia.</i>

899
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,667
<i>The Philippines.</i>

900
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:38,008
<i>First, we'd like to extend</i>
<i>a warm welcome to all our contestants.</i>

901
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,885
- Hello.
- Hi.

902
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,303
Hey there.

903
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:50,521
<i>Starting now, instead of</i>
<i>competing as individual athletes,</i>

904
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,439
<i>you'll compete for your country.</i>

905
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,150
<i>In </i>Physical: Asia,

906
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,696
<i>six representatives from each nation</i>
<i>will form a team,</i>

907
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,407
<i>and face off in an international showdown.</i>

908
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,993
<i>At the end of the competition,</i>

909
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,870
<i>when all the dust has settled…</i>

910
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,333
<i>one nation</i>

911
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,753
<i>will prove that they,</i>
<i>above all other nations,</i>

912
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:19,883
<i>have the best and most perfect physiques.</i>

913
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,305
<i>The time has come.</i>

914
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,975
<i>Please change into your uniforms.</i>

915
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,864
We're all getting changed, and…

916
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:42,948
It made me feel like,

917
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,576
"Okay, it's really happening,
we're really here."

918
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:49,413
Everyone suddenly got
this weird look in their eyes.

919
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:54,501
When I saw our uniform,
and the Philippines flag on our chests…

920
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,880
I felt a sense of pride.

921
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,551
I wasn't just an athlete,
I was representing my nation.

922
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,888
I felt a surge of patriotism.

923
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:12,728
We're here to do our flag proud,
to do Türkiye proud.

924
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,481
Indonesia, bro!

925
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,193
I take a lot of pride
in representing my home, Indonesia.

926
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,031
Upholding the honor
of my country and home is important to me.

927
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,460
Physical: Asia.

928
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,962
<i>Contestants,</i>

929
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:43,217
<i>we are here to determine which of</i>
<i>the eight nations represented here today</i>

930
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,469
<i>has the most perfect physiques.</i>

931
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,266
<i>If a participant</i>
<i>cannot perform their duties,</i>

932
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,603
<i>either due to injury</i>
<i>or unforeseen circumstances,</i>

933
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,022
<i>they will be replaced by an alternate.</i>

934
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,610
<i>The one surviving nation</i>
<i>at the end of the competition</i>

935
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,196
<i>will win…</i>

936
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,291
<i>the one billion…</i>

937
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,378
<i>the one billion…</i>

938
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,129
<i>…the one billion won prize.</i>

939
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,214
Wow.

940
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,008
That's crazy.

941
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,640
One billion.

942
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,601
Let's take that home!

943
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,271
- Holy moly.
- Great stack.

944
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,314
That's insane!

945
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,275
That much?

946
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,235
One billion won.

947
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,864
- Come on. Let's get it.
- Get paid.

948
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,242
<i>Good luck.</i>

949
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,453
<i>May the best team win,</i>
<i>and survive till the very end.</i>

950
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,168
<i>We will now take a moment</i>
<i>to invite the captains to speak.</i>

951
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,381
<i>Captain of South Korea, Kim Dong-hyun.</i>

952
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,260
I believe that true strength
comes from within,

953
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,804
and the resolve of our people
is the strongest in the world.

954
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,306
Through internal strength,

955
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,640
Korea shall win.

956
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,397
Japan is known as a nation of warriors,

957
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,774
of fighters, of great athletes alike.

958
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:27,362
We came to <i>Physical: Asia </i>to prove
to you the strength of our people.

959
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,364
Ready? Come at us!

960
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:37,372
We came here all the way from Türkiye,
on an eleven-hour flight.

961
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,625
We're not here to mess around.

962
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,584
For Türkiye!

963
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,877
With strength, we fight!

964
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,837
- Hear, hear!
- Bravo!

965
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,381
The fighting spirit of Muay Thai comes

966
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,759
from the heart of Thailand
and the hearts of Thai people.

967
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,303
It has strengthened us both
in body and soul,

968
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,513
and it will guide us to victory.

969
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,850
We are Mongolians,
descendants of Genghis Khan.

970
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,603
As a warrior nation,
we shall fight for our glory!

971
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,855
We didn't come here to play games,

972
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,815
we came here to win at all costs,

973
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,734
and we're gonna run through anyone
that gets in our way.

974
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,403
We are one team, with one purpose,

975
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,947
and that's winning!

976
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,782
Filipino is

977
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,283
a champion blood, so…

978
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,286
we will make sure
that we… we get the crown.

979
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,122
- Let's fight!
- Come on! Philippines!

980
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,376
The legend speaks.

981
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,299
Physical: Asia.

982
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:34,012
<i>Your very first quest</i>
<i>will begin momentarily.</i>

983
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:38,684
<i>With your nation's pride on the line,</i>
<i>please give it your all, and do your best.</i>

984
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,730
It's gonna be an all-out war
against all the other Asian countries.

985
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,691
I wanted to be more than formidable.

986
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,734
I wanted them to fear us.

987
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,071
I see us
being a very strong contender to win this.

988
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,815
Physical: Asia.

989
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,776
<i>The time has come.</i>

990
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,112
<i>Contestants, please enter the arena.</i>

991
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,119
Whoa, what's this?

992
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,580
- Wait. What is this?
- Sand.

993
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,582
Oh…

994
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,335
What is all this?

995
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,754
It's the big mound.

996
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,798
- All right. We're climbing up a hill.
- Yep.

997
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,091
What the hell?

998
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,552
Oh, my gosh, this is…

999
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,470
Amazing.

1000
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:39,679
What on earth?

1001
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,014
It's sand.

1002
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,808
Oh, I like the look of this.

1003
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,935
It looks like the desert from <i>Dune.</i>

1004
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,354
No way.

1005
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,064
What is this?

1006
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,398
Holy shit.

1007
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,942
Wow, wow, wow.

1008
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,779
It was pretty overwhelming to look at.

1009
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,031
I was worried we'd have to move the sand.

1010
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,991
Are we gonna run laps around it?

1011
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,077
Is this some kind of power play?

1012
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,205
Especially being a heavy athlete,
in the sand,

1013
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,665
might be a bit tricky.

1014
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,584
<i>Your first quest is…</i>

1015
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,923
<i>Territorial Conquest.</i>

1016
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,843
<i>Territorial Conquest.</i>

1017
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,344
Whoa!

1018
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,054
"Conquest", like a battle?

1019
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,222
Shit, shit.

1020
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,016
- Whoa. Oh, boy…
- Oh…

1021
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,018
- Ooh, here we go.
- Oh, sick.

1022
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,402
Oh, look. The sun is up.

1023
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,112
- It's risen.
- Yes, it has.

1024
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,580
<i>In Territorial Conquest,</i>

1025
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,082
<i>all eight nations will go head-to-head</i>

<i>in a race across the sands to conquer</i>
<i>the territory on top of the dune.</i>

1027

All at once.

1028
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,551
We have to fight for the top position.

1029
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,803
- Lots of physical contact?
- Sorry?

1030
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,388
- Lots of contact.
- Oh, yeah. A lot.

1031
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:06,516
That was the moment
when <i>Physical: Asia </i>really began.

1032
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,019
It was finally time to start fighting.

00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,691
I don't think most of the competitors

1037
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,902
were expecting a team challenge
right out of the gate.

1038
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,695
In the previous two seasons,

1039
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,031
the first challenges were all individual

1040
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,367
in order to assess each player
within the larger group.

1041
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,786
So I think this kind
of big, group challenge

1042
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,831
caught us all off-guard
by subverting our expectations.

1043
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,835
<i>I will now explain</i>
<i>the rules of Territorial Conquest.</i>

1044
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,339
There's four plots!

1045
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:40,717
<i>Your first quest, Territorial Conquest,</i>

1046
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:44,179
<i>will consist of three rounds total.</i>

1047
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,140
Oh-oh.

1048
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,935
Physical: Asia, <i>first quest,</i>

1049
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,938
<i>Territorial Conquest. Round one.</i>

1050
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,274
<i>You must conquer one of four plots.</i>

1051
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,820
<i>Each round will last two minutes.</i>

1052
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,449
That's really short.

1053
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,117
It's all reflexes.

1054
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,036
<i>Once time is called,</i>

1055
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:12,499
<i>whichever nation has the most contestants</i>
<i>on an individual plot,</i>

1056
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,501
<i>will have conquered that land</i>
<i>for their team.</i>

1057
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,835
Oh.

1058
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:16,753
Simple enough.

1059
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,922
But combat-heavy.

1060
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,507
We need as many of us

1061
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,841
as possible to stay on.

1062
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,510
That's easier said than done.

1063
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,594
Cause we want our numbers.

1064
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,513
We want as many people
as we can on the territory.

1065
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,306
We want everyone.

1066
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,933
<i>This first game</i>

1067
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:33,353
<i>requires physical combat</i>
<i>like pushing, pulling, and grabbing.</i>

1068
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,856
I've never really engaged

1069
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,401
in any kind of physical combat before.

1070
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,695
For the first quest, it was a lot.

1071
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,862
Least favorite game!

1072
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,406
I hate contact sports.

1073
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,657
I was confident.

1074
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,992
As a ssireum wrestler,

1075
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,161
I was used to fighting on sand.
I knew that I would do well.

ADIYASUREN
NATIONAL TEAM JUDOKA

1077
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,540
To be honest,
this game sounds really easy.

1078
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:57,294
I'm glad I'll be able
to utilize my strengths right away.

1079
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,879
<i>The four nations who've secured a plot</i>

1080
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,257
<i>will then move on to the next round.</i>

1081
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,720
<i>At that point,</i>
<i>the four plots will decrease to two.</i>

1082
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,849
<i>And, in the third and final round,</i>

1083
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,310
<i>two plots are reduced to one.</i>

1084
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:20,358
<i>At the end of the game, the nation</i>
<i>that conquers the last remaining plot</i>

1085
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,988
<i>will be declared the winner</i>
<i>of </i>Physical: Asia's <i>first quest,</i>

1086
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,990
<i>Territorial Conquest.</i>

1087
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:32,412
<i>Now, if two or more teams have an equal</i>
<i>amount of participants on one plot,</i>

1088
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,416
<i>an overtime match</i>
<i>will be called for that plot.</i>

1089
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:41,212
- I guess it's kind of like musical chairs.
- Yeah.

1090
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,506
But without any music or dancing.

1091
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,799
Three rounds.

1092
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,009
So pace yourselves.

1093
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,594
We want the first round.

1094
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,389
<i>The nation that places first</i>
<i>in Territorial Conquest</i>

1095
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,893
<i>will be given an advantage as a reward.</i>

1096
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,562
What did he say? They'll get an advantage?

1097
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,857
Wait, we need to hear.

1098
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,817
<i>The advantage for the winning team…</i>

1099
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,495
<i>is the right to decide</i>

1100
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,373
<i>the matchups for the second quest.</i>

1101
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,124
<i>…the matchups for the second quest.</i>

1102
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,584
Oh.

1103
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,669
That's a huge deal.

1104
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,339
<i>That means the winning team</i>

1105
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:28,051
<i>will get to select their own opponent</i>
<i>and everyone else's opponents.</i>

1106
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,636
Ah, so it's a tournament.

1107
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,763
Oh, we can make… We can pick. We can…

1108
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,014
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah, yeah.

1109
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,475
- We can handpick this comp, dude.
- Yeah.

1110
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,060
<i>Before we begin,</i>

1111
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,438
<i>all teams will be given</i>
<i>a starting position.</i>

1112
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:49,948
<i>To select a position,</i>
<i>each of the team captains</i>

1113
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:53,159
<i>must be first to place their hand</i>
<i>on one of the eight flagpoles.</i>

1114
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,620
Indonesia's the weakest team.

1115
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,913
We go for Indonesia.

1116
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,039
- All right.
- Okay.

1117
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,124
JUSTIN COVENEY
NATIONAL TEAM RUGBY PLAYER

1118
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,542
If you look at Indonesia's lineup,

1119
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,085
it's quite mixed,
just like the Philippines.

1120
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,337
Our size, we're just about the same,

1121
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,048
but knowing that they had certain athletes

1122
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:10,635
that also had
no background in combat sports.

1123
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,886
So I saw Indonesia

1124
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,346
as definitely someone to target.

1125
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,682
We've got Korea and Australia here,

1126
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,724
so maybe that way?

1127
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:17,642
You think so?

1128
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,894
I think Korea and Australia

1129
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,856
will both be strong competition. You know?

1130
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,899
If only because
they have the most balanced teams.

SOICHI HASHIMOTO
NATIONAL TEAM JUDOKA

1132
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,527
I don't think it matters.

1133
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,196
Does the position
really make a difference?

1134
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,283
It's a circle, so it doesn't really matter
where you start.

1135
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,534
There's also no advantage point

1136
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,078
because the giant dune
will always be blocking a team.

1137
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,329
It made no difference.

1138
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,664
We're a fearless team.

1139
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,082
We're not afraid of anybody.

1140
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,127
We are here to show everyone
our team is the strongest,

1141
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,962
that Türkiye is the strongest.

1142
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,631
And we didn't come here to lose.

1143
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,049
So we're a sporting nation,

1144
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,426
and we came here to win,

1145
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,803
and we are gonna run through anybody
that gets in our way.

1146
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,138
Anyone gets in our way?

Let's go, Rob.

1159
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,548
Come on.

1160
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,471
Let's go.

1161
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,311
Yes. Let's go.

1162
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,397
Australia got there before us.

1163
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,441
Our target was Indonesia,

1164
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,528
but almost immediately,
both neighboring spots were occupied.

1165
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,530

for the next open spot…

1167
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,867

00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,787
The other side!

1169
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,956
- It doesn't matter.
- It's okay, it doesn't matter.

1170
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,582
- It's okay, this is it.
- Doesn't matter.

1171
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,180
Go, go, go!

1172
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:28,106
Nice going, Bon. That was clever,
he just went straight there.

1173
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,985
We were mainly trying
to avoid Team Australia.

1174
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,446
Comparatively, their team was big.

1175
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,073
And if we wanted to win the first round,

1176
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,366
we needed to try and avoid them.

1177
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:42,870
<i>The selection has ended.</i>
<i>All starting positions are now set.</i>

1178
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,251

Let's have fun, guys!

1188
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:33,838
I'm ready to go. It's all for Indonesia,
so I'm gonna give it everything I've got.

1189
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:36,591
The national sport of Japan is Sumo.

1190
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:39,260
And this challenge is, at least,
partially inspired by it.

1191
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,554
And as a representative of my country,

1192
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,097
I can't lose this.

1193
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:47,226
Whatever happens, we're gonna
show them what Korea's made of.

Let's go.

1198
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:18,341
Here we go, here we go. Yep, that's it!

1199
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:19,967
Over here.

1200
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:27,767
- Go!
- Stay down! Stay down!
