PHYSICAL: ASIA

3
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:33,616
11. IMPENETRABLE FORTRESS

4
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,870
Physical: Asia.

5
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,997
<i>Fifth quest.</i>

6
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,708
<i>Castle conquest.</i>

7
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,004
<i>At the sound of the whistle,</i>

8
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,381
<i>you will transport a loaded supply wagon</i>

9
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,675
<i>to a destination within the castle.</i>

10
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,639
<i>To enter the castle,</i>

11
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,477
<i>you must lower the bridge</i>
<i>by pulling the lever on the castle wall.</i>

12
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,444
Okay, how do we get up there?

13
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,780
I think we climb the rope.

14
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,323
I think you're right.

15
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,704
<i>Since the bridge is too short,</i>

16
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,374
<i>you must utilize the support beams</i>
<i>scattered around the arena</i>

17
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,210
<i>in order to transport your cart.</i>

18
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,878
Ah. So that's what they're for.

19
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,590
<i>You will then use a battering ram</i>
<i>to open the castle gate.</i>

20
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,551
That's why it's got those handles.

21
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,761
Oh.

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,807
<i>Once the gate has opened,</i>

23
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>you must pull the cart so that</i>
<i>its front wheels cross the finish line.</i>

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,357
<i>After reaching the finish line…</i>

25
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,362
<i>you must then fully raise the draw bridge.</i>

26
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,533
MATCH OVER

27
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,160
<i>Only then will your quest be complete.</i>

28
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,162
<i>The team that takes the longest</i>

29
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,915
<i>to transport their supplies</i>
<i>and conquer the castle,</i>

30
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,917
<i>will be eliminated.</i>

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,001
Ah.

32
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,294
<i>…will be eliminated.</i>

33
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,004
Great. Thanks, guys.

34
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,382
<i>You must complete the quest</i>

35
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,925
<i>within one hour.</i>

36
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,431
<i>Any country that is unable to complete</i>
<i>the quest within the one hour time limit,</i>

37
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,143
- <i>will be up for elimination.</i>
- Wow.

38
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,730
<i>If two or more countries</i>
<i>are up for elimination,</i>

39
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,860
<i>then the time it took for the front wheels</i>
<i>of the cart to cross the finish line,</i>

40
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,821
<i>will be used</i>
<i>to determine the final standings.</i>

41
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,784
Wow, okay. So the stakes are real high.

42
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,704
I'd say the cart
was the size of a small truck,

43
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:46,040
<i>and it was packed to the brim</i>
<i>with crates and sandbags.</i>

44
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,043
<i>Our job was to push the entire cart</i>
<i>up the sand dune</i>

45
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,712
<i>and past the castle gates.</i>

46
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,089
<i>Our team's got this.</i>

47
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,842
<i>No one else stands a chance.</i>

48
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,721
<i>As we really demonstrated</i>
<i>in the shipwreck quest,</i>

49
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,558
<i>I think we're at our strongest</i>
<i>when we work as a whole team.</i>

50
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>With a bit of strategy,</i>
<i>we can do anything.</i>

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,772
<i>We'd place first, no problem.</i>

52
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,610
I think that moving this cart
is our top priority.

53
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,570
Let's try to get a feel
for the weight first.

54
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,865
BAGS + CRATES 1,400 KG
WAGON 800 KG

55
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,411
If it won't budge,
we can unload some of it.

56
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,621
<i>Ideally,</i>

57
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,916
we wanted to move the cart
without having to unload it.

58
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,710
<i>Moving bags wasn't difficult,</i>
<i>but we had a time limit.</i>

59
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,379
<i>So we didn't wanna move 'em</i>
<i>unless we had to.</i>

60
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,298
If we have to, we'll start with the sacks.

61
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,383
If it's still stuck, then we'll do crates.

62
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,468
As soon as we start,

63
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,012
Seung-yeon, you scale the wall,
and we'll move the barricades.

64
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,764
Then divide and conquer.

65
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,725
Sandbags, planks, battering ram. Okay?

66
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,310
<i>Everyone was given a job.</i>

67
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:51,397
We used the same strategy in the second
quest, and it made a huge difference.

68
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,691
<i>When you have a specific role to play,</i>

69
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,193
you're less likely to hesitate.

70
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,528
And you know exactly
how to help your team.

71
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,739
- Korea!
- Fight on!

72
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,535
<i>Fifth quest.</i>

73
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,037
<i>Castle conquest.</i>

74
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,914
Let's go! Treat it like the finals!

75
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,582
- <i>The game will begin…</i>
- I'm nervous.

76
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,000
<i>…at the sound of the whistle.</i>

77
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,211
<i>Stand by.</i>

78
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,633
<i>Ready.</i>

79
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,234
Wow, that's heavy.

80
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,443
Yeah, I know.

81
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,155
Together. One, two, three!

82
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,700
That's it.

83
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,579
<i>I was given a small solo mission.</i>

84
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,375
<i>My job was to run up the sand dune</i>
<i>and lower the bridge.</i>

85
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,128
<i>I was a bit anxious, but…</i>

86
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,048
<i>I rope climb all the time while training.</i>

87
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,720
<i>And in the gym,</i>
<i>you can really only rely on your arms.</i>

88
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,346
Let's give it a push.

89
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,890
Wow! Seung-yeon's nearly there!

90
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,600
Seriously? Already?

91
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,061
<i>I turned to check on Seung-yeon.</i>

92
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,856
<i>And somehow,</i>
<i>she'd managed to scale the wall</i>

93
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,149
<i>in the blink of an eye.</i>

94
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,234
<i>It was honestly pretty inspiring.</i>

95
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,242
<i>I mean, she's number one for a reason.</i>

96
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,749
Let's go. Be careful, Seung-yeon!

97
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,167
<i>When the bridge came down,</i>

98
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,670
<i>it felt like we'd opened</i>
<i>the path to victory.</i>

99
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,172
It was right at our fingertips,

100
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,840
we just had to take it.

101
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,508
Let's see what we're working with.

102
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,136
Okay. Come here, Min-jae.

103
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,847
- To the back?
- Yep. Eun-sil, you too. Okay.

104
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,266
All right. One, two, three!

105
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,770
- Two, three!
- It's working.

106
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,521
Hey! The cart is moving!

107
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,360
- Keep going.
- We go as far as we can!

108
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,404
<i>I didn't think it would budge,</i>

109
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,365
<i>but then we were rolling.</i>

110
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,532
<i>It was working.</i>

111
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,534
<i>It moved pretty fast at the start.</i>

112
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,204
<i>So, we kind of assumed it'd be easy.</i>

113
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,794
- One, two.
- One, two.

114
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,295
One, two.

115
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,465
One, two!

116
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,843
One, two!

117
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,846
One, two!

118
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,598
One, two!

119
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,517
- Come here, Seung-yeon.
- Got it.

120
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,937
One, two!

121
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,398
<i>Honestly, we were doing so well.</i>

122
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,566
<i>I thought we could push straight through.</i>

123
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,443
We were going up the hill.

124
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,986
Let's just try this first.

125
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,738
- One, two!
- Here we go!

126
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,323
One, two!

127
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,660
One, two!

128
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,913
One, two!

129
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,333
One, two! One!

130
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,459
One!

131
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,044
- This won't work.
- It's too heavy.

132
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,129
One!

133
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,422
This won't work.

134
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,715
Are we stuck?

135
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,092
- Let's unload.
- Come on, guys.

136
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,176
Sacks first.

137
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,553
- At least, we tried.
- Yep.

138
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,637
Let's go.

139
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,227
Throw them in that direction.

140
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,311
Okay.

141
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,731
- Unload everything?
- No.

142
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,275
Let's start with the bags.

143
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,027
- Okay.
- <i>Nobody suggested</i>

144
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,655
<i>that we stop to unload.</i>
<i>We just kinda did it.</i>

145
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,533
<i>We all jumped right in, no hesitation.</i>

146
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,412
- Climb down.
- Let's try again.

147
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,123
<i>We didn't touch the crates though.</i>

148
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,792
<i>Unloading those</i>
<i>would only be a last resort.</i>

149
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,378
I still remember the shipwreck mission.

150
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,797
And man, those things were heavy.

151
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,759
- Come on down. Let's go again.
- Okay.

152
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,138
<i>We were all determined</i>
<i>to keep pushing those crates up the hill.</i>

153
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,390
<i>It'd take too long to move them.</i>

154
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,601
One, two, three!

155
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,852
Two, three!

156
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,270
Two, three!

157
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,105
Two!

158
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,191
- One, two!
- Yes! It's working!

159
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,859
- All right, use your legs.
- Brace yourself.

160
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,528
- This part's the hardest.
- Okay. One, two!

161
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,655
<i>On the second push,</i>

162
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,157
<i>the cart got stuck again.</i>

163
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,910
It moved a tiny bit, but then stopped.

164
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,871
One, two, three!

165
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,955
Oh, no.

166
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,290
- Three!
- Three!

167
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,125
- Oh, no.
- One!

168
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,586
- Push! Two, three!
- It's stuck!

169
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,962
One, two, three!

170
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,882
- One.
- One, two, three!

171
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,176
Come on! One, two, three!

172
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,844
One, two, three!

173
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,013
Push! One, two, three!

174
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,058
One, two, three!

175
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,684
One, two, three!

176
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,520
One, two, three!

177
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,856
<i>I mean, we were pushing.</i>

178
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,194
<i>But we couldn't get a foothold.</i>
<i>We just kept sinking into the sand.</i>

179
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,029
<i>The cart didn't move at all.</i>

180
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,489
<i>It was like a wall on wheels.</i>

181
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,491
<i>Three!</i>

182
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,201
<i>I just had this bad feeling…</i>

183
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,453
<i>One! </i>

184
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:01,123
<i>…that despite our best efforts,</i>
<i>it wasn't going to work.</i>

185
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,334
<i>We had to stop to unload the cart.</i>

186
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,170
<i>I didn't want to admit it,</i>
<i>but we had no choice.</i>

187
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,047
One, two, three!

188
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,131
The bag!

189
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,676
- Under the wheel.
- Okay.

190
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,678
No, we have to unload.
Come on, help me up.

191
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,929
All right, all together.

192
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,516
<i>We were worried</i>
<i>that the cart would slide back down again.</i>

193
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,143
<i>So we used the sacks to lock the wheels.</i>

194
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,187
<i>We secured the cart,</i>

195
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,065
<i>and we all climbed up,</i>
<i>and threw the crates down.</i>

196
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,737
<i>We were all trying to avoid</i>
<i>this situation, but we have no choice.</i>

197
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,656
<i>We had to deal with it.</i>

198
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,618
- Be careful.
- Got it.

199
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,703
Okay.

200
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,288
- One, two!
- Remove it from here.

201
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,998
- Careful.
- Slowly.

202
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,749
- Watch out.
- Okay.

203
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,502
<i>All of the crates were heavy.</i>

204
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,629
<i>They were hard to throw off.</i>

205
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,881
<i>So, knowing we'd have to put them back,</i>

206
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,884
it was discouraging.
It felt like we'd already lost.

207
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,012
Move aside, Min-jae.

208
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,221
<i>I kept thinking,</i>

209
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,931
<i>"Man, we're in trouble."</i>

210
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,100
As fast as you can.

211
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,393
We don't have much time.

212
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,604
- Hold on.
- Just throw it on the floor!

213
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,064
Okay. Let's go.

214
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,567
- Come on, we need to hurry.
- Let's go.

215
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,860
- We're short on time.
- Right.

216
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,987
- Come on!
- One, two, three!

217
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,322
- Two, three!
- One, two.

218
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,866
- Two, three!
- One, two.

219
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,368
One, two!

220
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,163
One, two!

221
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,125
One, two! One, two!

222
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,420
One, two!

223
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,921
- Almost there!
- Let's go!

224
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,840
One, two!

225
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,924
Little more!

226
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,177
One, two!

227
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,261
One, two!

228
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,346
Come on!

229
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,639
One, two!

230
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,600
<i>The closer we got to the top,</i>

231
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,602
<i>the heavier the cart started to feel.</i>

232
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,520
<i>You'd think it'd get easier, but…</i>

233
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,482
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>maybe it was all psychological.</i>

234
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,566
- Come on!
- One, two!

235
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,777
- Almost there!
- Push!

236
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,281
Push!

237
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,949
- Okay!
- Okay. One, two!

238
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,619
- Okay!
- Okay. One, two!

239
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,703
- One, two!
- Harder!

240
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,705
One more! One, two!

241
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,416
- One, two! One more!
- Okay!

242
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,377
Okay, we're good. We did it.

243
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,589
Sacks.

244
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,969
<i>We wasted a lot of time</i>
<i>pushing the cart up the hill.</i>

245
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,554
<i>So we had to load it quickly.</i>

246
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,891
<i>Seeing just how much cargo we had</i>

247
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,726
<i>was really stressful.</i>

248
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,145
<i>Going up and down the hill,</i>

249
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,564
<i>I thought, "How long's it gonna take?"</i>

250
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,359
All right. Bring these up,

251
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,278
then we'll move the crates together.

252
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,831
Faster, we have to make up our time.

253
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,378
Sung-bin, let's grab this.

254
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,964
- One sec.
- On three, okay.

255
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,340
Oh, yeah. One, two, three!

256
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,925
Wow!

257
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,261
Watch out.

258
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,143
Okay, drop it here.

259
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,688
And flip. Okay.

260
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,400
Great. Seung-yeon, just fill that gap!

261
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,694
- We're almost done!
- Just a few more!

262
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,778
Let's do this.

263
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,238
- One, two!
- One, two, three!

264
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,116
<i>We could handle the bags. But the crates…</i>

265
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,077
<i>those were going to be difficult</i>
<i>to reload.</i>

266
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,203
<i>One, two, three!</i>

267
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,331
<i>One, two, three!</i>

268
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,458
<i>Okay.</i>

269
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,502
<i>Unloading is one thing,</i>
<i>but lifting back up is tough.</i>

270
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,018
All by himself? Way to go!

271
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,437
Watching Min-jae handle those crates…

272
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,230
was pretty inspiring.

273
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,690
One, two, three!

274
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,567
<i>We'd built this little staircase,</i>

275
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,486
<i>and had been carrying them in pairs,</i>

276
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,280
<i>but he just…</i>

277
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,699
<i>hauled 'em up the hill and threw 'em over.</i>

278
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,452
<i>I mean he is</i>
<i>the Strongest Man Under Heaven.</i>

279
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,247
Oh, shoot.

280
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,918
<i>At the rate we were moving,</i>

281
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,544
<i>we'd finish in no time.</i>

282
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,005
Seung-yeon, the battering ram!

283
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,717
Are you sure we can carry it?

284
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,012
- Here, grab that.
- Okay.

285
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,096
One, two, three.

286
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,432
One, two, three. Okay.

287
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,309
One, two, three. Okay.

288
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,393
Here we go.

289
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,149
<i>I figured it might be too heavy</i>
<i>for us to carry all the way.</i>

290
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,320
One sec.

291
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,823
<i>But we still wanted to move it</i>

292
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,282
<i>as far as we could.</i>

293
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,493
One, two, three.

294
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,121
<i>It was extremely dense.</i>

295
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,168
<i>I wouldn't have been able to move it</i>
<i>myself. But Eun-sil's really strong.</i>

296
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,296
<i>So we managed to get it up the hill,</i>
<i>just the two of us.</i>

297
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,550
- Set it here.
- Okay.

298
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,594
Okay.

299
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,474
Let's go, one, two, three!

300
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,810
Great.

301
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,438
- Let's go!
- Nice job.

302
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,190
All right, now for the door.

303
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,776
- Okay, here we go.
- Ready?

304
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,111
One, two, three!

305
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,613
Okay.

306
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,532
- How'd you wanna do this?
- Let's aim for center.

307
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,409
- All right. Let's do it.
- One and done.

308
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,536
- Okay. On three. Get ready.
- One!

309
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,620
Two!

310
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,622
- Let's go!
- Three!

311
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,044
- Again.
- On three.

312
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,963
Higher. Okay, ready?

313
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,256
One!

314
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,009
- Two!
- Okay, aim!

315
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,763
One last time.

316
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,057
<i>We didn't have time to count to three.</i>

317
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,350
- Let's hit on two.
- Okay.

318
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,603
- One!
- Let's go!

319
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,855
- Let's go again.
- Almost there.

320
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,441
- Let's go again.
- Almost there.

321
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,609
As hard as we can!

322
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,902
- On two.
- Ready?

323
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,904
One! Two!

324
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,572
- Two!
- One!

325
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,909
Come on!

326
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,827
- Got it.
- Let's go. Push! Come on.

327
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,581
CASTLE GATES CLEARED

328
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,665
Come on.

329
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,791
Let's go, guys.

330
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,960
- Come on, Min-jae!
- Coming.

331
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,712
- Almost there.
- We're nearly there.

332
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,548
- One!
- Two! Let's do this!

333
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,800
- And push!
- Okay.

334
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,886
- It's moving!
- Come on!

335
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,555
- Right to the finish line.
- Don't stop, guys!

336
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,475
Whoa, stop! Wait!

337
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,060
Whoa, stop! Wait!

338
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,561
It's caught on the side.

339
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,774
Wait! We need to back up. Back up!

340
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,610
<i>I thought we were screwed.</i>

341
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,654
We need to back up.

342
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,614
I'll angle it from the front.

343
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,913
- Dong-hyun, come here.
- Got it.

344
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,540
- Back up a bit. Just a bit more.
- Come on, guys.

345
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,625
Ready!

346
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,543
One, two, three!

347
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,628
It's not working.

348
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,630
- Two, three!
- It's not working.

349
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,132
<i>Amotti and I couldn't move it over at all.</i>

350
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,926
<i>Given the other setbacks,</i>

351
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,719
<i>if we took too long to re-angle the cart,</i>

352
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,888
<i>we would lose.</i>

353
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,723
Here, pull it back a bit more.

354
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,144
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

355
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,729
One, two, three!

356
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,189
One, two, three!

357
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,691
- Almost got it.
- Two, three!

358
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,693
<i>But once Sung-bin came to help,</i>

359
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,820
<i>we managed to slowly move the cart.</i>

360
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,655
<i>The guy's really strong.</i>

361
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,244
As expected, Sung-bin's just a powerhouse.

362
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,662
One, two, three!

363
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,539
- Okay!
- One, two!

364
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,790
One, two, three!

365
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,750
One, two!

366
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,293
One, two, three!

367
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,380
One, two, three!

368
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,464
Okay, we're good.

369
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,549
Let's go!

370
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,801
Okay!

371
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,511
Almost there!

372
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,722
All right, let's run!

373
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,806
Let's push.

374
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,891
- Pull!
- Keep pulling!

375
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,518
Come on, guys. We're in.

376
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,313
<i>I could see the finish line</i>
<i>right in front of us,</i>

377
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,982
<i>we just had to get across.</i>

378
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,275
- One, two!
- From the back.

379
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,990
One, two, three!

380
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,868
One, two, three!

381
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,662
Two, three!

382
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,375
- Let's go! All the way!
- We can't stop, come on!

383
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,461
- We're nearly there!
- Come on!

384
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,464
All together. Come on! Together!

385
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,300
One last push. Then never again.

386
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,260
Let's finish this!

387
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,889
<i>I think that final stretch</i>
<i>of sand was the hardest part.</i>

388
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,183
<i>We had to use the last of our strength.</i>

389
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,143
Let's finish this!

390
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,481
One, two, three!

391
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,442
<i>Maybe we were just too burnt out.</i>

392
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,069
<i>But it really wouldn't move.</i>

393
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,029
Come on, let's push on three.

394
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,365
Ready? One, two, three!

395
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,909
Let's go again. Here we go.

396
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,954
One! Two! Three!

397
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,416
We have to push! Come on!

398
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,210
One, two.

399
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,419
<i>The cart just stopped moving</i>

400
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,546
<i>'cause of the sand on the wheels.</i>

401
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,216
<i>We were racing against the clock.</i>

402
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,051
<i>We couldn't afford to stop.</i>

403
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,262
<i>Why did it have to stop</i>
<i>in front of the finish line?</i>

404
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,889
<i>It made me so anxious.</i>

405
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,308
Hey! Help me clear the sand.

406
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,852
Hurry.

407
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,646
Come on!

408
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,481
That's it.

409
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,024
Okay, good. Good.

410
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,860
- Again. It should move now.
- Get in position!

411
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,029
All together! One more go!

412
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,533
One! Two! Three!

413
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,326
Three!

414
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,411
- Okay.
- Okay.

415
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,997
- Okay.
- We're good.

416
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,457
- We're moving again.
- Yeah. Let's go.

417
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,794
- Almost.
- We're right there, guys!

418
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,879
We're right there, guys!

419
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,131
Just over the ridge.

420
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,590
Just over the ridge.

421
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,842
Then we're done.

422
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,926
One last shove.

423
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:00,305
- Ready?
- One! Two! Three!

424
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,266
Keep pushing!

425
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,976
Three!

426
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,060
Keep pushing!

427
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,271
- Again!
- One more time!

428
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,689
Pull back, then one!

429
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,607
Two!

430
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,692
Three!

431
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,901
Again! Just like that!

432
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,320
- It's not moving. Come on.
- No, stop.

433
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,532
<i>Seriously,</i>
<i>that finish line was infuriating.</i>

434
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,325
<i>It's like it was taunting us.</i>

435
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:25,289
One! Two! Three!

436
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,748
Three!

437
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,960
Three!

438
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,170
Three!

439
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,593
- We did it!
- Okay!

440
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,802
It's over!

441
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,220
- We did it!
- Okay!

442
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,680
- It's over!
- All right.

443
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,764
FINISH LINE CLEARED

444
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,183
We're good, guys!

445
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,352
<i>There was no time to celebrate.</i>

446
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,689
<i>The second we crossed the finish line,</i>

447
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,735
<i>we went to grab the ropes</i>
<i>to close the gate.</i>

448
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,528
- Here. This one.
- Where?

449
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,156
All right.

450
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,158
<i>The worst part was behind us.</i>

451
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,869
<i>All we had to do was raise the bridge.</i>

452
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,371
<i>And then, it would all be over.</i>

453
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,915
Ready? And, pull!

454
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,756
We didn't know how much it
weighed, but for a wooden bridge,

455
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,382
<i>it was quite heavy.</i>

456
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,093
<i>I wasn't sure we had the manpower.</i>

457
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,722
We need to back up. Get back!

458
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,267
Let's move back. Past the cart, let's go.

459
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,518
Even further.

460
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,811
Keep going.

461
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,271
You're still too close, Min-jae.

462
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,899
<i>We knew the bridge would be tricky.</i>

463
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,400
<i>So we came up with a strategy.</i>

464
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,779
<i>If we're using a pulley,</i>
<i>we should treat it like tug-of-war.</i>

465
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,948
<i>Pull straight back,</i>
<i>as far back as we can go.</i>

466
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:45,786
Once we make sure both sides are even,
we'll pull together. Sound good?

467
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,913
<i>The closer you stand to the pulley,</i>

468
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,625
the less force you exert, so you need
to compensate with distance.

469
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,419
The farther away you are,
the more you can lift.

470
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,963
One more step, Min-jae.

471
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,173
You too, Eun-sil. All set?

472
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,841
All right, ready?

473
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,176
One, two!

474
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,386
One, two!

475
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,679
That's it! One! Two!

476
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,222
One, two!

477
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,431
One, two.

478
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,849
That's it! One! Two!

479
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,309
One, two!

480
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,519
One, two!

481
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,062
One, two!

482
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,397
One, two!

483
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,731
One, two!

484
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,441
One, two!

485
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,526
One, two!

486
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,611
<i>Every time we pulled,</i>
<i>we got a little stronger,</i>

487
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,071
<i>and it went a little higher.</i>

488
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,489
One, two!

489
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,573
One, two!

490
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,286
<i>I pulled until my veins popped</i>
<i>and my knuckles turned white.</i>

491
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,620
One, two!

492
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,871
One, two!

493
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,956
One, two!

494
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,541
One, two!

495
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,709
One, two!

496
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,043
Come on!

497
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,796
One, two!

498
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,880
One, two!

499
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,299
One, two!

500
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,550
One, two!

501
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,889
One, two!

502
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,100
Let's go!

503
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,563
One! Let's go!

504
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,155
Nice!

505
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,659
<i>Game over.</i>

506
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,914
Nice.

507
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,595
Great job, guys.

508
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,933
- Nice job…
- We crushed it!

509
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,227
- We did great.
- Nonstop, guys.

510
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,521
We made it for sure.

511
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,856
I got you.

512
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,524
Hey!

513
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,360
Nice job, Sung-bin. You killed it.

514
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,028
Seriously.

515
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,571
Whoa…

516
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,781
I can't breathe.

517
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,076
<i>I think that's the hardest quest</i>
<i>I've ever done.</i>

518
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,327
<i>That was something else.</i>

519
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:55,290
I really did give it my all. Literally,
that took some years off my life.

520
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,125
Let's go!

521
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,460
<i>Of course I was tired.</i>

522
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,836
<i>But still,</i>

523
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,505
the second the gate slammed shut,

524
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,465
I felt unstoppable.

525
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,761
<i>After it ended, I got chills.</i>
<i>I couldn't believe we did that.</i>

526
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,679
Honestly, if we lose this,

527
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,433
kudos to the winner.
I'm just proud of what we did today.

528
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,019
Yeah, and not everything went as planned.

529
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,814
<i>We had to stop to unload the cart twice,</i>

530
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,190
<i>and then at the castle,</i>

531
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,068
<i>we spent a lot of time shifting the cart.</i>

532
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:27,280
It's hard to not have any regrets,
but I did my best. I know I did.

533
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,700
All right, you start, Min-jae.

534
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,161
- Korea!
- Fight on!

535
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,455
Okay!

536
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,008
Physical: Asia<i>.</i>

537
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,721
<i>Team Mongolia, please enter the arena.</i>

538
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,434
- Okay.
- Let's go!

539
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,479
What is this?

540
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,817
It looks like a defensive line.
Like a war zone.

541
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,112
<i>All I could do was stare.</i>

542
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,281
<i>Wow…</i>

543
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,450
<i>Just the scale of it took me by surprise.</i>

544
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,828
<i>It was straight out of a history book.</i>

545
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,914
<i>A large, foreboding castle,</i>

546
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,750
<i>in the middle of a battlefield,</i>
<i>waiting to be conquered.</i>

547
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,670
<i>The setup was intriguing.</i>

548
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,840
<i>And I got the sense that this challenge</i>

549
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,843
<i>would be more intense</i>
<i>than anything we'd faced so far.</i>

550
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,179
Wow, great, my heart's pounding again.

551
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,682
I mean, we used to do this all the time.

552
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,143
- So it's not much of a challenge for us…
- Yeah, during the Mongolian Empire.

553
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,311
…is it?

554
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,105
Historically speaking, Mongolia

555
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,401
is famously known
for conquering fortresses and land.

556
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,571
<i>I think we'll be able to capture it</i>
<i>without any issues.</i>

557
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,031
<i>Yeah.</i>

558
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,199
<i>And we'll be fast.</i>

559
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,533
<i>Faster than the others.</i>

560
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,911
We just have to get the cart up there
as soon as we can.

561
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,746
- Yeah, you're right. So we could--
- How should we do this?

562
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,956
- Let's start with cargo.
- Right, we can do it quickly.

563
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,958
We'll start by unloading the cart. Great.

564
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,795
While we do that, we should
also try to clear the barricades.

565
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,548
Once it's empty,
we'll be able to move the cart.

566
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:12,344
We'll get it onto the bridge, we'll grab
the cargo, and load it up again.

567
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,597
It's a good plan. I've got this.

568
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,434
All right team, you ready?

569
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,519
Let's go.

570
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,938
<i>Stand by.</i>

571
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,317
<i>No, I wasn't nervous at all.</i>

572
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,903
<i>As a team, uh,</i>

573
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,323
<i>we've always been at our strongest</i>
<i>when the six of us work together.</i>

574
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,243
Of course, there can only be one winner.
Mongolia!

575
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,828
- <i>Ready.</i>
- Ready! Yeah!

576
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,872
No hesitation, guys.

577
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,833
Let's go!

578
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,252
Come on.

579
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,004
Over here.

580
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,130
We'll lift together.

581
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,591
Okay, here we go.

582
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,134
Careful, nice, nice.

583
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:54,970
Watch out.

584
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,723
<i>While everyone else cleared</i>
<i>the path, I went to clear out the cargo.</i>

585
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,933
<i>And I just…</i>

586
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:03,645
<i>started throwing.</i>
<i>Whatever I could pick up, I threw off.</i>

587
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,980
<i>I had to be fast.</i>

588
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,775
<i>There was no time to think, I just had</i>
<i>to empty it as fast as possible.</i>

589
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,699
<i>Wall climbing isn't too</i>
<i>far removed from acrobatics.</i>

590
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,369
<i>So sprinting over and scaling the wall</i>
<i>wasn't much of a challenge.</i>

591
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,871
I could lower the bridge right away.

592
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,802
Nice work.

593
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,970
You're doing great!

594
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,932
<i>We're all pretty strong,</i>
<i>so moving the crates was easy.</i>

595
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,897
Let's take these two.

596
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,277
- No hesitation.
- Nope.

597
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,279
- Just keep going.
- We've got this.

598
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,822
Okay, support beams.

599
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,073
Let's finish the bridge.

600
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,075
Let's try it.

601
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,910
Maybe I can-- Great.

602
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,377
- I'll take the back. Ready to push?
- I'm ready.

603
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,462
Let's go.

604
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,672
Everyone in the back. Okay.

605
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,507
- Got it!
- Let's go, team.

606
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,967
- Ready?
- Push!

607
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,136
- Ready! Set!
- Watch your step.

608
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,554
Push!

609
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,514
Push!

610
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:25,268
Okay, one. Two. One. Two. One. Two.

611
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,938
<i>The cart was deceptively heavy.</i>
<i>It was difficult to manage.</i>

612
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,023
Two!

613
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,609
<i>I think a lot of the problems</i>
<i>were terrain-based.</i>

614
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,819
<i>The wheels just sunk into the sand.</i>

615
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,155
<i>We needed everyone.</i>

616
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,240
Come here, you two!

617
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,617
- Help us push it up the hill!
- One! Two!

618
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,036
Okay. Coming.

619
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,540
One, two, three.

620
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,001
One, two, three.

621
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,463
One! Two! One! Two! One! Two!

622
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,423
- That's it! Come on!
- One! Two!

623
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,716
One! Two!

624
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,009
One!

625
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,887
One! Two!

626
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,348
One! Two!

627
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,974
One! Two!

628
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,435
<i>It was really tough</i>
<i>pushing the cart uphill.</i>

629
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,729
- One!
- One, two, three.

630
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,107
One, two. Come on, push!

631
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,901
<i>I didn't think it'd be as hard as it was.</i>

632
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,736
<i>It kept pushing back on us.</i>

633
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,322
- <i>Our feet kept sinking.</i>
- One!

634
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,700
- Two! One!
- Push!

635
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,619
<i>But we just kept going, we never stopped.</i>

636
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,413
Keep going! Push. Come on!

637
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,082
- Two! One, two.
- Almost!

638
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,750
- One!
- Come on!

639
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,711
- Great work, guys!
- Hold on!

640
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,045
HILL CLEARED

641
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,505
- Stay there so it doesn't roll.
- It won't.

642
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,006
Lift in the middle.

643
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,466
Let me get this.

644
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,219
- Here, last one.
- It's fine.

645
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,429
There, it fits.

646
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,513
- Great.
- Ready?

647
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,890
- I think we're good.
- Okay, one, two! Three!

648
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,727
Again! One, two!

649
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,105
One, two, three!

650
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,275
One! Push harder! One!

651
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,985
- Almost, almost!
- Go, go, go, go!

652
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,820
Wait! We need to ram the door!

653
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,071
- Right, right.
- Let's go.

654
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,364
Come on.

655
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,242
- The two of you should go there.
- Are you sure?

656
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,662
Okay.

657
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,122
One, two, three.

658
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,415
Here we go.

659
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,334
Let's break it down.

660
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,921
<i>I felt like it was the</i>
<i>perfect challenge for our team to take on.</i>

661
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,217
Can we ram it from that angle?

662
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,178
- Yeah. All together.
- Okay, let's back up.

663
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,472
- Get ready.
- Let's aim for one side.

664
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,681
- Okay.
- Ready?

665
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,391
One, two!

666
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,895
One, two!

667
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,521
One, two!

668
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,399
<i>Hitting the center of</i>
<i>the door would make it harder to break.</i>

669
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,152
<i>So instead we focused on one side.</i>

670
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,945
- Ready!
- One! Two! Three!

671
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,908
One, two, three!

672
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,910
BROKE THROUGH
THE CASTLE GATES

673
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,248
- Let's go!
- Hurry!

674
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,001
<i>Luckily,</i>
<i>it only took a few hits to get inside.</i>

675
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,836
- Move over there!
- Let's get this out of the way.

676
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,048
<i>It was surprisingly easy,</i>
<i>almost like I'd done it before.</i>

677
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,300
<i>Like that's how I've always</i>
<i>entered my house.</i>

678
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,760
Let's load it up!

679
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,428
Help!

680
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,806
- Get up here!
- Okay, we're over here.

681
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,516
- Here.
- I'm coming up.

682
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,100
- Ready?
- Got it.

683
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,478
Yeah, grab them quickly, okay?

684
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,313
Everything needs to be loaded.

685
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,194
<i>We had to move fast.</i>

686
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,404
<i>We couldn't afford to take any breaks.</i>

687
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,991
<i>There was so much left we had to do.</i>
<i>We had to be fast.</i>

688
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,954
<i>None of us wanted</i>
<i>to waste time or any additional energy,</i>

689
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,622
<i>which is why we stuck to the plan.</i>

690
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,915
All right.

691
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,961
Watch out, Ochir! Move back.
We're throwing.

692
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,587
Hand me those.

693
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,672
The farthest ones.

694
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,677
- This is it.
- Careful.

695
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,929
- Come on, come on. Yeah!
- Ready?

696
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,139
Someone needs to steer up front.

697
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,016
- One sec.
- Get ready to push.

698
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,227
On three! Ready, set, push!

699
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,645
- Ready, set, push!
- One, two!

700
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,814
- Don't stop now!
- Ready? Push!

701
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,274
- As hard as you can, okay?
- Let's go!

702
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,817
Let's go, guys! That's it!

703
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,943
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Push!

704
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,736
- Push! Don't stop!
- Straight ahead!

705
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,489
- Keep going!
- Almost there, okay! Go, go, go!

706
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,032
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Push!

707
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,117
Push!

708
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,995
Last push, we're almost there!

709
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,205
- All right, all together now!
- We've got this!

710
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,040
- Keep pushing!
- Push!

711
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,542
Go! Go!

712
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,669
Push!

713
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,215
We're in!

714
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,302
- Hold on. We need to cross the line first!
- Shoot, you're right.

715
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,511
- Push again!
- Straight ahead.

716
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,971
- Over the ridge.
- It's that way.

717
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,347
Hurry up.

718
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,349
Push!

719
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,811
<i>Of course, right at the end,</i>
<i>just as we're about to cross,</i>

720
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,774
<i>our wheels got stuck in the sand,</i>
<i>and the cart wouldn't budge.</i>

721
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,486
<i>Of all the times to get stuck, why then?</i>

722
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,572
<i>You know? Why'd it have to be so painful?</i>

723
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,408
One! Two! Three!

724
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,746
The wheels are stuck! Wait!

725
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,456
I'm gonna push 'em.

726
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,791
Push the wheels!

727
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,126
Push the wheels!

728
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,921
One, two, go!

729
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,382
<i>We had to pivot really quickly.</i>

730
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,427
<i>Thankfully, once we had</i>
<i>four people pushing the wheels,</i>

731
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,095
<i>it began to move again.</i>

732
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,431
- Two, three!
- Yes!

733
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,308
Two, three!

734
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,726
Yes! It's moving!

735
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,603
- One, two, three!
- Keep going!

736
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,065
One, two, three!

737
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,860
One, two, three!

738
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,614
One, two, three!

739
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,783
Two, three!

740
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,536
- One meter!
- Almost!

741
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,622
Two, three!

742
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,751
- Just a little more!
- Push!

743
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,045
- One, two, three!
- So close!

744
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,714
- Again!
- One, two, three!

745
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,591
- We're right there!
- Just one more!

746
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,635
- Come on!
- Ready? One!

747
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,428
- Two!
- And…

748
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,554
- Two!
- And…

749
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,639
Three!

750
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,351
One, two, three!

751
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,144
Come on! Harder!

752
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,189
- We're right there!
- One, two, three!

753
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,694
CROSSED THE FINISH LINE

754
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,907
- We good?
- We made it!

755
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,283
- We good?
- We made it!

756
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,285
Okay! The gate!

757
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,037
Let me check.

758
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,253
I think it's been about 15 minutes.

759
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,713
Let's hurry and close it.

760
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,631
What are we doing?

761
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,719
- Raising the bridge.
- Come on! Let's close it!

762
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,138
Adiya, Orkhon, take the back positions.

763
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,181
- I can grab it.
- Let's move back.

764
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,642
- Go there.
- Three people each side.

765
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,894
- Got it.
- All right. Let's see.

766
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,858
- Let's use the cart.
- I'll grab the rope.

767
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,151
Yeah, exactly.

768
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,360
Let's tie it.

769
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,990
<i>The bridge was heavy,</i>
<i>but so was that supply cart.</i>

770
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,492
<i>So why not use it to give us more power?</i>

771
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,663
One, two, three!

772
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,956
- Pull!
- Again!

773
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,043
- One, two, three!
- Again!

774
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,837
- One, two…
- Three!

775
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,256
It won't close.

776
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,803
- Again!
- Okay, ready! One, two, three!

777
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,140
<i>Closing that bridge</i>
<i>was the hardest part of the whole quest.</i>

778
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,350
<i>Nothing else even came close.</i>

779
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,687
<i>There was no real way</i>
<i>of knowing how heavy it was,</i>

780
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,980
<i>but it weighed a ton.</i>

781
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,108
<i>We were pulling so hard,</i>
<i>we started to sink.</i>

782
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,320
<i>I knew there had to be</i>
<i>some way to close it,</i>

783
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,031
<i>but it was hard to think while lifting.</i>

784
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,785
<i>It just caught me off-guard,</i>
<i>it was way more difficult than I expected.</i>

785
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,661
<i>The gate just didn't budge.</i>

786
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,915
- Only the carriage is moving.
- Pull!

787
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,750
- The bridge isn't.
- Again!

788
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,337
<i>I don't know, I just… I was at a loss.</i>

789
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,838
<i>My mind went completely blank.</i>

790
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,007
We're between 15 and 20 minutes.

791
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,803
<i>Of course, I trust my</i>
<i>teammates. But I was really freaked out.</i>

792
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,013
<i>I was worried we'd get eliminated.</i>

793
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,140
<i>It tripped us up.</i>

794
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,726
<i>I think we all panicked a bit.</i>

795
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,730
Hey, Khanda, Adiya, over here!
We need you.

796
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,650
<i>You could almost hear the clock ticking.</i>

797
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,905
Oh, wait, wait! I've have an idea.

798
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,157
Come on! Help me, lift this up!

799
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,575
Let's try something.

800
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,494
Take this.

801
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,579
We're gonna wrap the rope around it,

802
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,124
and then use the log to pull.
It's too heavy.

803
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,459
Wrap the ropes around theses ones.

804
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,170
Come on, come on! Wait!

805
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,714
Orkhon, come here. Lift this.

806
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,425
- This thing?
- Wrap the ropes around these ones.

807
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,887
- Come on, come on! Hurry! Lift!
- Are we throwing it?

808
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,806
- No, we'll just hold it up.
- What do you mean?

809
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,349
It'll work! Just trust me.

810
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,227
- What's the point of using the log?
- For the weight!

811
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,520
- I don't get it.
- Trust me!

812
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,896
How do we do this?

813
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,439
Just like this.

814
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,733
Here. Help me out.

815
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,818
Let's wind it up.

816
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,570
As tight as we can. Come on, now.

817
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,198
- It's not heavy enough. Fine, I'll try it.
- Please, just trust me!

818
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,576
- I still don't get it though.
- Here, wrap it a bit tighter.

819
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,286
- We're wrapping it?
- Just do it.

820
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,871
That's it, that's it…

821
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,832
<i>Honestly,</i>
<i>I think everyone was a little bit lost.</i>

822
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,210
But at the time,
it was the only idea we had.

823
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:15,089
So, regardless of how anyone felt,
we all just kind of went with it.

824
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,133
<i>And we started wrapping the log.</i>

825
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,510
- Like that!
- Yeah, but let's go this way.

826
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,847
<i>So I wasn't sure how much</i>
<i>the battering ram weighed,</i>

827
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,933
<i>but I knew we needed four people</i>
<i>to carry it.</i>

828
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,019
<i>So, if we used the battering ram,</i>

829
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,188
<i>and combined its weight with our own,</i>

830
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,941
<i>I figured we'd be able to exert just</i>
<i>enough force to close the gate again.</i>

831
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,236
- Okay, now what?
- Is this going to work?

832
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,654
I guess we'll see.

833
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,825
Get ready to pull!

834
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,368
- Wait, watch out.
- A little lower.

835
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,079
- That's it! Okay, just hold on tight now!
- Hey! Watch your hands!

836
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,624
One, two, three!

837
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,751
- Watch out!
- Come on!

838
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,588
…three…

839
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,632
- Watch out!
- Come on!

840
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,091
It worked! Keep pulling!

841
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,010
<i>As soon as we pushed down,</i>

842
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:05,097
<i>the gate began to rise. It was slow,</i>
<i>didn't move much, but it did move.</i>

843
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,974
- Pull! Come on!
- Let's go!

844
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,143
- One more time!
- Here! I've got it.

845
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,853
- One, two, three!
- Should we push harder?

846
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,024
<i>We sat on the log to keep it steady,</i>

847
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,859
<i>and then started pulling again.</i>

848
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,528
And pull!

849
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,579
One, two, three!

850
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,789
Yes!

851
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,416
- One, two…
- Got it!

852
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,502
…three!

853
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,920
Yes!

854
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,258
One, two, three!

855
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,386
Three!

856
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,518
…two, three!

857
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,729
High five!

858
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,816
<i>Game over.</i>

859
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,110
- Yes! We did it, yeah.
- Did we make it?

860
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,444
You're the best.

861
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,572
You should thank our tactician.

862
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,283
Great job, team.

863
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,034
And you, Orgil.

864
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,662
You crazy, beautiful genius.

865
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,455
We had to try something different.

866
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,166
Seriously.

867
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,501
You saved us, man.

868
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,463
- That was an amazing idea.
- I told you it'd work! It wasn't nonsense.

869
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,507
- You're the best. You're the MVP.
- All right!

870
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,305
<i>Uh, I'm really happy</i>
<i>with how it all played out.</i>

871
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:31,309
I don't think any of the other teams were
able to come up with a strategy like that.

872
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,936
- All right!
- Bring it in, team.

873
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,772
- Ready?
- Warriors! Mount up!

874
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,274
Perfect!

875
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,341
This is gonna be tough, isn't it?

876
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,593
The last team challenge was tough.

877
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,636
But this time,
we're stronger and more united.

878
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,971
Let's do our best.

879
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,765
- Yeah.
- It'll all work out.

880
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,518
<i>Team Japan, please enter the arena.</i>

881
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,146
Let's go!

882
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,863
Huh?

883
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,159
- A rickshaw…
- Rickshaw…

884
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,203
Look at that.

885
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,372
- We're moving all of this?
- I think so.

886
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,249
<i>Out of curiosity,</i>
<i>I took a little peek inside the cart.</i>

887
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,086
<i>And as soon as I saw</i>
<i>those bags and crates, I thought,</i>

888
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,712
<i>"Yeah, this is gonna be fun."</i>

889
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,591
<i>I'd expect nothing less,</i>
<i>to be honest. Typical </i>Physical: Asia,

890
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,886
<i>always finding a way to outdo themselves.</i>

891
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:55,142
<i>And, of course, looming over us,</i>
<i>shrouded in darkness, is this huge manor.</i>

892
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,979
<i>I found myself staring at it,</i>
<i>trying to figure it out.</i>

893
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,607
I felt like I had these question marks
circling my head.

894
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,526
I just didn't know what to make of it.

895
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,778
- I see six.
- So twelve total.

896
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,238
<i>Almost immediately,</i>

897
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,032
<i>just by looking at it,</i>
<i>I could tell the cart was too heavy.</i>

898
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,786
It was impossible to move fully-loaded.
It was just going to sink.

899
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,498
Let's just do the sandbags to start.
If it's still too heavy, crates.

900
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,251
We can go two at a time.
I think that'll work the best.

901
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,212
<i>The last time we had to deal</i>
<i>with those crates,</i>

902
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,798
<i>both Mongolia and Korea obliterated us.</i>

903
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,676
But now that we knew what to expect,
we'd get our revenge.

904
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,636
- One, two, three!
- Go, Japan!

905
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,769
<i>Fifth quest. Castle Conquest.</i>

906
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,438
<i>Stand by.</i>

907
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,319
<i>I really do believe that our team</i>
<i>is like a phoenix, rising from ashes.</i>

908
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,240
We are resilient, which is how I know
we'll beat Korean and Mongolia today.

909
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,992
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

910
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,076
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

911
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,078
- If you're stressed, let it out.
- That's right.

912
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,122
- And communicate.
- That's important.

913
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,125
<i>At that point, all I cared</i>
<i>about was getting to the finals.</i>

914
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,626
<i>And that meant we had to win.</i>

915
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,797
<i>Ready.</i>

916
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,228
<i>The cart was too heavy.</i>

917
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,939
<i>It was never going to get up the hill</i>
<i>with all the supplies.</i>

918
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,192
<i>So, the first thing Itoi,</i>
<i>Katsumi and I did</i>

919
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,987
<i>was try to unload as many materials</i>
<i>from the cart as fast as we could.</i>

920
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,367
<i>In this kind of challenge,</i>
<i>it's really easy to start panicking</i>

921
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,827
<i>when things don't go to plan.</i>

922
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,162
<i>But that can trip you up.</i>

923
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,373
<i>So, my number one priority</i>
<i>was to stay calm and keep moving,</i>

924
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,667
<i>even if I was stressed.</i>

925
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,352
<i>The cart was big and couldn't really turn,</i>

926
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,896
<i>so we also had to clear away</i>
<i>all the obstacles.</i>

927
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,273
<i>Everything had to happen at once.</i>

928
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,067
<i>That's why we decided</i>
<i>to divide and conquer,</i>

929
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,277
<i>so we could use our time efficiently.</i>

930
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,996
Should we try pushing it now?

931
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,376
- One, two…
- Oh, that's heavy.

932
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,961
Wait, let's try this.

933
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,046
One, two…

934
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,422
Nope, not budging.

935
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,632
One, two…

936
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,883
Nope, not budging.

937
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,094
<i>Crazy. It won't even budge.</i>

938
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,641
Even with three people pulling,
that cart wouldn't move.

939
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,394
<i>So we decided to go ahead</i>
<i>and unload the whole thing.</i>

940
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,312
<i>It was the easiest solution.</i>

941
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,986
All right, anyone who's free,
help us move the cargo up.

942
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,239
Let's go!

943
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,828
- Wait, I'll toss you one from here.
- Okay.

944
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:10,170
<i>As good as our team is, I do think</i>
<i>we lack a little bit of overall power.</i>

945
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,507
<i>If we wanted to survive, we had to</i>
<i>combine our strength and work together.</i>

946
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,551
We've got this.

947
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:20,014
<i>We didn't want burn-out, so we</i>
<i>made these two little assembly lines</i>

948
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,809
<i>to haul the cargo uphill.</i>
<i>And it kept things moving at a good pace.</i>

949
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,186
- You got it?
- Yeah.

950
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:30,149
<i>No matter how hard it got,</i>
<i>I just kept pushing through it.</i>

951
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:33,819
<i>I didn't want to be a burden to my team.</i>
<i>I wanted to carry my own weight.</i>

952
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,238
I got ya.

953
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,786
<i>Because we moved as one unit,</i>
<i>we got things done pretty quickly.</i>

954
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,206
Nice. We're making good time.

955
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,126
Everything seemed to be working out.

956
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:53,964
<i>We weren't wasting time, we kept a nice</i>
<i>pace. Everything was going really well.</i>

957
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,425
Okay, I got it.

958
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,261
Nice job, man.

959
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,471
Hold on.

960
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,931
- The battering ram.
- Let's go.

961
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,685
- Kana, it's really heavy!
- We'll move it together!

962
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,021
- We can do this.
- Okay.

963
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,356
Here, let's lift it.

964
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,649
One, two, up!

965
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,900
Okay, now the other side.

966
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,152
- Look ahead, look ahead!
- Let's go!

967
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,863
- Get ready.
- We can do this! Come on!

968
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,657
We've got this.

969
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,158
Nice, nice!

970
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,452
<i>You know, the act</i>
<i>of ramming through castle doors</i>

971
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:26,205
<i>is a pretty significant part</i>
<i>of Japanese history.</i>

972
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:29,458
I mean, our own ancestors
lived through the Sengoku period.

973
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,627
<i>So I figured it'd come easy to us.</i>

974
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,087
<i>I was pretty confident.</i>

975
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,423
- Let's go for it!
- Okay.

976
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,884
What?

977
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,303
- It's okay. Let's lift.
- One, two…

978
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,263
- One, two!
- Use momentum.

979
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,433
- We doin' this right?
- This is it.

980
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,851
- This is the only way it opens.
- Are you sure?

981
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,438
Again.

982
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,732
- Again. Last one.
- Get ready!

983
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,652
Huh?

984
00:44:56,735 --> 00:45:00,155
We pulled it back, we swung, "Bam!"
We hit the door.

985
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,409
<i>We made a big dent, but that was it.</i>
<i>It wouldn't open.</i>

986
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,620
<i>I even tried slamming my own body</i>
<i>into the door.</i>

987
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,457
<i>But that didn't help either.</i>
<i>No amount of force could get it to budge.</i>

988
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,251
- What are we doing wrong?
- No, no, no, no.

989
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,585
This has to be it.

990
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,505
- Yeah, you're right.
- But how do we…

991
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,090
Have some faith.

992
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,925
Let's deal with the cart first.

993
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,719
Okay.

994
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,554
Come on, we gotta move quickly.

995
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,849
What was that?

996
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,475
I don't know…

997
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:35,315
<i>I don't think any of us expected</i>
<i>the gate to give us that much trouble.</i>

998
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,151
<i>But we had to try and keep moving.</i>

999
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,903
<i>Standing around and talking</i>
<i>would be a waste of time.</i>

1000
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,948
<i>So instead, we decided to run back down</i>
<i>and push the cart.</i>

1001
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,451
That way, we could still be productive.

1002
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,870
- Let's catch our breath.
- Okay.

1003
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,455
Let's do it in one go.

1004
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,541
All right, one, two, push!

1005
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,792
Nice job!

1006
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,043
Two, push!

1007
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,714
- It's going! No stopping.
- Come on! One big push!

1008
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,717
<i>The empty cart was very manageable.</i>

1009
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,304
<i>With all of us moving it,</i>
<i>I was sure we could get it up in no time.</i>

1010
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,889
Stretch your arms out!

1011
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,891
Use your momentum!

1012
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,226
Okay! Get ready, guys!

1013
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,937
Push!

1014
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,816
One, two…

1015
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,654
One, two…

1016
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:27,034
<i>But it stopped on the hill.</i>
<i>First the door, and now the cart.</i>

1017
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,704
I mean, credit where it's due,
it was a real challenge.

1018
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,749
<i>The hill was short, but pretty steep.</i>

1019
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:37,294
<i>And, of course, it got stuck right before</i>
<i>it went over the top.</i>

1020
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,048
<i>In all my years of training,</i>

1021
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,176
<i>I've never experienced</i>
<i>that level of resistance.</i>

1022
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,179
One, two…

1023
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,183
Hold on.

1024
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:54,770
<i>I was feeling a little worried by</i>
<i>that point. Would we be able to do this?</i>

1025
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,442
We'll try to lift it a bit.

1026
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,445
- One, two!
- One, two!

1027
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,697
- Okay, that's it!
- Got it!

1028
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,825
- Keep going!
- Come on!

1029
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,828
<i>The wheels were getting caught</i>
<i>in the sand.</i>

1030
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,705
<i>So I positioned myself</i>
<i>under the front of the cart,</i>

1031
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,874
<i>and used my back to lift it up slightly.</i>

1032
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,418
- Yes!
- It's working!

1033
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,587
Just a little higher.

1034
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,715
- Yes!
- It's working!

1035
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,510
Come on!

1036
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,928
Keep going!

1037
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,098
Yes!

1038
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,308
- Final stretch!
- Okay.

1039
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,852
Let's do this!

1040
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,395
We've got it!

1041
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,771
Let's do this!

1042
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,022
We can win this!

1043
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,483
We can win this!

1044
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,278
That's it!

1045
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,488
Don't stop!

1046
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,869
Okay.

1047
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,995
Stop.

1048
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,832
- So now what?
- Wait, hold on.

1049
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:01,295
<i>We just stood there,</i>
<i>trying to find a way to open the gate.</i>

1050
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,673
And all of a sudden,
Katsumi Nakamura pitches this idea.

1051
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,592
Why don't we use the cart?

1052
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,510
We can do that, right?

1053
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,387
We'll all push from the back.

1054
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,930
Are you sure?

1055
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,891
Yes, it was a little excessive.

1056
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,184
But we just kind of had to go for it.

1057
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,853
- Let's do this!
- Come on.

1058
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,022
- All together, guys.
- From the back?

1059
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,440
- Yep!
- All right.

1060
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,858
Come on, Kana!

1061
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,610
One, two!

1062
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,361
- Yeah, like that.
- Wait, wait, wait!

1063
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,615
<i>It was a crazy idea,</i>
<i>but we all believed in it.</i>

1064
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,659
<i>I felt like my heart was going to explode.</i>

1065
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,077
Yeah, like that.

1066
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,246
Wait, wait, wait!

1067
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,879
- It worked! It worked!
- Yes! Yes!

1068
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:47,549
BROKE THROUGH THE CASTLE GATES

1069
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,968
<i>Considering</i>
<i>all the little setbacks we faced,</i>

1070
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,429
<i>I think we made pretty good time overall.</i>

1071
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:57,184
<i>At the rate we were going,</i>
<i>I thought we had a real shot at winning.</i>

1072
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,645
It really felt like
we'd made it to the end.

1073
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,104
Okay. Let's load it up.

1074
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:05,025
- I'll help you lift 'em.
- Okay. Let's do crates first.

1075
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,152
And, three!

1076
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,948
<i>While all the teams were free</i>
<i>to try different strategies,</i>

1077
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,409
<i>there was a rule that the cart had</i>
<i>to be full before it entered the castle.</i>

1078
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,994
<i>So once we'd broken the gate,</i>

1079
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,914
<i>we wheeled the cart back</i>
<i>and started to load it up again.</i>

1080
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,123
Two, three!

1081
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,792
We got this!

1082
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,591
Crates are done.

1083
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,676
Let's get the bags.

1084
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,804
Let me help.

1085
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,305
All right, thanks.

1086
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,891
Watch out!

1087
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,854
<i>At some point, I realized that I was</i>
<i>completely drenched in sweat.</i>

1088
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,607
<i>I was still optimistic,</i>

1089
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,652
<i>but I could tell</i>
<i>that we were all running low on stamina.</i>

1090
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,239
- We're done.
- Okay.

1091
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,740
Let's finish this!

1092
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,119
<i>My stomach was in knots.</i>

1093
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,079
We struggled a lot with the empty wagon,

1094
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,540
so I didn't know if we could handle
the extra weight.

1095
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:05,460
We weren't able to move it when it was
halfway full, so I was a little nervous.

1096
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,421
Nope, not budging.

1097
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,549
- Let's finish this!
- Okay.

1098
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,387
- Just keep pushing.
- Okay!

1099
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,140
- That's it, guys! Run!
- Run, run, run!

1100
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,018
<i>We pretty much sprinted into the castle.</i>

1101
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:27,649
<i>Our goal was to gain enough speed so we</i>
<i>had the momentum to reach the finish line.</i>

1102
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,784
<i>Unfortunately, the floor</i>
<i>of the castle was covered in sand.</i>

1103
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,202
<i>So, we didn't get too far.</i>

1104
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,914
What happened?

1105
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,585
- We're too short!
- Where is it?

1106
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,379
- Over there.
- Okay, let's try pulling it.

1107
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,256
Same positions as before.

1108
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,216
- I'll lift again.
- Sounds good.

1109
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,551
Ready to lift.

1110
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,888
- One, two!
- Come on.

1111
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,057
You sure we can't unload?

1112
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,394
Do I go back?

1113
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,939
Let's try again. One, two!

1114
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,984
<i>I knew we were in danger.</i>
<i>We'd been delayed too many times.</i>

1115
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,403
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>it was a race against the clock.</i>

1116
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,406
Do you think you guys can lift it up?

1117
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,657
- We'll try.
- It's like a squat.

1118
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,118
- Lower your back, use your glutes.
- Okay.

1119
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,495
- Make contact with the front here?
- Exactly.

1120
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,163
- Got it. Like this?
- Yeah.

1121
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,289
Okay.

1122
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,208
Flat back, lift with your legs.

1123
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,586
I guess it was like we gave the cart
a piggy back ride.

1124
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,922
One, two!

1125
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,343
Okay!

1126
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,136
We've got this!

1127
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,222
That's it!

1128
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,557
One, two!

1129
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,975
One, two!

1130
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,979
<i>Even though it took a second,</i>
<i>we found our rhythm again.</i>

1131
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,481
- Step by step!
- One, two!

1132
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,942
<i>It was a slow, heavy march forward.</i>

1133
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:55,195
But we did it together.
Nobody gave up, we all kept pushing.

1134
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,322
All together! One, two!

1135
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,409
One, two!

1136
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,329
- There we go!
- One, two!

1137
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,419
- Okami, switch!
- Okay.

1138
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,924
<i>I was exhausted, my body was shaking.</i>

1139
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,343
<i>It felt like we would be there</i>
<i>for an eternity.</i>

1140
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,804
- Come on!
- Okay!

1141
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:21,972
One, two!

1142
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,392
- Okay!
- Almost!

1143
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,893
- Come on!
- Yes, yes, yes!

1144
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,812
Come on, come on!

1145
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,230
Push, push, push!

1146
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,317
One, two!

1147
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,157
- We can do this!
- One more!

1148
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,366
Let's go!

1149
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,827
- Okami, try pushing off.
- One, two!

1150
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,329
I think we got it!

1151
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,666
- Just a bit more!
- Come on, raise it! Just a bit more!

1152
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,084
- Let's try it.
- We'll get it in two.

1153
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,253
- No, we can do it in one.
- Okay.

1154
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,921
One, two!

1155
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,883
Come on, come on!

1156
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,975
Come on, come on!

1157
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,105
- Okay!
- We did it!

1158
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,149
- Close the gates!
- Hurry up!

1159
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,859
<i>It was like a little miracle.</i>

1160
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,362
<i>As soon as we crossed that finish line,</i>
<i>everyone got their second-wind.</i>

1161
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,364
- Grab the ropes!
- Where are they?

1162
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,075
<i>Obviously, we were all happy</i>
<i>to be done with the cart.</i>

1163
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,078
<i>But it wouldn't be over until</i>
<i>we managed to raise the bridge again.</i>

1164
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,957
- There!
- Quick. We gotta hurry.

1165
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,251
Itoi, over here.

1166
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,753
- How do we do this?
- Pull down.

1167
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,254
All together.

1168
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,797
- Grab it!
- Same time.

1169
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,467
Ready? One, two!

1170
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,136
- It's moving!
- All right.

1171
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,347
- It's moving!
- All right.

1172
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,807
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Hurry, hurry, go, go!

1173
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,434
Yay, we did it!

1174
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,895
With every last ounce of our strength.

1175
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,648
It was tough,
but we managed to raise it halfway.

1176
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,027
Pull, pull!

1177
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,570
Pull!

1178
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,952
- Wait, pull back!
- Got it.

1179
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,495
Let's go!

1180
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,414
<i>I was confident</i>
<i>that we were faster than the others.</i>

1181
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,500
One, two!

1182
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,214
<i>It felt like things</i>
<i>were finally working out for us.</i>

1183
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:23,969
Come on.

1184
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,682
Close!

1185
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,867
- Let's do this.
- Hey there, little buddy.

1186
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,413
Hello, torsos.
Hope you don't get shattered.

1187
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,582
Some will. Hope it's not us.

1188
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,593
Please no. I don't wanna break you.

1189
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,809
- They're all here.
- Hello.

1190
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,352
Everyone looks calm.

1191
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,150
They're in a good mood.

1192
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,193
Wow, they look happy.

1193
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,071
Maybe if we smile back they'll freak out.

1194
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,950
They look happy.

1195
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,243
Everyone does.

1196
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,745
I wonder who won.

1197
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,913
I guess nobody really knows.

1198
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,791
Physical: Asia<i>.</i>

1199
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:40,670
<i>This marks the end of the Fifth Quest,</i>

1200
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,089
<i>Castle Conquest.</i>

1201
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,390
<i>Japan, Korea, Mongolia.</i>

1202
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,559
<i>Only two have survived.</i>

1203
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:04,402
<i>The team that took the longest to</i>
<i>complete the quest will be eliminated.</i>

1204
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,946
One team's going home.

1205
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,242
<i>The winner</i>

1206
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:16,873
<i>of the Fifth Quest, the first team</i>
<i>that will advance to the Final Quest.</i>

1207
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,878
Physical: Asia<i>.</i>

1208
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:26,466
<i>The team in first place,</i>
<i>who will advance to the Final Quest…</i>

1209
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,845
I'm so nervous.

1210
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:36,351
<i>I wanted to win.</i>
<i>I really wanted to come in first.</i>

1211
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,019
Should we hold hands?

1212
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,312
Come on, everyone.

1213
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:50,115
<i>I think we managed to pull it off</i>
<i>in the end.</i>

1214
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,741
<i>We gave it our all out there.</i>

1215
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,327
<i>I was proud of my team.</i>
<i>I could see us winning.</i>

1216
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,288
<i>I think we were all happy</i>
<i>with how it went.</i>

1217
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,375
<i>Honestly, I thought</i>
<i>we'd have a good shot at winning.</i>

1218
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,590
<i>I'm so nervous.</i>

1219
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,676
Come on.

1220
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,386
Come on.

1221
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,138
Korea.

1222
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,681
Come on.

1223
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:23,148
<i>…is Korea.</i>

1224
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,732
<i>…is Korea.</i>

1225
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,531
- No way, first!
- We did it!

1226
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,616
- We came in first! Yes!
- We did it!

1227
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,953
I mean, we obviously
couldn't know for sure,

1228
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,038
but I was pretty confident.

1229
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,667
The second we finished, I knew we'd won.
Our team crushed it.

1230
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,127
One, two, three!

1231
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:48,590
<i>We were all working together,</i>
<i>we were chanting together.</i>

1232
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,216
<i>It brought out the best in us.</i>

1233
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,927
One, two!

1234
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,473
<i>As the captain,</i>
<i>I'm so grateful for my team,</i>

1235
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,558
<i>for their hard work and determination.</i>

1236
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,143
<i>I'm so proud of us.</i>

1237
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,730
<i>When you're part of a team like this,</i>

1238
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,940
<i>it really motivates you to do your best.</i>

1239
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,235
One, two!

1240
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,905
<i>When we were trying to close the gate,</i>

1241
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:15,366
<i>I looked around me and knew</i>
<i>that we were all giving it our best.</i>

1242
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,659
Nice!

1243
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,870
- Korea!
- Fight on!

1244
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:24,375
Honestly, getting first place in this
challenge meant we could win anything.

1245
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,128
If we kept this up,
we could win this whole competition.

1246
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,256
<i>…is Korea.</i>

1247
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:37,096
<i>…is Korea.</i>

1248
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,434
<i>The second we heard Korea</i>
<i>won, I felt like I was gonna be sick.</i>

1249
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,187
I don't know, it felt like the end for us.

1250
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,190
Come on, please just tell us already.

1251
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:52,862
<i>Team Korea, your final time</i>
<i>was 17 minutes and 53 seconds.</i>

1252
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,405
- No way.
- That fast?

1253
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,741
That's really impressive.
Seventeen minutes?

1254
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,577
- Seventeen minutes?
- Yeah.

1255
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,580
<i>When I realized just how fast they'd been,</i>

1256
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:06,459
I'm not gonna lie, I was in shock.
It's kind of unbelievable.

1257
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,754
Being able to do everything in 17 minutes,
bridge included,

1258
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,131
I honestly don't know how they managed it.

1259
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,551
Look at them. They look so surprised.

1260
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,220
That means our time was crazy fast.

1261
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,055
- We're in the finals!
- Yeah!

1262
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,183
<i>Now then,</i>

1263
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:28,106
<i>we will announce the second team,</i>
<i>who will be advancing to the Final Quest.</i>

1264
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,816
<i>I'm really nervous now.</i>

1265
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,945
<i>All I could feel was my pulse</i>
<i>quickening and my heart pounding.</i>

1266
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,780
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

1267
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,408
<i>I didn't want to go home. Not yet.</i>

1268
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,956
<i>The team that will join Korea</i>

1269
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,000
<i>and advance to the Final Quest…</i>

1270
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,587
<i>All I could do was hold my breath</i>

1271
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,256
<i>and hope that our team</i>
<i>would make it to the finals.</i>

1272
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,758
Mongolia.

1273
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,261
Say Mongolia.

1274
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:02,015
Come on, come on, come on…

1275
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,773
<i>…and advance to the Final Quest…</i>
