<i>Unlock.</i>

3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,683
All right, unlock.

4
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,059
- Slowly.
- Easy now.

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,144
Be careful.

6
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:20,895
Up!

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,190
- Uh-oh.
- Careful, careful.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,860
- Looks like Türkiye might be struggling.
- They're really shaky.

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,779
Team Japan's really unstable.

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,576
Japan's unraveling, don't give up yet.

11
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,369
<i>It was physically exhausting.</i>

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,454
Uh…

13
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,205
<i>You're fighting your own muscles.</i>

14
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,294
<i>Weirdly enough,</i>
<i>I had lost all feeling in my fingers.</i>

15
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,840
<i>So I had to use all of my strength</i>
<i>just to keep holding on.</i>

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,885
Hold it!

17
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,847
Hang in there.

18
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,356
- Just keep holding on, Anıl.
- Come on.

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,776
- You're doing great.
- Come on, man! Just push a little harder!

20
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,613
Say strong, okay? I know you can do this!

21
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,697
Don't let go!

22
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,033
- Don't let your legs split! Try to focus.
- Just hang on!

23
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,744
Come on! We believe in you!

24
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,995
You can do it!

25
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,624
Hang on, Nonoka!

26
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,708
Just… Ah, it's okay.

27
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,918
Hang on, Nonoka!

28
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,503
- Just… Ah, it's okay.
- Okay, okay.

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,088
- Okay, okay.
- Nice try.

30
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,423
- You fought well.
- Okay, okay.

31
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,717
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

32
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,514
<i>Immediately, as soon</i>
<i>as I'd uncrossed my ankles,</i>

33
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,558
<i>all the tension was released</i>
<i>and the pain shot up my body.</i>

34
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,521
<i>I couldn't even try to fight it.</i>
<i>I just collapsed.</i>

35
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,358
- Japan's down!
- Stay focused, don't look around.

36
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,151
- Stay strong, all right?
- Keep going!

37
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,444
Keep going!

38
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,947
- That's it, copy Mongolia.
- Careful, watch your left hand.

39
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,078
He let go of the same hand you did.
Just copy him.

40
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,832
Excellent. Very nice, Anıl.

41
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,667
Bravo, keep the balance.

42
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,919
- You're doing great.
- Very, very good. He's holding.

43
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,923
He's putting all of his weight
on the left.

44
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,717
He stretched out his right leg

45
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,469
and he bent his left knee.

46
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,012
Try to mimic the pose.

47
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,514
Stretch your right leg more.

48
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,558
Excellent posture.

49
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,851
Beautiful, man.

50
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,227
You're like a chameleon.

51
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,481
He's copying me.
He's doing well. He's a good student.

52
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,819
Nice pose, man. Nice pose.

53
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,529
It's your job. I need to cheat.

54
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,533
Let's do it, man.

55
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,661
<i>Fifty minutes.</i>

56
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,205
He's the best.

57
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,999
You're the man, Ochir!

58
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,591
<i>Sixty minutes.</i>

59
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,552
- Bravo, man.
- All right, keep it up!

60
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,761
- Bravo!
- You're killing it!

61
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,139
<i>Eighty minutes.</i>

62
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,683
You're doing great, man.

63
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,560
Nice balance.

64
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,562
<i>100 minutes.</i>

65
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,439
Awesome!

66
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,857
Am I doing all right?

67
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,944
I knew that the longer the game ran,
the more pain I'd have to endure.

68
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,530
<i>I started to feel a lot of strain in</i>

69
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,907
<i>my thighs and groin area.</i>

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,911
<i>So, to try and reduce the pain</i>
<i>and general stiffness,</i>

71
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,872
I would change my position
every few minutes.

72
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,626
I think I rotated
between three or four poses?

73
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,087
That way,
I could rest certain leg muscles.

74
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,590
- You're killing it up there.
- Easy, Ochir.

75
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,593
- We're proud of you! Keep it up!
- Nice and easy.

76
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,761
Just be patient.

77
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,097
Is he doing all that to show off?

78
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,433
I think it's his way
of stretching his muscles.

79
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:53,691
<i>A mirror store in Çanakkale </i>

80
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,861
<i>Mother I'm heading out </i>

81
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,531
<i>Toward the enemies </i>

82
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,409
As a way to try and stay motivated,

83
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,204
I started to sing an old folk song
to distract myself.

84
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:10,583
<i>If I focused on singing, I could</i>
<i>concentrate on the task, and not the pain.</i>

85
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,670
<i>I'll leave when I pass out or pass away.</i>

86
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,840
I think Türkiye's finally found
his happy place.

87
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,594
Man, I'm really impressed with
how well Türkiye's been holding up.

88
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,679
This could go all night.

89
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,514
At this rate, we'll be here till morning.

90
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,268
It'd be great if he accidentally grabbed
the ring with both hands.

91
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,352
Maybe he'll

92
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,688
- get tired and reflexively grab it.
- I know, right?

93
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,190
Just go ahead and disqualify yourself…

94
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,364
<i>My right hand started to go numb.</i>

95
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,161
<i>I figured that would happen,</i>
<i>but it was still challenging.</i>

96
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,998
I think his body's going numb.

97
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,916
But Anıl's hanging on, all right.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,876
Anıl, I think Mongolia's starting to slip.

99
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,214
- Hang on. You're good.
- Careful, Ochir.

100
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,844
<i>I just tried to focus on myself.</i>

101
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,684
<i>It was brutal. My hands and feet went</i>
<i>cold. My soul withdrew.</i>

102
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,024
<i>But even then,</i>
<i>I couldn't afford to give up.</i>

103
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,485
You can do it!

104
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,167
Oh! Did his hand make contact?

105
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,461
He was really close.

106
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,004
- Did he just grab the ring?
- That was close.

107
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,173
- Yeah, almost.
- That should be happening with

108
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,091
with Team Mongolia, not us.

109
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,135
Please fall.

110
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,386
Please give up.

111
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,013
Or just grab the ring.

112
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,225
<i>I really started</i>
<i>to struggle. But then I thought,</i>

113
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,977
<i>"How embarrassing would it be if</i>

114
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,480
<i>I gave up here,</i>
<i>of all the moments to give up?"</i>

115
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,106
<i>I wouldn't forgive myself.</i>

116
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,993
Whoa!

117
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,287
I think Türkiye's almost done.

118
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,500
Steady, Anıl. Steady.

119
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,502
- Hold on!
- Please, man.

120
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,920
Don't fall. Not now.

121
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,385
<i>I said I'd stay</i>
<i>until I passed out or passed away.</i>

122
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,686
- Hand, hand, hand! Touch.
- What?

123
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,232
- Touch!
- Wait, was that a foul?

124
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,234
Hand, hand, hand! Touch.

125
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,947
- Wait, Ochir. Don't move.
- Don't move. Stay still.

126
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,950
Shoot, I think Anıl grabbed it.

127
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,535
- Did he?
- Yeah.

128
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,745
DISQUALIFIED
FOR TWO HANDS ON A HANDHOLD

129
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,331
- <i>Game over.</i>
- Yay!

130
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,999
All right!

131
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,002
Yeah, Ochir!

132
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,509
I hope everyone can see
how tough Team Mongolia actually is.

133
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,887
<i>With no official scores from Game Two,</i>

134
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,681
<i>all three teams were tied for first.</i>

135
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,891
<i>We were over the moon.</i>

136
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,897
<i>It was a really bad loss.</i>

137
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,735
<i>I only made contact for a second.</i>

138
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,864
<i>I removed it right away,</i>
<i>but the damage was done.</i>

139
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,407
<i>I'd let my guard down.</i>

140
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,578
I felt really awful,
letting my team down like that.

141
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,621
It wasn't supposed to end this way.

142
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,331
Not on a technicality.

143
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,087
You put up a great fight.

144
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,047
- Proud of you, man.
- Nice job.

145
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,466
Great job, guys.

146
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,515
TIED FOR 1ST: 4 POINTS

147
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,850
Mongolia can't win.

148
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,144
Yeah. We need them in second.

149
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,105
If we get first and Japan gets third,
I think they're done.

150
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,399
Japan will get eliminated right away.

151
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,235
We knew that the Mongolian athletes
were incredibly skilled.

152
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,452
We can only move on to the next

153
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,204
quest if we beat Japan.

154
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,665
<i>If we get third, or place below them</i>
<i>at all, Team Türkiye</i>

155
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,375
<i>won't be able to avoid elimination.</i>

156
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,294
We wanted to beat Mongolia too,

157
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,087
but Japan was the priority.

158
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,174
I guess we just have to hope that
Türkiye doesn't get first.

159
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,511
<i>The issue with game two put us</i>
<i>in a precarious situation.</i>

160
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,180
We had to assume the worst case scenario.

161
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,891
And in that case, there was only one way
to survive.

162
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,101
We had to beat Türkiye in the sack toss.

163
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,187
Winning the game didn't really matter,

164
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,772
we just had to not be eliminated.

165
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,984
Obviously, you play to win.
But really, you're fighting not to lose.

166
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,861
So I felt a lot of pressure going in.

167
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,073
<i>Physical: Asia.</i>

168
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,741
<i>Team Rep Match.</i>

169
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,078
<i>Game 4.</i>

170
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,873
<i>Those selected for the Sack Toss match,</i>
<i>please enter the arena.</i>

171
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,209
<i>The game will begin momentarily.</i>

172
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,752
- All right!
- Let's go, Ogeday!

173
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:05,962
- Itoi!

OGEDAY
FORMER NATIONAL TEAM ROWER

175
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,548
Come on, rower!

176
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,383
- Itoi!
- Let's go!

177
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,467
You got this!

178
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,927
- You're the man!
- Let's go!

179
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,011
Yeah!

180
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,138
- Warriors.
- Mount up!

181
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,977
- Good luck.
- Go easy on them, man.

182
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,687
They don't stand a chance.

183
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,064
Go get 'em!

184
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,988
<i>Sack Toss Match</i>

185
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,740
<i>is a game</i>
<i>where the players pass a sack around</i>

186
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,035
<i>by tossing it over a hurdle</i>
<i>and onto their opponent's side.</i>

187
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,454
It's an endurance battle.

188
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,416
Orkhonbayar has the advantage.

189
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,668
<i>Mongolian wrestlers</i>
<i>have to undergo intense training.</i>

190
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,962
I've wrestled horses since I was a teen.

191
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,130
I'm naturally strong,

192
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,840
with great grip strength to boot.

193
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,010
<i>Comparing Ogeday to the other two,</i>

194
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,845
I think we've got a real shot at winning.

195
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,888
<i>He was a national team rower,</i>

196
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,308
<i>so his muscular endurance is unparalleled.</i>

197
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,436
<i>I had to get first place.</i>

198
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,897
<i>That was all I cared about, so that's</i>
<i>where I had to concentrate my thoughts.</i>

199
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,568
I was very confident.
I figured I'd have this in the bag.

200
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,278
As a former baseball player,

201
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,364
I've trained extensively with kettlebells
for many, many years.

202
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,702
<i>I've pitched a lot of baseballs. So</i>
<i>throwing things is almost second-nature.</i>

203
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,746
To be honest,
I'm itching to show off a bit.

204
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,832
It's gonna be a physical showdown
with Türkiye.

205
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,916
We'll win.

206
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:31,339
SACK TOSS ORDER DRAW

207
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,715
What did you get?

208
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,508
Okay!

209
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,764
ORKHONBAYAR, OGEDAY, YOSHIO

210
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,931
Keep your eyes on the prize.

211
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,099
Okay.

212
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,518
No sweat. It's gonna be fun!

213
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,811
<i>I was ready to win.</i>

214
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,980
Hey, Anıl. Can you do me a favor?

215
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,982
Remind me to watch my breathing, yeah?

216
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,525
And posture.

217
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,860
Yeah, you got it.

218
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,613
<i>Team Rep Match Game 4:</i>

219
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,865
<i>Sack Toss Match.</i>

220
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,160
<i>The match will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

221
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,954
<i>Stand by.</i>

222
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,790
<i>Ready…</i>

223
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,597
PHYSICAL: ASIA

224
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:28,229
8. FORMIDABLE FOE

225
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,022
<i>Ready…</i>

226
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,989
- Excellent throw.
- Yeah! That's it!

227
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,743
- Excellent throw.
- Yeah! That's it!

228
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,328
It was light.

229
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,083
All right. Remember to breathe.

230
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,717
- That's it.
- Great throw.

231
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,386
- Excellent. Nice job! Keep it up!
- Yes! Push!

232
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,846
- Nice and easy!
- Just like that.

233
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,347
That first toss was a breeze.

234
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,558
<i>Much easier than I thought. It was nice.</i>

235
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,476
Just stay calm.

236
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,980
And up!

237
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,108
- I think he missed.
- And up!

238
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,985
- Nice throw! Up and over!
- That was the highest!

239
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,069
Nice.

240
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,613
They kept shouting,
"You threw it higher than the others!",

241
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,948
so that boosted my morale.

242
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,032
He'll get tired soon.

243
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,367
It's just a matter of time.

244
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,540
Heads up!

245
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,501
Careful. Be careful.

246
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,711
He stumbled.

247
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,296
Don't rush.

248
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,550
- Nice!
- Nice recovery.

249
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,386
<i>You don't wanna miss a toss.</i>

250
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,555
If you keep slipping up
and making mistakes,

251
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,515
you're gonna get eliminated.

252
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,142
<i>Watching them made me anxious.</i>

253
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,226
Breathe.

254
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,729
- Nice throw!
- Very clean.

255
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,980
You're the best!

256
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,734
Go. Okay.

257
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,778
- Easy-peasy.
- Perfect.

258
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,781
No need to rush, take your time.

259
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,370
- Oh, shoot.
- One more.

260
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,706
- Stay calm.
- You've got twenty seconds. Stay calm.

261
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,167
- One more.
- Stay calm.

262
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,044
You've got twenty seconds. Stay calm.

263
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,338
Stay calm.

264
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,341
- Well done.
- Nice job, man.

265
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,884
- That was high.
- There you go!

266
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,344
I thought my heart was gonna give out.

267
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,221
And I wasn't even the one playing!

268
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,431
<i>Considering his body weight and skill set,</i>

269
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,350
Mongolia's athlete had an advantage.

270
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,768
But this is <i>Physical: Asia</i>.

271
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,394
Who knows what'll happen?

272
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,523
- Yeah! Good.
- Bravo!

273
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,607
We're just getting started,

274
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,775
but I'm having fun.

275
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,277
Good, they can't win if you're having fun.

276
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,406
<i>When I was throwing,</i>
<i>I kept trying to mimic the same,</i>

277
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,951
<i>stance, timing</i>
<i>and force as the first toss.</i>

278
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,786
You cleared it by a wide margin!

279
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,954
- You're killing it, man!
- That's the best so far!

280
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,038
- That was awesome!
- Doing great!

281
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,415
I'm really impressed
with how focused he is.

282
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,834
It must be muscle memory.

283
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:55,918
Absolutely.

284
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,378
- That was great.
- He looks comfortable.

285
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,462
Really awesome!

286
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,464
He might be better than Mongolia.

287
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,508
Nice!

288
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,260
Nice job!

289
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,432
<i>Starting now,</i>
<i>the weight of the bag will be increased.</i>

290
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,017
All right. Here we go.

291
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,273
<i>Stand by.</i>

292
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,695
- That's it, nice and easy.
- All right.

293
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,114
All right.

294
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,827
- Yay!
- Yeah. Keep it up!

295
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,537
Yeah, really good. Way to go!

296
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,789
- Let's go, Ogeday.
- Get closer, it'll be easier.

297
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,874
Remember to use your hips!

298
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,166
Mind your breathing.

299
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,590
Hips!

300
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,009
- Yes, exactly like that.
- Good.

301
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,302
- He's cutting it close.
- Stay on it.

302
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,137
- He's struggling!
- You can beat him.

303
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,889
Same as before. Clear it in one.

304
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,437
Here we go!

305
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,149
Beautiful!

306
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,942
- Yeah, you've got this!
- Keep it up!

307
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,403
Ah, too easy!

308
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,406
<i>The weight increase didn't cause</i>
<i>much of an issue for me.</i>

309
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,867
Good swing.

310
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,535
- That's how it's done!
- Best swing yet.

311
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,287
Just like that. Nice!

312
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,372
Drag it! Don't waste energy lifting!

313
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,459
I wonder if it's too heavy for him?

314
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,960
Throw it.

315
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,922
- Fantastic.
- Bravo!

316
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,425
He almost didn't clear it.

317
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,635
- I know. Good.
- He's cutting it real close.

318
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,719
Yes.

319
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,429
- Breaths, hips!
- Use your hips!

320
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,186
- Hey, nice try!
- All right.

321
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,395
He looks tense.

322
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,689
No need to rush,
you've got plenty of time.

323
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,233
Don't let it get to you.
Just trust yourself and go!

324
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,319
One more mistake, and he's done.

325
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,830
- Bravo, man. Bravo.
- Bravo.

326
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,958
- Bravo, man. Bravo.
- Bravo.

327
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,626
- Just like that!
- Nice.

328
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,295
- Get it!
- Hey, hey, hey!

329
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,005
I can afford to make one mistake.

330
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,257
- Yeah. They failed too, you're still good.
- Yeah, no sweat!

331
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,759
- Yeah!
- Let it fly!

332
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,969
Nice throw!

333
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,137
- And…
- All right!

334
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,014
- All right! Yeah!
- Use your hips.

335
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,933
Remember to breathe!

336
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,477
Nice toss.

337
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,526
Nice toss.

338
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,860
- Standing at an angle.
- Get closer!

339
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,487
Turn around. Uh-oh.

340
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,697
- You're standing at an angle.
- Get closer!

341
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,990
Turn around.

342
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,617
It's okay, you've got time.

343
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,501
Yeah! Well done!

344
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,795
- Great form. Bravo.
- Very nice, very nice. Bravo.

345
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,840
- He almost missed.
- Yeah, very close.

346
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,967
He's got ten throws left in him max.

347
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,386
You're doing great. Just
remember to turn your back completely.

348
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,013
Okay, let me know if I'm off.

349
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,891
- Yay!
- Easy, easy, easy.

350
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,060
Find your spot, then turn your back.

351
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,730
- Breathe.
- Watch your form.

352
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,023
Keep using your hips,

353
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,274
that's where all your power is.

354
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,819
Hips!

355
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,076
- That's it!
- Just keep doing that! Same thing.

356
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,536
Breaths! Hips.

357
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,872
Bravo!

358
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,082
- Bravo!
- Go, Ogeday!

359
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,418
Did I hit a wall here and there? Sure.

360
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,962
<i>But I just kept trying</i>
<i>and trying and trying again.</i>

361
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,673
<i>No matter what,</i>
<i>I was gonna see this through till the end.</i>

362
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,843
- Very nice, well done, Ogeday.
- You're killing it! Bravo!

363
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,595
You can do this all day!

364
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,013
Yeah, let's go all night!

365
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,598
Easy money!

366
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,351
- I think he's got it now.
- Yeah.

367
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,270
He's finally got the rhythm down.

368
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,272
One, two and throw!

369
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,565
He adjusted himself.

370
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,733
His posture's better.

371
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,817
<i>Türkiye was kind of</i>

372
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,320
floundering during
the first part of the game,

373
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,781
but he did gradually get better over time.

374
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,116
Seriously, where did that come from?

375
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,284
It's all right.

376
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,786
- You're doing great.
- Don't stress.

377
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,412
Use those big shoulders, man!

378
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,497
Use those boulder shoulders!

379
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,041
- Here we go!
- Let's go!

380
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,417
- Nice!
- Very nice!

381
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,377
You're the man!

382
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,632
- Up we go! Yeah!
- Let's go!

383
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,175
- That's right! Easy.
- Yeah.

384
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,885
We own this game.

385
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,847
- You're killing it!
- You're still a bit tilted.

386
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,099
You gotta stay parallel!

387
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,767
You've got this, tough guy.

388
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,602
Let's go!

389
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,853
- Nice!
- You cleared that hurdle!

390
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,979
Yeah.

391
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,731
Let's go!

392
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,817
- Let's go!
- That was amazing!

393
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,693
- Good, good.
- That's right, like a lion.

394
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,904
- Nice job!
- Bravo! That was awesome!

395
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,073
Okay.

396
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,157
- Yes!
- All right!

397
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,993
Great job!

398
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,620
They have to increase the weight.

399
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,080
Yeah, or it won't end.

400
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,581
And up!

401
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,874
Okay!

402
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,543
Okay.

403
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,586
Very, very nice, guys.

404
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,755
It's getting rough for the other two.

405
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,132
This is just the start!

406
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,967
- Take a break.
- Catch your breath.

407
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,552
Yeah, it's all good. Take the break.

408
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,763
<i>The weight of the bag</i>

409
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,223
<i>- will be increased.</i>
- Increased?

410
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,517
Yeah. You've been throwing it
higher than Türkiye.

411
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,018
They're gonna struggle.

412
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,228
<i>Stand by.</i>

413
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,861
- And up!
- Let's go!

414
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,281
- And up!
- Let's go!

415
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,992
- Up!
- Let's go!

416
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,326
- Nice and easy.
- Yeah!

417
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,411
Very nice.

418
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,246
- It didn't look too heavy for him.
- Not at all.

419
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,831
- He went really fast, actually.
- He's pretty strong.

420
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,915
He's still throwing well

421
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,375
with the heavier bag.

422
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,586
- Ogeday!
- Just breathe.

423
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,090
- Tighten your glutes.
- Use your hips!

424
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,258
Yeah!

425
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,926
- Use your hips!
- Yeah!

426
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,307
- Use your hips!
- Yeah!

427
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,391
- That was awesome.
- That's it!

428
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,517
Nice job!

429
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,562
- He barely cleared it.
- That was close.

430
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,022
He got really lucky.

431
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,065
You got it!

432
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,233
Steady

433
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,319
- and swing!
- All right!

434
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,946
And up!

435
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,741
Amazing! That was super clear, way to go.

436
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,659
You're killing it, man. Great job.

437
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,245
Throwing it higher isn't good.

438
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,039
He's wasting more energy than you!

439
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,874
- Let's see…
- And yeah!

440
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,459
Let's go!

441
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,085
- That's it!
- Yeah! Let's go!

442
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,170
- Very nice.
- Come on.

443
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,588
Yeah, let's go!

444
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,839
He's tired.

445
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,758
Tighten your glutes.

446
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,134
- Breathe. Keep it tight.
- Watch your hips.

447
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,344
- And throw.
- That's it.

448
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,224
- And throw.
- That's it.

449
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,391
- Clear!
- Good.

450
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,228
Man, that was close! Did you see that?

451
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,896
- It rolled over.
- Yeah, I saw.

452
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,022
So lucky.

453
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,774
Yes. Come on, Ogeday.

454
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,400
You gotta aim in that direction.

455
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,027
Make Japan work for it.

456
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,029
Remember, we've gotta send them home.

457
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,323
<i>No matter what anyone did,</i>

458
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,283
<i>one team was going home</i>
<i>by the end of this.</i>

459
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,869
- <i>That made me nervous.</i>
- Good!

460
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,250
- All right!
- He does it.

461
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,793
Up we go!

462
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,336
- Excellent.
- Nice.

463
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,672
- Good.
- Tighten the glutes!

464
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,800
- Good.
- Tighten the glutes!

465
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,761
That's it!

466
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,638
- Yeah!
- That's it!

467
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,640
Oh, man. He looks nervous.

468
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,977
Don't panic. Don't panic, all right?

469
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,353
I think he's in trouble.

470
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,772
You have 15 seconds,
so don't rush to throw it.

471
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,983
Just breathe.

472
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,611
One more!

473
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,912
I think that's it!
I think Türkiye's done for.

474
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,122
Come on! Hurry up!

475
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,206
Remember your technique!

476
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,874
Oh, man, we're done for.

477
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,420
You've still got five seconds.

478
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,465
Five, four, three, two…

479
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,599
- Nice save.
- Bravo!

480
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,479
No sweat.

481
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,441
You've got this.
Don't worry. You'll beat them eventually.

482
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,651
- And swing!
- Nice job!

483
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,403
Easy, easy!

484
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,779
- Keep going.
- Great throw, man.

485
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,573
You're still on top.

486
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,658
Is he ever gonna miss or what?

487
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,951
Throw it a little farther.

488
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,078
Let's go!

489
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,956
- Let's go!
- And up!

490
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,959
Let's go!

491
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,544
It's all right, just stay calm.

492
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,837
It's okay, one more.

493
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes, fail.

494
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,424
- Good and swing!
- And up!

495
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,009
Up!

496
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,470
- There you go. And up!
- Swing!

497
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,305
Nice, nice, nice!

498
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,058
That's what I'm talking about!
You're killing it!

499
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,852
Throw it higher next time.

500
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,813
<i>Watching the game</i>
<i>was extremely nerve-wracking.</i>

501
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>Everyone was anxious.</i>
<i>That's why we kept pacing back-and-fourth.</i>

502
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,943
<i>Anything can happen.</i>

503
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,070
<i>That's the essence of athletics.</i>

504
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,863
Even if you're ahead, you can still lose.

505
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,240
We've seen it happen on this show.

506
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,076
All right!

507
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,160
Looking good!

508
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,745
We're stopping again?

509
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,538
Looking good! We're stopping again?

510
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,666
Let's add some more weight.

511
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,836
<i>Starting now, the time limit</i>

512
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,089
<i>will decrease to fifteen seconds.</i>

513
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,883
You've got 15 seconds man, 15 seconds!

514
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,177
- <i>Fifteen seconds.</i>
- I'm good.

515
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,637
Orkhon. You gotta try to get it

516
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,721
on your first throw.

517
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,767
We're down to the wire now.
We're in good shape, but we can't slip up.

518
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,227
<i>I wasn't too worried about it.</i>

519
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,106
<i>On average, I took around ten seconds</i>
<i>to complete each toss,</i>

520
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,359
<i>while the other two averaged</i>
<i>around fifteen seconds.</i>

521
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,404
- It's all over if they mess up.
- There's only 15 seconds.

522
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,905
You need to make it on your first try.

523
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,116
There's no time to recover.
You can't mess up.

524
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,909
Don't sweat it.

525
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,119
Let's go, Itoi!

526
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,538
<i>Stand by.</i>

527
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,710
- And up we go!
- Heave-ho!

528
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,671
Nice!

529
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,882
And up we go!

530
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,051
Nice!

531
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,344
- He cleared that in four seconds!
- Awesome.

532
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,804
- He did that so quickly.
- Yeah.

533
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,140
- Easy. It's easy for him.
- Keep it up! Yeah.

534
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,892
I wanted to try
and shave a few seconds off.

535
00:23:55,976 --> 00:24:00,230
- Let's go, man.
- With gusto. With gusto.

536
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,527
- Bravo!
- Yeah!

537
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,611
Bravo.

538
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,364
- Don't rush.
- Come on. Compose yourself.

539
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,325
- Swing!
- Nice!

540
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,203
- Nice. Nice.
- Perfect. Perfect.

541
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,038
Too close?

542
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,206
- Just a bit.
- It's fine though.

543
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,916
If he screws up once, he's done for.

544
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,711
- Breathe.
- Let's go, Ogeday.

545
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,588
Watch the hips and breathe. And, go!

546
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,506
- Good.
- Yes.

547
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,925
And, go.

548
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,802
Good.

549
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,513
Good.

550
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,016
That was too close.

551
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,977
He's tired but he won't quit, huh?

552
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,646
There's too much at stake.

553
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,648
If they loose this, they're going home.

554
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,528
Just miss. Please fail!

555
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,031
- Give us one little mistake.
- Go!

556
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,370
- Go!
- You're good.

557
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,499
You're good. You're good.

558
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,292
He barely cleared it that time.

559
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,543
Yeah, I saw.

560
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,838
He's shaking out his body now.

561
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,048
Yeah, he's tired.

562
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,508
The longer he takes,

563
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,634
the better for us.

564
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,762
If either of them miss…

565
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,846
It's all over.

566
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,097
Yeah, they're done.

567
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,099
The key to winning is consistency.

568
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,227
Decrease your chance of error
and be patient.

569
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,479
Just wait. Someone's gonna make a mistake.

570
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,481
Position.

571
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,024
You've gotta use as much power as you can!

572
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,943
Up!

573
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,532
Please, please, please, please, please…

574
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,450
Up!

575
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,244
- Yeah!
- Nice.

576
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,873
Once again, the ball was teetering
on the edge before it fell.

577
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,875
He just barely managed to clear it.

578
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,877
I'm not gonna lie,

579
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,754
that made me a little anxious.

580
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,422
- He's persistent.
- Let's go!

581
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,800
- Just ignore him.
- Come on, Itoi!

582
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,468
Please, please mess up.

583
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,136
Let his hand slip or something.

584
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,681
He's gonna panic if he misses this.

585
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,641
I think we still have a chance.

586
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,934
- He looks tired.
- Yeah, I agree.

587
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,603
- Let's go!
- Steady, Itoi.

588
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,119
Up!

589
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,121
- It's all good, just throw it again.
- Stay calm.

590
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,747
This is it! That's it, right?

591
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,458
- Come on.
- This is it. Please panic. Come on.

592
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,168
Panic, panic, lose your focus.

593
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,879
- You're good. Just stay focused.
- It's okay.

594
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,715
You're good, just stay focused.

595
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,509
<i>The lack of time was really stressful.</i>

596
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,719
Brace yourself.

597
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,476
Okay!

598
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,521
Okay!

599
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,065
- It's okay.
- You're good. You made it over.

600
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,609
Keep the same pace as before.

601
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,279
- Come on.
- It's okay.

602
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,657
It's okay! He's gonna crack eventually!
It'll be fine!

603
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,162
- Bravo!
- Yeah!

604
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,496
Let's go!

605
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,874
I told you.
We're the most consistent team.

606
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,125
All right, yeah. Let's go!

607
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,501
- Use your core.
- And, up!

608
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,296
Nice!

609
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,798
That's it!

610
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,050
- Great job!
- Yeah!

611
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,635
That's what I'm talking about!

612
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,389
We're going down to ten.

613
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,725
Weight increase?

614
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,352
<i>Starting now,</i>

615
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,605
<i>the weight of the bag will be increased.</i>

616
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,649
Whoops, my bad. Yeah, weight increase.

617
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,859
- Orkhon!
- You doing okay?

618
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:33,943
Yeah, I'm good.

619
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,156
<i>I wasn't worried. I knew I would win.</i>

620
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,076
Remember to try and get it
on the first try, okay?

621
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,953
<i>I was competing against myself.</i>

622
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,955
Anything could happen. All I could do

623
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,290
was brace myself and see it through.

624
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:51,419
<i>I had to keep throwing for my</i>
<i>team. No way I could let them down.</i>

625
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,380
You're still throwing it

626
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,839
higher than everyone else.

627
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,842
Okay.

628
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,386
- Get momentum…
- Ready…

629
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,305
- Swing!
- Up we go.

630
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,390
Nice and clear.

631
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,309
- Yes. Yes, yes.
- Amazing, man. Great start.

632
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,144
That's a lower throw than before.

633
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,771
Yeah, they're barely clearing it.

634
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,232
Find your position.

635
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,820
Use your hips, breathe, and go for it.

636
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:36,131
- Fantastic.
- There we go.

637
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,716
You got it next time.

638
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,426
- Ooh, that was close.
- You got it next time!

639
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,761
Come on, Itoi!

640
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,054
- Let's go!
- Steady!

641
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,180
Same as before.

642
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,687
- Yes! Yes!
- That's it! That's it!

643
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,022
- You're crushin' it, man! Crushin' it!
- Perfect!

644
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,316
Don't let 'em get to you, Ogeday!
You're fine!

645
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,362
Yes, get back into position.

646
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,197
Ready…

647
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,574
Use all that power.

648
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,617
Use all that power.

649
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,702
Come on!

650
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,912
- Bravo!
- Nice work!

651
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,038
Keep it up.

652
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,958
- He's just barely clearing it.
- Itoi.

653
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,170
I'm begging you, Itoi.
Please hang in there.

654
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:16,963
Stay focused.

655
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,424
- Let's go!
- Just like that.

656
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,509
Come on. Miss, miss, just miss.

657
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,429
Miss, miss, just miss.

658
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,640
Okay, okay.

659
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,185
It's still high but it's getting lower.

660
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,270
- Very good!
- Just keep doing what you're doing.

661
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,564
All right, Ogeday. Back to your position.

662
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,525
Miss. Please, please, please.

663
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,069
Use those hips! Up!

664
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,285
- Nice.
- You made it. Good work.

665
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,414
It was so close, man.

666
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,916
- So close.
- I know. Just barely.

667
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,005
<i>So by this point,</i>
<i>we'd been going for a while.</i>

668
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,466
<i>But there was no real way</i>
<i>of knowing when it would end.</i>

669
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,885
<i>We just had to see.</i>

670
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,762
It's just all about endurance now.

671
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,846
Hang on, Itoi.

672
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,389
- Let's go!
- Get ready!

673
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,308
Brace yourself. Steady.

674
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,392
Come on!

675
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,269
Look at that!

676
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,437
Perfect!

677
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,064
Nice!

678
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,316
- You're amazing, Itoi! Just amazing!
- He's killing it!

679
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,529
<i>The longer we played,</i>
<i>the more my stamina fell.</i>

680
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:26,825
But even then, if I had to throw it 1,000
times, then that's what I was gonna do.

681
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,576
<i>So, mentally,</i>

682
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,286
<i>I always had to be ready to go again.</i>

683
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,540
- One big swing.
- Okay, you know what to do.

684
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,791
All right…

685
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,417
- And, up!
- Let's go.

686
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,294
<i>I knew I would clear it every time.</i>

687
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,131
- And, up!
- Let's go.

688
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,260
Come on, you've got this!

689
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,554
He's getting lower.

690
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,305
Just have patience, okay?

691
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,183
Just focus on clearing the hurdle.

692
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,351
Back to position.

693
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,435
All right, let's go!

694
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,104
You know what to do.

695
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,480
Eyes up!

696
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,234
Eyes up!

697
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,286
- Yeah!
- Three, two…

698
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,913
Eyes up!

699
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,749
Five seconds.

700
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,586
Five seconds.

701
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,089
Five seconds.

702
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,335
There we go!

703
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,881
There we go!

704
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,510
Great work, Itoi!

705
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,474
- Bravo, you did great.
- Bravo.

706
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,225
<i>He'd been throwing for an hour</i>

707
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,270
<i>and a half by that point.</i>
<i>He did the best he could.</i>

708
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,941
It sucks. I hate being the reason
that our team lost today.

709
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,525
Letting them down was devastating.

710
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,319
It really broke my heart.

711
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,030
<i>I know Ogeday fought hard</i>
<i>until the very end.</i>

712
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,951
I want him to know how grateful I am,
for all that he did for us.

713
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,328
He has absolutely nothing
to be ashamed of.

714
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,372
It's okay, I'm proud of you.

715
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,706
You were amazing.

716
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,421
It's over! Yes!

717
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,174
- Killed it out there.
- Yeah, way to go!

718
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,551
We did it!

719
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:58,393
We did it! We made it!

720
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,270
<i>We were overcome with joy.</i>
<i>Through all the challenges,</i>

721
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:05,024
<i>we'd managed to save ourselves from</i>
<i>elimination, lived to fight another day.</i>

722
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,317
<i>It felt like</i>

723
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,029
<i>Itoi had breathed new life into our sails.</i>
<i>It felt amazing.</i>

724
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,615
You're the best, man.

725
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:16,369
<i>I felt great, yeah. After the</i>
<i>game, I felt as high as the Tokyo Dome.</i>

726
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,540
<i>Totem hold match.</i>

727
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,087
<i>We'd already made top four by this point.</i>

728
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,631
<i>If we break the time record,</i>

729
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,009
<i>we'll be able to make the top three.</i>

730
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,387
Whoo!

731
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,640
Let's go!

732
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,994
Physical: Asia<i>.</i>

733
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,665
<i>This marks the end of the third quest.</i>
<i>Team Rep Match.</i>

734
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,384
<i>Team Türkiye has been eliminated</i>
<i>from </i>Physical: Asia<i>.</i>

735
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:22,477
<i>As a result, you must now destroy your</i>
<i>torsos with your very own hands.</i>

736
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,238
<i>I wish I could say that</i>
<i>I'm leaving here a champion.</i>

737
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,199
Like I said at the start,

738
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,534
that was the whole reason we came here.

739
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,245
- For Türkiye!
- For Türkiye!

740
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,747
- With strength!
- With strength!

741
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,373
- We fight!
- We fight!

742
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,376
<i>We were confident.</i>

743
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:52,215
<i>Our team was strong and skilled. Of course</i>
<i>we believed we'd make it to the end.</i>

744
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,514
Come on, Nefise!

745
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,725
This is nothing, guys.

746
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,935
Aw, man.

747
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,356
Yeah, let's go!

748
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,441
Yasemin!

749
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,443
<i>And even though we lost, we still proved</i>

750
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,029
<i>to everyone</i>
<i>that Türkiye was the fiercest competitor.</i>

751
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,908
To my teammates, it was truly an honor

752
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,868
to compete alongside you.

753
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,871
And I want to thank you
for being here with me.

754
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,918
Here we go.

755
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,629
By the name and the will of God…

756
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,467
That was brutal.

757
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,887
It was a fierce battle. But one

758
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,390
that was fought with honor and dignity.

759
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,184
It's been a wonderful experience,
so thanks for having me.

760
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,603
It was an honor to have fought alongside

761
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,438
such incredible teammates.

762
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,528
We were fearless and strong,

763
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,739
and we fought to the bitter end.

764
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,743
But sometimes, things don't go to plan.

765
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,036
We have to accept that.

766
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,666
Even though we're leaving,
we're leaving with some

767
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,376
great stories and the knowledge

768
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,420
that we represented our country well.

769
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,005
Our time here's come to an end,

770
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,840
so now it's our turn to fly home.

771
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,596
<i>I'm</i>

772
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,972
<i>heartbroken.</i>

773
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,565
I feel like our honor and our pride

774
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,358
have been deeply wounded.

775
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,361
<i>But I know we everything we could.</i>

776
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,117
<i>Selfishly,</i>

777
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,953
I hope nobody watches past quest two.

778
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,955
But if you're here, I love you.

779
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,875
I've loved being here,
and I'm so incredibly

780
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,085
proud to be a part of this team.

781
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:58,090
One, two, three, Türkiye!
One, two, three! Team Türkiye!

782
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,053
<i>Yeah, my teammates are incredible.</i>

783
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,263
<i>We became a family</i>
<i>while competing together.</i>

784
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,265
<i>I wanna thank them</i>
<i>for everything they've done here.</i>

785
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,268
And I wish them all the best.

786
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,772
Now that we're going home,
the rest of you have it a lot easier.

787
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,983
<i>Team Türkiye will be watching all of you.</i>

788
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,947
So may the strongest team win. Good luck.

789
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,088
PHYSICAL: ASIA

790
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,464
Okay, okay.

791
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,216
Wow, so many less people, man.

792
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,467
The flags are still there.

793
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,636
And we're down to four.

794
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,932
- The final four.
- Four remain.

795
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,141
They did it.

796
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,394
- Welcome in.
- Hi.

797
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,479
Hi, hi.

798
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,565
- Let's have a good game.
- Yeah.

799
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,027
It's so weird how few people are left.

800
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,988
I know. It feels so empty in here.

801
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,907
Well, we're down to half
of what we started with.

802
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,200
I wonder who we'll face next?

803
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,786
Whoever it is, we'll fight with all

804
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,538
- that we've got.
- That's right.

805
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,710
<i>I wasn't that bothered</i>
<i>by how empty the room felt.</i>

806
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,044
<i>The emptier, the better.</i>

807
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,796
I wanted to eliminate the rest.

808
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,048
As quickly as possible.

809
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,134
Who should we target next?

810
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,052
I'm thinking Japan or Mongolia?

811
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,387
I don't care who goes home next,

812
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,055
so long as it's not us.

813
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,266
I mean, ideally,
it'd be nice for Australia to go.

814
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,517
Yeah, it'd be nice, but…

815
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,936
It's not that realistic.

816
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,396
They're a strong team.

817
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,941
<i>I'm as confident as ever.</i>

818
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,277
Physically, there is no one
that can beat us.

819
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,362
I'm still…

820
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,198
I'm still clutching out that they start
bringing in, like, wrestling mats.

821
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,826
Rob's so eager to fight.

822
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,038
Yes!

823
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,582
Physical: Asia<i>.</i>

824
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,417
- <i>Physical: Asia</i>.
- Oh, no.

825
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,501
What's next?

826
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,045
The all-seeing eye.

827
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,174
<i>Among eight countries,</i>
<i>only four of you have survived.</i>

828
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,342
<i>Australia…</i>

829
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,386
<i>Korea.</i>

830

<i>Mongolia.</i>

831
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,640
<i>And Japan.</i>

832
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,561
Congratulations, everybody. Nailed it.

833
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,189
<i>Before we announce the fourth quest,</i>

834
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,150

836
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,612
Oh, no.

837
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,906
Oh, man, I almost forgot about that.

838
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,575
Oh, whoa, there's like a poll.

839
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,659
Aw, shoot.

840
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,915
<i>Who would you like to avoid</i>
<i>a one-on-one match with?</i>

841
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,250
The person I don't wanna fight?

842
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,169
That's actually a difficult question.

843
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,921
Like, the person I'm afraid of?

844
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,255
Trying to think.

845
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,717
In a one-on-one…

846
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,304
Mmm…

847
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,807
<i>The contestant</i>
<i>who received the most votes…</i>

848
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,392
Who will it be?

849
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,022
Oh, no. Are they gonna reveal
what we all said?

850
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,234
What if it's you?

851
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,318
I mean, maybe.

852
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:08,322
<i>…was Team Australia's Eddie Williams.</i>

853
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,580
Yeah, man, this is obvious.

854
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,665
No, no!

855
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,001
To be fair, how are you supposed
to beat him one-on-one?

856
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,753
Even if you had a friend, it'd be hard.

857
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,589
That's a good photo, though. Eddie.

858
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,508
You look angry.

859
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,635
- Eddie.
- Eddie.

860
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,678
Eddie-san.

861
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,515
Are you kidding me? There's no way
you can win against someone like him.

862
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,225
That's like trying to fight Godzilla.

863
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,897
In terms of raw power, I don't
think anyone here could compete with him.

864
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,568
Wow!

865
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,363
So please.
I really don't wanna fight Eddie.

866
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,741
You're the monster.

867
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,244
Godzilla.

868
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,871
Godzilla?

869
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,497
He just swore again.

870
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,001
Wait, why is everyone afraid of him?

871
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,294
I don't get it.

872
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,129
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I don't really think there's anyone</i>

873
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,381

874
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,632
Whoever I'm up against…

875
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,260
I'm ready for 'em.

876
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,887
<i>In order to test these results,</i>

877
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,931
<i>we will now play a short game</i>
<i>that will allow you to measure</i>

878
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,350
<i>each other's physical capabilities.</i>

879
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,436
- What kind of game would they choose?
- <i>The game</i>

880
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,688
<i>is one-on-one push and pull match.</i>

881
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,733
- Hand wrestle? Like this? Bro, I told you.
- Arm wrestling.

882
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,110
- Ah.
- Ah.

883
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,987
- Hand wrestling?
- Wait, hand?

884
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,405
<i>Similar to arm wrestling,</i>

885
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,450
<i>hand wrestlers apply force</i>
<i>with their body strength,</i>

886
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,452
<i>and are allowed to push or pull.</i>
<i>Whoever can get their</i>

887
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,038
<i>opponent to lift their foot</i>
<i>or fall over will win.</i>

888
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,999
<i>The push and pull bracket is comprised</i>

889
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,878
<i>of contestants who received</i>
<i>the most votes during the survey.</i>

890
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,135
What, no one wants to fight me?

891
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,471
But I'm really intimidating.

892
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,431
I'm a little annoyed
I didn't get any votes.

893
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,642
I guess I'm the scarier one.

894
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,477
Yeah. Kind of annoyed
I didn't make the cut.

895
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,397
<i>Bracket A: Round One.</i>
<i>Eddie Williams, Team Australia…</i>

896
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,276
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

897
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,737
<i>…versus Kim Min-jae, Team Korea.</i>

898
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,280
No telling who's gonna win.

899
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,365
Anything's possible.

900
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,909
- Let's go. Whoo!
- Let's go!

901
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,869
That's crazy. I can't wait.

902
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,038
I don't think Eddie's gonna budge at all.

903
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,373
Dude, he looks like he could eat you.

904
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,457
Exactly.

905
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,584
- Get in that headspace.
- You got this.

906
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,336
Instincts. Go with your instincts.

907
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,759
Wait, hold up.

908
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,345
Wait, hold up.

909
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,557
Just one grip, he's like, "Oh." Ruined it.

910
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,936
<i>His hand's,</i>
<i>like the size of a pot lid or something.</i>

911
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,772
Physically-speaking,
he's just built different.

912
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,483
<i>Even so, as a ssireum champion,</i>

913
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,609
<i>I felt pretty confident.</i>

914
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,737
He looks like Eddie gave birth to him.

915
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,198
Go, Min-jae!

916
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,825
Let's go!

917
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,243
<i>Ready.</i>

918
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,036
Go, Eddie.

919
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,712
Did you see that?
His foot almost came off.

920
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,172
- That was close! You can win this!
- Let's go, Min-jae! Keep fighting!

921
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,302
Come on, Min-jae! Show us what you've got!

922
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,775
Good effort, Min-jae. Good effort.

923
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,194
<i>The winner is Eddie Williams,</i>
<i>Team Australia.</i>

924
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,197
Good effort, Min-jae. Good effort.

925
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,450
- Incredible.
- That was amazing.

926
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,576
It's fine, save your strength.

927
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,952
Don't sweat it, You did great.

928
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,954
Damn, I don't think I can beat him.

929
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,464
<i>Round Two:</i>
<i>Orkhonbayar Bayarsaikhan, Team Mongolia</i>

<i>versus Yoshio Itoi, Team Japan.</i>

931
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,260
Look at his shoulders, man.

932
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,596
A beautiful man, with beautiful shoulders.

933
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,441
Ooh.

934
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,526
Wow, he's really strong.

935
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,570
- He even looks huge next to Itoi.
- Right?

936
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,031
<i>Ready.</i>

937
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:31,251
<i>The winner is</i>
<i>Orkhonbayar Bayarsaikhan, Team Mongolia.</i>

Whoa!

939
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,133
He just… Straight just pulled him down.

940
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,260
It's all good. What can you do?

941
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,930
Oh! Strong!

00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,479
<i>Round Three:</i>
<i>Eddie Williams, Team Australia,</i>

943

<i>versus Orkhonbayar Bayarsaikhan,</i>
<i>Team Mongolia.</i>

944
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,900
He looks so much bigger.

945
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,028
- Maybe 70 kilos?
- He looks so tiny next to him.

946
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,030
Be careful, okay?

947
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,701
<i>Ready.</i>

948
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,467
Just not strong enough.

949
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,970
- Nobody is.
- It's like he's glued to the floor.

950
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,223
<i>The winner is Eddie Williams.</i>

951
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,100
<i>Representing Team Australia.</i>

952
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,144
Yeah, good game, guys. Good game.

953
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,312
Man, that guy is insanely strong.

954
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:41,613
<i>Bracket B, Round One:</i>
<i>Robert Whittaker, Team Australia</i>

955
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,741

- Oh, my God.

00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,242
Yeah, Amotti!

957
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,535
Show 'em what you're made of!

958
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,496
If I win, I'm a UFC champion.

959
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,998
- What? Absolutely.
- If I beat him.

960
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,876
I think in this case,
Whittaker's got the upper hand.

961
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,211
Yeah, my money's on him.

962
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,840
<i>I've seen Whittaker fight on TV.</i>

963
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,968
<i>And now, here we are,</i>
<i>about to hand wrestle in person.</i>

964
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,678
I know it's just hand wrestling,

965
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,555
<i>but can I beat a UFC fighter?</i>

966
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,681
<i>I wasn't too sure.</i>

967
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,851
Whittaker's gonna destroy him.

968
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,353
<i>Oh, yeah. I'll win. For sure.</i>

969
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,147
For sure.

970
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,232
<i>Ready.</i>

971
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,570
Oh. Oh.

00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,322
Oh. Oh.

973
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,792
<i>Winner: Amotti, Team Korea.</i>

974
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,047
Awesome. You beat a UFC champ.

975
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,674
I think he used his strength against him.

976
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,595
<i>You know what, he's a wily guy.</i>

977
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,263
He took… He surprised me.

978
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,016
Little wily bugger.

979
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,143
Oh, Whittaker…

980
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,897
Taken down with one hand?

981
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,404
<i>Enkh-Orgil Baatarkhuu, Team Mongolia</i>

982
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,865
<i>versus Yushin Okami, Team Japan.</i>

983
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,158
You can't lose this.

984
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,828
He's smaller than you, Yushin.
Go crush him.

985
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,330
They're both fighters.

986
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,415
And Yushin's a pretty big guy, too.

987
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,209
He's like half his size.

988
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,295
But you never know.
That guy from Mongolia's

989
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,839
a pretty sharp fighter.

990
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,674
I guess we'll have to find out.

991
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,801
<i>Ready.</i>

992
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,890
Okami… Okami's base is really good.

993
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,810
- Yeah, he's got it nice and low.
- Really nice wide stance.

994
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,693
They're both really strong!

995
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,987
Yeah, you're right.
It's gonna come down to skill.

996
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,114
<i>We were evenly matched in strength,</i>

997
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,949
<i>so I knew I could get the upper hand.</i>

998
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,285
Oh! Oh! Oh!

999
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,370
Good, good, yeah, pull, Okami! Pull!

1000
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,499
This is a fun one.
This is a really fun one.

1001
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,836
It's funny,
cause there's so much size difference…

1002
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,713
- Yeah.
- …but so much strengths match.

1003
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,349
- Wow.
- Three hours, three hours!

1004
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,393
Such a even battle.

1005
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,326
Yushin!

1006
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,786
<i>Winner: Yushin Okami, Team Japan.</i>

<i>Team Korea</i>
<i>versus Yushin Okami, Team Japan.</i>

1009
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,171
He's got a great physique.

1010
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,714
- He really does.
- He's in great shape.

1011
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,549
- Wait, who?
- Amotti.

1012
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,718
Wait, no. No, no. You can't praise Amotti!

1013
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,762
We've gotta support Yushin, okay?

1014
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,890
"Amotti's so cool!"
No. Don't start praising the enemy.

1015
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,893
All right, here's your chance
to beat two UFC fighters.

1016
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,146
Let's go, Yushin.

1017
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,230
Let's go, Amotti.

1018
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,992
What's up with their hands?

1019
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,160
Oh. Oh.

1020
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,412
I'm sorry.

1021
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,414
I'm sorry.

1022
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,874
Sorry, sorry.

1023
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,334
Red card! Red card!

1024
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,256
- Come on!
- You can't hit him!

1025
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,842
No, no slip, no slip.

1026
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,888
No slip, no slip.

1027
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,556
Again?

1028
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,641
Okay, okay, okay.

1029
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,978
You one punch, I one punch?

1030
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,479
Ah, no, no, no, no.

1031
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,481
What did he just say?

1032
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,776
<i>Ready.</i>

1033
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,114
Oh!

1034
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,575
Ah!

1035
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,542
Ah!

1036
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,503
<i>The winner is Yushin Okami.</i>

1037
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,255
Representing Team Japan.

1038
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,849
<i>I know it was a fun little game,</i>

1039
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:23,186
<i>but I didn't want to lose. I was worried</i>
<i>it might crush our team's momentum.</i>

1040
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,273
And I couldn't let that happen.
So I had to win.

1041
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,736
<i>I knew he still had technique.</i>

1042
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:31,903
So, I…

1043
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:48,962
That was effortless.

1044
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,422
See? What did I tell ya!

1045
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,841
Just kind of went…

1046
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:56,011
I didn't give him enough time
to even think about a strategy.

1047
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,562
You can't just pick him up like that.

1048
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,355
Ah!

1049
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,692
In a blink of an eye, too. Unbelievable.

1050
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,278
Yeah, it's like
Eddie could do that in his sleep.

1051
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,114
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of the final match is Eddie Williams,</i>

1052
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,450
<i>Team Australia.</i>

1053
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,536
I'm impressed.

1054
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:25,791
Well, it just goes to show
how strong he is as an opponent.

1055
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:29,419
Not just in terms of physical strength,
but mental as well.

1056
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,588
Then everyone was right.
You were the scariest.

1057
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,967
So don't ever doubt a strongman.

1058
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,678
We can be strong, and we can be fit.

1059
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,973
<i>Once again,</i>

1060
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,351
<i>we will now play</i>
<i>another short game that will allow you</i>

1061
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,436
<i>to measure each other's</i>
<i>physical capabilities.</i>

1062
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,521
Another one.

1063
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,939
Whoa!

1064
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,943
<i>The game is Vertical Jump match.</i>

1065
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,319
<i>…is Vertical Jump match.</i>

1066
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,196
- Whoa.
- Vertical Jump?

1067
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,532
That's just the Sergeant jump, right?

1068
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,034
I think Sung-bin's gonna win.

1069
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,119
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

1070
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,870
This one was made for him.

1071
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,998
Ah. Why vertical? Make it horizontal.

1072
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,712
<i>Each participant will be allowed</i>
<i>to jump twice per height level.</i>

1073
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,090
Two attempts.

1074
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,801
<i>Please take a moment</i>
<i>to talk amongst your teammates</i>

1075
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,594
<i>and choose a participant.</i>

1076
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,762
That's easy.

1077
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,140
This is a no-brainer, right?

1078
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,349
I'm calling it now,

1079
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:27,435
nobody in this entire room is gonna
be able to jump better than this guy.

1080
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,486
Not easy. It's not easy for me at all.

1081
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,613
It's Sung-bin's turn to show off.

1082
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,448
Oh, who will play?

1083
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,575
We pick one.

1084
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,952
- Me or you? Me or Eloni.
- Just one?

1085
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,912
Uh, 'Loni, you're taller, bro.

1086
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,123
Eloni, that would be you, wouldn't it?
Wouldn't that be Eloni?

1087
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,083
Cause the height. The height.

1088
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,376
This makes a big difference.

1089
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,919
Well, I trained a lot of jumps too,

1090
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,754
for this competition.

1091
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,007
Eloni has the height advantage as well.

1092
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,843
Hey, here's our volunteer.

1093
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,762
Don't worry, you're the tallest one here.

1094
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,600
They said "You're tall
and play basketball, you've gotta do this.

1095
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,018
And besides, you're the only

1096
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:11,646
member of the team who has
any good jumping skills. So, hop to it."

1097
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,857
All right, Katsumi.

1098
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,066
- You want me?
- It's all you.

1099
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,568
Don't you jump when you swim?

1100
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,320
I mean, into the pool…

1101
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,404
<i>Yep.</i>

1102
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,698
I'm gonna do my best.

1103
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,159
At the very least
I'll get to show off my charm.

1104
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,830
<i>Vertical Jump match participants,</i>
<i>please step forward.</i>

1105
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,498
I think you're the shortest here.

1106
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,251
Coming in first place
as the shortest one would be crazy.

1107
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,295
Those guys are all good at jumping too.

1108
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,381
<i>The Vertical Jump match participants are…</i>

1109
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,468
<i>…Eloni Vunakece, Team Australia.</i>

1110
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,096
<i>Katsumi Nakamura, Team Japan.</i>

1111
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,849
<i>Yun Sung-bin, Team Korea.</i>

1112
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,895
<i>Dulguun Enkhbat, Team Mongolia.</i>

1113
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:56,316
Ooh, tough one. Big guy's a good jumper.
Those guys jump all the time in games.

1114
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,109
A swimmer, okay.

1115
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,487
Honestly, I'm more worried
about the basketball player.

1116
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,697
I'm keen to see Sung-bin jump in person.

1117
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,407
Yeah, I'm actually keen, too.

1118
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:08,119
<i>The first Vertical Jump match</i>
<i>is 300 centimeters.</i>

1119
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,247
Three hundred?

1120
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,125
Three hundred? Wow, that's really high.

1121
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,586
Eloni literally just does this for fun.

1122
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,296
- He just jumps and tries to reach things.
- Yeah, I know.

1123
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,464
That's why I sent him for this.

1124
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:22,968
Very good…

1125
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,307
Easy money! G!

1126
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,477
All right, here we go!

1127
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:35,730
You're kidding.

1128
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,024
- Let's go.
- Isn't that a bit much?

1129
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,192
Not for you!

1130
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,568
You can do it!

1131
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,487
- Use your arms!
- And legs.

1132
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,914
Yeah! Good jump!

1133
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,874
Come on, you can go higher.

1134
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,137
Oh, no way!

1135
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,180
I didn't know he could fly!

1136
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:13,018
- Wow!
- Yeah. I love watching you jump, bro.

1137
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,311
He's so floaty, eh?

1138
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,395
Yes, so floaty.

1139
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,398
All right! Let's go!

1140
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,617
<i>The height is now 320 centimeters.</i>

1141
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,286
Three meters and 20?

1142
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,413
Whoa!

1143
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,708
That's tough. But good
at weeding out the competition, I guess.

1144
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,127
Easy money, 'Lon.

1145
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,837
Full jump, nice touch.

1146
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,963
Just don't miss it.

1147
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,089
Nah, he got it.

1148
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,016
Whoa!

1149
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,434
I didn't expect that.

1150
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,146
- One more, one more.
- You're gonna have to give it a bit more!

1151
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,190
Ooh, shirt off! Yeah!

1152
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,485
It works better when you do it like this.

1153
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,529
Why'd he take his shirt off?

1154
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,989
If you fail here, you're done.

1155
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,325
Give it a bit more, G!

1156
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,409
Let's go, bro!

1157
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,745
<i>I'm just gonna hit it</i>
<i>with everything I've got</i>

1158
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:14,996
<i>and hopefully that's enough.</i>

1159
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,414
Let's go, bro!

1160
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,594
- I touched it, I touched it.
- He touched it!

1161
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,555
- I touched it.
- He touched it!

1162
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,017
He made contact, it counts.
It counts, it counts.

1163
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,356
- Yes!
- Yeah, come on!

1164
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,943
See? Take the shirt off, it works better!

1165
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:50,407
Seriously. Someone with
that build being able to jump that high…

1166
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,493
I mean, I couldn't believe
it was the same guy.

1167
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,203
It was impressive.

1168
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,206
Oh wow. Okay, that's bad.

1169
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,457
You can do it!

1170
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,626
- Come on Katsumi! Believe!
- Just believe!

1171
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:07,715
Yeah, no. That's not happening.

1172
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,509
It's okay.

1173
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,846
That was, what? 20 centimeters off?

1174
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,598
Take your shirt off.
Shirt off. It makes it better.

1175
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,226
There we go. There we go.

1176
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,728
Yeah, yes!

1177
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,571
- Believe in yourself!
- Let's go!

1178
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:33,283
I know I have great
leg strength, so it wasn't impossible.

1179
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,368
I mean, I hoped for the best.

1180
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,506
Wow. He did go higher.

1181
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,467
- He did go higher.
- It was higher!

1182
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,345
<i>But 320 centimeters</i>
<i>is a little too high for me.</i>

1183
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:58,766
I mean, I tried to be optimistic,
but that's ridiculously high to jump.

1184
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,979
Well, I did get closer than I thought,
but that's almost worse.

1185
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,315
You're joking.

1186
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,488
What is this? You're killin' me.

1187
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,364
- Okay, Sung-bin.
- Your time to shine!

1188
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,283
It's all you, Sung-bin!

1189
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,119
I think he's gonna make it.

1190
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,871
Man…

1191
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,801
Oh my gosh!

1192
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,141
Wow! That was crazy!

1193
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,852
Hey! Don't give up! Shirt off!

1194
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,529
So good!

1195
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,113
Yeah, let's go!

1196
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,198
You show 'em, Sung-bin!

1197
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:57,575
That was a warm-up! Let's do it for real!

1198
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,206
He'll do it. I reckon he got it.

1199
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,166
- Oh!
- Let's go!

1200
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,336
Wow, that's so high though.

1201
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:27,522
So close. So close.

1202
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,275
<i>It was just out of reach.</i>

1203
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,570
He hit the middle of the blue section.

1204
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,654
If only he were taller.

1205
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,531
Yeah, height makes a big difference.

1206
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,994
Mongolia!

1207
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,455
- I think he's got it. You've got this!
- Yeah, he's good.

1208
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,667
I mean, it was pretty doable for me.

1209
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,137
He was right there!

1210
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:01,889
Just jump again, okay? And stretch.

1211
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,726
Ugh, okay.

1212
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,782
I couldn't reach it.

1213
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,333
Let's go!

1214
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,169
See, eh?

1215
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,630
Take your shirt off,
it works every time. See?

1216
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,471
<i>I thought I could do a lot better.</i>

1217
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,097
So that was disappointing.

1218
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:48,269
<i>The winner of the Vertical Jump</i>
<i>match is Eloni Vunakece, Team Australia.</i>

1219
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,271
Yes!

1220
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,818
- That's our boy!
- Let's go!

1221
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,196
They've got a two-win streak goin'.

1222
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,864
- They've won everything.
- Yeah, they were first.

1223
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,532
- That's nuts.
- It was close though.

1224
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,868
Of all the teams that were left,

1225
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,704
Australia was by far the biggest threat
to any of us.

1226
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,873
And this was a painful reminder.

1227
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:12,752
How can you beat that? I don't know.

1228
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,089
I am the highest jumper
in all of the Asian nations.

1229
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,716
"Asia's highest jumper, Eloni Vunakece".

<i>The time has come.</i>

1232
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:26,516
- <i>Your fourth quest will begin momentarily.</i>
- Oh!

1233
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,769
- Let's go!
- We're ready.

1234
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,062
Yeah, mate.

1235
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:35,149
<i>Contestants,</i>
<i>please make your way into the arena.</i>

1236
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,652
All right, here we go, everybody.

1237
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:38,736
All right!

1238
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,987
Let's do it!

1239
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:41,823
Let's go!

1240
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,253
Last 30 seconds of your life!

1241
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,213
We can do this!

1242
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,426
Okay! Lift, lift, lift, lift!
