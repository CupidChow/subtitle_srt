1
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,927
Subtitles are color-coded by country,
and this setting cannot be changed.

2
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,146
<i>The time has come.</i>
<i>Contestants, please enter the arena.</i>

3
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,572
Anyone home?

4
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,826
- Ah, this is sick.
- Welcome to the jungle!

5
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,745
That tree is huge.

6
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,079
Don't do things by halves.

7
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,330
What is this?

8
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,415
What's that?

9
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,877
Holy shit. This is crazy.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,211
Wow, look at that.

11
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,047
- What the heck?
- Bro…

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,340
So as I walk into quest three arena,

13
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,384
<i>I see this massive tree</i>

14
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,763
<i>with fabric hanging down</i>

15
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,142
<i>and traditional Korean rope.</i>

16
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,479
And it was just such a nice setting.
It was like a movie setting.

17
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,023
- Nice. I can't believe it.
- This is really eerie.

18
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,357
What is this?

19
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,984
<i>The sets were crazy last season,</i>

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>but this season's even better.</i>

21
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,738
<i>Some of it was confusing,</i>

22
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,740
<i>but it all looked interesting and fun.</i>

23
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,824
<i>I was excited.</i>

24
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,871
Yo, this is massive.
There's actual real leaves?

25
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,540
<i>Every setup has been amazing.</i>

26
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,252
I felt like I was transported back
a few hundred years ago in Korea.

27
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,133
Physical: Asia.

28
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,218
Here we go.

29
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,428
<i>We will now revel the details</i>

30
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,596
<i>of the third quest.</i>

31
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,224
<i>The Team Representative Match.</i>

32
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,284
PHYSICAL: ASIA

33
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:03,832
6. INSURMOUNTABLE WALL

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,962
<i>Your third quest,</i>
<i>the Team Representative Match,</i>

35
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,132
<i>will consist of four individual games.</i>

36
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,550
Holy moly.

37
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,385
They're all here.

38
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,470
They're all here.

39
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,098
- <i>The sack toss.</i>
- Sack toss?

40
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,182
<i>One person.</i>

41
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,352
Oh, over the bar!

42
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,979
- Holy…
- Right, oh.

43
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,608
<i>In this timed game, the players</i>
<i>must throw the sack over the hurdle</i>

44
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,236
<i>in order to pass the sack</i>
<i>to their opponents.</i>

45
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,614
<i>The hurdles are 4 meters tall.</i>

46
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:41,327
<i>As for the sack,</i>
<i>its weight starts at 14 kg.</i>

47
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,165
Okay. You throw it behind you.

48
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,332
Over that thing?

49
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,793
And whoever gets tired the fastest loses.

50
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,044
So it's endurance first.

51
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,504
I can do that too.

52
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,925
<i>We actually, um, have</i>
<i>more experience doing that</i>

53
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,343
<i>since I'm a strongman athlete.</i>

54
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,472
So I have the grip strength
and the endurance as well.

55
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,850
Uh, we have the advantage for that event.

56
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,353
- Hanging endurance.
- Wait, hanging?

57
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,438
<i>One person.</i>

58
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,690
- Oh, hanging endurance.
- Hanging endurance.

59
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,858
- Here.
- Where's that?

60
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,234
Which one?

61
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,652
Where do we hang from?

62
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,616
<i>Players must hang from</i>
<i>long strips of fabric as long as they can.</i>

63
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,327
Those over there?

64
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,411
Holy…

65
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,622
Yeah, I couldn't do… Yeah.

66
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,207
It's all about grip strength.

67
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,625
That's insane.

68
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,002
<i>Stone Totem Endurance.</i>

69
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,255
<i>Two people.</i>

70
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,424
- "Stone Totem Endurance"? Okay.
- Oh, wow.

71
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,343
- Two people again.
- Two people.

72
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,263
<i>In this game, while standing back to back</i>

73
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,515
<i>two representatives from each team</i>

74
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,477
<i>will fight to uphold four totems</i>
<i>as long as possible.</i>

75
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,230
<i>The weight of each stone totem</i>

76
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,607
<i>is 135 kg.</i>

77
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,569
<i>Should even one of the totems</i>
<i>fall to the ground,</i>

78
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,613
<i>that team will be eliminated.</i>

79
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,907
- So, that means…
- Both need to be up.

80
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,452
And they're insanely heavy too.

81
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,287
This is your game, Eddie.

82
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,748
It's cool, 'cause I get to do it
with two people.

83
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,708
<i>When I heard 135 per hand,</i>

84
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,670
I thought I could just do it on my own.
We didn't need two people.

85
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,255
<i>I knew that, you know,</i>

86
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,924
<i>this was one of the… this was</i>
<i>gonna be one of my events.</i>

87
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,677
<i>Pillar vaulting.</i>

88
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,638
Pillar jump rope.

89
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,722
<i>Two people.</i>

90
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,102
<i>In this game, two players from each team</i>
<i>will compete in a short relay.</i>

91
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,064
<i>Each team member must complete ten laps</i>
<i>by vaulting over the pillar.</i>

92
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,148
10 TIMES X 2 PEOPLE

93
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:38,027
<i>Once those are completed,</i>
<i>the second runner will grab the flag.</i>

94
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,112
Wow.

95
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,699
Sorry, guys. Sorry, everyone.

96
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,785
It's literally parkour, sorry. Apologies.

97
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,954
- He said parkour?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,498
<i>And finally, to keep things fair,</i>

99
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:54,794
<i>every member of each team must</i>
<i>compete in at least one of the four games.</i>

100
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,922
Okay, so we can do multiple.

101
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,090
You can't.

102
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,883
Two, one…

103
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,093
<i>In each of the games,</i>

104
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,595
<i>the first place team</i>
<i>will earn three points,</i>

105
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,639
<i>the second place team will earn two,</i>

106
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,434
<i>and the third place team</i>
<i>will earn only one.</i>

107
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,771
<i>Once all four games are complete, the</i>
<i>scores will be tallied, and teams ranked.</i>

108
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,525
<i>And the team</i>
<i>that earn the lowest score overall,</i>

109
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,818
<i>will be eliminated.</i>

110
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,613
<i>If there is a tie,</i>

111
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,950
<i>in lieu of a rematch,</i>
<i>the final standing will be determined</i>

112
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,536
<i>by placement in the pillar vaulting game.</i>

113
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,788
Australia's going to
have an advantage there.

114
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,666
- But it's such a short lap.
- If you're fast…

115
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,293
You can't really tell at this point.

116
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,343
<i>Contestants, you will now</i>
<i>select your game representatives.</i>

117
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,219
<i>Please meet with your teammates</i>

118
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,139
<i>to determine which players</i>
<i>are assigned to each game.</i>

119
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,725
All right, bring it in, guys.

120
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,810
All right, we need
everyone's contribution here as well.

121
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,562
How good are you with holding?

122
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,231
No, I don't think we should sacrifice
the two biggest guys on that.

123
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,150
The other one I was gonna think of doing

124
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,235
was the flip,
'cause it's just constant power.

125
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,987
Just power, over and over.

126
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,947
Actually, I'm thinking…

127
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,825
I'm not certain whether, um,

128
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,578
- I do the sack flipping or that one.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,747
With your muscle endurance,
maybe that one.

130
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,041
- That's what I was thinking too.
- Yeah.

131
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,336
<i>Of course, with Ray, I thought</i>
<i>the totem poles would definitely be</i>

132
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,130
extremely fitting for his discipline.

133
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,466
<i>I thought there were some good events</i>

134
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,218
<i>to use Robyn in, with speed.</i>

135
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,012
<i>In my head, I was thinking about</i>

136
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,515
<i>who should be placed in which event.</i>

137
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,643
'Cause you can also kind of look at it…
look at the other teams.

138
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,269
Sack toss won't be their strongest point.

139
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,938
I think I'd be good at sack toss.

140
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,315
I-I'd be pretty good at sack toss too.

141
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,483
He can win the sack toss.

142
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,318
'Cause he can just keep going
forever. Honestly.

143
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,403
- Yeah, honestly.
- That's what…

144
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,987
- That's one of his comps.
- Yeah.

145
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,031
- He could do both of them.
- I could do both.

146
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,409
What do you guys think?
Like, where should we put…

147
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,577
<i>We knew that if he was in the sack toss…</i>

148
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,579
<i>whichever… any strength contest</i>

149
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,873
he was going to be in,
he was going to win three points.

150
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,627
<i>So it was more,</i>
<i>where did we want to use that trump card?</i>

151
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,462
<i>Where did we want to get three points?</i>

152
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,297
This is really tricky.

153
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,258
All right, Amotti,
what are your thoughts here?

154
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,927
All right.
I think the probability to tie is high,

155
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,471
so that's where
we should put all our effort.

156
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,681
If there's a tie

157
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,975
then the scores from that game determine
who gets to stay.

158
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,643
- Wait, which?
- The hurdle game.

159
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,478
Okay, I see. Ten laps per person.

160
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,522
- That's easy.
- Too easy.

161
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,357
- What if it's round trips?
- It's a speed battle.

162
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
Each person does ten laps…

163
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,901
- Round trips.
- …for a total of 20.

164
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,653
So if our goal is to win the hurdles,

165
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,780
then we have to put two men on that game?

166
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,365
We have to give up the pillars.

167
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,908
But then we won't have the power.

168
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,493
Yeah, they have strongmen on their team.

169
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,786
Are we okay with that,

170
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,997
so that we can focus more on the hurdles?

171
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,082
Yeah? Or should we keep it balanced?

172
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,750
Okay, okay. How about this?

173
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,421
<i>The meeting period has come to an end.</i>

174
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,719
Physical: Asia.

175
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,597
<i>Third quest. Team Representative Match.</i>

176
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,890
Whoo!

177
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,976
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Let's go!

178
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,769
Let's go!

179
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,898
<i>First game.</i>

180
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,444
<i>Those selected for the pillar vault</i>
<i>please enter the arena.</i>

181
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,529
<i>The game will begin momentarily.</i>

182
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,781
Korea!

183
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,158
Fight on!

184
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,285
When I say "cattle," you say "dog"!

185
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,453
- Cattle!
- Dog!

186
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,705
- Let's fight!
- Philippines!

187
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,873
Let's go!

188
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,543
- This is gonna be fun.
- Let's crush 'em, guys! Come on!

189
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,378
Hey, buddy. Ooh, interesting choice.

190
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,631
YUN SUNG-BIN
FORMER NATIONAL TEAM SKELETON RACER

191
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,635
Picks two of the guys. Yeah, yeah.

192
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,929
Yeah, I didn't expect
that-that matchup from…

193
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,681
<i>I thought we'd crush the vault challenge.</i>

194
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,600
<i>I was confident in our overall speed.</i>

195
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,229
So, of course I went in thinking
we'll take first place, no problem.

196
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,441
<i>As soon as they told us</i>
<i>what the games were,</i>

197
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,818
<i>I knew that I was doing</i>
<i>the first challenge.</i>

198
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,864
It's jumping over blocks,
which is 100 what I train.

199
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,493
<i>Katelin is just a little Energizer Bunny.</i>

200
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,953
<i>She was the perfect choice,</i>

201
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,164
<i>where she can continue going</i>
<i>and her stamina is crazy.</i>

202
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,917
<i>For me and Lara, we have speed.</i>

203
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,628
And I run 400 hurdles for a living.

204
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,129
ROBYN
NATIONAL TEAM 400 M HURDLES ATHLETE

205
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,631
So that's just what I do all the time.

206
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,258
<i>I'm a CrossFitter.</i>

207
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:14,887
<i>I'm the balanced one, and I'm stronger</i>
<i>in my stamina, endurance.</i>

208
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,514
We know we can do our best

209
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:20,184
in order to maximize our potential
and win the game.

210
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,564
Okay.

211
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,899
We need a strategic victory please, guys.

212
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,401
It'll be an easy victory.

213
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,736
This game? Yeah, I think you're right.

214
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,740
If we win this our team is safe,
I guarantee it.

215
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,248
<i>Team Representative Match.</i>

216
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,501
<i>First game: Pillar Vaulting.</i>

217
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,673
<i>The match will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

218
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,847
Let's go!

219
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,182
Win, guys. You got it!

220
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,727
Come on, Lara.
Good start, good start, good start!

221
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,025
Stun Gun!

222
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,109
Let's go!

223
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,361
Yun Sung-bin, let's go!

224
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,363
- We need to win.
- They must be nervous.

225
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,615
Come on, you two.

226
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,076
<i>Looking around,</i>
<i>I knew we'd made the right decision.</i>

227
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,746
<i>We were winning this game.</i>

228
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,999
<i>Stand by.</i>

229
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,711
<i>Ready…</i>

230
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,800
Go!

231
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,307
Back, back over. Back, back over.

232
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,601
Then two, over, smooth.

233
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,353
Bell, bell, bell.

234
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,438
Good work. One. Good.

235
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,442
All right, let's make it count!
You're doing great!

236
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,568
You've got this!

237
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,320
Come on, speed it up!

238
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,865
- That's it, Kate. That's it.
- Come on, Kate. Let's go. Good!

239
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,450
Good.

240
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,077
You've got it, Lara.

241
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,204
Come on, Lara.

242
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,456
Keep it up!

243
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,001
Let's go, Kate. Gotta catch him,
Kate. Come on, catch him!

244
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,086
Catch him, Kate! Ca…

245
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,462
Destroy them!

246
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,048
Round and around and around.

247
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,717
Nice job, Dong-hyun!

248
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,637
That's four.

249
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,515
You can catch up, Kate, come on!

250
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,725
You've got this!
I want you to keep running!

251
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,895
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

252
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,398
- Pick it up, let's go!
- You've got this, Lara.

253
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,526
Work. Work.

254
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,946
Slow. Come on.

255
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,989
Come on, Lara, push!

256
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,908
- Come on, Lara!
- Good work, Lara!

257
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,577
<i>When I was jumping off the pillars,</i>

258
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,288
<i>it was hard for me because I'm short.</i>

259
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,874
<i>I need to exert more effort to jump,</i>

260
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,835
<i>but not being negative about anything.</i>

261
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,921
<i>Just so we can perform</i>
<i>and do our best for the team.</i>

262
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,675
You've got this, guys! Keep it up!

263
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,344
This is intense.

264
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,596
Just three more laps! You're almost there!

265
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,894
Eight.

266
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,106
<i>The impression I got</i>
<i>was that the first runners</i>

267
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,275
<i>on the other two teams were slower.</i>

268
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,153
<i>So, my goal was to widen the gap</i>
<i>as much as possible.</i>

269
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,489
<i>After all, the professional</i>
<i>parkour athlete was about to tag in.</i>

270
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,242
<i>I needed to make sure</i>
<i>Sung-bin stayed ahead.</i>

271
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,329
Come on, Kate, don't slow. Push yourself.

272
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,373
Push yourself. Come on.

273
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,292
Come on, Kate, keep pushing.

274
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,628
Perfect form, Kate, perfect form.
Nice, step, over.

275
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,381
<i>I'll admit,</i>
<i>I was a little worried that it was</i>

276
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,342
<i>two men up against</i>
<i>a woman and a man in our team.</i>

277
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,344
<i>So I had a lot of work to do.</i>

278
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,222
- Last one!
- Watch your pacing.

279
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,434
We're winning. We've got this. Nice, nice!

280
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,936
<i>Sung-bin's a complete powerhouse.</i>

281
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,564
<i>He's unmatched in strength and speed.</i>

282
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,982
<i>Nobody was gonna beat us.</i>

283
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,443
Mind your pace.

284
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,321
Okay, good.

285
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,405
Just hold steady.

286
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,491
Good job, Sung-bin! Keep it up!

287
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,826
Just don't let your guard down!

288
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,453
Let's go, Dom!

289
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,747
- Just don't let your guard down!
- Whoa. Holy cow.

290
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,540
Come on, just a little bit faster!

291
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,043
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Come on, explosive!

292
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,587
Last one, last one.
Push through, push through.

293
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,755
Go, out of there.

294
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,383
Let's go, Dom, let's go, Dom!
Let's go, Dom! Yes, Dom!

295
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,052
Mr. Parkour's too fast.

296
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,848
- Let's go, Dom! Let's go, Dom!
- Recover, Dom, recover.

297
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,478
<i>Smooth is fast, and fast is smooth.</i>

298
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,189
<i>Parkour is about finding</i>
<i>the most efficient path.</i>

299
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,357
<i>So I knew if I did</i>

300
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,776
<i>Kong, step, step, lazy, around,</i>

301
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,487
<i>Kong, step, step, lazy, bell,</i>

302
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,905
<i>and just hit that rhythm,</i>

303
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,324
then it was gonna be faster
than any other athlete there.

304
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:49,036
Hang on, Sung-bin! It's all about
endurance! Just stay focused!

305
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,704
You're doing great! Keep it up!

306
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,289
Don't slow down!

307
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,208
Three.

308
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,212
He's slowing down, Dom!

309
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,589
You're catching him! You're catching him!

310
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,842
You're catching him, Dom!

311
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,428
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

312
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,021
Go, go, go!

313
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,233
Good!

314
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,317
Nice, Robyn!

315
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,529
- Let's go! Let's go, Robyn!
- Nice, Robyn!

316
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,325
Okay! I think he's got it now.

317
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,952
Great job, Sung-bin!

318
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,581
Okay, okay! We've got this!

319
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,166
Let's go, Dom. Let's go, let's go, Dom!

320
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,628
Yeah, keep pacing yourself, okay.
But still push when you can.

321
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,172
Let's go, Dom, let's go, Dom! Come on!

322
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,175
Let's go, let's go! Let's go, Dom!

323
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,846
Let's go! Two left!
Let's go, Dom! Let's go!

324
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,682
- You're killing it, Sung-bin!
- Let's go!

325
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,642
Come on, Sung-bin! Keep pushing!

326
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,185
Get in, Dom! Go, go, go!

327
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,778
<i>Come on, Sung-bin.</i>

328
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,488
Go, Sung-bin!

329
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,948
You gotta pick up the pace!

330
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,283
Push! Push!

331
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:14,872
Let's go, Dom! Let's go,
two left! Let's go, Dom! Let's go!

332
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,751
Let's go, Dom! Win it, win it, win it!

333
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,960
Let's go, Robyn!

334
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,300
Good work. Come on, finish
strong. Finish strong, finish strong.

335
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,886
Sung-bin, he's tired. Australia's tired!

336
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,055
Keep it up! You're almost there!

337
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,807
Come on, last one! Press and sprint!

338
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,978
Okay, press it and go.

339
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,205
Dom, you beautiful man!

340
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,582
- Tomato! Tomato! Tomato!
- Let's go!

341
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:03,212
Tomato! Tomato! Tomato!

342
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,131
- Whoo!
- Whoa! That was mad, dude!

343
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,135
It's okay, there's
one more round. You can do it!

344
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,390
<i>Man…</i>

345
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,559
by the end of that first round,

346
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,688
it was obvious that we'd made a mistake.

347
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:25,109
<i>My legs were already feeling numb</i>
<i>and we were only halfway through,</i>

348
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,318
<i>which was a bad sign.</i>

349
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,613
<i>Before we started</i>
<i>I thought it'd be a speed battle,</i>

350
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,699
<i>but the game was all about endurance.</i>

351
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,035
And once I realized that,
I knew things weren't gonna play out

352
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,412
like we thought they would.

353
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,541
<i>The match has ended.</i>

354
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,459
Nice one.

355
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,336
- Sorry, sorry.
- Don't worry.

356
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,464
Nice, nice. Nice one, nice one.

357
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,384
Dong-hyun!

358
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,177
Nice job!

359
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,138
You gotta do more to give
Sung-bin some more leeway!

360
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,222
Got it!

361
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,559
All right,
I'm gonna try to widen it by two laps.

362
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,187
Give it your all.
We gotta win first, okay?

363
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,772
If we end up in second,

364
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,857
we're gonna regret it.

365
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,028
So no regrets, all right?
This is our last stand.

366
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,364
Come on, Dom. Come on, you got this.

367
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,992
Easy money. Let's get this win
and get three points on the board.

368
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,872
<i>If I just keep my pace</i>

369
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,832
<i>and don't get any further behind,</i>

370
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,167
<i>Dom can definitely catch them.</i>

371
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,547
<i>Stand by.</i>

372
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,012
- Stay close. Get on your front foot!
- Stay on!

373
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,723
Fight on, Korea!

374
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,769
<i>Ready…</i>

375
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,275
Let's go, babe. Yes!

376
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,198
Great, he's pushing.

377
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,366
Over.

378
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,035
Bell. Beautiful. One.

379
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,412
You've got to hurry!

380
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,414
Just like that! Let's go, man!

381
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,084
After this, you're done for the day!

382
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,338
Okay, two.

383
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,298
Ten rounds! Keep the pace up.

384
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,051
I know you're burning.
Let's push through. Let's go!

385
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,677
That's it, breathe, breathe.

386
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,846
Good! Come on, babe.

387
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,767
Don't slow down now!

388
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,436
That's it! There you go!

389
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,107
Over, around. Three. Come on.

390
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,818
Good pace. Keep that pace, Kate.
Just keep it nice and smooth.

391
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,988
Five!

392
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,327
He's gassing, he's gassing, Kate.
Let's go!

393
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,372
Good job. This is your time,
Kate! Kate, let's push through!

394
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,706
Pick up the pace!

395
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,000
Go, Kate! Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!

396
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,962
Let's go! Faster! Faster! Faster!

397
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,171
Let's go, Kate, come on!

398
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,841
Let's go, Kate! Come on! Take more!

399
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,218
Swing your arms, swing your arms,
swing your arms! Let's go!

400
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,387
<i>I kept trying to widen the gap,</i>

401
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,682
<i>but that girl from Australia</i>
<i>kept catching up to me.</i>

402
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,767
<i>Her speed really caught me off-guard.</i>

403
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,978
Last lap!

404
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,313
- Come on! You're almost there!
- Run!

405
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,440
Sung-bin, let's keep the pace!

406
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,733
Aim for first, guys!

407
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,027
And over, come on. Come on.

408
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,781
<i>Yun Sung-bin is the golden boy</i>
<i>from Season 1.</i>

409
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,616
<i>He is an absolute physical freak,</i>

410
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,910
<i>and I knew he was gonna be good at this.</i>

411
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,706
<i>But this is my court.</i>

412
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,583
Hit it, hit it, hit it.

413
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,669
Let's go, Dom!
Let's go, Dom! Let's go, Dom!

414
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,753
Let's go, Dom. Yes!

415
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,214
Get him, Dom. He's gassed,
he's gassed, Dom! He's gassed!

416
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,383
Come on, come on!

417
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,178
It's not over till it's over,
so keep pushing till the end!

418
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,470
Don't give up!

419
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,641
- This is your moment!
- Let's go, Dom!

420
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,019
Yes, Dom! Yes, Dom!

421
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,322
- Faster!
- You're almost there, Sung-bin!

422
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,448
Come on! Come on!

423
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,909
This is your game, Dom! This is your game!

424
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,995
Don't slow down! Push through it!

425
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,330
Let's go. Yes!

426
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,290
Let's go, Dom! Let's go!

427
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,541
Let's go. Yes!

428
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,211
Let's go, Dom! Let's go!

429
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,171
Yes, Dom!

430
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,965
Breathe, Dom! He's slowing down! Breathe!

431
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,052
Oh, sh…

432
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,679
<i>I was so full of adrenaline</i>

433
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,806
<i>that it physically hurt</i>
<i>every time I landed.</i>

434
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,728
<i>I was knackered.</i>

435
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,813
<i>I never do this much parkour in a row,</i>

436
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,316
<i>but for my team,</i>
<i>I'm just gonna keep pushing.</i>

437
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:41,031
Let's go eat! Let's go eat! Let's go eat!

438
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,616
Let's go, Tomato!

439
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,993
All right, you got this. Let's go.

440
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,496
<i>I mean, I was at a loss.</i>

441
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,580
<i>What could I do?</i>

442
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,334
Let's go eat! Let's go eat!

443
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,710
Let's go, Dom!

444
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,504
Whoo!

445
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,588
Yes, Dom!

446
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,466
Easy jog! Easy jog! Easy jog!

447
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,349
Tomato! Tomato!

448
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,434
- <i>The match has ended.</i>
- Tomato! Tomato!

449
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,770
Great work, Kate. Great work, Kate.

450
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,110
<i>The match has ended.</i>

451
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,198
It's okay.

452
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,033
They were tough.

453
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,660
Really tough.

454
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,204
We did it!

455
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,082
Whoo!

456
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,126
That was all you. Proud of you.

457
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,086
I'm f*****.

458
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,132
Yes!

459
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,675
I knew it!

460
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,929
<i>This round was over before it began.</i>

461
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,725
Ah, I'm so happy.

462
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,185
But I'm also so exhausted.

463
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,854
<i>That took every inch of me.</i>

464
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:58,608
<i>That took every part of my being</i>
<i>to stay true and finish strong.</i>

465
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,736
If I was to describe

466
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,573
<i>mine and Dom's teamwork in one word…</i>

467
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,867
Perfection.

468
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,330
God damn, guys!

469
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,457
- Man, that really sucks.
- I know.

470
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,963
And we used two of our men on that too,
which isn't good.

471
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,927
<i>I was really embarrassed,</i>
<i>and disappointed in myself.</i>

472
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,429
<i>I let my team down.</i>

473
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,932
<i>We were supposed to win,</i>
<i>not settle for second.</i>

474
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,352
<i>That's why Sung-bin and I chose hurdles.</i>

475
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,645
<i>But now that felt like a huge mistake.</i>

476
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,114
Physical: Asia.

477
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,034
<i>Team Representative Match. Game 2.</i>

478
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:53,622
<i>Stone Totem Endurance match contestants,</i>
<i>please enter the arena.</i>

479
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,290
<i>The game will soon begin.</i>

480
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,708
- Okay.
- Let's go!

481
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,752
- Let's go, boys.
- Come on, we got this.

482
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,920
Let's go, guys!

483
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,007
<i>We thought that Justin and Ray</i>
<i>would be perfect for that position</i>

484
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,509
<i>because they're our two biggest guys.</i>

485
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,095
<i>So we really needed them</i>
<i>for that position.</i>

486
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,973
<i>They're both very strong,</i>
<i>and not only physically, but mentally.</i>

487
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,144
<i>So I just had a feeling</i>
<i>that we would win it.</i>

488
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,189
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's show 'em!

489
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,816
<i>This'll be an interesting battle.</i>

490
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,152
<i>Because I know Eloni has</i>
<i>really good grip strength,</i>

491
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,321
<i>and I know Rob</i>
<i>has really good grip strength</i>

492
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,282
<i>from wrestling and mixed martial arts.</i>

493
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:33,912
<i>So I thought those two</i>
<i>would be a great pair to work together.</i>

494
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,540
Here comes
Korea's top <i>ssireum </i>wrestler!

495
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,624
Guy and a girl.

496
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,835
<i>Having Min-jae</i>
<i>on the totems was a no-brainer.</i>

497
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,086
<i>He was made for this.</i>

498
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,295
<i>Eun-sil was a risky pick,</i>

499
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,840
<i>but she was our best choice,</i>
<i>given the circumstances.</i>

500
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,884
<i>Plus, she's a wrestler,</i>
<i>so we knew she could hold her own.</i>

501
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,595
Man, that's cool.
They've sent all their big guys.

502
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,640
- Everyone's sent their… their tank.
- Yeah.

503
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,891
It'll be fine.

504
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,561
Our team will be okay if we get third.

505
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,272
<i>We knew that we'd be</i>
<i>at a disadvantage here,</i>

506
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,190
<i>especially going up against a strongman.</i>

507
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,817
<i>This wasn't our priority.</i>

508
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,360
<i>But since we'd lost the first game,</i>

509
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,612
<i>that meant the rest of us</i>
<i>suddenly had to scramble</i>

510
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,406
<i>to try and make up for that loss.</i>

511
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,783
<i>And that kind of pressure</i>
<i>could really hurt us.</i>

512
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,454
<i>Game 2: Stone Totem Endurance.</i>

513
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,957
<i>Contestants, please take your positions</i>
<i>and ready yourselves.</i>

514
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,750
Let's do it!

515
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,381
Both teams are intimidating.

516
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,008
Just look at 'em.

517
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,219
I feel like throwing my arms up,
"Go easy on us."

518
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,263
Ah, man.

519
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,098
<i>There was a lot of pressure.</i>

520
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,517
This was supposed to be
our throwaway game.

521
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,478
"We'll get first in hurdles.
Don't worry about it."

522
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,440
But unfortunately
we ended up in second place.

523
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:47,277
Min-jae, Eun-sil, just do your best, okay?

524
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,404
But Team Philippines can't come in first.

525
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,489
So you gotta fight.

526
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,699
If they come in first, we're screwed.

527
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,117
I believe in you, though.

528
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,078
<i>There's a lot at stake here,</i>
<i>but it's worth fighting for.</i>

529
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,290
<i>Eun-sil's strong,</i>
<i>and she's got a good grip too.</i>

530
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,504
<i>As for myself, this was the first time</i>
<i>in the entire competition</i>

531
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,547
<i>where I thought, "Oh, I've got this."</i>

532
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,549
It was time for me to show off a little.

533
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,800
I wanted to win this.

534
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,596
I'm gonna pretend
we're at the <i>ssireum </i>championships.

535
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,473
Let's go.

536
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,141
You're the strongest man under heaven.

537
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,684
- Come on.
- You really are.

538
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,103
You can pretend it's the Olympics then.

539
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,730
Okay.

540
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,484
We're the heaviest combination.

541
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,902
Yes.

542
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,947
We've gotta be smart, but
we've gotta keep our weight in the middle

543
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,990
and make sure
that we're both pulling equally.

544
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,493
- We've… We have to find the balance.
- We have to find the balance.

545
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,328
Let's go, bro, you and me.

546
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,871
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

547
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,790
<i>They said it's around 135 kilos.</i>

548
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,210
<i>So I'm confident that the weight</i>
<i>is not that heavy for me</i>

549
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,046
because I'm doing heavier pulls before.

550
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,965
<i>So I knew in the first game</i>

551
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,634
<i>that we came out</i>
<i>with the least amount of points.</i>

552
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,344
<i>Okay? Philippines had one point,</i>

553
00:25:54,427 --> 00:26:00,100
so we really couldn't afford
to notch up another last place.

554
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,520
<i>And this would just be a battle of,</i>
<i>you know, who could hold off the most</i>

555
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,689
<i>and who had a stronger mind-set.</i>

556
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:10,610
<i>And I was confident in… in both</i>
<i>Ray and I's ability to do this challenge.</i>

557
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,320
- That was it.
- We're gonna be able

558
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,488
- to hold f****** forever.
- I know.

559
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,573
That's why it's just gonna be

560
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,657
- a long game, this one.
- Yeah.

561
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,409
<i>Confidence in this one for me.</i>

562
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,660
ELONI VUNAKECE
FORMER RUGBY PLAYER

563
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,204
I know I'm up against some
really strong competition here, which…

564
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,624
I-I really enjoy that environment,
so I can't wait to get into it.

565
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,503
It'll be fine.

566
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,422
We'll just leave it to fate.

567
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,173
That's right, man. Yeah.

568
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,594
I mean, beating yourself up
won't change anything.

569
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,932
<i>Team Representative Match, Game 2:</i>

570
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,393
<i>Stone Totem Endurance.</i>

571
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,939
<i>The match will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

572
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,403
- Ten minutes of glory here, bro.
- Yeah, brother.

573
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,947
Don't look around.
We'll tell you what's happening.

574
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,157
- Yeah.
- Okay?

575
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,370
Please.

576
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,080
- Remember to communicate.
- Okay.

577
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,332
- We've got this.
- Yeah.

578
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,543
Come on. You've got this, guys. Let's go.

579
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,004
It's literally your sport. You got this.

580
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,088
Let's do it.

581
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,924
<i>Stand by.</i>

582
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,097
Let's go!

583
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,892
- Here we go. Come on.
- Come on, be ready!

584
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,311
- Let's go, guys!
- Let's go, boys. Come on!

585
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,395
<i>Ready…</i>

586
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,065
Zone out, boys.

587
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,540
Pull.

588
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,173
- It's started, boys.
- Just focus, boys. Don't look around.

589
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,383
Just chill out.

590
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,343
- Just chill out. Relax.
- Just breathe.

591
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,553
- I think we're good.
- How are you, bro?

592
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,846
- Huh?
- How are you?

593
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,556
Yeah, I'm good, brother. I'm good.

594
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,433
I'm really good.

595
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,477
Yeah, good shit!

596
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,108
<i>My first impression</i>
<i>with the weight of the stones…</i>

597
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,485
<i>You know, it wasn't that heavy.</i>

598
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,405
It wasn't gonna feel heavy at first,
but it would…

599
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,324
You know, it would slowly dawn on me
how heavy it was.

600
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,661
<i>Not about how long I could hold it,</i>
<i>okay? So…</i>

601
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:28,540
<i>Yeah, I was… I was still very confident.</i>
<i>Very confident.</i>

602
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,961
- I lost my hook grip. Shoot.
- Hurry.

603
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,546
You have to tuck it under.

604
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,839
Now don't move, okay?

605
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,799
And the thumbs down is weird.

606
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,719
Before we started,
I went over the hook grip.

607
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,304
We'll need a hook grip hold.

608
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,723
Coat your whole hand in chalk,

609
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,891
- then tuck your thumb in so it sticks.
- Okay, I see.

610
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,728
<i>When you're holding on</i>
<i>to something like a barbell or ring,</i>

611
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,523
<i>you want to tuck your thumb into your palm</i>
<i>so your hold feels more secure.</i>

612
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,692
<i>That's why I suggested</i>
<i>starting with the hook grip.</i>

613
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,737
That way when there's tension,
it's harder to let go.

614
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,697
Keep the hook grip, okay?

615
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,491
<i>But Min-Jae struggled with it at first.</i>

616
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,411
In <i>ssireum</i>, everyone always
grabs with their thumbs out.

617
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,954
<i>That's the standard grip position.</i>

618
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,831
<i>So the hook grip felt really weird.</i>

619
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,084
<i>However, since this was</i>
<i>an overhand ring grip,</i>

620
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,794
<i>I went with Eun-sil's suggestion.</i>

621
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,255
There we go.

622
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,136
Bro, center.

623
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,472
Bro, center.

624
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,640
Oh, they're starting to slip over there.
Look.

625
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,934
- All right, good job!
- The Philippines is starting to slip!

626
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,394
Just hold steady.

627
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,812
Find your base.

628
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,063
Bro.

629
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,649
Your left side. Your left side.

630
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,817
Your left side.

631
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,819
- Yo.
- That's better, that's better.

632
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,904
Yo.

633
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,198
That's better, that's better.
That's better.

634
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,993
Good work. Yep. Keep it up.

635
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:51,456
<i>I think it really hurt us early</i>
<i>on when we were conducting the challenge.</i>

636
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,458
<i>Because Justin's not a strongman athlete,</i>

637
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:57,045
<i>so I have to tell him, get the balance,</i>

638
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,048
<i>find the center, um,</i>
<i>and then hold it from there.</i>

639
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,549
Now hold it.

640
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,303
<i>So we are trying to readjust our body</i>

641
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,640
<i>just to get the center of the totem hold.</i>

642
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,935
All day, guys, all day.
You got this, come on.

643
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,355
You've easily got this.

644
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,316
I got you.

645
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,901
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- We're good.

646
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,029
We'll alternate if you need to.
Just let us know.

647
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,322
Yeah, take it for a sec?

648
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,657
Yep, got it.

649
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,452
That's it. That's it,
just keep doing that.

650
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,287
You're killing it, boys. Keep it up.

651
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,041
- I'm struggling.
- Already?

652
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,085
- Yeah, it's the arm strain.
- Just…

653
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,587
Min-jae's face looks red.

654
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,216
Breathe, Min-jae. Okay.

655
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,427
<i>It was hard.</i>
<i>It just got heavier and heavier.</i>

656
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,138
- Don't worry, I feel it too.
- Oh, yeah? Which side?

657
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,932
- I feel it on both sides.
- Yeah.

658
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,017
<i>It was challenging.</i>

659
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,353
<i>I didn't know how long I could last</i>
<i>standing still,</i>

660
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,605
<i>so I tried shifting my weight a bit.</i>

661
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,607
- Why don't we each take a side?
- How?

662
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,025
Which is your good side?

663
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,195
I don't know.
Wait, I think my left side's weaker.

664
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,031
- I'll start left and then swap right.
- Okay.

665
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,284
We can shift our positions. Here, like…

666
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,578
- Like this?
- Yeah.

667
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,871
- Like this?
- Yeah.

668
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,957
Let's see. Left, right.
Oh, they're taking sides.

669
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,919
The way they lean their hips
must be a good idea.

670
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,755
Their wrists get enough of a break
so they can hold on longer.

671
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,799
Come on, Min-jae.

672
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,801
Come on, you two.

673
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,514
It's a battle of the wills, guys. Come on.

674
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,932
You know you've got this.

675
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,020
- Relax for a second?
- Yep.

676
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,104
I've got it.

677
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,148
<i>So, my left forearm here,</i>

678
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:45,820
<i>I've got issues with one of my fingers, so</i>
<i>I can't fully grasp the, uh, the handle.</i>

679
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,989
<i>Lucky for me, Rob took the weight</i>

680
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,701
<i>just for a fraction of a second…</i>
<i>…to release my arm again.</i>

681
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,913
<i>It was really, really challenging</i>
<i>in that regard.</i>

682
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,749
<i>But Rob, yeah, once again,</i>
<i>back, forth, back, forth.</i>

683
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,084
<i>We just kept alternating</i>
<i>the load between the two of us.</i>

684
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,836
- Beautiful work.
- Come on!

685
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,796
Keep adjusting, that's good.

686
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,715
Readjusting.

687
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,594
You guys are not even moving.
Roman statues, good job.

688
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,930
This is pain. Keep it going!

689
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,932
- Fight through it!
- Fight through it!

690
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,934
Pain, boys, pain!

691
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,852
<i>Five minutes.</i>

692
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,109
Oh! Team Philippines is shaking again.

693
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,613
It's getting heavier.

694
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,697
I'm holding it, bro.

695
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,324
Are you holding it? It's getting heavier.

696
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,992
I'm holding it, really.

697
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,121
- You're doing great, guys.
- Yeah.

698
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,456
Philippines is struggling.

699
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,627
- Guys, keep holding, keep holding.
- Come on! We want that feeling. Come on!

700
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,462
They're starting to struggle, guys.

701
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,506
Stay centered. Come on, stay centered.

702
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,968
Thanks, bro.

703
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,136
Thanks, bro.

704
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,806
Ah, that feels way better.

705
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,307
Yeah.

706
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,476
Yep, adjust.

707
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,686
- Get stable again, good.
- Good.

708
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,188
Good, yeah.

709
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,272
Cillian,

710
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,108
Solana,

711
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,818
Hadassah,

712
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,778
Jaxson.

713
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,572
<i>I could tell that we were coming</i>
<i>slightly off balance,</i>

714
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,075
<i>and one side was feeling a lot heavier</i>
<i>than the other.</i>

715
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,286
<i>So the mind-set there was just,</i>
<i>you know, hold on,</i>

716
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,540
<i>and at least wait</i>
<i>for one team to… to draw out.</i>

717
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,259
Shit.

718
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,468
I think he's struggling.

719
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,431
Hey,
could you pull right a little bit more?

720
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,725
Your right side.

721
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,311
Pretend it's the last game, guys!

722
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,024
You guys are killing it up there!
Just keep holding!

723
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,235
I'm starting to sweat, man.

724
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,696
Okay, now left side.

725
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,614
A bit more.

726
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,908
All right, got it.

727
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,786
Let's stay like this.

728
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,247
We'll hold it here.

729
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,374
We just need to get second. Please, guys.

730
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,502
- They're struggling, boys!
- Come on!

731
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,670
You've got this!

732
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,380
F***. My left arm, man.

733
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,178
- I gotta rest, bro, my left arm's gone.
- Yep. Yep, yep.

734
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,513
Deep breath, yeah? That's it.

735
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,598
Slow.

736
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,935
You can outlast them.

737
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,483
- You've got this, boys! That's it!
- There you go.

738
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,402
Just hold on a little longer, okay?
You're doing great!

739
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,654
- Come on!
- You'll get through this!

740
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,739
I promise!

741
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,076
Go, boys. You got this.
All day, man! All day!

742
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,497
All day, let's go! All day.

743
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,083
All day. Let's go, guys.

744
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,004
You've got this!

745
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,966
You've got this!

746
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,426
You're not giving up.

747
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,097
He looks stressed.
I think he's struggling a lot.

748
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,389
He looks exhausted.

749
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,559
<i>Come on, you two.</i>
<i>Just hang on for a bit longer.</i>

750
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,686
- They're struggling, boys.
- Come on!

751
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,146
You've got this.

752
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,109
- You've got this, yes.
- Just hold on a bit longer, okay?

753
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,443
You're with her right now.

754
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,195
You've got her, Ray. You're with her.

755
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,156
<i>Telling myself that it's really light.</i>

756
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,534
<i>All you have to do is</i>
<i>hold it as long as I can.</i>

757
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,041
Australia's shaking.

758
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,001
A little bit of pain, boys!

759
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,133
- You've got that mental battle.
- Fight through!

760
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,884
Fight through the pain, boys!

761
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,597
Fight through it!

762
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,474
Fight on, Kim Min-jae!

763
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,101
- Fight on!
- Fight on!

764
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,895
- You too, Eun-sil! Fight on!
- Fight on!

765
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,522
Fight on!

766
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,606
Fight on!

767
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,111
Philippines is struggling.

768
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,195
- Are they?
- Uh-huh.

769
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,950
Let's go, boys.
You guys got this. Thumbs up.

770
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,411
Hold it, Justin.

771
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,708
Slow it down.
Deep breaths, brother. Deep breaths.

772
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,418
Hold it!

773
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,546
Min-jae, the team to your right is shaky!

774
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,298
They're struggling, so don't give up.

775
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,593
We just need to hold out
a little bit longer.

776
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,094
The Philippines won't last.

777
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,305
Their rugby player
is gonna break any second now.

778
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,060
It's almost over, you two.

779
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,230
<i>I just had to stay strong.</i>

780
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,195
Bro, your right. I need help.

781
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,279
Your right.

782
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,365
Your right.

783
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,075
Any second now, okay?

784
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,912
- You can do it!
- Just a little bit more!

785
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,832
Eun-sil, my left hand's slipping.

786
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,000
- Your left?
- Yeah.

787
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,794
Okay, I've got it.
Switch back to a hook grip. That's it.

788
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,005
Hook grip. Come on, hook grip.

789
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,300
Okay, now hold it steady while I fix mine.

790
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,053
- There we go.
- All right, other side.

791
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,804
- Okay, you go first.
- Okay, going.

792
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,097
All right, and holding.

793
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,684
- Got it.
- You got it? Okay, my turn.

794
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,770
- Okay!
- Okay, my turn.

795
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,521
Okay!

796
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,732
Let's go!

797
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,442
Let's go!

798
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,819
Oh, oh, oh!

799
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,946
Team Philippines is close!

800
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,372
- Bro.
- Hold it!

801
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,166
Hold it!

802
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,128
Their right side's nearly shot, guys!

803
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,507
Their grip is slipping, boys.
You've got this.

804
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,181
Yes, Justin. Yes, Ray. Good job.

805
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,849
Yes, Ray, keep it up.

806
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,270
Hold it strong.
You're the world's strongest man.

807
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,646
Let's go!

808
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,107
You are too, Justin. Keep it together!

809
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,776
Now, we'll keep it…
keep it like we are. We're doing good.

810
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,152
I can hold this.

811
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,696
We need these points, boys.

812
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,656
- We need these points.
- We need these points.

813
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,449
We're gonna get these three points, homie.

814
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,370
Don't give up! Go, Eun-sil! Go, Min-jae!

815
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,335
Bro, my hand's about to come off.

816
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,920
My hand's about to come off.
This side! This side!

817
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,213
Bro, my hand's about to come off.

818
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,881
My hand's about to come off.
This side! This side!

819
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,967
My hand's about to come off.
This side! This side!

820
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,474
My hand's about to come off.
This side, this side!

821
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,809
- This side…
- No, don't…

822
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,894
- This side…
- No, don't…

823
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,896
No, don't…

824
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,106
Ah, f***!

825
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,399
Lean forward!

826
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,735
All right!

827
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,986
Yeah! That's it!

828
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,070
- You can win this!
- Let's go.

829
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,363
- Don't give up!
- Let's go, Min-jae!

830
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,743
- You hear me? Don't give up!
- Keep pushing, guys! Come on! Come on!

831
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,411
Let's go!

832
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,458
- Yes!
- Yes, one down!

833
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,335
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Hold! Hold!

834
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,003
I f****** live here!

835
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,716
I couldn't hold on. I slipped.

836
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,302
Not that easy.

837
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,012
Are you okay?

838
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,056
- Yes, uh…
- Yeah, I keep on pulling it.

839
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,140
Couldn't do it.

840
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,269
<i>We didn't really hit our limit.</i>

841
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,937
Yeah, it was quite premature
when it ended.

842
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,900
It's just the jolting caused, um,
loosening of the grip.

843
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,277
But again, in the end,
this is team effort,

844
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,905
so i-it is the two of us

845
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,491
<i>failing this, uh, second round.</i>

846
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,118
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

847
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,666
Number one in Korea
means number one in Asia!

848
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,168
- That's right!
- Let's show them!

849
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,712
- Steel your bodies! Steel your mind!
- Fight on!

850
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,924
We can do it, Min-jae.

851
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,134
I believe in you.

852
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,264
- Come on!
- Yeah.

853
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,432
- Good shit, Rob.
- Let's go, boys.

854
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,725
Good shit, Eloni! Come on!

855
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,102
Let's go, boys.

856
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,146
You want to finish
and be satisfied. Come on!

857
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,944
Australia's wavering.

858
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,487
Let's go!

859
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,989
Don't give up! You can win this!

860
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,924
<i>Till the day the waters</i>
<i>Of the East Sea run dry </i>

861
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,301
<i>And Mount Baekdusan is worn away </i>

862
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:33,472
<i>Till the day the waters</i>
<i>Of the East Sea run dry </i>

863
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,142
<i>And Mount Baekdusan is worn away </i>

864
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,813
<i>God protect and preserve our nation</i>
<i>Hooray to Korea! </i>

865
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,858
<i>Of splendid rivers and mountains </i>

866
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:50,072
<i>Covered with mugunghwa blossoms </i>

867
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,283
<i>They had to be exhausted,</i>

868
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,784
<i>but they just kept holding on.</i>

869
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,286
<i>And then they sang.</i>

870
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,370
<i>I had goose bumps.</i>

871
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,706
<i>You could feel the determination.</i>

872
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,834
<i>These are the moments</i>
<i>where Korea's teamwork shines.</i>

873
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:02,960
Easy!

874
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,170
Please, Eun-sil…

875
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,546
- This is too easy, right?
- Push, push, push…

876
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,299
- Look, Australia's moving!
- Oh! Whittaker's gonna tap out!

877
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,633
Give us a second.

878
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,260
Give us a second.

879
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,598
- Push through…
- You've come this far…

880
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,683
- …push through.
- …you can hold on a little bit more.

881
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,561
Don't regret…
No regrets, guys, no regrets!

882
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,356
Whittaker's struggling!
Don't give up! He's gonna break!

883
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,775
- Man, I'm so proud of 'em!
- I know, right?

884
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,277
Stay focused, you guys!

885
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,361
A little longer!

886
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,530
- You gonna readjust?
- Can I readjust?

887
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,949
You okay? You okay?

888
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,953
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good. You?

889
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,247
- Just my left hand.
- Yep. You good?

890
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,916
- Good.
- Yeah, we're good.

891
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,630
Yeah, you're killing it.
Keep it up, keep it up.

892
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,423
Come on, boys, you're strong!

893
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,925
That's not painful, boys.

894
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,718
Let's show them this, come on!

895
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,053
That is not painful.

896
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,180
Min-jae, my hand!

897
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,724
- It's my left arm. Just a sec…
- We are winning!

898
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,017
She's losing her grip.

899
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,061
- She's losing her grip.
- Show them we're the strongest here!

900
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,521
Come on!

901
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,272
Min-jae, my hand!

902
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,566
- It's my left arm.
- Hold on.

903
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,734
Give it a tug.

904
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,154
A little more, little more…

905
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,782
Smart, the readjusting, how they readjust.

906
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,575
- And how they're shifting their hips.
- Mmm.

907
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,660
- Wow.
- They're insane!

908
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,203
- I know! Just look at 'em go!
- Crazy.

909
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,330
- They might just win. Let's go, guys!
- I know!

910
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,040
- I can't believe it…
- Let's go!

911
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,044
One more pull? Got it.

912
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,838
- Oh, no!
- No!

913
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,092
<i>Even if it meant ripping</i>
<i>the skin of my palms apart,</i>

914
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,302
<i>I refused to let go of the ring.</i>

915
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:36,845
Hold!

916
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,305
That's right, guys! Don't let go!

917
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,474
- Stay!
- Good job!

918
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,226
- Stay strong!
- Your strategy's working, guys!

919
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,812
You've come this far! Don't give up now!

920
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,439
- Come on, you can win this! So win this!
- That's right.

921
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,567
- Come on! First place, guys!
- First place!

922
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,943
Don't give up!

923
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,904
Come on, Whittaker!

924
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,447
Come on, Australia!

925
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,743
<i>Fifteen minutes.</i>

926
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,121
Let's go, Korea!

927
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,416
Let's go, Korea!

928
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,668
Such a massive PB.

929
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,086
Amazing.

930
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,921
You've got this, boys.

931
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,423
- Good job, Rob.
- Let's go!

932
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,760
Come on, just a bit more.

933
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,224
- Can I readjust?
- Yeah, okay.

934
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,351
Hold it.

935
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,936
- They're almost out!
- Whittaker's flagging!

936
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,688
- He's exhausted.
- He's almost done!

937
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,943
- You good?
- Yep, yeah, I'm back.

938
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,530
- Good adjustment.
- Great stuff, great stuff.

939
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,907
It's gonna be close! It's really close!

940
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,619
You're killing it, boys.
Keep it up, come on!

941
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,292
Just a few more minutes!

942
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,376
Eun-sil, my left…

943
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,253
- My left hand's slipping! I can't…
- No, no, no, wait, wait!

944
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:59,094
- My left hand's slipping! I can't… Can't…
- No, no, no, wait, wait!

945
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,525
Ah, shit.

946
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,073
It's okay, guys.
We got second, we're good.

947
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,742
All right team! That's how you do it!

948
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:25,537
- There we go!
- Yes! Yes!

949
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,126
- Let's go!
- You won, boys. You won!

950
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,087
We'll stay here all day. All day!

951
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,421
F****** oath, hundred percent!

952
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,964
I live here, brother.

953
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,758
I live here, brother!

954
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,178
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

955
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,930
I lost my grip too.

956
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,312
<i>Game over.</i>

957
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,025
Min-jae. That was great.

958
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,444
Hey, Min-jae? That was amazing.

959
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,697
- I'm sorry.
- Don't you dare. You did great.

960
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,949
You hear me?

961
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,414
<i>In Korea, I've earned</i>
<i>the Strongest Man Under Heaven title,</i>

962
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,041
but that's not how I felt at all
coming in second today.

963
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,001
I was disappointed in myself.

964
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,212
<i>Because of our</i>
<i>height and weight differences,</i>

965
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,089
<i>we came into this game unbalanced.</i>

966
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,590
<i>But despite that obvious challenge,</i>

967
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,218
<i>Min-jae was great.</i>
<i>He would adjust to help me,</i>

968
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,720
<i>and I'd adjust to help him.</i>

969
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,013
<i>So even though we got second,</i>

970
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,266
that's a win in my book.

971
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:31,103
Because we were able to outlast the
Philippines, we recovered a few points.

972
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,605
- Three, two, one, let's celebrate!
- Let's go.

973
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,942
- Three, two, one, let's celebrate!
- Let's go.

974
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,531
Beast!

975
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,494
That really knocked 'em out.

976
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,291
<i>First place, Australia.</i>

977
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,502
<i>Team Australia has now scored</i>
<i>three additional points.</i>

978
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:11,477
We need the win,
and we need Australia to come second.

979
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,687
Yeah I know, I thought about that too.

980
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,274
The 'effing story…
the story is going crazy.

981
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,569
<i>Australia won the second</i>
<i>and the first event.</i>

982
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,113
<i>Korea won, uh, came second.</i>

983
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,992
It still gave us an opportunity
to still strike.

984
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,828
<i>Korea was still within striking distance,</i>

985
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,623
<i>particularly if we went well</i>
<i>in the third event.</i>

986
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,251
<i>After each game,</i>
<i>I'd review all the hypotheticals.</i>

987
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,712
<i>After game 2, Australia has six points.</i>

988
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,507
<i>Even if they place third next game,</i>
<i>they'll still have the lead.</i>

989
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,177
Right now, our team has four points,
and the Philippines has two.

990
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,597
The only scenario
that I wanted us to avoid,

991
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,517
was the Philippines getting first,
and us getting third.

992
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,561
Even if we get third, as long as
Team Philippines doesn't get first,

993
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,231
<i>it's more than likely that we'll advance.</i>

994
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,483
<i>Contestants, the third game</i>

995
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,361
<i>of the Team Representative Match</i>
<i>will begin shortly.</i>

996
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,156
Okay! Whoa, whoa!

997
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,200
Whoa!

998
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,003
- Oh.
- Oh, rings? Sick.

999
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,171
Rings?

1000
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,298
Rings?

1001
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,133
- Are those rings?
- Looks like it.

1002
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,052
- Ring!
- What are they for?

1003
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,345
Why are there rings?

1004
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,265
Different heights of the hooks.

1005
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,142
I know, right? So, like,
what's the point of the tall one?

1006
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,769
Why are they different lengths?

1007
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,729
Hands up there, and feet down low.

1008
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,022
So, one hand, one foot?

1009
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,066
Or maybe two and two?

1010
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,569
Physical: Asia.

1011
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,864
<i>Team Representative Match, Game 3:</i>

1012
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,574
<i>Hanging Endurance.</i>

1013
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,368
They each had four rings,

1014
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,120
<i>and then they were on long straps</i>

1015
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,873
<i>and we could only assume</i>
<i>cause two were higher two were lower</i>

1016
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,001
<i>that two would be for your feet,</i>
<i>and two would be for your hands.</i>

1017
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:02,087
<i>This is different to kind of</i>
<i>what people expected, I think.</i>

1018
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,173
<i>Let me explain the game in more detail.</i>

1019
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,593
<i>Hanging Endurance</i>

1020
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:11,221
<i>is a game in which players</i>
<i>suspend themselves via hanging ropes.</i>

1021
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,182
<i>To do so, they will hold</i>
<i>two of the rings with their hands,</i>

1022
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,603
<i>while using the other two rings</i>
<i>as supportive footholds.</i>

1023
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,939
<i>However, holding one ring with two hands,</i>

1024
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,568
<i>or hooking one ring around both feet,</i>
<i>is not allowed.</i>

1025
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,986
Oh, so it's hands and feet.

1026
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,322
Hands and feet.

1027
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,241
So we're testing core strength,
and balance.

1028
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,661
<i>After a certain amount of time has passed,</i>

1029
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,997
<i>players must release one of their hands.</i>

1030
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:41,835
<i>After some more time has passed, they</i>
<i>will be asked to change their positions.</i>

1031
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,339
<i>For this game</i>
<i>of the Team Representative Match,</i>

1032
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,050
<i>the following players have been chosen.</i>

1033
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,385
<i>Team Australia: Alexandra.</i>

1034
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,470
ALEXANDRA
FITNESS COACH

1035
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,096
- Let's go, Alex.
- Yes, Alex!

1036
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,307
- That's our girl!
- Let's go!

1037
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,684
<i>I thought that Alex</i>

1038
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,852
<i>might do better</i>

1039
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,270
because of her body weight.

1040
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,648
She was the lightest
out of the three athletes.

1041
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,401
<i>It would just come down to</i>
<i>how strong she was mentally.</i>

1042
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,696
<i>Team Korea: Choi Seung-yeon.</i>

1043
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,240
- All right, Seung-yeon!
- You're number one!

1044
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,034
Number one in Asia!

1045
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,079
<i>Seung-yeon has</i>
<i>the best mental fortitude of any athlete.</i>

1046
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:20,832
<i>So, in my mind,</i>
<i>there was no way she could possibly lose.</i>

1047
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,751
<i>And Team Philippines: Mark Mugen.</i>

1048
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,127
MARK MUGEN
NATIONAL TEAM SAMBO ATHLETE

1049
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,587
- Let's go, Mark.
- Let's go, Mark!

1050
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,839
- Let's go, bro. Come on.
- You've got this!

1051
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:31,635
<i>Mark had extremely good core strength</i>

1052
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,345
<i>coming from a grappling background.</i>

1053
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,098
Despite the disadvantage in weight,

1054
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:41,061
<i>this could be overcome with his skills</i>
<i>in… in maintaining core strength.</i>

1055
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,647
<i>Stand by.</i>

1056
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:49,027
<i>I knew for this next challenge</i>
<i>that I needed to win.</i>

1057
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,822
<i>I have to perform,</i>
<i>or else we're gonna get eliminated</i>

1058
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,408
<i>and we won't even go</i>
<i>to the next challenge, so…</i>

1059
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,909
<i>I'm gonna win this challenge,</i>

1060
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,787
<i>and if I have to stay there forever,</i>
<i>I'll do it.</i>

1061
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:03,125
<i>When you get down to it,</i>
<i>it's just a battle of endurance.</i>

1062
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,836
<i>Whoever can hold out the longest will win.</i>

1063
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,297
<i>It's all psychological</i>
<i>and, luckily, I've got a strong mentality,</i>

1064
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,882
<i>so I'm ready.</i>

1065
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,926
<i>I plan on being the last one standing.</i>

1066
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:17,389
<i>I want to be</i>
<i>a key essential player in our team,</i>

1067
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,683
<i>and I'm honestly not up there.</i>

1068
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:24,813
<i>I want to ensure</i>
<i>that I'm a essential part of our team,</i>

1069
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:29,985
<i>so I'm going to die on these rings</i>
<i>before I give up.</i>

1070
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,987
That's it, bring your feet in.

1071
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,155
Nice, Mark.

1072
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,239
<i>Ready.</i>

1073
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,699
Don't forget to breathe.

1074
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,286
- Let's go, Alex!
- Oh, okay, Mark!

1075
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:40,912
Let's go, Alex!

1076
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,080
That's a great tech.

1077
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,166
Great pose, great pose.

1078
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,667
Let's go, Seung-yeon!

1079
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,752
Looking good!

1080
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,295
Find a sweet spot.

1081
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,130
Nice one, brother. Find that sweet spot.

1082
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,758
Just settle in, Alex. You're doing great!

1083
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,594
It's okay if you need to adjust.
Get comfy.

1084
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,846
<i>When I first grabbed the rings I thought,</i>

1085
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,515
<i>"Shit, this is harder than…</i>
<i>than it, than it looks."</i>

1086
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,059
<i>Cause this is full body,</i>

1087
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,562
<i>and this is so weird with the balance,</i>
<i>with my feet.</i>

1088
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,399
<i>I've never done anything like this.</i>
<i>It's completely unfamiliar.</i>

1089
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,360
<i>It was nerve-wracking. You don't realize</i>

1090
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,405
<i>how much strain it puts on your body</i>
<i>until you have to find your balance.</i>

1091
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,866
Great tech.

1092
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,619
- Great tech.
- Great technique with your feet.

1093
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,914
Brilliant stuff, Alex.
You already look more stable than anyone.

1094
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,749
Great technique, Alex.

1095
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,209
- Really good, Alex.
- Beautiful.

1096
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,960
<i>I looked and I saw her strategy,</i>

1097
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,712
<i>and I copied her strategy.</i>

1098
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:34,257
<i>And then once I locked my legs down,</i>
<i>I felt comfortable,</i>

1099
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:38,136
<i>and I was able to stabilize</i>
<i>and then find my comfortable position.</i>

1100
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,098
- The other two crossed their feet!
- You're doing great!

1101
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,349
Copy their form if you can!

1102
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,142
Try crossing your feet! See if it helps.

1103
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,019
There's no penalty for copying,

1104
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,395
so keep watching them.

1105
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,688
Nice!

1106
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,982
<i>Crossing my feet was a game-changer.</i>

1107
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,235
<i>It was easier on my body,</i>
<i>which made me less anxious.</i>

1108
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,530
All right, good. Now you're all the same.

1109
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,781
Just settle in, Alex!

1110
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,116
You're doing great! Beautiful!

1111
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,368
Just do whatever feels comfortable, okay?

1112
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,120
Stay still, Mark, stay still.

1113
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,080
Mark, you're chillin'.

1114
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,124
Listen to your body and adjust as you go.

1115
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,834
You're doing great up there!

1116
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,836
That's it. Find your happy place, Alex.

1117
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,255
That's it, settle in. Zen in, zen in.

1118
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,048
Fantastic work, Alex.

1119
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,135
<i>Five minutes.</i>

1120
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,137
Great stuff, Alex. Great stuff.

1121
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,638
What was that? Ten minutes?

1122
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,682
- Five.
- Five?

1123
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,100
That was five.

1124
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,852
That's funny.

1125
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,187
That five minutes felt like 50.

1126
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,481
- It's my adductors.
- Abs?

1127
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,941
No, my adductors burn.

1128
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,734
Adductors? Oh, okay. She's a little sore.

1129
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,653
- Like right here? Okay, okay.
- Yeah.

1130
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,781
<i>On occasion,</i>
<i>I've tried similar exercises at the gym.</i>

1131
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,742
The ones where I move my feet
while holding my body up.

1132
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,328
<i>The bulk of the exercise</i>
<i>comes from trying to keep your feet</i>

1133
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,081
<i>from splitting apart,</i>
<i>so it really strains your adductors.</i>

1134
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,292
<i>It's a really difficult exercise.</i>

1135
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,849
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

1136
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,521
Oh, man. This is hard to watch.

1137
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,275
Who came up with this game?

1138
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,693
They look like they're dying.

1139
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,072
I think these types of
"breaking point" challenges are cruel.

1140
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,160
<i>Twenty minutes.</i>

1141
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,331
Oh, yeah!

1142
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,124
Okay! Let's go!

1143
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,209
Yeah, Seung-yeon!

1144
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,960
- Fight on!
- Fight on!

1145
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,504
Whoa!

1146
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,840
Look! The red girl is shaking a lot.

1147
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,596
- Australia's unsteady.
- Oh! She's struggling!

1148
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,223
Australia's unsteady.

1149
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,225
Oh! She's struggling! She might drop.

1150
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,685
Okay, I don't know
if she can re-cross her feet.

1151
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:51,978
I think her thighs are shot.

1152
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,980
She keeps trying to cross them,

1153
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,565
but she's having trouble
locking her foot in place.

1154
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,359
She keeps slipping.

1155
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,486
<i>I'm the most one moving</i>

1156
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:04,241
<i>cause your legs just are cramping up,</i>
<i>your feet are dying.</i>

1157
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,951
<i>So every time I was readjusting,</i>

1158
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,869
<i>it was actually nice to get</i>
<i>some movement in.</i>

1159
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,039
Fantastic work, Alex. That's our girl!

1160
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,165
Yes, Alex!

1161
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:16,253
<i>I'm looking over at</i>
<i>the Philippines and Korean team,</i>

1162
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,381
<i>they're literally like statues.</i>

1163
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:22,384
<i>They're not even moving.</i>
<i>It's not even fazing them at all,</i>

1164
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,468
<i>and I'm like,</i>

1165
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,095
"What the heck?"

1166
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,181
I look over and I'm getting so angry.

1167
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,642
<i>I was like, in so much pain.</i>

1168
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,477
<i>I'm gonna be up here forever.</i>

1169
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,480
<i>They're gonna be up here for hours.</i>

1170
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,608
If Australia gets third…

1171
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,776
It's good for us.

1172
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:40,944
It works in our favor.

1173
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,821
- She's gonna fall soon.
- We need it.

1174
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,448
Mark looks like he's falling asleep.

1175
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,411
Philippines' guy looks comfy as shit.

1176
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,037
Bro, he ain't moving.

1177
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,748
Too easy, bro. Just relax.

1178
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,042
He's the statue of David right now.

1179
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,086
You're the only one not moving.

1180
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,462
- You're like a rock.
- Keep it steady, Mark.

1181
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,630
Keep it steady.

1182
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,175
<i>The guy from Team Philippines</i>
<i>had gotten comfy up there,</i>

1183
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,427
<i>almost too comfy.</i>

1184
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,263
I had to accept that Team Philippines
had a good chance

1185
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,681
<i>of actually winning this.</i>

1186
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,434
<i>And that meant we had to beat Australia.</i>

1187
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,311
It'll be harder when you're down a hand.

1188
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,354
So just mentally prepare yourself
for that.

1189
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,439
You're doing great!

1190
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,815
Just outlast one!

1191
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,568
Just relax! You've got the right position,

1192
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,486
- all you gotta do is hold it.
- You're more stable than the other two.

1193
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,821
That's our Number One!

1194
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,990
<i>My teammates were trying to encourage me</i>

1195
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,534
<i>by saying I looked more secure</i>
<i>than anyone else.</i>

1196
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,370
But on the inside, everything was burning.

1197
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,581
<i>From twenty-minutes onward,</i>

1198
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,250
<i>every inch of my body</i>
<i>was screaming in pain.</i>

1199
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,128
<i>And since it looked like Team Philippines</i>
<i>could hold on forever,</i>

1200
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:43,423
<i>I narrowed my focus.</i>
<i>I just had to beat Team Australia.</i>

1201
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,177
<i>Twenty-nine minutes.</i>

1202
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,720
Twenty-nine minutes!

1203
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:52,432
<i>In one minute, all contestants</i>
<i>must release one of their hands.</i>

1204
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,351
Be aware which one you want to let go.

1205
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,435
Pick an arm.

1206
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,812
Start working out what arm
you're gonna let… use.

1207
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,773
Start working out what arm
are you gonna use?

1208
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,233
Australia's in trouble
once you're down to one hand.

1209
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,362
Start feeling it out.
Decide which one's easier to let go of.

1210
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,947
Think about what you're
going to move. Which arm,

1211
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,657
and how you're gonna stabilize it.

1212
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,202
Choose whichever side has better balance.

1213
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,371
Everyone's legs are starting to go.

1214
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,082
- Hang in there!
- Let's go!

1215
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,417
Coming up on that half-hour mark.

1216
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,128
Get ready bro, it's gonna be
30 minutes soon. You got it, bro.

1217
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,214
Don't over think it. You know what to do.

1218
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,674
Just try to think about something else!

1219
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,677
<i>One hand off.</i>

1220
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,138
<i>One hand off.</i>

1221
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,681
Let go. Let go.

1222
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,558
There you go! That's it!

1223
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,102
Beautiful.

1224
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,437
You're the best, Alex.

1225
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,855
One hand off.

1226
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,735
Oh! Oh!

1227
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,986
Balance, balance!

1228
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,238
Philippines might fall!

1229
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,864
He's going! He's off-balance!

1230
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,242
I think he might be a goner.

1231
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,369
- Oh, watch out!
- C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

1232
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,079
Stay focused, Eun-sil! Don't worry!

1233
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,956
Mark is in a f***** position.

1234
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,794
<i>Just fall, please? Come on…</i>

1235
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,296
Oh, that's a hard position.

1236
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,799
Oh, he's gonna get fouled.

1237
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:12,470
You've got it, Mark! Nice recovery, Mark!

1238
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,806
- Nice, bro, yeah!
- Nice!

1239
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,266
Nice one, Mark.

1240
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,517
Well done, Mark. That was awesome.

1241
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,601
Beautiful.

1242
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,396
I…

1243
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,275
My feet were so painful.

1244
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,529
<i>Everything was going numb and my legs</i>
<i>and my feet were in so much pain.</i>

1245
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:33,324
<i>I was trying to keep a poker face</i>
<i>and pretend that it wasn't painful for me,</i>

1246
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,326
but I was… I was in a lot of pain.

1247
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,329
<i>I was just trying to do poker face</i>

1248
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,165
<i>because I also had to win for my team.</i>

1249
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,041
<i>Of course. They're counting on me.</i>

1250
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,377
Okay, Team Philippines
is scrambling a bit.

1251
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,254
- But you're good!
- You're doing great!

1252
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,089
Just push through it, Seung-yeon!

1253
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,550
Stay zen, stay on.

1254
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,386
Just breathe, breathe.

1255
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,013
You're doing amazing.

1256
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,848
<i>It was a rough transition,</i>

1257
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,766
<i>but all three of them figured it out.</i>

1258
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,810
<i>They all looked unfazed up there,</i>

1259
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,229
<i>like they were content to dangle forever.</i>

1260
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,108
I can't imagine how tired they are.

1261
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,321
They're gonna be so sore after this.

1262
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,450
<i>How slowly the time was going by.</i>

1263
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:19,162
<i>It really felt like some kind of</i>
<i>medieval torture.</i>

1264
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:23,500
<i>Or like some Shaolin-monk training</i>
<i>in the mountains.</i>

1265
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,503
<i>It was a battle of the mind</i>
<i>and just pain endurance.</i>

1266
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,590
<i>Sixty minutes</i>.

1267
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,134
That's one hour.

1268
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,261
Way to go! One whole hour!

1269
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,804
Fighting, Choi!

1270
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,599
Oh, you guys are amazing.
All three of you, killing it.

1271
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,767
Right.

1272
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,228
- Yeah.
- Unbelievable amount of time.

1273
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,313
Nice job, Choi Seung-yeon! Let's…

1274
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,440
Oh, wait! I think she's gonna fall!

1275
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,944
Oh, wait! I think she's gonna fall!
She's falling!

1276
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,403
- Come on!
- Hang on, Seung-yeon!

1277
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,906
Red's flailing! Keep holding on!

1278
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,203
F*** me.

1279
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:03,206
Whoa, whoa! Her legs split!

1280
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,666
I think this is the end.

1281
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,209
- She's trying to adjust.
- She's moving too much.

1282
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,293
Let's go!

1283
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,587
Yes, here we go, you've got this.
Keep fighting.

1284
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,673
Okay, okay. She's a goner.

1285
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,799
She's a goner!

1286
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,008
Let's go!

1287
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,468
Let's go, Seung-yeon!

1288
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,097
It's all right. It's all right.

1289
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,557
- Take your time.
- Readjust, readjust.

1290
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,475
This is it! She's going! She's going!

1291
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,060
Just fall.

1292
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,395
Yeah, good.

1293
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,525
Wow. No way…

1294
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,026
- Yes!
- There you go.

1295
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,444
That's our girl, come on!

1296
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,529
Lock 'em back in.

1297
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,739
Man, I really thought she was gonna fall.

1298
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,199
Come on, please fall.

1299
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,826
Safe!

1300
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,328
- Chi-Chiller!
- Outstanding!

1301
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,916
<i>That girl was unbelievable.</i>

1302
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,919
After so many close-calls,
I couldn't believe she was still up.

1303
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,588
<i>I'd been too optimistic,</i>

1304
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,591
<i>which made me all the more anxious</i>
<i>as I kept watching.</i>

1305
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,717
Please, please.

1306
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,510
Seung-yeon, please. Push.

1307
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,053
We need you to get second.

1308
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:01,514
I know it's hard, but we need this.

1309
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,724
You can do it!

1310
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,892
<i>I needed to distract myself,</i>

1311
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,686
<i>so I just fixated on Australia.</i>

1312
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,480
<i>And just kept waiting for her to fall.</i>

1313
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,485
<i>This game is absolute hell.</i>

1314
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,821
It started feeling like hell
from 20 minutes,

1315
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,616
so I'm literally taking it
second by second.

1316
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,867
F***.

1317
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,206
<i>And I don't know how much more</i>
<i>I can do of it.</i>

1318
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,878
Even watching this
feels like some kind of torture.

1319
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,882
One mistake.

1320
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,970
One mistake.

1321
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,102
<i>140 minutes.</i>

1322
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,605
Wow!

1323
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,649
- Wow, good job, everyone.
- Yeah!

1324
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,819
- They're all insane!
- Great job!

1325
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,113
I can't watch this anymore.

1326
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,990
Go, Seung-yeon!

1327
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,034
<i>At this point in the game,</i>

1328
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,870
- <i>everyone must uncross their feet.</i>
- Whoa!

1329
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:09,123
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>if one foot touches the other,</i>

1330
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,917
<i>you will be eliminated</i>

1331
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,669
- <i>from the game.</i>
- Wow!

1332
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,338
This might end
within the next few minutes.

1333
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:18,174
Or even the next few seconds.
Just keep holding!

1334
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,801
You've got it, Mark!
You've got this, Mark.

1335
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,594
<i>I got nervous.</i>

1336
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,847
<i>I knew that that's when</i>
<i>the real game would start.</i>

1337
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,307
<i>At that point,</i>

1338
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,185
<i>I knew someone would fall.</i>
<i>It just couldn't be me.</i>

1339
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,979
When the legs split, you're on.

1340
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,232
When legs split, that's when you win.

1341
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:37,151
You're used to it,
you know what to expect. They don't!

1342
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:40,238
<i>Because I'd been moving around a bit more,</i>

1343
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:42,115
<i>and I knew how to readjust,</i>

1344
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:46,077
<i>where I was like, I…</i>
<i>This is where the tables turn.</i>

1345
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,162
Slow, slow.

1346
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:51,082
<i>Contestants, please unlock your feet.</i>

1347
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,543
And hold it there.

1348
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:56,254
- That's it. Stay. Strong. Strong!
- Yeah, nice.

1349
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,422
You gotta unlock.

1350
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:00,258
Unlock. Nice, nice!

1351
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,843
Fight on, Seung-yeon!

1352
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,679
- Keep focused!
- That's it, your form looks great!

1353
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,764
It's all about concentration now!

1354
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,224
Stay with it, okay?

1355
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,186
Yes, Alex,
fight tooth and nail, right here!

1356
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,938
You're doing great so far!

1357
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,482
<i>You had to kind of be in a bicep curl</i>

1358
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,401
<i>and a lunge at the same time</i>

1359
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:21,738
<i>after you'd already been exhausted</i>
<i>for two and a half hours.</i>

1360
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:25,366
<i>The second I unlocked,</i>
<i>everything hit me at once.</i>

1361
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,035
<i>The heaviness from the exhaustion,</i>

1362
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,954
<i>the excruciating pain</i>
<i>that shot up my legs,</i>

1363
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:34,041
<i>it felt like my entire body</i>
<i>was being ripped apart, limb by limb.</i>

1364
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,377
There!

1365
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,462
Wow!

1366
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,255
Nice, Mark. Come on, Mark!

1367
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,549
Wow!

1368
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,342
Lock that in, that's the one.

1369
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,386
Mark, you're incredible!

1370
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,679
<i>It felt okay.</i>

1371
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,140
<i>I knew it would be hard,</i>
<i>but I knew I could do it.</i>

1372
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,975
And also some psychological games.

1373
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:54,520
<i>I wanted to show that I was strong</i>
<i>and that I could go forever.</i>

1374
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,481
Don't give up!

1375
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,441
Australia can't hold on much longer!

1376
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,902
- Red's falling over!
- She's gonna fall!

1377
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,653
It's almost done! Just hang on till then!

1378
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,155
You can beat her! Stay strong!

1379
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:07,033
Last fight! Last fight!

1380
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,327
She's gassing, Alex! Stay strong!

1381
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,995
She's gassing, stay strong! Stay strong!

1382
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,079
She's gassing.

1383
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,664
We've got this. Easy money.

1384
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,876
Come on, Seung-yeon!
You can beat her! Just don't let go!

1385
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,336
Lean your body forward!

1386
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,379
A little more! Come on, come on!

1387
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,173
They're fading! They're fading out!

1388
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,467
They're fading,
they're fading, Alex, come on!

1389
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,228
Keep holding.

1390
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,480
It's not far now. Not long now.

1391
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,276
Do it for Eun-sil. Channel
her strength! Just push through it!

1392
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:06,300
You're almost there, Seung-yeon!
She's gonna fall soon!

1393
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,178
<i>I just couldn't wrap my head around it.</i>

1394
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,013
<i>Why was she fighting so hard?</i>

1395
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,558
<i>Australia was advancing</i>
<i>so what's the point?</i>

1396
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:18,521
I just don't want to let my team down.

1397
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:21,315
I really felt like I let my team down

1398
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,067
after that first challenge.

1399
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:25,903
<i>Cause everyone else was on there,</i>

1400
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:29,156
<i>and I was not on there.</i>

1401
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,785
<i>I just never… I knew</i>
<i>I never wanted to feel that feeling again.</i>

1402
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,413
I know in the first round,

1403
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,081
<i>she felt like she let the team down,</i>

1404
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,833
<i>even though we don't think that,</i>

1405
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,961
<i>and she was there to prove her worth.</i>

1406
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,339
<i>She really, really showed up</i>
<i>on this challenge.</i>

1407
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,800
Do whatever you need to do
to get comfortable!

1408
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:51,137
Whoa! Oh, shit! Something's wrong.

1409
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,559
Her legs are shaking, Alex!

1410
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,936
Korea's struggling, Alex.
Stay in it, Alex.

1411
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,230
I think her foot slipped.

1412
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,442
She's really struggling, Alex!

1413
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,278
She's almost done, Alex. You've got this.

1414
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,654
You have this.

1415
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:12,074
Seung-yeon, don't move! Don't give up now!

1416
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,451
No, no, she's struggling.

1417
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:14,952
She's about to go, Alex!

1418
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,246
- She's about to go! I can see her face!
- She's about to go!

1419
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,248
- Stay on, Alex, stay on, Alex!
- Stay on!

1420
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,292
- Stay in there, Alex!
- Come on, Alex!

1421
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,377
Come on, Alex.

1422
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,212
Hang in there, okay?

1423
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,923
She looks like she's passed out, right?

1424
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,382
It's so close, Seung-yeon.

1425
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,634
You're so close!

1426
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,761
Seung-yeon! Fight on!

1427
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,471
Fight on!

1428
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,890
Just a little longer, I promise.

1429
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,476
Oh, she's done, Alex, she's done!

1430
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,812
Fight, Alex, fight!

1431
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,119
You can do it!

1432
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,582
You can do it!

1433
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:09,298
She's done! Yeah!

1434
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,470
Amazing, Seung-yeon!

1435
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,555
Well done, Choi. Well done, Choi.

1436
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,849
That was incredible!
Well done, Seung-yeon!

1437
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,144
Oh, my God.

1438
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,689
Oh, my God.

1439
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,524
- Nice.
- Well done, Mark!

1440
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:29,777
Well done, Mark!

1441
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,738
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

1442
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,199
Yes, Alex!

1443
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,538
Nice, nice.

1444
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:42,999
Yes!

1445
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,002
Oh, my God.

1446
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,421
<i>I felt amazing</i>
<i>when they all came running towards me</i>

1447
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,006
<i>and we were all celebrating.</i>

1448
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,590
<i>It was… It was awesome.</i>

1449
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,802
And I knew that, you know, we did it.

1450
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:59,473
And now the score is tied. Five points
for Philippines, five points for Korea,

1451
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,226
so now it's, uh, it's game time.

1452
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,938
I'm so f****** proud of you.

1453
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,524
Oh, my God!

1454
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,151
- Outstanding.
- Look at you being amazing!

1455
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,819
You're an animal, you're an animal!

1456
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,529
- You're an animal!
- Look at you being amazing!

1457
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:16,032
- Oh, my God. You did so well.
- You're an animal!

1458
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:17,992
So well!

1459
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,244
So well.

1460
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:22,163
Are you okay? You did great.

1461
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:23,956
- I'm so sorry.
- What are you talking about?

1462
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,041
Don't you dare apologize.

1463
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:27,001
You worked hard and did your best.
You should be proud.

1464
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,919
- That was two hours!
- I'm so sorry, guys. Really.

1465
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,422
- Don't say that. You lasted two hours.
- You were so amazing out there.

1466
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:32,798
- I couldn't have done that.
- Same, same,

1467
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,717
you did great.

1468
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,094
<i>Losing an individual event is one thing,</i>

1469
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,554
<i>but as a team…</i>

1470
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,856
I think, right now,

1471
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:52,651
um… I'm just feeling
a tremendous amount of guilt.

1472
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,570
Yeah. And, um…

1473
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,240
<i>I was trying to fix my footing in the end,</i>

1474
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,326
<i>but my legs collapsed from under me.</i>

1475
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,870
I don't know what to say.

1476
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:04,622
I'm just really sorry.

1477
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:07,666
All I can do now…

1478
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,545
is cheer for Amotti.

1479
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,298
And then, in the next round,

1480
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:16,592
I can maybe make it up to everyone.

1481
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:22,348
<i>I don't think I expected</i>
<i>that kind of reaction from Seung-yeon.</i>

1482
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,433
<i>It was already hard to see her cry,</i>

1483
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,102
but she kept apologizing.

1484
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,396
It just broke my heart.

1485
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,192
I know Seung-yeon gave the challenge
her all today.

1486
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:37,154
Even when her legs were buckling,
she was trying her best to hold on.

1487
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:40,991
She shouldn't have any regrets about
what she did. We're all proud of her.

1488
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,701
She really was incredible.

1489
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:43,994
I hope she knows that.

1490
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,253
1ST: 8 POINTS
TIED FOR 2ND: 5 POINTS

1491
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:56,173
<i>These are the current team standings.</i>

1492
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,467
- <i>In first place, Team Australia…</i>
- Yeah, boy!

1493
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,718
<i>…eight points.</i>

1494
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,137
TEAM AUSTRALIA SECURES SURVIVAL

1495
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,263
<i>And tied for second,</i>

1496
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,267
<i>Team Korea and Team Philippines,</i>
<i>five points.</i>

1497
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,434
Neck and neck.

1498
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:11,063
All comes down to this.

1499
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,149
Death match!

1500
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,568
<i>That's the only chance that we have.</i>

1501
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,529
<i>With that victory</i>
<i>in challenge number three,</i>

1502
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:21,115
<i>we were confident</i>
<i>going into challenge number four.</i>

1503
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,701
Of course, we… we can't afford to lose.

1504
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,327
We didn't come this far to lose.

1505
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,205
<i>And we're ready to show</i>
<i>everyone else what we're made of.</i>

1506
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,458
<i>I was trying to stay level headed,</i>

1507
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,960
<i>but I was getting anxious.</i>

1508
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:35,546
It almost felt like I was being haunted by

1509
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,548
the nightmares of last season.

1510
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,425
<i>I knew I was being paranoid,</i>

1511
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,510
<i>but it felt like I was cursed.</i>

1512
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,263
I believe in Amotti.

1513
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,390
I think anyone who saw last season

1514
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:49,268
knows that he's someone
you can put all of your trust in.

1515
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:52,438
<i>I was ready to see</i>
<i>Amotti beat Team Philippines.</i>

1516
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:55,399
<i>Team Representative Match: Game 4.</i>

1517
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:59,862
<i>Those selected for the Sack Toss,</i>
<i>please enter the arena.</i>

1518
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:01,864
<i>The game will begin momentarily.</i>

1519
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,824
All right, let's bring it in, okay?

1520
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,035
It's possible that this'll be
our last match,

1521
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:08,287
so let's give it our all, no regrets.

1522
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,538
You guys ready?

1523
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,082
- Korea!
- Fight on!

1524
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,084
- You've got this!
- Let's go!

1525
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,086
- Cattle!
- Dog!

1526
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,922
Yes, let's go, Eddie!

1527
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,049
Come on, Eddie. This is your time!

1528
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:22,509
- Let's fight!
- Philippines!

1529
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,720
Let's go! Come on!

1530
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,972
- Let's go!
- Get it!

1531
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,057
Easy.

1532
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:35,022
<i>The future</i>
<i>of Team Philippines is on the line here.</i>

1533
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:37,358
<i>The fate of our team lies with me today.</i>

1534
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,360
<i>So I have to win.</i>

1535
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:41,987
<i>I really have to give it</i>
<i>my best, my everything.</i>

1536
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:51,247
<i>Now then,</i>
<i>let me explain the game in more detail.</i>

1537
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:59,380
<i>Sack Toss is a game</i>
<i>where the players pass a sack around</i>

1538
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:02,633
<i>by tossing it over a hurdle</i>
<i>and onto their opponent's side.</i>

1539
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:07,972
<i>Each pass must occur</i>
<i>within thirty seconds.</i>

1540
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,640
<i>In any instance</i>

1541
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:13,102
<i>where a player is unable to</i>
<i>pass the ball in the given time limit,</i>

1542
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,480
<i>that player, regardless of</i>
<i>the next player's outcome,</i>

1543
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:19,108
<i>will be eliminated from the game.</i>

1544
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,820
Another endurance battle.

1545
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:24,446
And a timed game too.

1546
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,032
<i>If the game continues with no losses,</i>

1547
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,618
<i>the weight of the sacks</i>
<i>will start to increase.</i>

1548
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,496
- Oh, nice, nice.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1549
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:33,956
Eddie, prove to them

1550
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,708
that you're strong and fit.

1551
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,418
You've got this.

1552
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,836
I want it heavier.

1553
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,880
<i>If the game still continues</i>
<i>with no losses,</i>

1554
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,091
<i>the time limit will start to decrease.</i>

1555
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:45,259
Cool.

1556
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,678
So it's strength and endurance, also.

1557
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:48,762
Yes.

1558
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,348
He's good with endurance
because he does triathlon.

1559
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:55,144
He was the fittest, uh, CrossFitter
in the Philippines.

1560
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,730
JUSTIN HERNANDEZ
CROSSFIT ATHLETE

1561
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:02,401
<i>I am first and only Filipino</i>
<i>CrossFit Games male athlete.</i>

1562
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:05,112
<i>Aside from that,</i>
<i>I used to do bodybuilding,</i>

1563
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:07,573
<i>and I do other sports like triathlons,</i>

1564
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,616
<i>so you can call me a hybrid athlete.</i>

1565
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,828
I was excited to show everyone

1566
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:16,123
why I am the only
Filipino male CrossFit Games athlete.

1567
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:18,125
That guy's ripped, just look at him.

1568
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,669
He's got a pretty solid
physique all-around.

1569
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,087
Look at the size of him,
he's a CrossFitter.

1570
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,630
- Got more mass than Amotti.
- Looks fit too.

1571
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,090
We've got this.

1572
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:28,635
He's the best guy from
the Philippines for this challenge, bro.

1573
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:33,474
<i>Before we begin, you will</i>
<i>randomly select your starting position.</i>

1574
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,768
SACK TOSS ORDER DRAW

1575
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:37,686
One, Eddie?

1576
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,229
What number, Justin?

1577
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:41,482
You're third, right, Amotti?

1578
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:43,776
All right, excellent.

1579
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,402
EDDIE, HERNANDEZ, AMOTTI

1580
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,363
- Nice, Eddie.
- Nice.

1581
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,740
Let's go, Eddie, have some fun, brother!

1582
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:51,241
Have some fun!

1583
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:53,160
Let's go, Justin, brother!

1584
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:54,244
You've got the power.

1585
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,329
Let's go!

1586
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:56,955
Bring it home, okay?

1587
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,791
- Got your position?
- Yep.

1588
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,000
Okay, now practice.

1589
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,252
- Your form looks great!
- All righty, here we go!

1590
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,797
Let's go! Don't be nervous!

1591
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:08,801
<i>Once we know which country</i>
<i>will be eliminated,</i>

1592
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,928
<i>the match will come to an end.</i>

1593
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:14,598
If one of us is in third,
us or the Philippines, the game will end.

1594
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:16,850
Please, please, please…

1595
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:21,355
<i>Now then…</i>
<i>Team Representative Match, Game 4:</i>

1596
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:23,482
<i>Sack Toss.</i>

1597
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,735
<i>The match will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

1598
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,948
- Okay! Let's go, Amotti! Fight on!
- Fight on!

1599
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,908
- Fight on!
- Fight on!

1600
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:34,910
<i>I mean, it's not like it'll kill me,</i>

1601
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:37,204
<i>so who cares if I wreck my body a bit.</i>

1602
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,831
<i>I was going to give it everything.</i>

1603
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:42,376
<i>We're going to show them that…</i>
<i>Not to mess with Australia.</i>

1604
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:45,462
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1605
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:46,880
Let's go!

1606
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,757
- Let's go, Justin!
- Let's go!

1607
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,510
- Come on! Come on, brother!
- This is you!

1608
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,971
<i>I am determined,</i>
<i>I have the fighting spirit,</i>

1609
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:57,516
<i>and then I'm not gonna give up,</i>
<i>no matter what, until I get this win.</i>

1610
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,143
<i>Stand by.</i>

1611
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,148
<i>Ready…</i>

1612
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:09,278
Let's go, Eddie.

1613
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,696
- Come on, baby!
- Come on, Eddie.

1614
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,322
Let's go, Eddie.

1615
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:14,116
- Come on, baby!
- Come on, Eddie.

1616
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:20,080
- Easy money.
- Easy money.

1617
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:22,916
He throws extremely well.

1618
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,752
<i>When I saw the sandbag and I lifted it up,</i>

1619
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:28,088
<i>I got excited 'cause it felt lighter.</i>

1620
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:31,550
<i>I thought it was like,</i>
<i>a five-kilo bag of rice.</i>

1621
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,680
<i>The 14 kilogram sack, it felt right.</i>

1622
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:39,475
<i>It wasn't that heavy,</i>
<i>but it wasn't light either.</i>

1623
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:41,477
Oh, shit.

1624
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:44,897
- Oh, shit.
- Get it, bro. Get it, quick!

1625
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,565
- Come on, bro.
- Closer, Justin.

1626
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,484
<i>That's the challenging part.</i>

1627
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,153
<i>I think it's the height</i>
<i>that you have to throw the sack.</i>

1628
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:53,405
Wait, I think Justin might miss again.

1629
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,032
Come on, please, please, please.

1630
01:14:55,115 --> 01:14:57,868
<i>And when I threw it, I went really hard</i>

1631
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:02,748
<i>and then the ball passed</i>
<i>the hurdle pretty easily.</i>

1632
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,666
- Yeah!
- Nice!

1633
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:05,751
Hips high!

1634
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,586
- Nice!
- Yeah!

1635
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,630
<i>It really felt easy in the beginning.</i>

1636
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,426
<i>It honestly wasn't that hard.</i>

1637
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:16,637
It's all good.

1638
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,057
- Oh, shoot. It's all good.
- It's all good. It's fine, it's fine.

1639
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,100
<i>But as you start to play,</i>

1640
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:25,020
<i>you realize that timing matters</i>
<i>just as much as technique.</i>

1641
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:27,731
- Good throw, Amotti.
- There you go.

1642
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:28,899
- Good throw.
- You've got it down now.

1643
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:30,567
You got this.

1644
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,736
<i>Thankfully, the constant repetition meant</i>

1645
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:34,404
<i>I could improve while I played.</i>

1646
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,448
Let's go, Eddie.

1647
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,575
Clockwork, Eddie, just breathe.

1648
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,538
Perfect rainbow.

1649
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,248
Just use your hips!

1650
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:45,749
High hip, Justin, high hips.

1651
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:46,833
Hips!

1652
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,253
Nice!

1653
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:50,629
Yeah! Get closer!

1654
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,631
- That was a high one! Nice!
- Let's go!

1655
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:54,841
- Let's go. That's our boy.
- Boom!

1656
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:56,593
- Let's go, Justin!
- Yeah!

1657
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:58,887
- Okay, okay.
- Nice job!

1658
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,347
It all comes down to pacing.

1659
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,515
- Pacing?
- Yeah.

1660
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:05,269
- It doesn't matter how heavy the sack is.
- It's all endurance.

1661
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:06,895
It's going to be long.
It's going to be a long game.

1662
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:09,606
Very good.

1663
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:16,154
Wow!

1664
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,698
Ah, too high, Eddie.

1665
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,534
- Wow!
- Ah, too high, Eddie.

1666
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:23,829
- Too high, too high.
- Perfect.

1667
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:27,165
It looks so much, like,
less than 14 kilos when he throws it.

1668
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,376
Wow. It looks weightless.

1669
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,129
Now he has to go run and grab it.

1670
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,757
All that running will wear him down.

1671
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:36,842
It goes so far away.

1672
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,093
Good, good, good, good.

1673
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,887
<i>I'm just unlucky that I'm, like,</i>

1674
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:42,431
<i>in the number two station</i>

1675
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:44,391
<i>which is where Eddie throws his ball.</i>

1676
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:46,685
<i>He always throws the ball so far.</i>

1677
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:47,769
Let's go, Justin!

1678
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,688
Go, Justin. You got this.

1679
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:53,191
<i>So, Eddie, he make…</i>
<i>he made it harder for me.</i>

1680
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:55,319
- Nice!
- Nice, brother.

1681
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:56,403
Nice, Justin.

1682
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,322
Keep the pace, keep the pace.

1683
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:00,324
Great job, Justin. Keep it up.

1684
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:01,742
- That's it!
- Great!

1685
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:02,993
So high, Amotti.

1686
01:17:03,076 --> 01:17:04,494
Nice!

1687
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:07,247
<i>Starting now, you will continue to play</i>

1688
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,915
<i>with a heavier bag.</i>

1689
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,125
- Heavier ball?
- Heavier ball?

1690
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,795
Eddie, you look outstanding.

1691
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:16,048
You look so good.

1692
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,592
Let's go, Eddie, let's go.

1693
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,887
Let's go, Eddie, let's go.

1694
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:22,971
Nice! Nice!

1695
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,390
Let's go, Eddie, let's go.

1696
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,601
They're having fun.

1697
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:29,936
Let's go, Justin, doesn't matter bro.
You've done this before.

1698
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,272
- Same technique. Same technique.
- Yep. Easy.

1699
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,357
<i>Stand by.</i>

1700
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,275
- Okay, I can do this.
- Yeah, you got this.

1701
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,360
<i>Ready…</i>

1702
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,322
Let's go, Eddie!

1703
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,577
- Yeah!
- Wow!

1704
01:17:47,954 --> 01:17:48,955
- Oops.
- Wow!

1705
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,336
- Yeah!
- That's what I wanna see!

1706
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:56,421
- Yes, Eddie!
- Wow.

1707
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,090
<i>It looked so easy for Eddie.</i>

1708
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,050
<i>I was no match for him.</i>

1709
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,137
<i>Eddie was throwing the ball really well,</i>

1710
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:07,808
<i>and he's really just that strong</i>
<i>and he never committed any mistakes.</i>

1711
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:09,726
- Yep!
- <i>So I just realized</i>

1712
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:12,270
<i>that it's gonna be a match</i>
<i>between me and Amotti.</i>

1713
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,112
Get closer!

1714
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,905
Get a feel for the weight first.

1715
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:23,448
- Take your time.
- There you go.

1716
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,329
- Let's go, Amotti. Come on.
- Take your time.

1717
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,498
Come on. That's our chance, man.

1718
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,459
<i>One bad throw, then another,</i>

1719
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:38,380
<i>and all of a sudden, these negative</i>
<i>thoughts just start to flood my brain.</i>

1720
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:40,090
- It's okay, just stay calm.
- Don't let it get to you.

1721
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:41,800
- Fight on!
- You're good.

1722
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:43,343
Eddie, Amotti's gassing.

1723
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:44,761
Like, this is already…

1724
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,638
- This is already at that.
- He's gassing.

1725
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:47,723
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1726
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:50,267
Good, swing twice, and then throw!
