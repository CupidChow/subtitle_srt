1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:11,011
Subtitles are color-coded by country,
and this setting cannot be changed.

2
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,762
Get a feel for the weight first.

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,389
- Take your time.
- There you go.

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,267
- Let's go, Amotti. Come on.
- Take your time.

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,853
That's our chance, man.

6
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,980
Eddie, Amotti's gassing.

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,524
- This is already at that.
- He's gassing.

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,608
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,152
It's okay, just stay calm.

10
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,737
- Fight on!
- You're good.

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,781
Amotti, swing twice and then throw, okay?

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,949
Use your hips, up!

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,993
Breathe, Amotti.

14
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,786
- Up, up!
- Up, up, up!

15
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,548
Yes, you did it!

16
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,843
- Yes, you did it!
- Wow!

17
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,553
- Yes, you did it!
- Hey!

18
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,096
Good work, mate. Good work.

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,057
- Good throw, Amotti.
- Good job, Amotti.

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,767
- You good, man? You good?
- Nice one!

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,226
- Is he ok?
- Yeah, he's good.

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,603
It's okay, I've got this.

23
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,647
<i>All I needed to do was focus.</i>

24
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,232
<i>Focus, focus, focus.</i>

25
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,068
Hey!

26
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,569
Nice one!

27
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,780
This is our chance, brother.
This is our chance.

28
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,492
<i>We felt like we definitely had a good shot</i>

29
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,744
<i>at taking out Korea in this last event.</i>

30
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,371
- You can do it!
- Take your time.

31
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,166
Just focus on your breathing,
and you'll be fine, okay?

32
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,667
Hip thrust!

33
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,336
All right!

34
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,088
Let's go!

35
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,340
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

36
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,259
Let's go, Justo!

37
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,594
Okay, okay! Let's go!

38
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,471
All right! Two swings, okay?

39
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,225
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on, come on!

40
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,851
You were born for this.

41
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,228
Ba-booey!

42
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,479
Baba booey!

43
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,648
Let's go, Justin.

44
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,941
Basic!

45
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,317
- Justin!
- Basic! Basic!

46
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,527
It's all you!

47
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,739
<i>Philippines,</i>
<i>the hope and morale, sky-high.</i>

48
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,949
Extend!

49
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,247
Justin's doing good, mate.
Justin's consistent.

50
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,456
He's doing very good.

51
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,916
- He's good.
- I know…

52
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,000
He's very strong.

53
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,294
- You've got this!
- You all day, Justin.

54
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,880
It felt like we did the right choice.

55
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,715
<i>because I know he can do properly,</i>

56
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,468
<i>and I think at least</i>
<i>he can get the second place.</i>

57
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,970
Go, go, go.

58
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,639
- Okay!
- You're almost there, trust me!

59
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,932
Okay!

60
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,059
You're almost there, trust me!
Stay with it!

61
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,895
Just keep going! Keep going, okay?

62
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,399
You've got this, Justin!
Let's go! Promise!

63
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,322
Let's go! Let's go!

64
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,074
We're almost there. Just hang on!

65
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,826
Let's go!

66
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,995
We're almost there. Just hang on!

67
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,705
He needs to get closer.

68
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,457
It's fine. He'll be okay.

69
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,544
<i>I saw Amotti committing mistakes.</i>

70
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>It got my hopes up.</i>

71
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,174
<i>I tried to throw it faster.</i>

72
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,925
- Hip extension!
- Up!

73
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,221
<i>Amotti won't be able to rest at all.</i>

74
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,600
- Come on!
- Whoo! Let's go!

75
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,268
- Let's go, Justin!
- Come on, Justin!

76
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,023
<i>Team Philippines was</i>
<i>really pumped up and cheering loudly.</i>

77
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,901
- Take your time. You're good.
- <i>They had good team morale,</i>

78
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,695
and for the first time,
our team seemed defeated.

79
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,614
So I tried cheering us up, but…

80
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,948
Okay, good.

81
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,491
Easy, easy.

82
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,370
- Oh, that was too close.
- Step forward a bit.

83
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,538
<i>I was nervous.</i>

84
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,124
<i>I kept missing,</i>
<i>so that made me really anxious.</i>

85
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,084
Don't stress yourself out, okay?

86
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,670
You're so close, Justin! Promise!

87
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,339
- Let's go.
- It's over! It's over!

88
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,840
- It's all over!
- Nice!

89
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,217
Let's go, Justin!

90
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,427
- Let's go.
- It's over! It's over!

91
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,971
- Come on, Amotti, go!
- Last one! Last one! Ten seconds.

92
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,806
Come on, Amotti. Full power!

93
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,351
We've reached the end now! Just hold on!

94
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,936
We've reached the end now!

95
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,355
- We've got time, okay?
- Stay calm!

96
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,400
<i>Please, please.</i>

97
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,569
<i>Come on, Amotti.</i>

98
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,407
- Stay calm!
- Nice!

99
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,368
- Good work, mate.
- Great throw, Amotti.

100
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,494
That's it!

101
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,750
I can't watch this.

102
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,465
- That's it!
- **** me.

103
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,843
Stay calm!

104
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,928
That's it!

105
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,056
<i>I kept messing up</i>
<i>because I couldn't figure out</i>

106
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,724
the placement and timing.

107
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,018
Finding the rhythm was really tricky.

108
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,896
I just kept making the wrong calls.

109
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,360
<i>I think it took me a while</i>
<i>to get the hang of it.</i>

110
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,070
Come on!

111
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,406
He's gassing though.

112
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,491
- Amotti's… Amotti's struggling.
- Yeah!

113
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,118
He's wasting energy.

114
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,663
- Okay!
- Yeah, nicely done, mate.

115
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,290
Nicely done.

116
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,668
Man, we're in big trouble.
Real big trouble.

117
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,213
It's a good day for an upset, team.
It's a good day for an upset.

118
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,133
<i>Starting now, the weight of the bag</i>

119
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,051
- <i>will be increased.</i>
- Heavier? Heavier.

120
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,763
That's crazy.
That already looks heavy as ****.

121
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,433
Right, right. This is the third one.
It's really heavy now.

122
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,269
This'll be a cakewalk, all right?

123
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,396
Just keep doing what you're doing!

124
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,690
<i>I know that</i>
<i>whenever they increase the weight,</i>

125
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,233
<i>it's favorable for me,</i>

126
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,446
<i>because I saw Amotti</i>
<i>committing mistakes with a lighter weight.</i>

127
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,281
So now that it's heavier,

128
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,452
I know that there's more chance
of him committing more mistakes.

129
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,705
<i>So I thought that</i>
<i>this was my chance already.</i>

130
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,000
<i>If this was the best I could do,</i>
<i>all of our effort would go to waste.</i>

131
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,377
<i>I had to push myself harder.</i>

132
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,005
- You gotta get it on the first try, okay?
- Okay.

133
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,298
- You got this!
- I know it's tough.

134
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,591
<i>Stand by.</i>

135
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,053
Let's go, Eddie! Get the rig out. Come on!

136
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,972
- Go, Eddie.
- That's the Australian way, brother!

137
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,224
- Get the rig out!
- <i>Ready…</i>

138
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,476
Okay, guns out.

139
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,353
- Let's go!
- You can do it.

140
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,979
- Give it your all, Amotti!
- Yeah.

141
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,272
You got this, Justin!

142
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,024
Make your countries proud.

143
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,865
Yes, Eddie. Nice.

144
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,367
It's getting higher!

145
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,785
- Yeah, it's going further.
- Facts.

146
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,828
The ball's getting heavier,
and it's going further.

147
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,374
Wow.

148
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,460
<i>He made it look easy,</i>
<i>like it weighed less than a trash bag.</i>

149
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,129
That's definitely heavier. Heavier.

150
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,300
- Go, Justo.
- You got this, Justin!

151
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,551
More power! That's right.

152
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,595
- Breathe.
- Put your back into it!

153
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,355
Ooh.

154
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,361
<i>For my body weight and for my strength,</i>

155
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,239
<i>I found the sack manageable.</i>

156
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,616
Justo, feeling good, bro.
You're a triathlete.

157
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,368
Fight on!

158
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,661
Go, Amotti!

159
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,955
He's gotta focus and get it in one go.

160
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,456
<i>It was even heavier now.</i>

161
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,668
<i>But I had to trust myself</i>
<i>and just throw it.</i>

162
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,711
- Okay!
- Nice job!

163
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,672
- Nicely done, Amotti!
- Good job.

164
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,216
- Okay!
- Nice job!

165
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,342
- Nice job!
- That's it!

166
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,802
- Get a bit closer.
- Okay.

167
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,429
Easy money, Eddie.

168
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,140
He doesn't even need
a windup. Just straight into it.

169
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,225
Yeah, yeah, that's the best.
He backs up, and he goes…

170
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,560
There's no reset.

171
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,686
Yes, Eddie!

172
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,063
Remember to breathe, okay?

173
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,148
Go, Justin!

174
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,649
A little harder.

175
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,526
- Yep!
- Yeah, nice!

176
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,694
Beautiful, Justin!

177
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,612
Just do your own thing.

178
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,614
Focus on yourself.

179
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,283
- Nice job!
- Nice!

180
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,952
- Nice job!
- Nice!

181
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,245
Nice, Amotti. Nice!

182
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,496
There's the scream.

183
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,624
- Nice job!
- Nice!

184
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,462
I'm stressed, I'm stressed.
It's hard to watch.

185
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,505
He's waning, Justo. He's waning.

186
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,551
<i>Amotti must be tired already.</i>
<i>He's having a hard time.</i>

187
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,512
<i>I actually got excited.</i>

188
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,223
<i>But even then,</i>
<i>I'm really going to give my best.</i>

189
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,268
- Easy-peasy, Justin!
- Go, Justin!

190
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,896
- Yep!
- Yeah!

191
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,939
You can do it.

192
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,029
- Amazing!
- Good throw!

193
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,489
Keep that position!

194
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,949
- You got good distance.
- Same timing too.

195
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,827
Let's go, Eddie.
Let's go, Eddie. Let's go!

196
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,953
Yep!

197
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,206
- Nice!
- Nice, Justin.

198
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,708
Make it count, Amotti. Let's go.

199
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,293
One throw, one throw.

200
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,838
- Nice job!
- There he is! He's back!

201
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,550
That's why he's a champion.

202
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,968
That's why he's a champion though.

203
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,179
'Cause once he's found his rhythm,
he doesn't miss.

204
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,098
All right!

205
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,642
Keep it going, keep it going.

206
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,977
- Nice, Amotti!
- Let's go! That's it!

207
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,062
Yeah!

208
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,689
That's what I'm talking about. Let's go!

209
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,817
<i>All I needed was</i>
<i>a little time to figure it out.</i>

210
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,279
And once I got it, I felt like
I could handle whatever came next.

211
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,325
- Nice job!
- Nice, Amotti, nice!

212
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,494
- He's got his groove.
- Let's go!

213
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,329
I think he's got the hang of it now.

214
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,830
Thank goodness for that.

215
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,750
- He knows the feeling of it now. Yeah.
- He knows he needs to get it in one.

216
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,418
Bap, bap, bap.

217
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,546
Nice set, and buff.

218
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,965
- That's my guy!
- It's getting higher!

219
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,385
Poor Justin's gotta run to it
and run back.

220
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,553
Yeah.

221
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,263
And he keeps having to grab that.

222
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,557
He's only gonna get 25 seconds
to throw it.

223
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,766
You got it!

224
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,850
You got it!

225
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,352
Yep!

226
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,272
Go again, Justo.

227
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,815
- You're good!
- Reset.

228
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,024
This might be it.

229
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,859
- Here it comes!
- It's starting, it's starting.

230
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,361
You got this!

231
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,446
Reset!

232
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,531
You can do it!

233
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,993
- Just reset!
- Hip extend, hip extend! And throw!

234
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,341
- Yeah, bro!
- Yes!

235
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,346
- All right, keep going!
- You can do it, Amotti!

236
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,057
Few steps back. Little over. That's it.

237
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,684
One, two… and go!

238
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,478
All right! That's it!

239
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,398
- Nice, Amotti!
- Good work, man.

240
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:11,193
<i>I saw that Amotti</i>
<i>is getting better at throwing the ball,</i>

241
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,571
<i>not committing any mistakes anymore.</i>

242
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,948
It made me feel like I'm in trouble.

243
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,536
Come on. Throw it far.

244
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,580
Closer, Eddie.

245
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,290
Closer, Eddie.

246
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,584
I think he's starting to get pretty tired.

247
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,710
What did he say?

248
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,253
- He said, "Closer."
- Hmm.

249
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,131
It was nothing against Philippines.

250
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,633
I was just throwing it.

251
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,427
<i>My technique to kind of keep me in rhythm,</i>

252
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,471
<i>'cause I can conserve more energy.</i>

253
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,607
Team Philippines is struggling.

254
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,816
He looks exhausted.

255
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,443
I can see the sweat on his brow.

256
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,819
Legs!

257
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,613
He can't afford to rest.

258
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,460
- Really?
- Trick shot!

259
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,962
- Wow. Wow.
- Nice break, nice break.

260
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,048
- Yeah.
- Use the rest.

261
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,175
- Justo, use the rest.
- Justin, recover.

262
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,928
<i>We had to delay the match to get the ball,</i>

263
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,930
<i>but I think Hernandez</i>
<i>was kind of relieved.</i>

264
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,765
Why do we have to stop?

265
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,725
You got this, Amotti.

266
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,061
<i>Stand by.</i>

267
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,814
- Go, Justo. Nice recovery.
- Let's go, bro.

268
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:30,898
Full swing.

269
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:31,982
<i>Ready…</i>

270
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,567
- Get ready.
- Come on, Justin.

271
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,652
Go.

272
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,779
- Go, go, 18 seconds.
- Deep breath.

273
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,947
Keep fighting!

274
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,490
Let's go, bro!

275
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,574
Yes!

276
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,457
Nice.

277
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,292
Come on, Justo.

278
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,961
That was close. Real close.

279
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,045
Focus.

280
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,880
One throw.

281
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,300
- Yeah!
- Nice! Awesome!

282
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,471
<i>Starting now, the time limit will decrease</i>

283
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,098
<i>to 20 seconds.</i>

284
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,184
All right, here we go.
Now it's crunch time, Eddie.

285
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,145
Focus on throwing it right away.

286
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,022
- Just in case.
- You gotta watch your form.

287
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,108
You got no time to **** mess around.

288
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,943
Let's go, Justin. You've got this.

289
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,113
Just keep doing what you're doing.

290
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,741
He doesn't look at all fazed.

291
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,243
I'm so hungry.

292
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,411
We're gonna make up for that.

293
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,371
- We're gonna feast tonight.
- We're gonna make up for that tonight.

294
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,582
We're gonna feast. We deserve it.

295
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,001
Hundred percent.

296
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,335
Let's go, Eddie.

297
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,589
Twenty seconds, bro.

298
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,757
Make sure.

299
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,634
- Nice!
- Yeah, bro!

300
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,720
- Just like that!
- Nice throw!

301
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,222
- Good shit, Amotti.
- Nice, Amotti.

302
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,183
You guys are killing it. Killing it.

303
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,309
It's a tight match.

304
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,019
- Yeah.
- Wow.

305
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,313
- Yeah.
- Wow.

306
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,065
Whoa.

307
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,277
- Everyone's just like, "Wow!"
- Yeah.

308
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,696
Eddie's downplaying
how hard this challenge is.

309
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,781
Oh, yeah.

310
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,284
For the Philippines!

311
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,786
- Nice!
- Yeah, bro!

312
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,954
- Nice!
- Nice one.

313
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,039
Swing!

314
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,540
- Yeah!
- Nice!

315
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,750
That was a good throw, Justin.

316
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,877
Man, he's really, really good.

317
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,462
He's got his timing down.

318
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,302
You've got the fate of Korea
in your hands now.

319
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,387
- All right!
- Let's go!

320
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,680
Nice throw!

321
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,225
All right! You're crushing it!

322
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,060
- Amotti's **** very good.
- Yeah.

323
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,478
Amotti's an animal, dude.

324
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,939
- Yeah, such an animal.
- He's found his rhythm,

325
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,023
and he's just hitting it.

326
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,108
- He's not even sweating.
- No.

327
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,069
Amotti's not getting tired.

328
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,113
- But he's strong.
- Yeah, he's a beast.

329
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,869
- How many throws is that?
- At least a hundred.

330
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,539
All day, Justin. All day.

331
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,333
Let's go, Amotti!

332
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,835
Why's he so good though?

333
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,545
This is taking a while.

334
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,089
I wonder how long
they've been going for now.

335
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,173
A long time.

336
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,302
There we go.

337
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,138
<i>Starting now, the time limit will decrease</i>

338
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,431
<i>to 15 seconds.</i>

339
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,516
Fifteen?

340
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,811
Justo, you don't get a chance
to make a mistake anymore.

341
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,063
Yeah, first time every time, bro.

342
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,481
Work on that power.

343
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,985
<i>I just know that</i>
<i>you cannot commit any mistakes anymore,</i>

344
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,864
so it's… it's a game of
whoever commits the first mistake.

345
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,700
Whoever commits a mistake will lose.

346
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,451
It's gotta be the first try.

347
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,871
- You just have to focus.
- Yeah, focus.

348
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,163
No mistakes.

349
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,332
<i>You didn't have any time to recover.</i>

350
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,377
<i>One of us was bound to screw up.</i>
<i>It just couldn't be me.</i>

351
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,504
Time to run over these guys, Ed.

352
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,132
He's hungry to win. He's hungry to eat.

353
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,633
Time to eat, Eddie.

354
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,677
Time to eat, baby.

355
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,431
Let's go eat. Let's go eat.

356
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,059
<i>We're confident in Eddie not being beaten.</i>

357
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,021
<i>He's gonna absolutely demolish this quest.</i>

358
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,522
<i>Stand by.</i>

359
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,065
- Let's go, Eddie.
- Here we go, here we go!

360
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,483
It's what you were built for, Justin.

361
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,319
- You were built for this!
- <i>Ready…</i>

362
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,196
- This is it, final stretch.
- Let's go!

363
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,037
- Easy, Ed.
- Power swing, Justin!

364
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,205
Come on, Justin. Get under.
From the first one, man.

365
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,625
Don't take two throws, just one.
Get it in one.

366
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,960
Come on, come on. If he fails, it's over.

367
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,962
Nice!

368
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,090
Nice!

369
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,967
That was really, really close though.

370
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,510
Let's go!

371
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,304
- Fight on!
- Get it in one.

372
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,973
Get it in one. Don't rush. Nice big dip.

373
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,351
- Okay!
- Nice job!

374
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,061
Let's go.

375
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,687
Yes, Eddie.

376
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,981
All day, all night.

377
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,525
- Let's go, Justin. Dig deep.
- Dig deeper.

378
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,653
This is the one, bro. This is it!

379
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,113
- For the country!
- Justin, this is all you all day!

380
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,952
- Yes!
- Nice!

381
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,370
Come on, Justin!

382
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,958
Almost there, Amotti. Let's go.

383
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,836
<i>It was a close call</i>
<i>every time he threw it over,</i>

384
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,255
<i>but it was smarter</i>
<i>to just assume he'd make it.</i>

385
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,549
<i>That way, I'd always be ready to throw.</i>

386
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,303
- Excellent!
- Keep it up!

387
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,138
Send her up. Up.

388
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,391
- Good shit.
- Good position, bro.

389
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
- There it is.
- Nice.

390
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,229
- One big swing.
- Hold your breath. Big squat.

391
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,401
Nice!

392
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,444
Up and over. Let's go.

393
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,279
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Nice.

394
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,498
I think he's a little shaken
by how well the other two are doing.

395
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,876
- Keep strong. Big, deep swing.
- Deep swing, deep swing.

396
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,504
One mistake. That's all it takes.

397
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,345
- Go! Go, go!
- One more, one more!

398
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,180
Five seconds, five seconds.

399
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,726
One mistake, and he's done.

400
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,186
- Come on. Five seconds.
- Pick it up, pick it up.

401
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,980
- You got this.
- Come on!

402
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,567
Hips!

403
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,366
- Yeah!
- Yes!

404
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,328
- Come on!
- Let's go!

405
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,873
- Come on, Justin!
- Let's go!

406
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,250
He had one second left. Unbelievable.

407
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,419
- Focus, focus!
- Let's go. Come on.

408
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,754
Don't let it get to you.

409
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,505
All right!

410
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,801
- That's it! You're killing it, man!
- Bring it home, Amotti! You can do it!

411
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,637
Yeah, nice.

412
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,348
Let's go. Use that time.
You're a little bit off.

413
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,768
Please fail. Just one little slipup.

414
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,936
- Deep swing.
- Big swing!

415
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,938
Full extend!

416
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,774
- Nice!
- Yeah!

417
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,072
Excellent. You know what to do.

418
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,494
And go!

419
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,828
Okay… Oh! Whoa!

420
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,039
Okay… Oh! Whoa!

421
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,708
- Come on, focus.
- It's okay, it's okay. Easy.

422
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,294
<i>I was thinking that, in my head, like,</i>

423
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,339
<i>"Please, please commit another mistake</i>

424
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,132
<i>so that this ends already,</i>

425
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,301
<i>and so that I don't get tired anymore."</i>

426
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,221
- All right!
- Nice save!

427
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,389
Commit to the first throw. Come on.

428
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,642
Recover, recover. Breathe.

429
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,228
Dial in, Justin. Come on, focus, brother.

430
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,855
Justin, this is you all day. Keep going.

431
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,732
You're doing amazing. Keep it up.

432
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,485
- Big swing!
- Big swing!

433
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,946
- Go, go!
- Come on! Come on!

434
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,241
- Go, go!
- Come on! Come on!

435
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,576
- This is it. I think we got it.
- Oh, ooh.

436
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,204
<i>Please don't make it.</i>

437
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,832
- Go, go!
- Come on! Come on!

438
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,792
Justin, this is you. Come on!

439
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,252
Down… Up!

440
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,009
<i>It was like</i>
<i>a life-and-death situation for me.</i>

441
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,775
We did it!

442
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,199
Up!

443
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,535
We did it!

444
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,960
<i>Game over.</i>

445
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,297
<i>Finally, it was over.</i>

446
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,340
That was insane.

447
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,385
<i>I was really unsure for a bit.</i>

448
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,096
<i>I'd let all the anxiety and the pressure</i>
<i>get to me,</i>

449
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,515
<i>and it took me a while to snap out of it.</i>

450
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,852
<i>But despite that, I pulled through.</i>

451
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,354
I'm thrilled. I really am.

452
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,440
Man, what just happened? Come here.

453
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,735
<i>I was so happy it was over,</i>
<i>I started to tear up a bit.</i>

454
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,905
<i>Amotti had saved us. He was my hero.</i>

455
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,033
Seriously, that was amazing.

456
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,951
- You okay, Seung-yeon?
- Dude, I'm exhausted.

457
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,662
You had a long day.

458
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,958
What a relief.

459
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,588
Oh, my goodness.

460
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,256
<i>I felt so bad.</i>

461
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,677
At the start of the fourth game, I was
still really upset and super anxious.

462
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,888
I just kept telling myself,

463
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,016
<i>"We're going to be eliminated today.</i>
<i>It's all my fault."</i>

464
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,394
That was incredible!
Well done, Seung-yeon!

465
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,149
<i>I'm not religious,</i>
<i>but I kept praying and praying.</i>

466
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,486
It felt like I was standing
on the edge of a cliff,

467
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,488
like, "I'll see myself out."

468
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,865
And then Amotti grabbed my hand
and pulled me back.

469
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,200
Thank goodness.

470
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,953
I'm so grateful to him.
He always comes through.

471
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,081
Very good game.

472
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,629
- Nice save, nice save.
- It's okay, it's okay.

473
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,172
It's okay, guys. It's all right.

474
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,716
- Hey. No need to be sorry.
- Sorry, guys, I did my best.

475
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,176
No, dude, you did.

476
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,470
- Nice save, nice save.
- Dude, you did great, bro. You did great.

477
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,931
- Awesome. Awesome.
- Good job, Justin. Dude…

478
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,433
<i>I actually don't have any regrets</i>

479
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,477
because I know that I did my best.

480
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,396
But what I couldn't handle,

481
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,108
and what was really hard for me to handle,
was letting down my team.

482
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,487
Justin really showed
how much of a beast he actually is,

483
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,783
and again, epitomizing
what that Filipino fighting spirit is.

484
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,078
<i>I have a great sense of respect and pride,</i>

485
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,999
<i>not only for Justin, but for</i>
<i>all the athletes in Team Philippines.</i>

486
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,337
<i>Team Philippines,</i>

487
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,257
<i>since you placed third,</i>
<i>you have been eliminated.</i>

488
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:47,055
GROUP A FINAL RESULTS

489
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,740
Raise those heads high, guys.

490
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,491
You gave it everything.

491
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,744
It was so close though.

492
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,583
<i>Team Philippines, you have</i>
<i>been eliminated from </i>Physical: Asia.

493
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,757
<i>As a result, you must now destroy</i>
<i>your torsos with your very own hands.</i>

494
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,974
I hope that I and we

495
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,602
made the country proud
with all our efforts.

496
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,562
We gave it everything we had,

497
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:39,274
and we were determined
to show Filipino fighting spirit.

498
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,403
<i>We didn't have anyone in our team</i>
<i>that just gave up.</i>

499
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,990
<i>We really gave it our all…</i>

500
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,536
<i>and… and will into the events.</i>

501
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,957
<i>I-I was extremely proud for me,</i>
<i>as the captain, to witness that.</i>

502
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,628
Now, a lot feels unfinished.

503
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:04,049
<i>We will only get stronger</i>
<i>from this experience.</i>

504
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:11,181
We cannot make this far
if we're not working together as a team.

505
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,100
- Let's fight!
- Philippines!

506
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,351
Philippines!

507
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,811
Philippines!

508
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,396
Jeepney blitz.

509
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,233
<i>Every ounce of determination…</i>

510
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,111
One, two, three, up!

511
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,364
<i>To collaborate…</i>

512
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,034
No, you did an amazing job.

513
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,452
You were amazing okay?

514
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,164
Yeah!

515
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,959
<i>To share…</i>

516
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,464
That's Team Philippines,
and we traveled this far…

517
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,551
<i>as a team.</i>

518
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,638
<i>It was my dream to compete.</i>

519
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,142
<i>It was the best opportunity in my life.</i>

520
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,895
<i>It was an absolute honor</i>
<i>representing the Philippines.</i>

521
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,865
I wasn't gonna cry.

522
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,660
Um…

523
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,707
As athletes and as individuals,

524
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,334
it's been amazing.

525
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:26,381
It's been a great opportunity
to be selected to be among you guys.

526
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,638
<i>I'm so sad that we're leaving.</i>

527
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,854
Um, although I'm very sad that

528
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:44,191
this is gonna be our last challenge
and we have been eliminated,

529
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:48,028
I'm still very happy
to be able to compete,

530
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:52,949
participate alongside
my awesome and wonderful teammates.

531
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,243
- He killed it.
- He really did.

532
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,536
Thank you, everyone.

533
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,338
- Proud of you guys, bro.
- Good luck, guys.

534
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,006
Appreciate it, man. Thank you so much.

535
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,090
<i>Philippine is strong.</i>

536
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,926
- It was awesome competing with you.
- See you guys soon.

537
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,012
- Great job, great job.
- Thank you. Well done. Go hard.

538
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,519
- One more last.
- One last one.

539
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,938
- One more last.
- All right, one last time, guys.

540
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,981
- This is it.
- This is it. This is the loudest.

541
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,942
- This is the loudest.
- Loudest. Okay, ready?

542
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,443
Let's fight!

543
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,530
Philippines!

544
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,482
PHYSICAL: ASIA

545
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:15,031
7. FOR THE HOMELAND

546
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,414
Wow, it feels like
we're walking in the clouds.

547
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,498
I know, right?

548
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,792
<i>The first thing I saw when we entered</i>

549
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,377
<i>was an endless floor of sand</i>

550
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,796
<i>and this pillar-like tree</i>
<i>in the center of it.</i>

551
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,173
<i>So, immediately, I'm kind of at a loss.</i>

552
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,384
Maybe we'll hang from those?

553
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,553
I guess we know what I'll be doing.

554
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,139
Each of these feel so different.

555
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,766
Are we supposed to hang from those?

556
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,227
<i>I kept looking around</i>
<i>at all the different games.</i>

557
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,731
<i>Like, "Great, I wonder</i>
<i>what kind of torture awaits us now."</i>

558
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,108
Physical: Asia<i>.</i>

559
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,404
<i>We will now reveal the details</i>
<i>of the Third Quest.</i>

560
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,115
<i>The Team Rep Match.</i>

561
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,951
<i>The Sack Toss Match.</i>

562
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,119
All right.

563
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,496
<i>Last One Hanging Match.</i>

564
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,415
Hanging? From where?

565
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,167
<i>Totem Pole Match.</i>

566
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,460
Oh, no way.

567
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,298
<i>Zigzag Hurdle Match.</i>

568
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,008
Did they say hurdling?

569
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,718
Over those?

570
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,720
<i>Once all four games are complete,</i>

571
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,181
<i>the scores will be tallied</i>
<i>and teams ranked.</i>

572
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,308
<i>If there is a tie,</i>

573
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,268
<i>in lieu of a rematch,</i>

574
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,978
<i>the final standing will be determined</i>

575
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,065
<i>by each team's placement</i>
<i>in the Zigzag Hurdle Match.</i>

576
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,983
<i>Contestants,</i>

577
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,736
<i>you will now select</i>
<i>your game representatives.</i>

578
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,990
Oof.

579
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,993
I'm like a monkey,
I basically live in the air.

580
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,411
That's gonna be all you, okay?

581
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,664
- Yeah, no sweat.
- Just pretend you're onstage.

582
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,999
- Yeah. For sure. I've got this.
- You could put on a whole show here.

583
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,377
I think we need Khandsuren on the hurdles.

584
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,672
We need agility and speed,
so your volleyball skills are ideal.

585
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,424
- Then how about Dulguun and I team up?
- You two? Yeah, lets.

586
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,343
- Make sure to pace yourselves.
- I think it's a good idea.

587
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,971
And don't forget, you two are used to
maneuvering while you're running,

588
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,015
- so you have an advantage.
- You're a lot more agile.

589
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,601
Hurdles are definitely
gonna be a struggle for them

590
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,603
since they're not used to
dealing with obstacles.

591
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,688
- Yeah.
- Hey,

592
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,941
I think Türkiye's female wrestler
is doing the sack toss.

593
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,485
And you're sure
you wanna do the sack toss?

594
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,362
Absolutely. I think it has to be me.

595
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,780
How many rounds is it?

596
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,074
It's not a set number.
I think you just keep going.

597
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,367
Until the time runs out?

598
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,705
I'm pretty sure everyone's sending
their big guys to the pillars.

599
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,915
Then why don't I take that one?

600
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,127
That's the only real option.
I can't do the other games.

601
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,672
Whatever strategy we go with, we need
to consider our decisions carefully.

602
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,007
- Winning everything would be difficult.
- It's not realistic.

603
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,219
Let's aim to get first in those two games,
and second in the other two.

604
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,055
I mean, obviously,
we should try to win all of them, but…

605
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,475
We need to prioritize the first match.

606
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,145
How well we do there
can determine our final ranking.

607
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,272
- If there's a tie--
- Exactly, so it's important.

608
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,649
What if Kana and I did the hurdles?

609
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,652
- I could go first and you second.
- If you want hurdles, be my guest.

610
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,654
You, Soichi? You want the hurdles?

611
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,406
I think that's our best bet, yeah.

612
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,615
Uh…

613
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,994
<i>Since it's important,</i>
<i>I knew I'd be good at it.</i>

614
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,706
But personally speaking, all I really
wanted was the chance to beat Türkiye.

615
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,961
<i>I was still pretty mad</i>
<i>about getting thrown off the platform.</i>

616
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,005
And since I'm pretty fast,

617
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,257
I thought I'd have
a good chance at revenge.

618
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,384
Physical: Asia.

619
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,512
<i>Third Quest: Team Rep Match.</i>

620
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,347
<i>First game.</i>

621
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,933
<i>Those selected</i>
<i>for the Zigzag Hurdle Match,</i>

622
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,643
<i>please enter the arena.</i>

623
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,687
<i>The game will begin momentarily.</i>

624
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,189
- All right, let's go.
- Good luck.

625
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,940
- Kill 'em.
- Let's go, you two.

626
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,942
- Bravo!
- Let's show 'em!

627
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,069
You can do it! Get it, get it!

628
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,156
Well, at the very least, we look stronger.

629
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,492
I think our team's
gonna be great at vaulting.

630
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,535
Looks like they went with height.

631
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,078
Maybe they thought
they'd have an advantage?

632
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,205
- Why do that?
- Yeah, think so.

633
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,749
I mean, if they can get over faster,
that's a huge help.

634
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,171
<i>The pillar height was just</i>
<i>about where my and Dulguun's hips were,</i>

635
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:01,508
so I knew we'd be able to vault over them
without any issues.

636
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:05,053
<i>As long as we didn't slip up,</i>
<i>victory would be ours.</i>

637
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,556
<i>I knew we could win this.</i>

638
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,518
It's pretty high.

639
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,103
It might take us a few attempts.

640
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,731
I think it's a little high for him.

641
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,692
<i>I knew that jumping</i>
<i>was gonna be a challenge</i>

642
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,486
since my legs are pretty short.

643
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,822
I decided to focus on what I could do,

644
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,824
rather than worrying
about what I couldn't.

645
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,827
<i>In a race like this,</i>
<i>I figured speed would be more effective.</i>

646
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,913
She looks light on her feet.

647
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,624
- Wasn't she a track and field athlete?
- Yeah.

648

ALI SOFUOGLU
NATIONAL KARATE FIGHTER

649
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,254
All we needed to focus on was winning.
I didn't care who my opponent was.

650
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:43,091
<i>All I cared about was getting over</i>
<i>the obstacles as quickly as possible.</i>

651
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,175
<i>That's it.</i>

652
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,180

<i>Game One: Zigzag Hurdle Match.</i>

654
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,813
<i>The match will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

655
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,275
Khandsuren, there's no need to rush, okay?

656
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,901
- You're good. You got this!
- Don't sweat it.

657
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,572
- Let's go!
- You've got this, team!

658
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,658
<i>Stand by.</i>

659
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,747
Quick jumps, okay? Be explosive.

660
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,832
<i>Ready…</i>

661
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,685
Nice job. You're leading.

662
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,229
You're the best, Khandsuren. Let's go!

663
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,355
There you go.

664
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,190
- Wait! Press the button!
- Oh, shoot.

665
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,692
Hey, hey! Come back!

666
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,403
Let's go. Hey, hey! Come back!

667
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,780
Okay, no need to worry. You're good.

668
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,074
Nice recovery there!

669
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,493
Don't forget the button!

670
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,912
Mongolia missed it.

671
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,872
Bravo!

672
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,665
- You're doing great!
- Bravo!

673
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,586
Sorry.

674
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,546
It's okay. You're fine.

675
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,757
- Sorry.
- It's okay. You're fine.

676
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,593
<i>It was surprisingly hard to jump.</i>

677
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,680
<i>I could tell the gap between me and the</i>
<i>other two runners was starting to grow,</i>

678
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,140
<i>which was really distracting.</i>

679
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,516
I had eight laps left.

680
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,061
And I figured that,
if I could maintain a good pace,

681
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,105
<i>then I could slowly start</i>
<i>to overtake my opponents.</i>

682
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,859
<i>I could still win.</i>
<i>I just had to power through.</i>

683
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,070
No need to panic! Just pace yourself!

684
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,575
Four!

685
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,827
- Keep going, keep going!
- You're okay, just run!

686
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,955
You're good, Khandsuren. You got this.

687
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,039
You're good! Just go!

688
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,749
You're good, Khandsuren. You got this.

689
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,167
You're all caught up!

690
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,877
You're all caught up!

691
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,796
Way to go, way to go!

692
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,298
- Nice! Keep that pace! Keep it up!
- Let's go, Kana!

693
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,884
She fell behind
after not pressing the button earlier.

694
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,052
Stay calm, okay?

695
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,516
Hey, you're doing great. Just breathe.

696
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,523
<i>I forgot to hit the button,</i>
<i>which made me panic.</i>

697
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,692
I tried to push through it,

698
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,778
but I was so freaked out,
I started running out of breath.

699
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,572
<i>I forgot to watch my breathing</i>
<i>and I fell over.</i>

700
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,574
<i>I felt horrible,</i>

701
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,494
<i>but I couldn't think about that.</i>
<i>My team was counting on me.</i>

702
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,913
You've got this, Khandsuren!
Let's go, go, go!

703
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,375
<i>I had to snap out of it and focus on</i>
<i>finishing the rest of the laps</i>

704
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,293
<i>as fast as I possibly could.</i>

705
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,131
Push! Mongolia's already off their game!

706
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,049
Your opponents are exhausted, okay?

707
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,428
You're already one lap ahead.
Try to widen the gap more!

708
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,722
If you get there first,
I can finish before them!

709
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,640
Let's go, Ali!

710
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,393
Please, Ali, come on!

711
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,519
Three more!

712
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,396
They're tired! They're both tired!

713
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,606
Looking good. Just keep going!

714
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,608
That's right. Don't stop.
Push, push, push.

715
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,860
Right, nice!

716
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,237
- Come on! Come on!
- Two more laps! Two more, let's go!

717
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,489
- Two more, Kana!
- You can do it!

718
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,783
All right, last lap, Ali.
Come on. Hurry up.

719
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,747
Go, go!

720
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,873
Nefise!

721
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,928
Keep going!

722
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,056
You've got this! Run!

723
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,599
Last jump!

724
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:20,892
Last one!

725
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,108
- Yeah, let's go!
- All right, Soichi!

726
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,034
Let's go! You're killing it, man!

727
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,702
Wow, you're fast. One.

728
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,997
<i>The hurdles weren't just high,</i>
<i>they were super wide too.</i>

729
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,750
<i>You had to completely clear them</i>
<i>if you wanted to get over.</i>

730
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,753
It was challenging.
A lot harder than I thought.

731
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,047
<i>Even so, once I'd finished the first lap,</i>

732
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,424
<i>I knew I'd be able to catch up to Türkiye.</i>

733
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,929
<i>All I had to do was stay focused</i>
<i>and make my jumps.</i>

734
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,013
<i>No mistakes.</i>

735
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,307
Japan's catching up.

736
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,226
Come on, come on!
Just a little bit faster!

737
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,685
Faster!

738
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,189
Don't tire yourself out, okay?

739
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,899
- One down.
- That's it.

740
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,734
- One down.
- That's it.

741
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,112
- That's it.
- One down.

742
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,905
Japan's in the lead.

743
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,241
Come on! Faster, Nefise!

744
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,118
<i>The height was really frustrating.</i>

745
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,703
<i>I mean, I could hardly</i>
<i>haul myself over the hurdles.</i>

746
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,206
<i>I just started to fixate on it, you know?</i>

747
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,042
<i>Like, "Why can't I jump over it?</i>
<i>What's going on?"</i>

748
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,378
I was super confident at first,

749
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,671
so I really didn't expect that.

750
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,839
- Almost, and…
- Go!

751
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,101
All right, Dulguun! It's neck-and-neck!

752
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,311
You've got this, man! Let's go! Catch up!

753
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,688
Fight for it, Dulguun!

754
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,481
<i>I told myself,</i>

755
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,067
<i>"Even if we don't end up</i>
<i>coming in first here,</i>

756
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,362
<i>to stay in the competition,</i>
<i>I had to at least get second."</i>

757
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,244
- Push! You've gotta push!
- You're almost done! Hang on!

758
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,746
Come on! Let's go!

759
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,961
You've got this, man! Let's go! Catch up!

760
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,925
Hang in there, Nefise!

761
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,802
Hang in there, Nefise!

762
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,429
Türkiye's in trouble!

763
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,930
You're doing great!

764
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,184
We need at least second place.

765
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,477
All right, two more.

766
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,189
You're almost there, guys!

767
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,565
- You're right there!
- You've caught up to Türkiye!

768
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,734
Run, run, run! Hang in there!

769
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,319
Last one.

770
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,403
Last one, let's go!

771
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,239
You can't slow down! Just run!

772
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,742
Almost there! You can do it, Soichi!

773
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,455
- There we go, man! Let's go! Let's go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

774
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,044
<i>From the very beginning,</i>
<i>I knew we'd be able to win this.</i>

775
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,712
<i>I had my eye on that flag.</i>

776
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,008
It's your win, man! You can take it easy!

777
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,359
- Hurry up!
- You gotta go faster!

778
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,152
You're almost there! Keep pushing.

779
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,696
Final stretch! Go!

780
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,657
I think we can catch up at the end!

781
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,700
Go, go, go!

782
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,826
We might win this!

783
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,748
<i>My pulse was racing, my heart pounding.</i>

784
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,208
<i>I was so exhausted.</i>

785
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,542
You're almost done!

786
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,710
Run, Nefise!

787
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,213
<i>Getting second still seemed possible.</i>

788
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,798
Yes, we can overtake Türkiye!

789
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,132
- That's it!
- Let's go!

790
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,304
You gotta run. Mongolia's catching up!

791
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,014
All right, run! You can beat her!

792
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,943
Come on, hurry up!

793
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,117
He's exhausted!

794
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,743
<i>The second I turned,</i>

795
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,204
<i>the moment I decided</i>
<i>to push myself to the limit,</i>

796
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,248
<i>I tripped from exhaustion.</i>

797
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,501
<i>The whole time, I was neck-and-neck</i>
<i>with Team Türkiye,</i>

798
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,753
<i>but that little slip-up did me in.</i>

799
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,424
- Well done!
- Yeah!

800
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,883
- That's how you do it!
- Bravo, Nefise!

801
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,844
- Well done!
- Yeah!

802
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,804
- That's how you do it! Bravo!
- Bravo, Nefise!

803
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,556
<i>The match has ended.</i>

804
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,850
Yeah!

805
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,185
- That's how you do it! Bravo!
- Bravo, Nefise!

806
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,354
Bravo!

807
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,696
It's all my fault…

808
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,199
<i>By then, I was overwhelmed with guilt.</i>

809
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,659
Especially because

810
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,911
I knew my team had been depending on me,

811
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,288
and I'd completely let them down.

812
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:56,500
<i>My emotions were running high,</i>
<i>and I just broke down in tears.</i>

813
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,296
This is all my fault.

814
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,630
No, it's okay.

815
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,633
I was hoping that we'd
at least get second place.

816
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,012
So when I heard the score,
I was really disappointed in myself.

817
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:11,557
If we wanna survive,
we'll need to get first in the next game.

818
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,895
So, us and Türkiye?

819
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,064
Mongolia won't race since they got third.

820
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,775
If we get first again,
we'll get the points.

821
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,235
The only thing
is that you've gotta go faster.

822
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,820
The gap wasn't wide enough.

823
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,447
Okay.

824
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,491
I think Türkiye's female runner is tired.

825
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,784
Yeah, she was slow.

826
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,080
Hey, you did great.

827
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,040
- I should've gone first.
- Well, let's switch.

828
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,383
Man, Japan's incredible.
Hashimoto's a beast!

829
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,135
Yeah. Everyone on their team
has great training and technique.

830
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,303
No kidding.

831
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,139
- I was fast, right?
- Yeah, you were. That was crazy.

832
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,101
We're always gonna be lower than we think.

833
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,311
- Yeah? Okay.
- So aim higher.

834
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,855
Your body was just caught off guard.

835
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,316
Now that you know what to expect,
it'll be easier.

836
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,567
You'll breathe better.

837
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,323
<i>Game One, Zigzag Hurdle Match.</i>

838
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,033
<i>Round Two.</i>

839
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,953
<i>Stand by.</i>

840
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,873
All right, last round, guys!
Give it your all!

841
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,750
- Go, Japan!
- Come on!

842
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,043
Let's go!

843
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,339
<i>Yeah, I was already pretty confident…</i>

844
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,300
<i>but even more so after I saw</i>
<i>how tired the track runner was.</i>

845
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,719
<i>I was exhausted,</i>

846
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,972
<i>but I had to show off my crazy strength.</i>

847
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,850
This time, we were going to win.
Absolutely.

848
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,018
Just try to find the rhythm.

849
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,812
<i>Ready.</i>

850
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,274
Focus.

851
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,358
Go!

852
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,533
Bravo, Nefise!

853
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,034
All right, let's go!

854
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,623
If you close the gap,
I can overtake them. Keep going.

855
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,667
Close that gap.

856
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,003
Faster. Don't let it widen.

857
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,964
Keep going! Don't walk!

858
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,507
Find your rhythm, Nefise!

859
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,302
You're fine, Türkiye's struggling.

860
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,637
You're one lap ahead! Keep going!

861
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,931
- I think Japan's got this.
- Seems like it.

862
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,560
Japan's runner has really great form.

863
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,855
She's pushing off well.
Her vaults are clean.

864
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,275
Nefo! Nefo! Nefo!

865
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,651
Keep pushing!

866
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,820
<i>Round Two was absolute torture.</i>

867
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,824
<i>But I just kept pushing.</i>
<i>I thought I was gonna faint.</i>

868
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,826
Their runner's starting to struggle.

869
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,461
- Don't worry, Japan's struggling!
- Let's go!

870
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,672
It's okay, you're all good.

871
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,716
Aim higher! That's right!

872
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,136
- Looking good!
- You're doing great! Don't push too hard!

873
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,971
You're already two laps ahead.

874
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,681
Nice job!

875
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,475
Last one.

876
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,601
And jump!

877
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,145
- Last one!
- Let's go, Kana!

878
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,897
- One more!
- Last round!

879
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,690
Ali can win, just close the gap!

880
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,400
Just set it up for Ali.

881
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,737
Don't give up! You hear me? Don't give up!

882
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,619
Hang in there.

883
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,538
- Yeah! Come on!
- Let's go!

884
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,789
You're doing great!

885
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,794
That's it! You've got this!

886
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,134
Run, Ali! Run!

887
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,220
- Ali's pretty good.
- He is.

888
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,556
You can see how strong his legs are.

889
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,934
<i>Your opponent can make a mistake</i>

890
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,019
<i>at any time, you just need to be patient.</i>

891
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,605
<i>I figured it'd only be a matter of time.</i>

892
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,942
<i>But until then, I had to narrow the gap</i>
<i>as much as possible.</i>

893
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,030
<i>After all, the game wasn't over</i>
<i>until someone took the flag.</i>

894
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,042
- Last one!
- Let's go, Soichi!

895
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,926
I got it!

896
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,262
I got it!

897
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,264
- You did it!
- Yeah!

898
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,348
Nice!

899
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,769
<i>I felt amazing.</i>

900
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,188
Obviously, I wanted to win,
but I really wanted

901
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,440
revenge on Türkiye.

902
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,109
And I think today's victory
is payback enough.

903
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,652
It feels really good.

904
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,033
As the first runner, I knew I had to try
and set us up for success.

905
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,077
So it was great to know
all that hard work paid off.

906
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,706
Really great job.

907
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:55,799
I'm sorry, Ali.

908
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:56,884
No, it's okay.

909
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,262
I swear, I felt like I was about to vomit.

910
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,181
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

911
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,016
- I feel awful.
- Come on, it's okay.

912
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,352
We did good.

913
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,813
- Great effort, you two! Seriously.
- Bravo, bravo, bravo!

914
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,273
We still got second place.

915
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,524
<i>I was upset.</i>

916
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,069
<i>And even when it ended,</i>
<i>I was still nervous.</i>

917
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,946
I was my fault. I can admit that.

918
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,698
I know I could've done better.

919
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,949
I mean, we practically

920
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,077
handed Japan the win on a silver platter.

921
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,830
But… I really don't think Team Japan's
going to do as well

922
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,123
in the other games.

923
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,463

<i>please enter the arena.</i>

927

<i>The game will soon begin.</i>

928
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,811
- All right.
- Let's go, guys!

929
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,562
- You can do this.
- Good luck.

930
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,856
- You've got this, you two.
- Yeah.

All righty… let's go, boys!

934
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,368
<i>To win the stone pillar game,</i>

935
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,079
<i>you had to count on</i>
<i>muscular endurance and weight.</i>

936
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,956
Because of that, we thought it'd be best

937
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,126
to have an all-male team,
which happened to be me and Katsumi.

938
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,754
They might have an advantage here
since they've got two men,

939
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,924
but right now, there's no telling
how all of this is gonna play out.

940
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,886
The only thing I want from my teammates

941
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,222
is to see their confidence, you know?

942
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,224
I mean, we already proved

943
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,892
the strength of our team
in the first quest,

944
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,103
so why can't we prove our strength again?

945
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,357

00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,821
<i>Especially Turkish women.</i>

949
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,490
I know I'm a very strong woman.

950
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,702
<i>My strength is equal to any man's.</i>

951
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,414
Since it was the most strenuous game,

952
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,082
<i>we had Recep for heavy lifting.</i>

953
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,295
<i>They're a good team. Strong individually,</i>
<i>but stronger together.</i>

954
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,880
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

955
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,882
- Let's go, Türkiye!
- You got this!

956
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,300
- Come on!
- You can do this.

957
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,218

Captain, do you think Adiya's mad
at the two of us?

961
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,394
For asking her to do this?

962
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,897
<i>I was a little bit worried for them,</i>

963
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,608
<i>especially since Orgil</i>
<i>has a very small physique.</i>

964
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:22,279
<i>I know them well.</i>
<i>Adiya and Enkh-Orgil are strong enough</i>

965
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:25,240
<i>to take on anything, so I knew</i>
<i>they'd be able to win this.</i>

966
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,744
And besides, the longer the arms,
the wider the pillars will tilt.

967
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,746
The smaller the arms,
the easier to balance.

968
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,039
It's simple physics.

969
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,416
I was confident
I could rise to the challenge.

970
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,835
<i>I kept trying to reassure myself,</i>

971
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,963
<i>like, "you're a judoka,</i>
<i>you're used to handling weight!"</i>

972
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,465
you've got a great grip.

973
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:45,135
But still, my heart was beating so fast
I could hear it pounding.

974
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:46,887
I was nervous.

975
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,517
Since we didn't place first or second
in the last game,

976
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,352
<i>we had to place high here.</i>

977
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,521
<i>At the very least,</i>
<i>we needed to get second.</i>

978
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,190
We're gonna fight to the end!

979
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,901
- You're the best, you two!
- Let's go, Adiya!

980
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,194
- You've got this!
- All right, all right.

981
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,239

00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,540
Once the whistle blows,

985
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,124
- you pull, then I'll pull.
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

986
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,543
In the name of Allah.

987
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,754
Believe in yourselves! You've got this!

988
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,173
All right, let's go!

989
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,258
Yeah!

990
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,593
Steady.

991
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:28,929
<i>Ready…</i>

992
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,310
All right.

993
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,566
- All right, there you go!
- Looking good, guys!

994
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,859
Just have patience, all right?

995
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,820
I know you can make it!
Just keep your balance and work together.

996
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,322
Nice job, you two! You're barely moving!

997
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,081
Good start.
Just don't pull too hard, Recep.

998
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,207
Hold it steady.

999
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,003
<i>Honestly, it wasn't too bad at first.</i>

1000
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,881
<i>It felt pretty manageable,</i>
<i>for two stone pillars.</i>

1001
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,926
Take a deep breath,
and just focus on yourselves.

1002
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,262
Excellent, just keep breathing.

1003
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,973
There you go, very nice guys.

1004
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,349
Keep it up, you two! Just relax!

1005
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,184
Stand solid, like a rock.

1006
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,646
They're all unstable.

1007
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,190
<i>Once we started,</i>
<i>there was nothing to think about.</i>

1008
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:25,235
<i>Just focus, and hold on.</i>
<i>That's all we could do.</i>

1009
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:31,074
Well, that was the plan,
but there was a technical issue.

1010
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,160
Our totems weren't released properly.

1011
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,372
So as a result, we ended up
having to re-do the challenge.

1012
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,834
DUE TO AN EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION,

1013
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,419

1018
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,973
There were a lot of discussions
on what to do,

1019
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,310
but this is a competition,
and we wanted to be good sports.

1020
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,395
So we agreed to go again

1021
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,148
once the third and fourth games
were completed.

1022
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,984
If we wanted to win, it had to be fair.

1023
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,363
Bravo, bravo.

1024
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,031
Look at Team Mongolia.

1025
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,616
Their right side is tilted.

1026
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,534
- Yeah, it's coming loose.
- Oh, they're falling soon.

1027
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,371
How are you?

1028
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:18,914
I'm good, you?

1029
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,041
You okay?

1030
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,877
It's pulling me over.

1031
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,712
I can tell you're pulling it,

1032
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,506
- but I don't think we're balanced.
- Okay.

1033
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,176
<i>It felt like I was going to lose my grip.</i>

1034
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,011
<i>I couldn't think about anything else.</i>

1035
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,514
<i>I was completely freaked out</i>
<i>and didn't know what to do.</i>

1036
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,517
I feel like I've got most of the weight.

1037
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,894
I have to pull more
because I'm higher up than you are.

1038
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,854
Oh, okay. Should I pull?

1039
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,731
One sec. We need to center ourselves

1040
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,274
- before we try that.
- Okay. All right.

1041
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,609
- Okay?
- Tell me when.

1042
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,195
You shouldn't pull that hard.

1043
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,030
Don't move it too much.

1044
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,659
We just kept fidgeting, like,
here, and back, and here…

1045
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,786
We had to figure it out somehow.

1046
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,164
<i>It took a bit of coordination</i>
<i>to even out our balance.</i>

1047
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,126
<i>A lot of, "How's this?",</i>
<i>"This hurts!", and so-fourth.</i>

1048
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,129
<i>But once we got it, we adjusted our grips.</i>

1049
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,423
Looks like they've got it handled.

1050
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,758
There! That's perfect!

1051
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,302
- Tell me when your hands hurt.
- Okay.

1052
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,470
Just a bit… Okay!

1053
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,722
That's it, perfect!

1054
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,309
Türkiye is terrifying.

1055
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,519
They haven't even moved, right?

1056
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,813
- They haven't budged. Exactly.
- Like they're glued down.

1057
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,526
<i>I think Türkiye's strategy</i>
<i>was to come out here</i>

1058
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,986
<i>and stand absolutely still.</i>

1059
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,949
No need to worry.
Our team is the strongest.

1060
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,909
Yeah yeah, stay Zen!

1061
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,162
- You're killing it!
- Seriously, you look comfortable.

1062
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,584
<i>Of the four challenges we had lined up,</i>

1063
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,170
<i>this was the one</i>
<i>that felt like the easiest win.</i>

1064
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,131
<i>I tried to motivate myself,</i>

1065
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,051
<i>repeating mantras like,</i>
<i>"I'm strong. I could do this forever."</i>

1066
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,136
Nice job, Recep.

1067
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,721
- Just don't move your head.
- Great posture.

1068
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,014
Don't look, Yasemin.

1069
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,016
You guys are fine.

1070
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,685
Seven minutes have passed.

1071
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,228
You're in the zone now.

1072
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,735
You can bend forward if you need to.

1073
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,700
Wait, wait. What happened? Are you good?

1074
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,996
I think Adiya's grip
has come a little loose.

1075
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,372
Yeah.

1076
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,836
Give them compliments, not notes.

1077
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,213
Yeah, they need a distraction.

1078
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,923
Okay, keep holding, keep breathing,

1079
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,841
but try to think about something else.

1080
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,386
Keep it up, guys. You look great.

1081
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,805
Your form is perfect!

1082
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,058
- Mongolia's unbalanced.
- Yeah.

1083
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,142
They'll let go soon.

1084
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,435
Yeah, they're done.

1085
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,522
Team Mongolia won't last long,
so just hold on.

1086
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,857
- Don't stress.
- They're wobbly.

1087
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,110
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

1088
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,194
All right, team.

1089
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,114
- Bravo!
- Bravo, bravo!

1090
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,282
Ten minutes.

1091
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,408
And your feet haven't moved!

1092
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,036
That's it, you two. Nicely done.

1093
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,789
Team Mongolia's struggling to breathe.

1094
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,207
Bravo, bravo!

1095
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,424
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

1096
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,220
<i>I broke out into a cold sweat.</i>

1097
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,389
<i>My hands got really clammy.</i>

1098
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,434
<i>It was a different kind of pain</i>
<i>than I anticipated.</i>

1099
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,024
Hey, Recep, I need to readjust.

1100
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,321
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1101
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,657
- What was that?
- Easy there…

1102
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,075
Don't move around too much.

1103
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,785
I think our left pillar is tilting.

1104
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,245
Hey, look over there.

1105
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,373
- On the end?
- Aw, come on! Drop it!

1106
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,833
Well, now Türkiye's struggling.

1107
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,502
Just hang on! Türkiye's pretty shaky.

1108
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,382
Stay solid. We're winning this.

1109
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,434
What do you think happened?

1110
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,352
Who knows, maybe an arm cramp?

1111
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,479
This is a team match, guys!

1112
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,732
Still looking sharp, you two!

1113
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,819
Hey, pull on my left for me.

1114
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,198
Yeah. Just a bit, I need to fix my hand.

1115
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,366
Okay, I'm good.

1116
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,786
Hold on, the weight's on my back now.

1117
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,081
Okay, that's better. Thanks.

1118
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,504
<i>The longer we stood there,</i>

1119
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:40,008
<i>the more you could feel the weight</i>
<i>and the muscle strain from the pillars.</i>

1120
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,637
<i>But all that mattered</i>
<i>was beating our opponents,</i>

1121
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,139
<i>so I braced myself</i>
<i>and kept pushing through it.</i>

1122
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,976
Don't let it get to you.
You're doing really good.

1123
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,313
Come on, Mongolia. Let go, let go.

1124
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,857
Just let go, please.

1125
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,902
Could you pull left a bit?

1126
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,445
Nice teamwork, you two.

1127
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,074
Okay, now I'll pull.

1128
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,076
- Okay.
- There.

1129
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:08,411
Just keep pushing. Keep pushing!

1130
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,413
Türkiye's starting to shake!

1131
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,667
I need to change my grip.

1132
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,252
Hold on a second.

1133
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,628
Hold on a second.

1134
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,094
I need to rest my left hand.
Could you pull left?

1135
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,972
Okay, I'm pulling. Pulling, pulling…

1136
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,140
Too much, not too much!

1137
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,226
Slow down! Keep your balance!

1138
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,522
<i>There was this sharp</i>
<i>muscle spasm in my lower back.</i>

1139
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,148
Hang in there, come on!

1140
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,650
Yasemin, Recep, hold on!

1141
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,361
Mongolia's shaky at best,
they'll be down soon.

1142
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,363
Those two are goners.

1143
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,240
Her right pillar's about to crash.

1144
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,118
Stay steady, guys. Looking good.

1145
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,202
So solid!

1146
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,538
- Doing great! Come on!
- Good, Adiya! Hold on!

1147
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,541
Recep, she's slipping!
Just a little big longer! Hold on!

1148
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,126
Come on!

1149
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,762
My elbow hurts.

1150
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,520
<i>135 kilos on both the left and the right.</i>

1151
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:19,149
<i>In theory, that wasn't a challenge</i>
<i>if we were working together.</i>

1152
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,443
<i>And yet, the longer we held them up,</i>

1153
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,195
<i>the more those 135 kilo pillars</i>

1154
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,699
started to feel like 245 kilo pillars.

1155
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,827
You're letting it hang too much.

1156
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,413
Recep, please don't.

1157
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,539
Almost there.

1158
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,874
They're turning red!

1159
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,627
Don't forget, Recep,
it's about mental strength too!

1160
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,174
They're so close to dropping!
You can't give up now!

1161
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,259
Please, Recep, just pull left.

1162
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,137
Okay, okay, okay!

1163
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,514
- Great, Adiya! Very good, just adjust.
- You've got this, you two!

1164
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,599
Keep holding!

1165
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,142
Mind the pillars. Don't let them wobble.

1166
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,270
If it wobbles too much,
it'll be harder to keep ahold of!

1167
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,397
Your opponents are struggling
just as much as you!

1168
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,441
I know it's hard, but don't give up!

1169
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,901
I've got it, you can rest again.

1170
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,320
You have to move less,
or it'll be much harder.

1171
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,447
Yasemin, please…

1172
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,656
Don't, Recep.

1173
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,868
No. Please, Recep, don't let go, okay?

1174
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:15,038
Please, Recep.
You can't let go yet. Recep, please.

1175
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,998
I can barely hold on!

1176
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,795
- Türkiye's about to let go!
- Come on, let go, let go, let go…

1177
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,631
Hold it, hold it, hold it! You're good!

1178
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,263
All right.
Let's go Enkh-Orgil! Stay strong!

1179
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,516
Wait a minute, Recep, I can't!
No, no, no, no!

1180
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,726
Wait a minute, Recep, I can't!
No, no, no, no!

1181
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,811
Recep, no!

1182
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,063
Recep, no!

1183
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,567
And Türkiye's out!

1184
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,693
- Keep going!
- Don't give up now!

1185
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,028
You just have to work together!

1186
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,406
- All right, Adiya!
- That's what I'm talking about!

1187
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,826
Bravo.

1188
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,412
Bravo, bravo. It's okay.

1189
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,832
I think he may have hurt his back.

1190
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,042
That's why.

1191
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,476
I've had two surgeries on this elbow.

1192
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,188
Right here, on my muscle, so…
so that's why…

1193
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,901
It's okay, you two. Well done.

1194
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,111
Good fight, guys.

1195
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,242
<i>I begged and begged Recep</i>

1196
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,535
<i>to hold on for me.</i>

1197
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,538
<i>But I know that, sometimes,</i>

1198
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,624
in this world,
for all the victories you earn,

1199
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,418
you still have to face defeat.

1200
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,880
I want to take a moment to thank Yasemin.

1201
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,798
You know, in that game,
we worked together,

1202
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,092
<i>standing back-to-back,</i>
<i>shoulder-to-shoulder,</i>

1203
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,760
<i>and fought as hard as we could.</i>

1204
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,597
<i>I know that neither of us</i>
<i>wanted to give up</i>

1205
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,975
<i>or let the other down,</i>
<i>but I didn't have a choice at the end.</i>

1206
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,436
<i>I just wanted to say I'm sorry.</i>

1207
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,155
We're really doing it!

1208
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,073
And now that we've managed
to make it this far,

1209
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,160
we just gotta endure. Right to the end.

1210
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,787
We had to get first, no matter what.

1211
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,456
No reason to give up now.

1212
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,834
Goodbye, Türkiye! You two look so solid!

1213
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,920
Hang in there! You're killing it!

1214
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,296
- Orgil.
- Yeah?

1215
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,923
I think we can actually win this thing!

1216
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,132
Yeah, we can.

1217
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,426
<i>Twenty minutes.</i>

1218
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,053
- All right!
- You guys are amazing!

1219
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,763
Just gotta keep pushing, okay?

1220
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,515
Just keep going and stay focused.

1221
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,559
- Seriously, you guys are unbelievable!
- Maintain that balance, okay?

1222
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,894
Why don't we try counting?

1223
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,187
All right.

1224
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,396
I'll count to a hundred.

1225
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,689
Sounds good.

1226
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,234
<i>We needed a distraction.</i>

1227
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,945
<i>So we decided that we'd swap off</i>
<i>counting to a hundred.</i>

1228
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,280
All right, it's your turn.

1229
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,365
Okay.

1230
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,075
One, two…

1231
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,494
- Fantastic work, seriously.
- Hang in there.

1232
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,955
- Keep going, all right?
- <i>Twenty-five minutes.</i>

1233
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,623
- Twenty-five minutes!
- Nice, nice, nice!

1234
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,749
- Let's go!
- Very good!

1235
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:05,833
Yes, yes, yes!

1236
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:10,255
I'm so proud, man. Seriously.

1237
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,719
<i>When I wasn't counting,</i>

1238
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,722
<i>I kept trying to think of nice things</i>
<i>and happy memories.</i>

1239
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,392
<i>Sometimes I imagined</i>
<i>I was walking through a field,</i>

1240
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:25,270
<i>other times I thought back</i>
<i>to horseback riding as a kid.</i>

1241
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,778
Pull on your left again.

1242
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,489
No, your left, your left.

1243
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,033
If you pull with your left,
I can fix my right grip.

1244
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,411
<i>Thirty-five minutes.</i>

1245
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,079
- Thirty-five minutes!
- Nice job!

1246
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,706
- Incredible.
- Keep it up!

1247
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,541
<i>About 30 minutes in,</i>

1248
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,084
<i>my right arm tendons started to hurt.</i>

1249
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,795
I have an old injury here, so…

1250
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,006
having it flare up again
was really horrible.

1251
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,091
- I can't hold on.
- What?

1252
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,634
Come on, come on, come on!

1253
00:59:56,718 --> 01:00:00,013
Hang in there. Come on, you two.
Don't give up now.

1254
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,890
- Maybe try left again?
- Okay.

1255
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,058
Steady!

1256
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:07,103
- Good job, guys! Stay strong, stay strong.
- You've got this!

1257
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,438
- Excellent teamwork!
- That's right, work together,

1258
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,564
share your strength!

1259
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,066
They keep adjusting their grip.

1260
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,485
How is she able to do that?

1261
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,614
- That's amazing.
- Seriously.

1262
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:18,990
I'm so impressed.

1263
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:22,702
From the beginning, I knew
Team Mongolia would be hard to beat.

1264
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:26,664
Watching them, you really got
a good sense of their capabilities.

1265
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,333
It was jaw-dropping to see.

1266
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,001
Yeah, they were worthy opponents.

1267
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:33,171
<i>They were very dangerous.</i>
<i>You couldn't underestimate them.</i>

1268
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,006
Seriously, what are they feeding them?

1269
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,350
<i>Forty minutes.</i>

1270
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:52,023
I'm losing my grip!

1271
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,567
You've got this, man!

1272
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,445
Hold on!
We're almost there! Don't give up!

1273
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,780
Keep pulling!

1274
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,202
- Come on! You can do it, guys.
- Good, great job!

1275
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,638
Way to go, you guys!
That was unbelievable!

1276
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,891
Seriously! You guys are built different!

1277
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,643
What you two did was incredible!

1278
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,103
You should be proud!

1279
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,480
- You fought incredibly hard.
- Hey.

1280
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:33,898
Come here.

1281
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:39,612
You guys were amazing out there!

1282
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,322
Yeah!

1283
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,866
Truly amazing, I've never seen
anything like it! Come here!

1284
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,494
- I'm so proud of you! You did so well!
- Let me give you a hug!

1285
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:49,038
- Come here. Bring it in.
- You were awesome!

1286
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,416
You were so strong, I'm so proud of you!

1287
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,670
I knew that Mongolia still had a chance
to win this competition.

1288
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,548
All we had to do was
keep our team's momentum going.

1289
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,432
Physical: Asia.

1290
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:12,979
<i>Contestants, Game Three</i>
<i>of the Team Rep Match will begin shortly.</i>

1291
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,529
Wow.

1292
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,994
- What's this? These are the ropes?
- Wow.

1293
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,580
Are those rings?

1294
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,040
<i>I saw four ropes.</i>

1295
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,210
<i>I wasn't sure why they would need four.</i>

1296
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,963
Wait, how do you use the longer ones?

1297
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,632
<i>They said this was a hanging exercise,</i>

1298
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,342
but I couldn't figure out the position.

1299
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,928
So right now I'm guessing…

1300
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,639
the lighter you are,
the better your chances?

1301
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,142
<i>Because of the safety pin issue,</i>

1302
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,686
we didn't know where we ranked
in the second game.

1303
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,731
So the best thing we could do
was assume the worst-case scenario,

1304
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,441
<i>and fight to get first place.</i>

1305
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,693
<i>That was all I could really think about.</i>

1306
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,069
You good, Anıl?

1307
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,324
<i>Japan had one win,</i>
<i>but no score for Game Two.</i>

1308
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,910
We got second once,
but we had to aim higher.

1309
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,120
<i>It'd be really difficult,</i>
<i>but we'd do our best.</i>

1310
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,123
It's calling me.

1311
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,208
I know.

1312
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,877
Seriously, you've got this one.

1313
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,421
You're our aerial expert.

1314
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:21,631
<i>As an acrobat,</i>

1315
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:24,175
it's practically my job
to hang on ropes all day.

1316
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:26,719
It's my second home at this point.

1317
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,181
So I hope I get the chance to maybe
take a break and zone out up there.

1318
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,809
Physical: Asia.

1319
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,895
<i>Team Rep Match, Game Three:</i>

1320
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,439
<i>Last One Hanging Match.</i>

1321
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,067
<i>Last One Hanging Match</i>

1322
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,570
<i>is a game in which players</i>
<i>suspend themselves via hanging ropes.</i>

1323
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,865
<i>To do so, they will hold</i>
<i>two of the rings with their hands,</i>

1324
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:51,577
<i>while using the other two rings</i>
<i>as supportive footholds.</i>

1325
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,454
You gotta use both your hands and feet

1326
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:56,165
<i>After a certain amount of time has passed,</i>

1327
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,960
<i>they will be asked</i>
<i>to change their positions.</i>

1328
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,754
<i>Holding one ring with two hands</i>

1329
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,632
<i>or hooking one ring around both feet</i>

1330
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,050
<i>is not allowed.</i>

1331
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,846
- So you just do this right?
- Yeah.

1332
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,102
<i>Those selected</i>
<i>for the Last One Hanging Match,</i>

1333
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,728
<i>please enter the arena.</i>

1334
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,439
<i>- The game will begin momentarily.</i>
- Bravo!

1335
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,649
Let's go!

1336
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,822
<i>For this game of the Team Rep Match,</i>

1337
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,949
<i>the following players have been chosen:</i>

1338
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,534
Team Türkiye, Anıl Berk Baki.

1339
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:32,869
NATIONAL TEAM SAILOR

1340
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,120
Come on, Anıl.

1341
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,872
- Let's go, Anıl!
- You can win this!

1342
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,915
<i>Even though I'm strong,</i>

1343
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,459
<i>and have really good grip strength</i>
<i>as a wrestler,</i>

1344
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,961
Anıl's training as a sailor

1345
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,463
means his grip strength
is ten times my own.

1346
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,591
<i>So, when we were choosing team reps,</i>

1347
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:50,136
<i>I thought Anıl had the best overall</i>
<i>skill set for this particular game.</i>

1348
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,139
<i>Team Japan, Nonoka Ozaki.</i>

1349
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,099
- All right!
- You've got this!

1350
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,475
NATIONAL TEAM WRESTLER

1351
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,352
- Let's go, Nonoka!
- Get it, get it!

1352
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,355
Body weight was going to be
a considerable factor here.

1353
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,899
And since I'm lighter than the two men,

1354
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,943
<i>I figured I'd have an advantage</i>
<i>if I was in the hanging challenge.</i>

1355
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:08,571
<i>I'd have less to hold,</i>
<i>so I'd just wait it out.</i>

1356
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:11,490
<i>Team Mongolia, Lkhagva-Ochir Erdene-Ochir.</i>

1357
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,867
CIRCUS ARTIST

1358
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,702
- That's our guy! Let's go!
- All right!

1359
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,454
Show them why you're the best!

1360
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:21,167
The whole point of the game was to see
who could last the longest in the air.

1361
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,462
<i>It had to be Ochir.</i>
<i>Honestly, we'd be stupid not to pick him.</i>

1362
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,757
<i>Aerial stunts are his specialty.</i>

1363
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,677
<i>With him competing,</i>
<i>it should be an easy victory.</i>

1364
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:33,971
<i>Now then,</i>

1365
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:37,350
<i>the game will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

1366
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:41,228
<i>The second game ended up having a lot of</i>

1367
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,022
<i>technical challenges,</i>

1368
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,608
<i>so none of us knew</i>
<i>how well we were doing overall.</i>

1369
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,945
<i>But even if we had won,</i>
<i>we'd still only have four points.</i>

1370
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,821
<i>I knew I could win this,</i>

1371
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:52,990
<i>so that was my goal. Easy-peasy.</i>

1372
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,409
<i>The only way I'd come down,</i>

1373
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:58,204
<i>was if I passed out or passed away.</i>

1374
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,082
<i>There's no way I'm quitting. Not a chance.</i>

1375
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,962
<i>For the sake of my team,</i>
<i>I was determined to keep us in first.</i>

1376
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,173
Just maintain your balance, okay?

1377
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:10,257
<i>Ready…</i>

1378
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:15,346
That's it, Nonoka. Nice job.

1379
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,727
That's it, come on. Fall.

1380
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,939
<i>Right away, I lost my balance.</i>

1381
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:26,732
<i>And that shook me a bit.</i>

1382
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,150
Hey, Anıl,

1383
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,945
the other two wrapped their arms
around the longer ropes.

1384
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:34,365
<i>So I had to quickly change up my strategy.</i>

1385
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,242
They're all crossing their ankles.

1386
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,285
There you go, just like that.

1387
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,746
You just need to focus.

1388
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,375
Nice job adjusting.
You look more balanced.

1389
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:46,919
Nice, Nonoka.

1390
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,379
You have the best form.

1391
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:50,840
Yeah, you look great!

1392
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:52,717
Even better than Mongolia.

1393
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:56,053
<i>Team Mongolia's guy is a literal acrobat,</i>

1394
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:59,515
<i>so I figured he'd be good at hanging</i>
<i>from things and dealing with ropes.</i>

1395
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,644
<i>We were gonna be up there for a while,</i>
<i>so why not copy him?</i>

1396
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,438
<i>It'd probably be super helpful.</i>

1397
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,774
Just try to copy Mongolia if you can.

1398
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,901
Lean to your left.

1399
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,529
Yeah, just take a look at his posture.

1400
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,780
I know, it's crazy.

1401
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:15,948
Okay, okay, okay.

1402
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,033
Nice.

1403
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:20,077
I think they're telling
the other two to copy him.

1404
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,581
Mongolia looks so relaxed up there.

1405
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:25,541
He's really strong, as expected.

1406
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,002
<i>Is he for real?</i>

1407
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,797
The other two teams started to copy me.

1408
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:35,301
I won't lie,
it was a really big confidence boost

1409
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,054
<i>to know that I was kind of the one</i>
<i>to follow up there.</i>

1410
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,142
<i>Five minutes.</i>

1411
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,102
- Nice!
- All right.

1412
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,270
Nice!

1413
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:47,480
Only five minutes?

1414
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,689
- It felt like 15.
- Keep it up!

1415
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,024
Nice job, Anıl.

1416
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,069
Türkiye hasn't moved at all.

1417
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,073
And from the looks of it,

1418
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,741
I think Japan's doing well too.

1419
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,826
- All right!
- Good.

1420
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,164
Man, Team Mongolia's balance is insane.

1421
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,708
- He's something else.
- He hasn't flinched.

1422
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,294
From what I see,
you have the best posture.

1423
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:12,338
Yeah, take a look around if you can.

1424
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,548
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

1425
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,468
- Bravo!
- Ten minutes!

1426
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,220
- Bravo, bravo!
- You're killing it.

1427
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,644
Hang in there. You've got this.

1428
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,814
Are her legs locked in?
I don't think they are.

1429
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,650
- I think you're right.
- She's looking a little unstable.

1430
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,902
Japan doesn't look too good.

1431
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,615
Wait, don't unlock yet.

1432
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:42,535
Just hold on!

1433
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,704
Just stay calm. You've got this.

1434
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,123
Nice.

1435
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,084
That's it, power through.

1436
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,168
Nice, nice!

1437
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:54,046
<i>It was fine at first,</i>
<i>but after a little bit,</i>

1438
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,214
<i>my thighs started to hurt.</i>

1439
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:58,175
<i>My muscles just got tighter and tighter.</i>

1440
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:02,054
<i>In trying to maintain my balance,</i>
<i>I'd been using a lot of my leg strength.</i>

1441
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:04,223
We just need Japan to fall.

1442
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,142
Come on, Japan. Please just fall.

1443
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,644
<i>Nineteen minutes.</i>

1444
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:13,941
<i>In one minute, all contestants</i>
<i>must release one of their hands.</i>

1445
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:16,819
You'll need to let go
of one of your hands in a moment!

1446
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:20,447
Give your arms a rest,
you'll have to drop one soon.

1447
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,826
<i>One hand off.</i>

1448
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,871
Nice.

1449
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,247
Good.

1450
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,456
Nice and easy.

1451
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,917
She's holding her posture.

1452
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:35,588
I think this position
is more comfortable for her.

1453
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,464
Good stability.

1454
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,926
- Really, really good.
- Great job.

1455
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,221
Do you think he sleeps like that?

1456
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,141
I mean, if anyone could, it'd be him.

1457
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:49,560
He looks so relaxed. It's crazy.

1458
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:52,813
You're killing it. Go, Ochir.

1459
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:59,320
<i>I was shocked looking at him.</i>

1460
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,406
<i>Mongolia didn't seem</i>
<i>to be struggling at all.</i>

1461
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:06,076
But I had to remind myself
why we'd flown 11 hours to be here,

1462
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,037
why we were pushing ourselves
in the first place.

1463
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:10,831
<i>We had to prove ourselves.</i>
<i>I had to hold on.</i>

1464
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:12,875
You're doing great, Anıl.

1465
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:16,420
Nice job.

1466
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:17,504
Nice.

1467
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:18,964
<i>Thirty-nine minutes.</i>

1468
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,883
<i>At this point in the game,</i>

1469
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:23,177
<i>everyone must unlock their feet.</i>

1470
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,387
He's gonna have to move in a second.

1471
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,555
One minute to go.

1472
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,891
Things are about to get interesting.

1473
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:31,185
Yeah, there's gonna be
a whole lot more shaking.

1474
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:35,147
The real challenge is
about to start, so brace yourself.

1475
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,483
The heavier they are,
the more unstable they'll be.

1476
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,984
So you've got this!

1477
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:44,949
<i>Unlock.</i>

1478
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,244
All right, unlock!

1479
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:49,745
And it begins…

1480
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:51,956
- Slowly.
- Easy now.

1481
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,123
Be careful.

1482
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,380
Uh-oh. Careful, careful.

1483
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:02,049
- Looks like Türkiye might be struggling.
- They're really shaky.

1484
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,969
Team Japan's really unstable.

1485
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,263
Anıl, Team Japan's flailing around a lot.

1486
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:08,639
She looks unbalanced.

1487
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:11,558
She's wobbling back and fourth
and back and fourth up there.

1488
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,310
Türkiye's struggling.

1489
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:16,146
Come on, Türkiye. Please, please fall.

1490
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,651
Keep hanging on. Just a little longer.

1491
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:23,529
Japan's unraveling. Don't give up yet.

1492
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,572
Don't let your legs drift!

1493
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,408
Don't split like that.
