00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,595
<i>Stand by.</i>

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,265
<i>Ready.</i>

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,855
Yes!

5
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,398
Get it, get it!

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,482
Let's go!

7
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,192
Yes!

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,695
- Get it, get it!
- Let's go!

9
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,905
Get it, get it!

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,872
Check it out!

11
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,248
James grabbed it first!

12
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,834
- Get it, get it!
- Let's go!

13
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,002
Let's go, guys!

14
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,337
The second I had the ball
in my hands, I thought,

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,339
"Okay, now we can win this!"

16
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,633
Manny, get the ball! Get the ball!

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,302
Stay tight!

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,304
I didn't expect them to be that fast,

19
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,764
so it really threw me off-guard.

20
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:59,559
- Go Manny! Yes, Manny!
- Get him, Manny!

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,522
Still, we couldn't let anything stop us.

22
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:08,985
One way or another, we had to steal
the ball for ourselves and make a goal.

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,779
Go get 'em, P'Bon!

24
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,161
I mean, he's not budging at all, is he?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,753
Obviously, I went after
the big guy first, 'cause without him,

26
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,671
Pacquiao was on his own.

27
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,759
It's like a completely different game--
Yes! Run! Yes!

28
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,139
Keep him off, Manny!
Get the ball, get the ball!

29
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,975
Get it, Manny! Get it, Manny!

30
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,065
Get the ball!

31
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,651
Ah!

32
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,028
- Go, go! Hurry, hurry!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

33
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,824
Get it, get it, get it! Ray, push him!

34
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,833
Take him down!

35
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,753
<i>All I had to do was get that</i>
<i>ball to the other side of the arena.</i>

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,844
Manny, get it! Ray, push him! Push him!

37
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,017
- Hurry, hurry! Come on! Get the ball!
- Almost.

38
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,686
Pick it up! Pick it up, pick it up!

39
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,453
Push him!

40
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,104
<i>The match has ended.</i>

41
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,024
<i>I mean, we lost,</i>

42
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,067
<i>but that wasn't really the worst part.</i>

43
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,653
<i>No, the worst part was how fast they were.</i>

44
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,199
<i>They just threw it straight to our side</i>
<i>of the pit, picked it up, and scored.</i>

45
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,951
James is just strong.

46
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,870
Yeah!

47
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,498
Look at him go! I told you
to keep an eye on that one, didn't I?

48
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,793
He walks better than me too.

49
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,087
With that hair toss and everything!

50
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,841
- That was unexpected!
- You usually don't wanna throw it, right?

51
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,594
Yeah. But this time,
it was the right call.

52
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,972
The person that stood out the most
to me in the elimination games was James.

53
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,142
People would assume his flamboyant nature
means he couldn't turn it on,

54
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,936
and he delivered.

55
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,064
<i>He just really persevered</i>
<i>through his match,</i>

56
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,358
<i>threw the ball out,</i>
<i>got his teammate the win.</i>

57
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,193
Having a personality doesn't mean

58
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,569
you still can't be tough

59
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,571
and a serious athlete.

60
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,157
<i>Death Match: Round Two.</i>

61
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,744
<i>The winner of round two is Thailand.</i>

62
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,665
Happy!

63
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,667
JAMES RUSAMEEKAE
FORMER VOLLEYBALL PLAYER

64
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,128
Look, if it was a boxing match,
I would've been KO'd almost immediately.

65
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,590
But getting to prove myself
in there and win? That was a huge honor.

66
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,468
Like I said, it's one of those
once-in-a-lifetime moments.

67
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,304
Pacquiao's a legend,
but we can hold our own against him.

68
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,556
Uh… And that means something.

69
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,602
I mean, if we can win this round,
we can win the whole thing.

70
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,899
<i>I mean obviously… I didn't wanna lose.</i>

71
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,026
I was really disappointed.

72
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:38,987
It was a shame.

73
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,199
But mostly, I was worried.
Since the score was one-to-one,

74
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,828
Team Philippines
absolutely had to win this third match.

75
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,212
<i>Death Match. Round three.</i>

76
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,013
<i>Rugby. He's tough.</i>

77
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,433
- Holy moly!
- Yeah!

78
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,600
ANUCHA YOSPANYA
NATIONAL TEAM WRESTLER

79
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,520
I don't think I'd wanna face
a wrestler in a Death Match.

80
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,980
Ooh, wrestling.

81
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,606
This is gonna be a crazy match.

82
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,275
- Wrestling versus rugby.
- Yeah.

83
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,027
So strong!

84
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,946
- Yeah, you've got this!
- Keep it up!

85
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,657
Let's go, bro. First contact, let's go.

86
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,535
<i>He's a SEA Games champion.</i>

87
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,787
<i>His discipline is wrestling.</i>

88
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,331
<i>But…</i>

89
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,251
the ball-stealing game
is essentially rugby, nearly.

90
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,377
<i>So</i>

91
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:40,798
<i>my first thought was,</i>
<i>"I need to get to this ball first."</i>

92
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,508
<i>He's a rugby player.</i>

93
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,094
<i>Of course he was gonna be faster than me.</i>

94
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,389
But I wasn't worried. I knew I could use
my wrestling skills to stop him.

95
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,975
<i>Stand by.</i>

96
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,602
<i>Ready.</i>

97
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:09,285
PHYSICAL: ASIA

98
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,749
5. MYSTERIOUS VILLAGE

99
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,002
<i>Stand by.</i>

100
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,629
<i>Ready.</i>

101
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,883
Go on! Go! Get it!

102
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,344
Go on! Go! Get it!

103
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,263
- Wow!
- Wow! Whoa.

104
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,226
Got it.

105
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,186
<i>I get there first.</i>

106
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,689
<i>Within one second,</i>
<i>I can feel he's on me as well.</i>

107
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,400
<i>He has a big body,</i>

108
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,277
<i>really strong arms, really strong core…</i>

109
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,614
You don't wanna be
in that position, right? For wrestling?

110
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,157
'Cause it's more risky.

111
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,367
You've got this!

112
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,202
- You can do it!
- Yeah! This is your specialty!

113
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,372
<i>I was ready to put</i>
<i>my wrestling skills to good use.</i>

114
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,791
Get an angle on him, flip him!

115
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,547
Throw him! Throw him!

116
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,226
Look at that throw! He's the real deal.

117
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,026
- That's it!
- Yeah!

118
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,612
Some wild shit, eh?

119
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,281
That's good technique.

120
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,117
He's starting to use his wrestling move,

121
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,080
<i>and I'm just holding as tight as I can.</i>

122
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,750
Keep it! Lay low!

123
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,671
This is one intense match, isn't it?

124
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,175
Don't turn into him! Don't turn into him!

125
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,012
Thirty seconds, thirty seconds!

126
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,307
Look, his arm's in!

127
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,475
Oh!

128
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,894
Pull it out! Use both hands, come on.

129
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,022
- Hang tight, Justin!
- Hold it!

130
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,524
Hold, hold, hold! Yes!

131
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,819
<i>He was trying to free the ball,</i>
<i>but I just would not let go.</i>

132
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,905
Ten seconds! Ten seconds! Ten seconds!

133
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,784
Most people would've let go,
but his grip strength is insane.

134
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,495
Hold it! Stay tight!

135
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,748
Wear him down, man! You can do it!

136
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,126
Two, one!

137
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,879
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

138
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,673
Breathe, brother!
Catch your breath, come on!

139
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,175
Hey, Anucha!

140
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,551
You're in the home stretch here.

141
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,095
All you gotta do is keep him
near his own goal.

142
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,972
<i>Since neither team scored,</i>

143
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,517
<i>we will now enter our tiebreaker match.</i>

144
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,394
- Speed kills, brother, speed.
- You've got speed, bro.

145
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,730
Lift him up and keep him on his side.

146
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,566
<i>The match time is one minute.</i>

147
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,610
<i>Ready.</i>

148
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,831
<i>The whistle blows,</i>
<i>I sprint and dive at the ball to make sure</i>

149
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:05,586
<i>that my momentum takes me into</i>
<i>their territory a lot more, which it did.</i>

150
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,006
- Wow!
- He got it again.

151
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,552
Hey, good dive, good dive.

152
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,222
Here it comes!

153
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,308
<i>If I wanted to move him,</i>
<i>I had to try and suplex him right there.</i>

154
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,728
<i>He was trying to throw me.</i>

155
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,064
If he lifts him high enough,
he's done for.

156
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,983
Lean forward, don't let him suplex!

157
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,610
<i>All my strength to just keep my hips down</i>

158
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,613
<i>and to make sure</i>
<i>that he couldn't suplex me.</i>

159
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,951
<i>Every time I went to try</i>
<i>and lift him back,</i>

160
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,287
<i>he'd pull himself right back down</i>
<i>into the water.</i>

161
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,665
- Stay tight! Thirty seconds!
- Thirty seconds!

162
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,753
Grab his waist, man.
Flip him around in one go.

163
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,881
<i>It was now or never, I had to suplex him.</i>

164
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,261
<i>He's pulling and pulling,</i>

165
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,556
<i>but I have to hold on</i>
<i>for the last seconds.</i>

166
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,308
- Ten seconds, bro! Ten seconds!
- Let's go!

167
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,726
Use your whole body!

168
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,477
Ten! Nine!

169
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,438
Eight! Seven!

170
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,982
Six! Five!

171
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,900
Four! Three!

172
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,200
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

173
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,957
<i>The winner of Round Three</i>
<i>is the Philippines.</i>

174
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,085
Well done, Philippines.

175
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,838
- Well done, boys.
- Good effort, boys. Good effort.

176
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,048
Good job, brother.

177
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,342
Great effing job.

178
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,637
Bro… Beautiful. Beautiful, brother.

179
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,556
It was… That was amazing, bro. That was…

180
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,685
- All right!
- You were awesome out there!

181
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,811
I'm sorry!

182
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,313
You did really well, man.

183
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,275
I mean… I kept trying
to lift him over, but…

184
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,452
Two points to Philippines.

185
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,746
If the Philippines win the next one,
they won.

186
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,039
Good job!

187
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,708
Okay, ladies. You're up.

188
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,211
- Ploy?
- You ready? Let's do this, Ploy!

189
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,172
- Let's show 'em what we're made of.
- That's right!

190
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,966
Hey, shut it down right here.
Speed and hustle, come on.

191
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,511
Don't let them get any breakaways.
Always for the ball.

192
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,304
If she's the one
who gets the ball, help her.

193
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,389
Uh-oh.

194
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,351
Please, go, go get this.
Go get this, okay?

195
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,566
<i>I just kept praying that</i>
<i>we'd win the next round</i>

196
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,776
<i>and get to stay.</i>

197
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,237
As for Lara and Robyn,
since they were going in,

198
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,948
our team gave them encouragement.

199
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,242
We all said,
"Don't give up, just do your best."

200
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:45,162
<i>Whether it's this round or</i>
<i>the next, one of us is about to go home.</i>

201
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,582
We can't lose.
We have to win this one, no matter what.

202
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,751
Physical: Asia.

203
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,296
<i>Death Match: Round Four.</i>

204
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,924
<i>Contestants, please enter the arena.</i>

205
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,843
It's an all-female match.

206
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,595
Ooh, the girls are gonna be spicy.

207
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,348
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

208
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,518
<i>I knew that if we lost this game,</i>
<i>Thailand would go home.</i>

209
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,813
<i>I refuse to be a burden to my teammates.</i>

210
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,606
I had to survive.

211
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,359
<i>I waited for this, and I can get them.</i>

212
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,903
<i>We're ready to fight,</i>
<i>and we're ready to show</i>

213
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,363
everyone else what we're made of.

214
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,781
Let's go!

215
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,949
<i>Stand by.</i>

216
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,163
<i>Ready.</i>

217
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,185
- Ah, she's a runner, so it's hers to take.
- Yeah, she's fast.

218
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,649
- Pass it, pass it!
- Pass, pass, pass!

219
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,818
<i>The moment I grabbed the ball,</i>

220
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,322
<i>I just felt two bodies come over me.</i>

221
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,824
<i>Our plan is for Robyn to get the ball,</i>

222
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,119
<i>then throw it to me,</i>
<i>but she wasn't able to throw the ball.</i>

223
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,415
That's why I just walked
towards the water and helped Robyn.

224
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,709
Lara, try to pry her off!

225
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,547
- Oh my God, she's strong.
- Go, go!

226
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,383
Team Philippines' Crossfitter is crazy!

227
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,889
<i>When she grabbed me from behind,</i>

228
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,267
<i>the first thought I had was,</i>
<i>"She's gonna try and flip me over."</i>

229
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,853
<i>And I was determined</i>
<i>to prevent that from happening.</i>

230
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,442
All right, come on, Ploy!
Get the ball out!

231
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,861
<i>Apply pressure, and try to steal.</i>

232
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,490
<i>And then just rinse and repeat.</i>

233
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,034
Good, good, good!

234
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,372
Robyn, stay tight,
she's trying to squeeze her hands in.

235
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,168
Keep hold, grip for dear life!

236
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,212
Come on, grip onto that ball!

237
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,889
That first girl, she's holding good.

238
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,060
Whoever's holding onto the ball
right now has got an iron grip.

239
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,399
<i>If I let go of the ball,</i>
<i>I would have to fight,</i>

240
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,027
<i>because again, I don't have a background</i>
<i>in fighting or combat.</i>

241
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,989
<i>So my only option</i>
<i>was to hold on to the ball</i>

242
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,367
and-and never let go,
no matter-no matter what.

243
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,328
Jar! Try pulling it from the other side!

244
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,747
I kept trying to squeeze my hand in.

245
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,421
Stay tight, Robyn.

246
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,466
Ploy!

247
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,719
Hold it, Robyn! Hold it!

248
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,598
You can do it!

249
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,608
Her hand's slipping.
I think they're gonna steal it!

250
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,276
Thirty seconds!

251
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,031
Robyn, control your breathing
from the bottom.

252
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,867
That's it! Scoop it out like that!

253
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,620
Ah!

254
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,996
Oh, I think she's losing it!

255
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,998
Lara!
Don't let her pull it out from under!

256
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,375
- Look!
- What?

257
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,044
She's pushing the ball back.

258
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,881
<i>If ever someone wanted to pull the ball,</i>

259
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,925
<i>they cannot,</i>
<i>because I'm pushing against it.</i>

260
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,593
Hold it, just hold it!

261
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,386
Ten seconds!

262
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434
Just like that!
Just like that! Just like that!

263
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,020
Five seconds, girls.
Five seconds. Stay tight!

264
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,146
Hold it down.

265
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,525
Three. Two. One.

266
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,235
Okay, time's up.

267
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,529
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

268
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,697
Good fight, good fight.

269
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,324
Good job, girls!

270
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,039
One more, one more.

271
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,625
Yo, yo, guys!

272
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,168
We make first contact with the ball.

273
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,420
You make first contact
and it's-it's a game of inches.

274
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,090
Look, make sure
that you push the ball over there.

275
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,425
Just like you did.
You already passed halfway point.

276
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,303
But this time it's only 60 seconds.
Come on, just one more like that.

277
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,391
Don't give up.
It's your last chance to come back.

278
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,103
Honestly, I think the two
of you can lift them up no problem, but…

279
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,187
What do you think?

280
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,271
Can you get to it first?

281
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,732
No, that's impossible. There's no way.

282
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,695
But we'll be okay
if we hold our ground and push back.

283
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,948
Our strategy was to take the ball

284
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,784
from whoever gets it first,
and then push towards our opponent.

285
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,161
That way, they wouldn't be able to win.

286
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,123
<i>We will now enter our tiebreaker match.</i>

287
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,791
<i>Stand by.</i>

288
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,711
It all comes down
to this last minute, huh?

289
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,342
<i>Ready.</i>

290
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,475
Great dive.

291
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,106
Lara, help! Help!

292
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,275
Push, push! Nice, Ploy!

293
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,069
Jar, get her out of there!

294
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,330
<i>Since she made it to our side,</i>

295
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,668
<i>we had to find a way to push them back</i>
<i>as far as we could, as fast as we could.</i>

296
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,212
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yes, true. Yes, true!

297
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,089
- Yes, pull foot! Pull foot!
- Yes, continue, continue!

298
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,967
That move with the leg was smart,
turning her around.

299
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,136
<i>I was shocked.</i>

300
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,680
<i>They shifted their game plan.</i>

301
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,975
<i>Instead of pulling the ball,</i>
<i>they pulled Robyn's leg.</i>

302
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,106
Lara, push them over!

303
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,525
Pull back! Pull back!

304
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,944
Okay! Thirty seconds!

305
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,406
<i>I had so much adrenaline in that moment.</i>

306
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,950
I knew I could do it.

307
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,995
You've got this, come on!

308
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081
- Come on, Lara!
- Get to the other side! Lara, go!

309
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,000
Robyn, crawl! Robyn, crawl!

310
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,336
Ten, nine…

311
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,213
It's Thailand's game.

312
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,048
You're up.

313
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,174
Pull it out!

314
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,551
Pull it out!

315
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,554
Push! Good job, Ploy!

316
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,271
<i>All of the audience</i>
<i>were counting ten seconds.</i>

317
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,650
<i>and I was like, "Oh shit,</i>
<i>I think we're going to lose."</i>

318
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,528
<i>And at six seconds, I checked the timer.</i>

319
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,865
<i>I started pulling hard.</i>

320
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,286
There she goes. Whoa, there she goes!

321
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,371
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

322
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,545
Oh, no! No, no!

323
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,139
Pull!

324
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,932
Pull!

325
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,060
Keep pulling!

326
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,645
Go! Go!

327
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,823
Yeah, look at that! That's crazy!

328
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,116
Who won?

329
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,326
- The Philippines won, yeah?
- Wow, Lara!

330
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,957
<i>It was a clutch that won us the game.</i>

331
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,973
Yes! Yes!

332
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,017
- F****** down to three seconds!
- Yes!

333
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,101
Yes!

334
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,395
Shoot, Philippines won.

335
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,068
<i>It all happened so fast,</i>
<i>in the blink of an eye.</i>

336
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,780
Well done, well done.

337
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,545
Physical: Asia.

338
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,005
<i>Death Match.</i>

339
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,424
<i>The surviving country is</i>

340
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,885
<i>the Philippines.</i>

341
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,603
Good job, guys.

342
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,356
Thank you for your hard work.

343
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,107
Bro.

344
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,904
<i>I'm proud of my whole team.</i>

345
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,574
Coming from such a disaster
of a challenge in shipwreck

346
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,952
<i>to performing like that under pressure.</i>

347
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,955
And everyone just worked so hard, so…

348
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,249
Super proud of our team
for that performance.

349
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,335
Before this challenge,
we had a team meeting.

350
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,005
And we had a long discussion
about what we needed to do to reach

351
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,675
that next challenge
and advance to the next level.

352
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,719
<i>And… I'm proud to say that they delivered.</i>

353
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,223
<i>I think winning today gave everyone</i>
<i>a huge confidence boost.</i>

354
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,100
And that'll keep us pushing forward.

355
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,729
<i>This means</i>

356
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,941
<i>the first country to be eliminated</i>
<i>from </i>Physical: Asia

357
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,818
<i>is Thailand.</i>

358
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,199
<i>I was really devastated, because</i>
<i>I knew how much this meant to all of us.</i>

359
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,826
One, two, three, Thailand!

360
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,994
Let's go!

361
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,746
All right! We've got this! Thailand!

362
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,831
Let's go!

363
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:35,460
It really sucks. Not being able
to continue here is disappointing.

364
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,881
Especially because despite our
best efforts, we couldn't keep up, and…

365
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,176
That's just something we have to accept.

366
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,138
I'm sure some of you are disappointed

367
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,057
to see us eliminated
so early in the competition.

368
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,352
<i>I just hope that the people of Thailand</i>

369
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,730
<i>know we fought for them</i>
<i>as hard as we could.</i>

370
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,494
<i>It's a pity that we have to go home.</i>

371
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,457
So let me say,
for all the Thai people cheering us on…

372
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,419
I'm really sorry we couldn't win
this competition for you.

373
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,548
But we came here in hopes
of sharing our beautiful culture.

374
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,552
<i>And we did so with</i>
<i>our heads held high and proud.</i>

375
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,929
<i>Despite all the challenges,</i>
<i>we stood united as a team</i>

376
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,474
<i>and fought hard on our country's behalf.</i>

377
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:34,561
I'm proud of Thailand, and I'm proud
to be Thai. And I hope you feel the same.

378
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,064
Lead the way.

379
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,245
Physical: Asia.

380
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,539
<i>The second Death Match is about to begin.</i>

381
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,167
<i>Japan vs. Indonesia.</i>

382
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,961
<i>The team who is defeated</i>
<i>will be eliminated.</i>

383
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,591
<i>I kept thinking,</i>
<i>how do we get Japan to the next round?</i>

384
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,470
<i>That was the only thing on my mind</i>
<i>as I walked in.</i>

385
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,139
<i>It was time to go all-out.</i>

386
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,936
<i>We'd been given one last chance,</i>
<i>and we weren't gonna let it go to waste.</i>

387
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,943
Let's do this, guys.

388
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,111
Let's go!

389
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,114
- Go, Japan.
- You can do it!

390
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,158
Whoo!

391
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,827
At the start of this competition,

392
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,746
I said that Japan was
a nation of warriors.

393
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,707
And today
those warriors will take you down.

394
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,377
He said they're gonna take 'em down.

395
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,088
Basically he said Indonesia
better book their tickets home.

396
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,550
We wanted to thank you
for this opportunity.

397
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,095
Today, we'll prove to everyone
that we're the best.

398
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,849
<i>Contestants, please take a moment</i>
<i>to select your teammates</i>

399
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,143
<i>for each of the five rounds.</i>

400
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,728
I wonder who they're gonna send out first.

401
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,063
What do you reckon?

402
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,441
Uh, the UFC.

403
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,109
UFC or judo.

404
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,653
<i>If we wanted to win</i>
<i>as quickly as possible,</i>

405
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,405
<i>we needed those first three wins.</i>

406
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,950
<i>And that meant dedicating ourselves</i>
<i>to a more offensive strategy.</i>

407
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,911
So for the first round,
we sent in Soichi Hashimoto.

408
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,079
SOICHI HASHIMOTO
NATIONAL TEAM JUDOKA

409
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,874
<i>As a Judo Champion, he has the best</i>
<i>of both strength and skill.</i>

410
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,793
I wanna get in there
and start us off on a high note.

411
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,587
That way, we can ride the momentum.

412
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,047
- We can't go back to Japan this early.
- No, we can't.

413
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,091
- All right, let's bring it in.
- Okay.

414
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,177
- One, two, three!
- Go, Japan!

415
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,180
Okay!

416
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,893
All we need to do is stick
to the plan, okay?

417
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,563
Our focus should be on scoring.
And we should avoid fighting.

418
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,399
Over half of
their team does combat sports.

419
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,276
So they'd have the advantage there.

420
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,113
Okay. This is it.
This is our last chance, guys.

421
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,658
Just remember why we're here.
We didn't come here for ourselves,

422
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,327
we came here for Indonesia.

423
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,162
One, two, three.

424
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,413
We can do it!

425
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,332
Let's go!

426
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,337
<i>Death Match: Round One.</i>

427
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,798
Judo, judo!

428
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,301
- Go Soichi!
- Let's go!

429
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,385
Let's go!

430
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,389
Hey. Look. Hashimoto's gonna use
his Judo skills.

431
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,892
He's the Olympic gold medalist, right?

432
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,811
He got bronze, but he's a world champion.

433
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,149
Who is it? Who?

434
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,987
Show them, Glenn.

435
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,865
GLENN VICTOR
FORMER NATIONAL TEAM SWIMMER

436
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,451
- It's the swimmer.
- Oh, it's him.

437
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,953
Go, Glenn. You've got this.

438
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,872
<i>If I just believe I can win, I will win.</i>

439
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,376
I mean, it's not a judo match.
We're fighting over a ball, right?

440
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,127
<i>So what if he's better at combat?</i>

441
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,129
<i>This was a completely different game.</i>

442
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,465
<i>All I had to do was protect the ball.</i>

443
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,218
It's hard to make a call with the water.

444
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,553
If they were in a cage,

445
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,013
the grapplers would have the advantage.

446
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,223
Yeah, right now,

447
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,183
- there's no telling how this will go.
- We'll see.

448
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,811
<i>Stand by.</i>

449
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,981
<i>He was going down.</i>

450
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,150
<i>No matter who I was up against,</i>
<i>I was ready.</i>

451
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:11,945
<i>Ready.</i>

452
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,633
Wow, he's fast.

453
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,969
All right, Glenn,
hang in there! Let's go, Glenn!

454
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,888
- Just hold on for now! Glenn!
- Just take it slow, okay?

455
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,517
Wow.

456
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,313
<i>From the very start, I had one goal:</i>

457
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,315
<i>To get the ball and hold it hostage.</i>

458
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,943
I knew that if I threw the ball,
then I'd have to wrestle him for it.

459
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,072
And he's a national team fighter,
so I'd obviously lose.

460
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,949
Get him on his back! On his back!

461
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,285
You're doing great, just pin him down.

462
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,204
- That's it! That's it!
- Position yourself like a turtle!

463
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,124
He's gonna have a really tough time
getting out of that position.

464
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,418
Soichi! Focus on his wrists!

465
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,337
If he lets go, he's done.

466
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,340
Glenn, turtle!
Position yourself like a turtle!

467
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,718
Glenn, turtle! Yeah!

468
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,094
Glenn, turtle! Yeah!

469
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,889
- Yes!
- Okay! Now push forward!

470
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,684
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

471
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,061
- Turn your back!
- Okay! Now push forward!

472
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,229
He's holding up pretty well down there.

473
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,814
He's tenacious.

474
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,358
There's still time!

475
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,442
Don't panic!

476
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,110
You've still got two minutes!

477
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,114
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Nice job!

478
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,367
- Grab it, there's your opening!
- Strong grip!

479
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,202
Nice, nice, nice, nice!

480
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,953
Hey! Watch out!

481
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,247
- He got the ball out!
- Oh, shoot! It's out!

482
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,959
- Closer! Pull it closer!
- Oh! He's got it!

483
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,086
Oh, no!

484
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,505
- He's got it, he's got it!
- Oh, look!

485
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,964
Yeah, yeah, let's go!

486
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,800
Glenn! Go for his leg!

487
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,885
Go for his leg! Come on!

488
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,428
Go for his leg!

489
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,971
Hold on tight, Soichi!

490
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,682
- Glenn! Come on, Glenn!
- Glenn, the leg!

491
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,448
<i>It was kind of annoying</i>
<i>to have Glenn clinging onto my leg</i>

492
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,200
<i>that close to the goal.</i>

493
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:26,079
<i>And he was a lot stronger than</i>
<i>I thought he'd be, which stressed me out.</i>

494
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,331
- Throw the ball, Glenn!
- Throw it, throw it!

495
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,417
- Kick it!
- Kick it! Kick it!

496
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,793
Kick the ball, Glenn!

497
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,004
- Kick, kick! Kick the ball! Come on!
- Kick it! Kick it! Come on, Glenn!

498
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,841
All right, let's bring it home!
Let's see some moves!

499
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,676
- Use your judo!
- Lift him up!

500
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,678
Kick it towards the water!

501
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,263
Towards the water, Glenn!

502
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,724
There's the judo move.

503
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,809
Yeah, there's the judo.

504
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,311
- Thirty seconds left!
- Time's almost up!

505
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,150
Oh, look!

506
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,902
Oh no, he's breaking out!

507
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,612
Low to mount! Glenn!

508
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,156
Don't let him up!

509
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:05,118
Glenn, close guard! Close guard!
Close guard! Glenn! Close guard!

510
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,494
Yeah, there you go!

511
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,788
Well done! Nice save!

512
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,041
- Whoa, whoa.
- He's losing his grip!

513
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,502
Grab the ball!

514
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,837
You can grab it!

515
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,596
Yes! That's what I'm talking about!

516
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,680
That's right!

517
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,392
The benefit of being tall, huh?

518
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,605
Nice job! Use those long legs!

519
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,356
- Ten more seconds!
- Come on, Soichi!

520
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,442
Ten seconds! Ten seconds!

521
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,320
Glenn! Ten seconds! You can do it, Glenn!

522
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,490
- Hurry up!
- Ten seconds! Come on, man!

523
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,325
Hang on! Yes, you've got it!

524
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,244
Come on! Almost! Four seconds!

525
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,747
Don't let him get the ball, Glenn!
There you go!

526
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,918
- Nice! Nice, Glenn!
- <i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

527
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,087
- Nice, Glenn. That was awesome.
- You did it, bro.

528
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,131
Really, bro. Mad props, man.

529
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,883
We're proud of you, that was insane!

530
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,301
Amazing job, Glenn.

531
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,429
- Not bad for a swimmer.
- Not bad for a swimmer.

532
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,889
These guys are so, like…

533
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,182
Olympians are f****** something else.

534
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,851
Everyone in this comp
is a f****** athlete.

535
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,771
<i>Since neither team scored,</i>

536
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,398
<i>we will now enter our tiebreaker match.</i>

537
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,692
<i>The match time is: one minute.</i>

538
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,071
<i>That was the moment</i>
<i>I started to freak out.</i>

539
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:27,575
<i>One little mistake could cost us</i>
<i>the match. I was under a lot of pressure.</i>

540
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,244
<i>Yep, very skillful.</i>

541
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,995
<i>Extremely strong and very technical.</i>

542
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,581
But even so, it really felt like…

543
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,502
No matter what he threw at me, I could
take it. I could handle the pressure.

544
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,546
<i>I thought, "Well, I've lasted this long,</i>

545
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,048
<i>so what's one more minute? I can take it."</i>

546
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,676
<i>Ready.</i>

547
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,272
Well, there you go. The ball's free.

548
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,482
Come on, Glenn! Come on! Grab the ball!

549
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,109
Just grab it! Let's go!

550
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,319
Go! Grab the ball, Glenn! Glenn!

551
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,617
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yay!

552
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,952
Hold, hold, yes!

553
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,662
It's all over if he lets go.

554
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,455
Grab the ball, Glenn!

555
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,834
- That's it!
- All right, Soichi!

556
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,337
Yeah, there you go!

557
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,089
Go, go, go!

558
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,883
Throw the ball! Come on!

559
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,801
Let's go, Glenn! You can do it!

560
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,303
Hey, watch out!

561
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,555
- Come on, grab him, grab him!
- Grab onto him!

562
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,848
No!

563
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,434
Yeah!

564
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,019
Let's go, Glenn!

565
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,118
- Yeah! you've got this!
- Nice job!

566
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,583
- Yeah! you've got this!
- Nice job!

567
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,549
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

568
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,595
<i>I went in thinking</i>
<i>it would be an easy win.</i>

569
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,556
<i>But that wasn't the case at all.</i>
<i>Glenn was a formidable opponent.</i>

570
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,391
<i>I was really happy when I made that goal.</i>

571
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,605
- Referee, referee! Bloody, bloody!
- Referee! Bloody, blood…

572
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,024
- Blood, blood, come on, blood!
- Blood, blood!

573
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,108
Oh, my…

574
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,029
I think it's his chin, so it must've
happened when he grabbed Soichi's leg.

575
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,661
<i>I did get injured,</i>
<i>but I know it was just an accident.</i>

576
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,707
<i>He wasn't aggressive,</i>
<i>and it definitely wasn't intentional.</i>

577
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,961
<i>But it was really unfortunate.</i>

578
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,963
<i>I felt, sad? Maybe disappointed?</i>

579
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,049
I know I shouldn't be,
because I did my best, but…

580
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,135
<i>I was really worried.</i>

581
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,932
And I want to say, Glenn,
I am so sorry that I hurt you.

582
00:32:56,015 --> 00:33:00,186
I wish you a speedy recovery, and
I'd love to see you when you're better.

583
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:03,106
Who knows, maybe we could have
another rematch someday?

584
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,366
Those guys… I'll make them bleed.

585
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,909
They make him bleed, we make them bleed.

586
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,286
- Something's going on.
- Simple as that.

587
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,247
I'm sensing a lot of aggression.

588
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,915
- I just… I just can't!
- Hey, calm down.

589
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,375
Calm down, calm down.

590
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,711
- It's okay, Fina. Take it easy.
- I just hate this!

591
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,964
- They're upset because he got injured.
- It's a lack of sportsmanship!

592
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,134
I'm just worried
that they'll try to retaliate.

593
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,553
<i>Of course I'm angry!</i>

594
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,722
<i>He was bleeding right in front of me!</i>

595
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,516
He didn't do anything to deserve it!
He never hit anyone!

596
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,727
I'll knock 'em out!

597
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,604
I've just never been this angry before!

598
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,689
Fina.

599
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,191
Remember, you gotta get the ball first.

600
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,444
But if they get to it first,
don't worry about it.

601
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,947
I'll get into the water,
and you can stay on the outside.

602
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,117
Just worry about the goal.
I'll take care of the rest.

603
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,037
Looks like they're determined
to win this round.

604
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,581
The big guy and one of the girls.

605
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,333
So then, if we hold off the big guy--

606
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,210
- I think we have a good chance.
- Yeah.

607
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,173
<i>Round Two participants,</i>
<i>please enter the arena.</i>

608
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,051
They went with those two?

609
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,011
Come on, guys. Let's go.

610
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,095
YOSHIO ITOI, KATSUMI NAKAMURA

611
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,514
Wow, that's a fast team.

612
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,016
Another two-on-two.

613
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,268
Their baseball player and swimmer.

614
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,687
Let's go, Indo.

615
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,522
Oh, there's a girl.

616
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,316
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, oh shit.

617
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,860
What does she specialize in again?

618
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:31,944
Jujitsu.

619
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,490
Oh, mate's angry.

620
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,741
FINA PHILLIPE
JIUJITSU FIGHTER

621
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,202
<i>I believe in my own capabilities.</i>

622
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,329
Got the rigs out.

623
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,456
IGEDZ EXECUTIONER
BODYBUILDER

624
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,792
<i>The bodybuilder from Indonesia, Igedz,</i>

625
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,252
<i>he was on a mission for blood.</i>

626
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,174
Oh, I'm scared for these two's lives.

627
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,218
Gonna send the Indo bouncers in.

628
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,011
They're about to get eaten alive.

629
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,515
<i>You could feel</i>
<i>the tension. It was gonna be a brawl.</i>

630
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,599
<i>Stand by.</i>

631
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,770
<i>We can't go home. Not yet.</i>

632
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,732
<i>The only way we can hope</i>
<i>to redeem ourselves is to keep fighting.</i>

633
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,111
<i>We'll settle the score for Glenn.</i>

634
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,863
You can do this.

635
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,116
Come on…

636
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:20,993
<i>Ready.</i>

637
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,456
Go, go, go!

638
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,424
All right, new strategy.

639
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,218
It's gotta be a jiujitsu move.

640
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,180
C'mon guys, grab the ball! Grab the ball!

641
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,058
<i>I was surprised.</i>
<i>She had a wrestler's grip.</i>

642
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,768
<i>It was impressive.</i>

643
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,604
<i>It wasn't easy to take the ball from her.</i>

644
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,022
<i>She had a really strong grip on it.</i>

645
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:54,068
<i>I don't care if someone's bigger</i>
<i>than me, I'm not afraid to fight anyone.</i>

646
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,237
You're so strong!

647
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,282
Hang in there, Fina! You've got this!

648
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,159
- Watch out!
- You gotta subdue him!

649
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,368
- Take him down!
- Watch out!

650
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,453
See? He's waiting.

651
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,956
- Nice defensive play.
- Gotta get in the water!

652
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,375
- Take him down!
- He's coming! Watch out!

653
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,627
That's some defense!

654
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,962
Take him down!

655
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,297
That's some defense!

656
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,673
Bravo!

657
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,216
- Oh, shit.
- Holy moly.

658
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,552
<i>Oh, yeah, he took me down.</i>

659
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,888
But when that happened, I just thought…

660
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,514
"Okay, then. I get it.

661
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,517
You wanna play rough?
Fine, let's play rough."

662
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,853
Yes, just walk her, yes, that's it!

663
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,230
Walk her, walk her, walk her, walk her!

664
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,482
<i>We couldn't let them walk all over us.</i>

665
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,610
<i>We had to prove that Indonesia</i>
<i>could fight back!</i>

666
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,493
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, holy moly!

667
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,162
Come on, get him off her!

668
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,250
Yeah, that's it, man!
Yeah, that's it, man!

669
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,544
- Grab him, grab him!
- Take him down!

670
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,838
Grab the neck!

671
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,757
Grab the neck! His neck!

672
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:00,968
<i>Stop.</i>

673
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,764
Was he going for a choke hold just now?

674
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,517
I think their
strongman's way too agitated.

675
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,727
Well, at least it's over.

676
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,811
Rest, rest.

677
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,105
Nice, Fina.

678
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,525
You're killing it!

679
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,324
- She's fired up.
- Let's go!

680
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,450
Let's go!

681
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,204
Yeah!

682
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,248
You see that?

683
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,500
She's all pumped up.

684
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,294
<i>She was just ready to rip.</i>

685
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,546
<i>She was like,</i>
<i>"I don't care who I'm going against."</i>

686
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,385
She's not giving up.

687
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,469
No way.

688
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,680
Stay calm.

689
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,140
Just stay calm. Stay calm.

690
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,725
Eyes on the big guy.

691
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,937
Igedz, Fina…

692
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,730
Let's go, guys. We can take this.

693
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,149
<i>Indonesia needs a miracle.</i>

694
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,987
<i>Ready.</i>

695
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,991
Push! Push! Push! Push!

696
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,076
- Aim for the legs, man!
- He's got it.

697
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,703
- Leg, leg!
- That's it.

698
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,621
Pry it out. Almost!

699
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,164
Whoa! That won't work.

700
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,291
He's too heavy.

701
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,667
Oh, no. Is she okay?

702
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,377
Oh, she's got all that weight on her.

703
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,920
You're crushing her.

704
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,797
<i>I couldn't feel anything.</i>

705
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,634
<i>I was so concentrated,</i>
<i>I didn't feel any pain or discomfort.</i>

706
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,386
- Come on, pull!
- Come on!

707
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,055
Show them what Indonesia's made of!

708
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,434
<i>I was shocked</i>
<i>by how intense the fighting got.</i>

709
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,352
Pull! Yeah, you gotta pull!

710
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,313
<i>The bodybuilder yanked me back.</i>

711
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,232
<i>And his grip was so tight</i>
<i>that I couldn't move at all.</i>

712
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,027
<i>That meant the only way</i>
<i>I could break away from him,</i>

713
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,778
<i>was if Nakamura got him off of me.</i>

714
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,905
<i>I went in to grab one of his legs,</i>

715
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,324
<i>since the bigger you are,</i>

716
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,242
<i>the more unstable your footing is.</i>

717
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,411
- Nice move, man!
- That's it, man!

718
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,912
Now grab the arms, okay?

719
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,664
Pry his arms off!

720
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,042
Hold on! Don't let go!

721
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,128
Yes, hold him, hold him,
hold him, hold him. Come on!

722
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,255
- Get up, bro! Get up!
- Stand up!

723
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,299
- I think it's done.
- Oh, he's got his legs…

724
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,552
Take the ball! Now's your chance!

725
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,347
Get out of there, Fina.

726
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,016
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on, Fin! Come on!

727
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,268
Let's go, Fina. Just hang on.

728
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,645
Oh, man, I think that she's gonna lose it.

729
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,147
Amazing. Good for her.

730
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,983
You can't afford to get tangled up again!

731
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,109
No, no, no, no!

732
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,153
Don't let him hold you captive like that!

733
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,531
<i>We were way too close to the goal.</i>

734
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,867
<i>I knew I couldn't afford</i>
<i>to surrender the ball,</i>

735
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,995
<i>so in that moment,</i>
<i>I was ready to do whatever I had to.</i>

736
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,331
- Don't lose!
- Take the ball!

737
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,415
Just hang on!

738
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,919
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

739
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,671
- Come on!
- Come on!

740
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,716
Don't let go!

741
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,020
What a round.

742
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,858
Good effort, good effort, Indo.

743
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,568
Really good effort.

744
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,320
Don't worry, don't worry!

745
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,988
- Don't worry!
- Really good effort!

746
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,449
Well played, well played.

747
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,244
- Nice.
- Nice!

748
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,329
You went in. You should be proud!

749
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,625
Indonesia.

750
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,839
<i>It was such an incredible match.</i>

751
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,715
I mean, it was an honor to watch her.

752
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,594
Her opponent was twice her height,
and yet she fought so hard,

753
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,055
<i>with so much confidence,</i>
<i>I couldn't help feeling proud.</i>

754
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,307
It was… It's emotional, cause it's hard,

755
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,600
because you just want to help.

756
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,727
Also, you just got so much respect.

757
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,564
That was really something.
It was incredible.

758
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,317
<i>Death Match: Round Two.</i>

759
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,906
<i>The winner…</i>

760
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,076
<i>is Japan.</i>

761
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,746
Looks like the pretty boy duo won.

762
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,831
Bravo!

763
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,584
Yes, we're on a roll.

764
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,253
The ball hasn't even made it
over here yet.

765
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,713
- Well done.
- Nice job, man. Nice.

766
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,091
- You killed it out there. Great job!
- Itoi! Nice job.

767
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,469
Thank you for the guidance, everyone.

768
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:15,973
As soon as it was over,
I immediately started to tear up.

769
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,019
But I wasn't emotional because I was sad,

770
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,271
it was because I was so proud of my team,

771
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,065
and proud of myself,
for everything we did out there.

772
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,074
- He just… lifted me up.
- You did great.

773
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,660
- You did your best. It's okay.
- You did great.

774
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,288
- It's okay.
- Nice try.

775
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,332
Worth a shot.

776
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,626
Are we going home now?

777
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,252
No, they have to win one more.

778
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,378
We got this.

779
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,589
<i>We can't let these losses get to us.</i>

780
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,966
And I'm confident that in the next round,

781
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,678
we won't just do better.
We're gonna start winning.

782
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:06,690
<i>Round Three participants,</i>
<i>please enter the arena.</i>

783
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,902
- So it's back to one now, I think.
- Yeah.

784
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:13,322
Looks like Team Japan's
about to send out that one guy,

785
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,407
the one Recep had mentioned earlier.

786
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,159
The skull crusher.

787
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,954
Yeah, he's up.

788
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,499
Okami's coming out.

789
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,793
YUSHIN OKAMI
MMA FIGHTER

790
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,128
I think the game's pretty much over.

791
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,507
<i>Obviously, I know Yushin Okami very well.</i>

792
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,425
If he manages to get you pinned down,

793
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,219
there's no chance of escaping.

794
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,720
He's like a force of nature.

795
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,181
<i>There was no denying it,</i>
<i>it'd be a bloodbath.</i>

796
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,225
Who's up next?

797
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,435
For this last one they're definitely
gonna send out the big guy.

798
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,648
Oh, my God.

799
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,567
Holy moly!

800
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,610
Oh! It's their boxer.

801
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,448
Cuz, sleeper builds
are sitting all in this team.

802
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,783
JEREMIAH LAKHWANI
HYBRID ATHLETE

803
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,035
Bro, that's actually crazy.

804
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,747
<i>He's someone who is physically strong.</i>

805
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,333
I'm really excited to watch Jeremiah.

806
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,295
<i>It was time.</i>
<i>I figured they'd send him out.</i>

807
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,923
I mean, it makes sense. He's a boxer,
so he's used to combat and all.

808
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,552
But I'm pretty sure the reason
they chose him is because he's fast.

809
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,722
<i>I won't lie,</i>
<i>I actually got a little nervous.</i>

810
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,391
If Japan wins, it's over.

811
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,726
Best three of five, right?

812
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,728
Yeah, best of five.

813
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,314
We were under a lot of pressure,
and I didn't want the girls

814
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,065
<i>to have to make up for my failure.</i>

815
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,694
<i>So I promised myself</i>
<i>this would be the last round.</i>

816
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,155
<i>But I was really nervous.</i>

817
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,574
It's gonna be fine.
Just believe in yourself, man.

818
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,658
You can win this,

819
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,784
just have confidence.

820
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,703
This was Team Indonesia's last chance,

821
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,080
so I knew I had to go in there and win.

822
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:49,752
<i>The time had come. The only way</i>
<i>to win was if I gave it my all.</i>

823
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,004
Let's get it, Jer.

824
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,298
You got this, let's go!

825
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:56,842
<i>Ready.</i>

826
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,135
Come on.

827
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:03,932
Finish him!

828
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,268
Finish him!

829
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,483
- Oh, shoot!
- No way.

830
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,652
- Oh, shoot!
- No way. No way!

831
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,153
Oh, that's bad.

832
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,367
<i>It felt like everything was</i>
<i>in slow motion.</i>

833
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,912
The plan was simple.
If he got the ball, I'd subdue him.

834
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,246
Easy enough, right?

835
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,083
<i>But he was so fast, he just blew past me.</i>

836
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,002
<i>And in the moment,</i>
<i>that really tripped me up.</i>

837
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,591
- Yes!
- Nice! Nice!

838
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,176
<i>I thought, "What's happening?"</i>

839
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,552
- Yes!
- Nice!

840
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,148
Oh!

841
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,318
How do you even…

842
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,945
What? He was right there!

843
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,905
- I don't…
- Why would he throw it?

844
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:05,577
<i>You know, 0.0001 to happen that way, but…</i>

845
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,413
It did happen.

846
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,123
That was a bad call.

847
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:10,916
Let's go.

848
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,627
Come on, bud. Get it together!

849
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,296
- Go underhand!
- Block it!

850
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,465
Take him back!

851
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,677
They both whiffed it! Wow!

852
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,303
Push him back, man!

853
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,388
Push him back!

854
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,764
Yeah, Okami!

855
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,558
You got that, you got that, you got that!

856
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,728
He's just gonna lean on him.

857
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,604
<i>The new plan was to tire him out,</i>

858
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,232
<i>and what better place to start</i>
<i>than with his legs?</i>

859
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,694
- Yes! Hold on tight!
- Hold on! Don't let go!

860
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,405
- There's two minutes!
- We still have some time!

861
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,866
This is good! Good start, man!

862
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,994
- Just go slow. Take it slow, man!
- Be careful, Yushin!

863
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,371
Turtle Position! Turtle Position!

864
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,873
Turn around!

865
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,043
He's trying to loosen the grip.

866
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,879
Yeah, he is.

867
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,465
It's just a waiting game.

868
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,137
Roll, roll, Jeremiah, roll!

869
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,931
Oh! He pried it open.

870
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,184
Oh! He pried it open.

871
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,648
He'll feel Okami's strength now.

872
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,526
<i>He weighs nearly a hundred kilos,</i>

873
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,988
<i>and he's almost 190 centimeters tall.</i>

874
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:26,867
<i>But I can't think about that. I just have</i>
<i>to fight back as hard as I can.</i>

875
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,536
Throw the ball, throw the ball!

876
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,205
- Don't let him take it!
- Watch out.

877
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,542
That's right, good job!

878
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,253
Defend! Jeremiah, defend!

879
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,215
As if it wasn't hard enough already.

880
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,592
- He's terrifying.
- Yeah, that's crazy.

881
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,386
Take it slow, man!

882
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,515
There we go! Nice play, great job!

883
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,142
- No! No, no!
- Push it!

884
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,857
He needs to pull his leg out.

885
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,360
- He's trapped in a bind.
- Looks like it.

886
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,694
Pull your leg out!

887
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,530
One minute left! Hurry up!

888
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,448
- You've got it! Yes!
- Yes!

889
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,575
Hold on for a little longer!

890
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,661
It won't be easy for him to escape.

891
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,831
Okay, okay!

892
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,250
- Get it, get it!
- You can do it!

893
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,669
He's exhausted!
You got this, he's exhausted!

894
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:23,048
Twenty seconds! Hold! Defense!

895
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,175
Hold on and get that rematch, okay?

896
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,803
Eleven seconds!

897
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,556
Okami! Aim for overtime, all right?

898
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,350
Tire him out, then go into overtime!

899
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,643
They're out of time!

900
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,814
- Five, four, three, two, one!
- Good job!

901
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,112
- <i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>
- Yeah, good job!

902
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,947
- Good match, good match, good match!
- Good!

903
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,407
Rematch! Rematch!

904
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,284
That was too close.

905
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,660
I thought he was done for.

906
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,537
Yeah, I was worried at first.

907
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,747
Same! It's fast!

908
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,083
Fast, same!

909
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,461
Whatever threw Okami off
is out of his system now.

910
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,130
Just be careful at the start.

911
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,924
I know you're tired too,
but I think he's exhausted.

912
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,175
Yeah, I bet.

913
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,012
I'm pretty sure I survived on luck alone,

914
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,972
but I still survived.

915
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:16,101
<i>When we went to reset, I knew</i>
<i>I wasn't allowed to make another mistake.</i>

916
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,646
<i>If I wanted to win this game this round,</i>
<i>I had to focus.</i>

917
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,398
<i>I'd been given a second chance at victory,</i>

918
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,567
<i>so I couldn't afford to waste</i>
<i>the opportunity.</i>

919
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,361
<i>We will now enter our tiebreaker match.</i>

920
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,405
Let's go, Okami. Let's go, Jeremiah!

921
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,531
<i>Ready.</i>

922
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,412
Push him back!

923
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,877
- Okay!
- Stay focused!

924
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,922
Nice, nice, nice!

925
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,965
Come on, Jer!

926
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,258
He's too strong.

927
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,428
- Nice, nice!
- Get past the halfway point!

928
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,597
- Keep going!
- You need to go further!

929
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,433
Look, look, he's got the ball.

930
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,645
Yes!

931
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,397
This is really bad.

932
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,943
- Take it back, you can do it!
- Yeah, yeah! Take it!

933
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,486
- Grab the ball!
- C'mon, Yushin!

934
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,904
Thirty seconds left!

935
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,282
- Yeah!
- Yes!

936
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,452
Yeah, get the ball!

937
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,455
Get it! Get up!

938
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,919
You got this!

939
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,465
Jer! Come on! Jer, Jer!

940
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,467
Yes!

941
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,302
Jer, Jer!

942
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,762
Yes!

943
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,264
Yes!

944
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,642
Oh, big play.

945
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,228
- Yes!
- Yeah!

946
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,814
Ten seconds left! You're almost there!

947
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:47,359
Let's go! Ten seconds! Come on, grab it!

948
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,530
Let's go! Let's go!

949
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,117
Japan can't afford to lose today.
We're not going home.

950
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,577
Yes! Push! Push with your head!

951
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,871
Now your hand! Yeah, that's it!

952
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,541
It looks like Japan's gonna win this.

953
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,042
He's keeping it on the other side.

954
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,627
Kick it to the side!

955
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,462
Five, four,

956
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,214
- three--
- Grab the ball!

957
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,591
- Hurry! Get it!
- Come on, Yushin! Grab the ball!

958
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,135
Come on!

959
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,804
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

960
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,597
Is that it?

961
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,641
No, nobody was in possession of the ball.

962
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,310
Ah, another rematch, another rematch.

963
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,272
<i>Since neither team won,</i>

964
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,316
<i>we will reset</i>
<i>and enter a second tiebreaker match.</i>

965
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,153
He's got a gash on his eye.

966
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,904
Look. His eye's all swollen.

967
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,531
Yeah, his eye's turning blue.

968
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,199
Was it the elbow?

969
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,914
<i>Jeremiah hurt his eye in the last around.</i>

970
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,251
<i>But since he could still see,</i>
<i>he decided to keep fighting.</i>

971
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,462
I think he was absolutely amazing.

972
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,755
I was really proud of him.

973
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,591
<i>I'd been given one last chance</i>
<i>to win the Death Match,</i>

974
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,178
<i>I wasn't about to let</i>
<i>a little injury keep me from winning.</i>

975
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:59,097
Let's go! Let's go!

976
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,437
Come on! Come on! Yes, Jer!

977
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,730
You got that!

978
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:10,650
- Whoa!
- Aw, he was too slow.

979
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,028
Whoa!

980
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,529
Aw, bro, that's nuts.

981
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,240
Push his body, don't worry about the ball.

982
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,325
Come on!

983
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,583
They're really going at it down there.

984
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,544
- He's trying to smother his face.
- Yeah.

985
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,879
Forty! Forty seconds!

986
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,672
Just stay there! Don't move!

987
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,300
If he can get up, he can push him back.

988
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,468
Push, push!

989
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,303
<i>I had to protect the ball.</i>

990
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,264
<i>But I also had to move</i>
<i>towards Indonesia's goal.</i>

991
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,893
<i>That's really Okami's</i>
<i>specialty, holding his opponents.</i>

992
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,938
<i>Once he locks 'em down, that's it.</i>
<i>He's like a rock.</i>

993
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,775
- Twenty seconds left on the clock!
- Keep pushing!

994
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,193
- You can do it!
- Push, push, push!

995
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,778
That's it, push, push, push!

996
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,947
- Ten!
- Final stretch!

997
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,031
Push!

998
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,574
- Yeah, Jeremiah!
- Come on, don't let go!

999
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,118
Last chance! Push him!

1000
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,204
Yeah, yeah, good, good!

1001
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,959
Five, four…

1002
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,752
- Push!
- Push! The ball is slipping out!

1003
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,087
We're gonna win this!

1004
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,797
Three, two…

1005
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,298
- Push!
- Push!

1006
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,175
Don't move! You're right there!

1007
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,720
<i>The match has ended.</i>

1008
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,808
<i>The match has ended.</i>

1009
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,269
Good battle, good battle!

1010
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,607
Whoo!

1011
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,985
- Well played!
- Good.

1012
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,613
- That was intense.
- Yeah, but they fought well.

1013
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,866
Good job, guys. Good job.

1014
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,868
Great sportsmanship.

1015
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,286
Good game!

1016
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,745
Great TV, boys!

1017
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,624
<i>We may have lost, but I have no regrets.</i>

1018
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,961
I went in there and did my best.
And most importantly,

1019
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,838
<i>I had a lot of fun doing it.</i>

1020
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,011
Amazing!

1021
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,679
<i>At the end of the day,</i>

1022
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:06,016
<i>nothing really ended up going</i>
<i>the way that we wanted it to go.</i>

1023
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,852
But there's no reason
to be ashamed of ourselves.

1024
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:12,314
Every single member
of our team came to <i>Physical: Asia</i>

1025
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,691
<i>and competed to</i>
<i>the best of their abilities.</i>

1026
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,194
<i>So, as a leader,</i>
<i>I couldn't be more proud of them.</i>

1027
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,320
Nice, nice!

1028
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,739
- You're amazing, Okami!
- Nice, Captain!

1029
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,908
- We did it!
- You did it!

1030
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,535
<i>I'm so relieved that we won.</i>

1031
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,330
<i>Okami really took our fate</i>
<i>into his hands today.</i>

1032
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,707
<i>We're so lucky to have such</i>
<i>a trustworthy captain.</i>

1033
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,419
Oh, no. I guess I have to stop
looking at flights to Japan.

1034
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,712
I'm so glad we're staying.

1035
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,673
You did it! Thank you so much!

1036
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,468
<i>I don't think I've ever</i>
<i>been this happy before.</i>

1037
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,178
But now,

1038
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:46,014
it's time for the real battle to begin.
So get ready.

1039
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,184
<i>We're riding high from winning</i>
<i>the Death Match, but make no mistake.</i>

1040
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,311
We'll use that momentum
to win the Third Quest.

1041
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,729
<i>The winner…</i>

1042
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,314
<i>of round three</i>

1043
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,858
<i>is Japan.</i>

1044
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,903
- Thank you, everyone!
- Thank you!

1045
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,446
Let's go!

1046
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,416
Physical: Asia.

1047
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,876
<i>Death Match.</i>

1048
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,089
<i>The surviving country is Japan.</i>

1049
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,272
<i>The country of Indonesia has</i>
<i>a national motto. It goes…</i>

1050
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,315
<i>Bhinneka Tunggal Ika.</i>

1051
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,193
Which translates to, "Unity in diversity."

1052
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,072
Indonesia!

1053
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,366
We'll take you down!

1054
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,576
<i>So, while every member of our team</i>

1055
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,870
<i>comes from</i>
<i>a different athletic background…</i>

1056
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:55,166
<i>All of us came together with</i>
<i>one shared goal, to represent one country.</i>

1057
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,961
- Build a barricade. Barricade!
- Let's go. Let's go.

1058
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,671
If my legs slips, I'm out!

1059
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,214
Just grab hold like this, Glenn.

1060
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,591
- Boxes good?
- We're good!

1061
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,010
Hey, we can do this!

1062
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,512
One, two, up!

1063
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,681
Let's go!

1064
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,893
Thank you so much, Father,
for giving Team Indonesia

1065
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,437
this beautiful opportunity.

1066
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,523
I'm proud of you guys.

1067
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,943
<i>We always put our heart like…</i>

1068
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,321
At least I have no regrets to it.

1069
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,115
Hang in there, Jer!

1070
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,450
- Come on, Jeremiah!
- Turn!

1071
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,452
<i>I felt so supported in the arena.</i>

1072
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:34,289
<i>The rush of adrenaline I felt</i>
<i>in that moment was honestly just…</i>

1073
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,874
The best.

1074
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,720
I'm just so grateful
for the opportunity to be here.

1075
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:54,768
<i>And to work alongside these absolutely</i>
<i>incredible athletes I admire so much.</i>

1076
00:55:56,227 --> 00:56:00,857
So I just wanna say thank you to them.
For fighting beside me until the end.

1077
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,445
Um…

1078
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:10,492
I just hope that the time we spent here
wasn't a complete waste, you know?

1079
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,995
<i>Ultimately, even though we were defeated,</i>

1080
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,248
<i>we still maintained our honor.</i>

1081
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,750
And I'm proud of us for that.

1082
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,523
<i>The remaining six countries</i>
<i>will now advance</i>

1083
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,483
<i>to the third quest.</i>

1084
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,664
Well, that was really intense.

1085
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,749
- Six teams left!
- Wow.

1086
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,085
Wow. Wow, wow!

1087
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,003
Let's make it to the final two.

1088
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,964
Honestly,

1089
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,173
I'm glad that wasn't us.

1090
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,800
It's better to watch the Death Match.

1091
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:11,052
- Instead of participating.
- Participating sucks.

1092
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,054
Oh, here comes Australia!

1093
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,140
There they are.

1094
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,142
There they are.
Where's the Australian flag?

1095
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,394
I think we're right here, dude.

1096
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,729
You know, during the first quest,

1097
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,565
I couldn't gauge their opinion of us.

1098
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,525
Maybe we came across as too persistent.

1099
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,819
But I think
the last results shook them up a bit.

1100
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,779
They won't take us lightly.

1101
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,661
Morning.

1102
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,998
It's afternoon, my guy.

1103
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,293
Here comes the oil man.

1104
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,461
Hello, brothers!

1105
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,129
Enemies of enemies!

1106
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,257
We taught them that, right?

1107
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,759
Ever since the alliance,
we've gotten closer.

1108
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,679
We need to drive a wedge between them.

1109
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,389
Mmm.

1110
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,060
- Hey, hey.
- Yo.

1111
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,859
- Hey there! Morning!
- Thanks, guys!

1112
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,029
Why didn't they say "hi" to us? Huh.

1113
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,660
Guys.

1114
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,287
Hey, mate.

1115
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,915
Here they are, back from the dead.

1116
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,708
That's a new guy, right?

1117
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,959
Oh, you're right! Who is that?

1118
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,586
Wait, what happened?

1119
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,130
So, looks like they're all sizing us up.

1120
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,218
No Manny anymore?

1121
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,385
No PacMan.

1122
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,263
MANNY PACQUIAO
BOXER

1123
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:41,017
I wanted to take a moment
and apologize to everyone.

1124
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,188
I have to leave the competition
and return to the Philippines,

1125
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:49,817
because of another obligation
in my home country.

1126
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:54,489
Also, I just want to apologize to my team.

1127
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:58,201
<i>We came here with one goal.</i>

1128
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:02,914
To show the capacity and capability
of Team Philippines.

1129
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,166
<i>I really wanted to win the challenges.</i>

1130
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,001
- Let's fight!
- Philippines!

1131
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:12,048
And I'm just wondering what we're gonna do
for the next challenge.

1132
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,008
That's been my mindset, you know?

1133
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,261
Just, "Keep on going, no matter what."

1134
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,889
So, like,

1135
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,226
it's hard. It's-It's hard when…

1136
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,312
I'm disappointed.

1137
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,731
But, I'm happy that…

1138
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,441
to be part of this season.

1139
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,777
<i>As team captain,</i>

1140
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,739
<i>I was really proud to have an opportunity</i>
<i>to represent The Philippines.</i>

1141
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:42,370
<i>Um, Team Philippines are hard warriors.</i>

1142
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,871
Jeepney blitz!

1143
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,000
<i>Because my people, the Filipino people,</i>

1144
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:51,212
<i>are born with the ability</i>
<i>to overcome any challenge, no matter what.</i>

1145
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,840
Uh, the Philippines are strong.

1146
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,135
Deep in my heart, in my mind,

1147
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,553
praying for you now…

1148
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,472
We can overcome
anything and achieve victory.

1149
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,518

01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,108
- Ooh, here we go.

01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,153
<i>Physical: Asia.</i>

1154
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,447
<i>The countries that have survived so far</i>

1155
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,698
<i>are Korea.</i>

1156

<i>Australia.</i>

1157

<i>Mongolia.</i>

<i>Türkiye.</i>

<i>Japan.</i>

1160
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,706
<i>And the Philippines.</i>

1161
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,833
- It's all or nothing.
- Won't be easy.

1162
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,127
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1163
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,256

01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,635
<i>Whatever happens, I'm ready to go.</i>

01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,345
<i>Contestants,</i>

1168
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,639
<i>we will now reveal the third quest.</i>

1169
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,433
Come on! Let's go!

1170
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,643
Here we go.

1171
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,977
Just no more sand.

1172
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,648
<i>Physical: Asia. Your third quest is…</i>

1173
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,358
I'm nervous.

1174
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,194
There should be
a strongman component in this too.

1175
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,820
My money's on a balance game.

1176
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,988
Or a running game.

1177
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,368
<i>…the Team Representative Match.</i>

1178
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,496
I think it's a teamwork game.

1179
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,206
<i>The Team Representative Match</i>

1180
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:12,168
<i>is a quest that consists</i>
<i>of four different games.</i>

1181
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,464
Maybe delegating roles?

1182
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:20,176
<i>Before we begin,</i>
<i>your team will select representatives</i>

1183
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,720
<i>to individually compete</i>
<i>in each of the four games.</i>

1184
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,764
So one representative for each game.

1185
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,974
Like a one-on-one then two-on-two?

1186
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,268
<i>For this quest, the six surviving teams</i>

1187
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:34,107
<i>will be split into two groups of three</i>
<i>and will only compete within those groups.</i>

1188
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,650
Two groups of three.

1189
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:38,945
<i>Additionally, at the end of the quest,</i>
<i>the countries that rank the lowest</i>

1190
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,571
<i>within their individual group</i>

1191
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,908
<i>will receive no death match opportunity</i>

1192
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,953
<i>and will be eliminated on the spot.</i>

1193
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,789
This is like do or die, guys.

1194
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,374
Two countries leaving again!

1195
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,334
If you're last in your group, you're out.

1196
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,253
Wow, that's intense.

1197
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:58,589
<i>Now then, allow me</i>
<i>to explain how the groups will be chosen.</i>

1198
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,675
All right, let's do it. Let's go.

1199

01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,390
<i>will be chosen at random from a box.</i>

1201
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:10,560
What? We're gonna be picking our team
from a box?

1202
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,021
Yeah, good, random.

1203
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:16,816
I'm so nervous.

1204
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,943
Avoid Australia.

1205
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,572
<i>Captain of Team Korea, Kim Dong-hyun.</i>

1206
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,075
<i>Please approach the box</i>
<i>and select your group assignment.</i>

1207
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:35,877
I see.

1208
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,799
Ooh.

1209
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:43,551
- Come on.
- A.

1210
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,179
KOREA: GROUP A

1211
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,972
- No, it's just a letter.
- Oh, it's just numbers?

1212
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,056
Yeah, just A.

1213
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:54,604
With Australia and Türkiye,
that'd be really bad for us.

1214
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:57,940
But the chances of that exact outcome
are slim at best.

1215
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,401
I think the scariest teams are Australia
and probably Türkiye.

CROSSFIT ATHLETE

1217
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,822
<i>So I was hoping we could avoid them</i>
<i>at all costs.</i>

1218
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,325
It's smart to compete
at a consistent level

1219
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,202
so we store our strength for the end.

1220
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,995
<i>That's why I didn't want to face them now.</i>

1221
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,413
I wanna verse Amotti.

1222
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,832
That'd be gangster.

1223
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,126
I just kept a close eye on Amotti.

1224
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,545
He is an absolute robot, a machine.

1225
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,714
We want a strong competitor
because that will keep us…

1226
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,967
Because that's when we thrive,
especially as a team.

1227
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:28,679
Korea is such a stacked team,

1228
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:32,058
<i>so I guess like,</i>
<i>we wanted to go against Korea.</i>

1229

<i>Robert Whittaker.</i>

1230
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,649
Go, Cap.

1231
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,859
I'm confident we can beat them,

1232
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,611
but it'd be nice if they were B.

1233
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:51,035
We wanted to get in there,
we wanted to have some challenge 'cause…

1234
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,870
to show everybody how hard we are.

1235
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,957
<i>So I went over there,</i>
<i>I drew the letter, and…</i>

1236
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,876
Don't be scared, it doesn't matter.

1237
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,087
A!

1238
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,840
A!

1239
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,968
AUSTRALIA: GROUP A

1240
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,595
A!

1241
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,222
They sure are excited.

1242
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,391
Whoo!

1243
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:15,142
Wow.

1244
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,937
It was our birthday.

1245
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,606
Another A, huh?

1246
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,109
Why did Australia have to pick Group A?

1247
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,569
I'm scared!

1248
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,903
All right, whatever.

1249
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,405
Let's do it, guys.

1250
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,073
<i>I guess it'll be fine.</i>

1251
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:31,033
I mean, there's two survivors, right?

1252
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,785
I guess it could be a win-win.

1253
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,495
<i>We'll just have to see.</i>

1254
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,956
What if Türkiye gets picked?

1255
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,167
I guess
they would become our enemies, then.

1256
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,836
Maybe Japan or Mongolia?

1257
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,129
I think those are good options.

1258
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,922
To be honest, Japan's pretty weak.

1259
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,966
They won't have much of a chance.

1260
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,135
<i>Right now, the two teams I'd like to avoid</i>

1261
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,596
are Korea, and probably Australia.

1262
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,932
Making us pick teams
from a box is kind of cruel.

1263
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,977
<i>Captain of Team Mongolia, Orkhonbayar.</i>

1264
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,398
I guess we're getting B
if they also pick A.

1265
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:03,941
Come on, big Genghis Khan!

1266
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:08,821
A.

1267
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:10,656
<i>Given our options,</i>

1268
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,825
Mongolia would be one of the weaker teams.

1269
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,087
- B.
- Ooh. Doesn't matter!

1270
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:28,341
MONGOLIA: GROUP B

1271
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:36,307
Team B would be great. Let's hope we're B.

1272
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,976
Whoever we get, we're gonna crush 'em.

1273
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,272
All right, first in Group B.

1274
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:46,442
<i>I really hope we go up</i>
<i>against Team Türkiye.</i>

1275
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,362
They worked with Team Korea
in the first quest,

1276
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,614
and they were happy
about beating us that round.

1277
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,413
So now it's time for payback.

1278
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,624
Yeah! I guess
we've just been biding our time.

Next is Türkiye, right?

1281
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,797
We lost to Türkiye
at the end of the first quest.

1282
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,757
- Hang on, hang on!
- Stay right there! Don't move, don't move!

1283
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,011
<i>The match has ended.</i>

1284
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,846
- Yes!
- Let's go, man!

1285
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:21,602
And then they pitted us against Australia,
which wasn't great for us.

1286
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,229
Which team should we pick?

1287
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,897
I was thinking maybe…

1288
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:27,316
<i>Australia</i>.

1289
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,361
Have at it, you two…

1290
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:34,407
And ever since then,
this frustration's been eating away at me.

1295
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,710
If they pull A,
we're completely off balance.

1296
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,212
A. A, A, A!

1297
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,381
Let's go hard. Let's go hard, crew.

1298
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,760
I want to face off against Türkiye.

1299
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,055
<i>I've got some</i>
<i>unfinished business against Türkiye.</i>

1300
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,934
- Bring it in, guys!
- Whoo!

1301
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,186
One, two, three, Türkiye! Yeah!

1302
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,940
That Türkiye gets pooled in our team.

1303
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,531
B!

1304

TÜRKIYE: GROUP B

1305
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,164
B!

1306
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,665
Oh, no.

1307
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,209
- Next time, next time.
- Oh, no.

1308
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,336
<i>Once I saw we had the same group,</i>

1309
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,547
<i>I decided it was time to send them home.</i>

1310
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,133
"You must be tired
after traveling all this way.

1311
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,678
Ah. Why don't you pack your things
and head back to rest?"

1312
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,265
- Now things are getting interesting.
- That's a huge relief.

1313
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:43,309
It's a 50/50 chance.

1314
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:46,854
GROUP A: REPUBLIC OF KOREA & AUSTRALIA

1315
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:50,316
GROUP B: MONGOLIA & TURKEY

1316
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:53,778
<i>I thought, "Seriously?"</i>

1317
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,112
Oh, my god.

1318
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,947
I really didn't want Group A.

1319
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,867
So I just kept thinking, "B! B!
We have to get B!", you know?

1320
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,286
<i>I just had to trust that</i>
<i>our Captain wouldn't let us down.</i>

1321
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,955
<i>I really wanted to avoid group A</i>

1322
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,166
after Australia and Korea
were already in Group A.

1323
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,877
<i>Captain of Team Japan, Yushin Okami.</i>

1324

<i>Captain of Team Philippines,</i>
<i>Justin Coveney.</i>

1325
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,048
I wonder what this might be.

1326
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:17,718
<i>Please approach the box,</i>
<i>and select your group assignment.</i>

1327
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,721
Ah! Doof, doof, doof.

1328
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,181
My heart was pounding!

1329
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,641
<i>It was intimidating.</i>

1330
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,400
JAPAN: GROUP B

1331
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,156
THE PHILIPPINES: GROUP A

1332
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,660
I was so happy. Yes! Best outcome.

1333
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:45,246
Not sure why they're happy
when we're in Group B.

1334
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:49,750
I get the feeling the other two Group B
teams weren't too happy with our reaction.

1335
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:54,547
Look, we have the chance to get back
at Türkiye for screwing us over twice.

1336
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,676
<i>Obviously that boosted our team's morale,</i>
<i>even more than winning the Death Match.</i>

1337
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,011
Ultimately,
it makes little difference to us.

1338
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,889
We're obviously gonna take first,
just wait and see.

1339
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,392
I'm confident we can beat anybody here.

1340
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:08,769
So we're competing against Australia.

1341
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:09,854
And Korea.

1342
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:16,193
The resilience that they showed
in that Death Match,

1343
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,654
Philippines is a bit of an underdog.

1344
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,407
Wow, Philippines! Let's go.

1345
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,992
Looking at the overall roster,

1346
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:25,035
<i>Team Philippines is really strong.</i>

1347
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,787
Look, I don't wanna underestimate them,

1348
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,914
but there's no way we're gonna lose here.

1349
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,291
It's a good day for an upset.

1350
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:33,002
It's time to take down Goliath.

1351
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,879
No way out. Let's go.

1352
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,354
Hurry, hurry. Come on!

1353
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,070
I'm losing my grip!

1354
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,741
I f****** live here!
