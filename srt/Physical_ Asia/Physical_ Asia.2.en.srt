00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,802
Subtitles are color-coded by country,
and this setting cannot be changed.

2
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,557
<i>Before we begin,</i>

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,020
<i>please take a moment to meet as a team</i>
<i>and hold a brief strategy meeting.</i>

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,523
We shouldn't push too hard.
If we do that, it'll all fall on Min-jae.

5
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,067
If we go slow,
it's like the strength of three people.

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,069
We need to be close together
and coordinated.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,487
We'll push from behind.

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,531
And once he's there, we'll stay behind him

9
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,532
and get in formation.

10
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,617
What if Seung-Yeon and I
were in the middle,

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,369
and you all surrounded us.

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,871
- From the outside?
- Yeah, like a wall.

13
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,081
If they can separate us, we're screwed.

14
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,459
In the event we're lucky and get a spot,

15
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:47,005
we'll lock our arms together,
and pull forward while facing inwards.

16
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,550
<i>By combining our strength,</i>
<i>we created the best defense possible.</i>

17
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,429
You can't pull one person from the outside
without having to pull the rest of us.

18
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,222
We dubbed it, Operation: Flowers.

19
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,265
Cool, right?

20
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,225
It's the first quest,
adrenaline's pumping,

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,811
and that means
no one's gonna lock in for a few seconds.

22
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,896
- Right.
- As wrestlers,

23
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,981
- you two have the major advantage here.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,775
We'll start strong and hit hard.

25
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,902
In the world of wrestling,
there's this common saying that goes…

26
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,695
RECEP KARA
FORMER NATIONAL TEAM OIL WRESTLER

27
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,448
"…The greatest defense is great offense."

28
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,576
<i>The most powerful country</i>
<i>will always be Türkiye.</i>

29
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,245
<i>Look, we intend to leave here</i>
<i>as champions.</i>

30
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,206
We'll be the first in everything.

31
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,291
This is clearly what's gonna happen.

32
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:27,253
All of the other teams have wrestling,
judo, they're all fighting.

33
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,714
You can see, just before,
they were all practicing.

34
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,257
Let them drain their energy.

35
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,300
Let them fight.

36
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,135
As fast as we can, over there. On the top.

37
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,804
Yeah. But just observe.

38
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,263
- Yeah. Just observe.
- Just observe.

39
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,599
We all know how to latch on,
you gotta keep your body tight,

40
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,477
you gotta stay low, you gotta stay…
pretty much pushed that way.

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,979
- This move is called the jeepney blitz.
- Okay.

42
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,064
Okay?

43
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,691
Let's keep it Filipino. The jeepney blitz.

44
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,196
If you live in the Philippines,
if you've been to the Philippines…

45
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,614
you know what a jeepney is.

46
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,075
It's a big bus. It's made of steel,

47
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,286
and it travels very fast,
along EDSA and other major roads.

48
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,038
<i>Now, what the jeepney blitz was,</i>

49
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,873
<i>the two heaviest guys at the front,</i>

50
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,210
<i>which was Ray and myself. We latch on.</i>

51
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,004
<i>Behind us, we had the boys,</i>
<i>in Manny and Mark.</i>

52
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:14,175
<i>And then behind them,</i>
<i>we had Lara and Robyn.</i>

53
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:19,222
And the whole point was to stay connected,
and move on to the territory,

54
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,224
one quick movement.

55
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,810
I reckon, do you want maybe Eloni…

56
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,396
Eloni on my flank
and me in between the girls.

57
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,356
On the flanks. Me and you in the center

58
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,191
- and the girls directly behind all of us.
- Sweet.

59
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,026
- We f****** smashed it.
- Yeah, like I said,

60
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,779
- best major objective, stay in the circle.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,615
<i>The meeting period has come to an end.</i>

62
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,493
Let's go.

63
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,036
Get to da chopper!

64
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,497
Let's crush them.

65
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,249
Go!

66
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,210
One, two, three. Thailand, let's go!

67
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,963
- Korea!
- Fight on!

68
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,424
- Let's go!
- Crush them!

69
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,718
Türkiye! Yeah!

70
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,678
- One, two, three!
- Go Japan!

71
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,971
Mount up!

72
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,600
- Let's fight!
- Philippines!

73
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,783
PHYSICAL: ASIA

74
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,832
2. ON THE BRINK

75
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,001
<i>Contestants,</i>

76
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,503
<i>the match will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

77
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,339
<i>Stand by.</i>

78
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,424
- Stand by.
- Here we go.

79
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:42,931
<i>Ready.</i>

80
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,252
Over here!

81
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,712
Over here!

82
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,396
- You watch that side.
- Okay, got it.

83
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,439
They're coming. Get ready, get ready.

84
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:34,983
Come on in.

85
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,746
Positions, positions!

86
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,249
Positions, positions!

87
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,583
Come on!

88
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,341
Hey, hey. Which way?

89
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,386
- Here. Get down. Huddle. Huddle.
- Let's go. Get down.

90
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,971
Hey, hey. Which way?

91
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,474
- Here. Get down. Huddle. Huddle.
- Let's go. Get down.

92
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,525
- Down!
- Let me in there.

93
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,444
Okay, good. Hang on.

94
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,572
Look what Korea's doing.
Just be mindful, just be mindful.

95
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,490
They're gonna tactical up.

96
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,023
Get down, Japan's open!

97
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,066
Let's go, let's go!

98
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,150
Here they come.

99
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,613
Here they come.

100
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,909
Hey! Look!

101
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,018
<i>They were all strong,</i>
<i>but Japan's women were exceptional.</i>

102
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,853
Get back!

103
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,022
Get back!

104
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,736
<i>They were well positioned.</i>
<i>Whenever I tried to force my way through,</i>

105
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,489
<i>they would lower their stances</i>
<i>and push back.</i>

106
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,157
<i>Even when I went for their necks,</i>

107
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,493
<i>they immediately pivoted away from me.</i>

108
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,289
<i>With the sand, it felt like a sumo match.</i>

109
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,958
<i>And we couldn't lose that.</i>

110
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,973
Looks like
it's time for us to push back, huh?

111
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,599
Come on. Let's do this.

112
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,394
Get 'em on there,
get 'em on there. Get 'em on there.

113
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,312
Okay.

114
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,775
- All right, let's circle 'em.
- Around the plot, guys. That's it.

115
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,652
All right, let's calm down.

116
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,614
Don't worry.

117
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,867
Let's pull in.

118
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,493
Just stay close, okay?

119
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,621
<i>I thought we were stronger than Indonesia.</i>

120
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,915
Just try us, we'll see who wins.

121
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,224
One minute left!

122
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,119
Closer. Closer.

123
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,454
Yes.

124
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,276
<i>The strategy we came up with</i>
<i>for the game was pretty simple.</i>

125
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,322
<i>The bigger, stronger teammates</i>
<i>would protect and shield the smaller ones.</i>

126
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:55,243
<i>And the smaller teammates would look</i>
<i>for any defensive gaps and move in.</i>

127
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,578
<i>But our opponents ended up being</i>

128
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,122
<i>much stronger than we thought they'd be.</i>

129
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,792
<i>Even I ended up being pushed</i>
<i>off of the platform.</i>

130
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,962
<i>There were so much happening,</i>
<i>it was hard to focus.</i>

131
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,339
- How much time?
- My left arm's gonna drop.

132
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,216
- Hang in there.
- Almost.

133
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,425
Thirty seconds!

134
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,178
Thirty seconds!

135
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,934
- Get ready! One, two…
- Lock it in guys.

136
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,144
- And pull!
- Come on!

137
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,691
Grab him! Grab him!

138
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,526
Okay! Good!

139
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,944
- Get up.
- Come on!

140
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,281
- Just hold on, guys.
- Hang on. Almost there!

141
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,533
Hold on!
They've got Dong-hyun! Don't let go.

142
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,617
Move this way.

143
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,369
<i>We couldn't lose that quickly.</i>

144
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,039
<i>Let's see what everyone makes of us now.</i>

145
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,792
<i>We'll show them just how much</i>
<i>of a threat we can be.</i>

146
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,462
- Come on! Hang on!
- Just hold on, guys!

147
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,214
- Almost there!
- Hold on!

148
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,259
- They've got Dong-hyun! Don't let go.
- Hold on! Come on!

149
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,385
Get up!

150
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,311
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>I'd ever been lifted.</i>

151
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,063
<i>And their strength really,</i>
<i>really caught me off-guard.</i>

152
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,907
<i>I wouldn't give up.</i>

153
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,761
Be ready for someone
to attack us. The whole team, come on.

154
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,305
- Stay on, stay on! Watch your flank!
- Yep, yep, yep.

155
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,849
Stay on!

156
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,603
Positions. Positions, guys.
Positions. Positions. Positions.

157
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,481
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

158
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,024
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

159
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,820
<i>Jeepney blitz, this strategy</i>
<i>could not work if you tried it too early.</i>

160
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,155
JUSTIN COVENEY
NATIONAL TEAM RUGBY PLAYER

161
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,658
You get on there early,
you get in there with a minute and a half,

162
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,159
everyone's gonna throw you off.

163
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,452
So what we discussed is,

164
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,829
we would leave it
till the last 20 seconds.

165
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,043
- Now, now, now. Ready?
- Now.

166
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,294
Jeepney blitz.

167
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,254
Jeepney blitz.

168
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,758
Look! They're gonna ruck,
they're gonna ruck, they're gonna ruck!

169
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,718
Jeepney blitz. Three,

170
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,887
two,

171
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,514
one. Let's go.

172
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,099

That's time.

Hold it, hold it, hold it!

184
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,852
Okay.

185
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,312
How many? How many?

186
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,232
You don't want this!

187
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,984
You don't want this!

00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,618
That was close.

192
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,582
All right, we got a good plan.

193
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,584
Nice work, team.

194
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,215
Nice, guys.

We really did our best.

209
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,214
…like a piece of cake.

210
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,257
Honestly, I was surprised…

ROBERT WHITTAKER

212
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,885
…no one stood up to us.

<i>Nobody even tried.</i>

214
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,805
Stay on! Stay on! Stay on!

We're in this.

216
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,225
You gotta have a go.

217
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,810
One second.

218
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,894
Okay.

219
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,729

MANNY PACQUIAO - BOXER

225
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:54,667
Our jeepney blitz was extremely effective.
Our strategy really ended up paying off.

226
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,046
<i>It wasn't just effective, it was effective</i>
<i>because we worked together as a team.</i>

227
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:03,092
And we ended up really leaving
a strong first impression.

228
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,385

Grab the female players.

244
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,121
Grab the female players.

245
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,789
Grab her! Grab her!

246
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,421
<i>I mean… Their strength was just…</i>

247
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,215
Wow.

248
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,051
What can I say?

249
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,344
Impenetrable.

250
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,808
Seung-yeon.

251
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,353
- Hold on. Let's wait.
- Wait it out?

252
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,813
Wait it out. Wait it out.

253
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,523
Come on!

254
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,359
Having a big, scary guy on the edge

255
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,611
is a good way to deter
Korea's female players.

256
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,154
But still, what are they doing?

257
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,949
Korea's in danger
if they don't try to fight back.

258
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,241
Then the rematch is pointless.

259
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,660
Grab her!

260
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,204
Watch out! There's two on the outside!

261
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,580
Two on the outside!

262
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,791
Thirty-eight seconds!

263
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,421
- Sung-bin, come here. Hold on.
- I got it!

264
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,842
Get down, guys. Get down. Just like this.

265
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,260
Let's form a chain, okay?

266
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,013
- Take my hand.
- Here. Now lock arms with me.

267
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,264
Lock, lock!

268
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,100
Let them fight.

269
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,394
That's okay.

270
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,147
Stay calm. We'll let them have this.

271
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,565
Let's go, Indonesia.

272
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,069
They're practically sitting. I'll go up.

273
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,322
- Is there two teams against one?
- They're going in for the peel now.

274
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,074
They got heavier competitors.

275
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,534
Now they're gonna pick them off--

276
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,246
Like a chain, okay? Just like a chain.

277
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,582
- Lock arms, guys! Come on! Lock arms.
- Here they come. Don't move.

278
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,293
- Let's start here!
- Come on, come on!

279
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,587
- Come here!
- Pull, pull, pull!

280
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,673
Good, good, good! Now set them down!

281
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,300
This way! This way, bring them here.

282
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,553
- No, no, no! No more!
- Don't let go of me!

283
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,681
Hey, Glenn! Glenn!
Just hang on. Just hang on.

284

<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

285

Hey, watch out! Be careful.

286
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,313
Come on! Over here!

287
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,983
<i>I think Türkiye's strategy was just,</i>

288
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,318
<i>don't let the female contestants</i>

289
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,029
Sit down.

290
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,449
Sung-bin, do you see them?
We need the girls up here.

291
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,243
The women are outside!
Pull the men out now!

292
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,539
- Push!
- Watch out.

293
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,416
Push!

294
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,295
We need the girls up here!
We need them now!

295
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,257
<i>I think Korea's one</i>
<i>of the more experienced teams here,</i>

296
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,509
which makes them stand out above the rest.

297
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,511
<i>They are notably strong contenders.</i>

298
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,056

<i>They were relentless,</i>

304
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,112
I just kept pushing back
out of pure spite.

305
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,074
The women are outside!
Pull the men out now!

306

All right! You got her? Great! Let's go!

309
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,301
- Come here, guys! Hurry up!
- Come on! Charge!

310
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,511
Just hang on.

311
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,096
If my legs slips, I'm out!

312
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,764
Just hold like this, Glenn.

313
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,266
We're gonna get really low, okay?
Really low.

314
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,893
- You ready? Go! Come on, now!
- Come on.

315
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,103
Wait, wait!

316

Jeepney blitz!

317
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,817
Oh, they're rucking! They're rucking!

318
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,401
They can't, they're lying down.

319
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,239

- Ogeday?
- No, same, same. No.

332
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,305
Looks like we managed
to push someone out at the end.

333
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,056
- We did?
- Yeah, one person.

334

they just said, right?

345
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,551
It is what it is, yeah?
We just have to accept it. With grace.

00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,606
<i>At the end of the match,</i>

350
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,610
<i>the two teams who have the most members</i>
<i>on the plot will move on to Round Two.</i>

351
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,695
Come on! Let's go! Bring it home!

352
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,072
Come on!

353
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,827
<i>The match time is one minute.</i>

354
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,540
<i>We had to think about</i>
<i>how to approach this.</i>

355
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,878
<i>If we wanted to win,</i>
<i>we needed another plan.</i>

356
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,214
The jeepney blitz was great, but…

357
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,634
we came up with a lot of different ideas
during the strategy meeting.

358
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:04,054
<i>But Justin was the one</i>
<i>who thought of approaching Mongolia.</i>

359
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,974
<i>Not only would it give</i>
<i>both of us an advantage,</i>

360
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,559
but also in a more logistical sense,

361
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,312
our strategy would be
twice as strong as before.

362
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,737
<i>Standby.</i>

363
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,863
All right.

364
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,617
<i>Ready.</i>

365
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,250
Let's go! Come on!

366
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,257
Come on, go as fast as you can!

367
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,175
Hurry. Let's go.

368
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,468
Okay!

369
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,721
Huh?

370
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,599
Oh, Türkiye.

371
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,268
- Oh, my gosh!
- Let's go!

372
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,145
- I got it!
- It's ours.

373
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,271
Hurry up!

374
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,107
- It's ours. Everyone ready?
- Come on.

375
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,651
Get up here.
Positions, positions. Come on.

376
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,612
Oh, okay.

377
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,489
- They teamed up.
- They did, huh?

378
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,408
Look, they're all linked together.

379
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,744
That's amazing, honestly.

380
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,205
Join, join, join!
Mongolia, Mongolia, Mongolia!

381
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,790
Hey, over here!

382
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,959
Let's go, team. Follow me.

383
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,881
- What's going on?
- It looks like Türkiye and Korea

384
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,716
- are teaming up.
- Wait, seriously?

385
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,925
10 MINUTES AGO

386
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,469
- Good fight. Good fight.
- Yeah.

387
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,636
- Two teams?
- Yeah?

388
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,181
Two teams?
Did you say two teams this round?

389
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,308
- Together? Together?
- Ah, got it.

390
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,476
- Two on two?
- Yeah.

391
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,854
- Enemy of my enemy is my friend. Okay?
- All right, two teams.

392
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,272
Teaming up.

393
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,233
- They're gonna be teaming up.
- Yeah, for sure.

394
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:44,738
<i>What I noticed was, to my left,</i>
<i>I see Amotti and Dong-hyun Kim</i>

395
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,032
<i>walk over to the Turkish team.</i>

396
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,202
And I could tell.
At that moment, I looked at our team,

397
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,871
I said, "Look, we need to
team up with Mongolia."

398
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,166
- Over here, everyone.
- Let's go clockwise.

399
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,542
Come! Hurry!

400
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,795
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

401
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,297
This side, this side.

402
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,259
- Turn. Hurry. We gotta turn.
- Turn!

403
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,806
- Let's huddle up. Go!
- Turn, turn, turn!

404
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,726
<i>All the men made this circle,</i>
<i>with the women inside.</i>

405
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,271
And their job was to support us
from behind, like pillars,

406
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,439
and push us forward.

407
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,483
<i>And while they were inside the circle,</i>

408
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,901
<i>they'd stay locked together.</i>

409
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,612
<i>That gave our team</i>
<i>three layers of protection.</i>

410
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,738
<i>It was foolproof.</i>

411
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,740
Build it, build it. Hurry!

412
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,451
- Move as one. Get down.
- Grab on first.

413
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,869
- Get in formation.
- Keep moving.

414
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,122
- Huddle!
- Fifteen, fifteen!

415
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,249
- Fifteen!
- Build it, build it!

416
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,584
<i>A scrum is really, really technical.</i>

417
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,752
But we made our way,

418
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,005
and there were language barriers,
as there is with different countries.

419
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,301
<i>We agreed that we would</i>
<i>form a joint scrum, a joint jeepney,</i>

420
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:52,055
<i>and blitz with about</i>
<i>20 to 15 seconds to go.</i>

421
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,683
Go, Ali, go Ali! Go Ali!

422
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,810
- Ali, go, go, go!
- Push 'em out!

423
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,401
- Twenty seconds!
- Twenty!

424
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,195
Turn! Turn! Left, left turn! Left turn!

425
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,995
- Fifteen!
- Let's go!

426
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,052
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

427
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,140
Wow, wow, wow!

428
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,771
Stick together, guys!
Don't move. Don't move!

429
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,029
Stick together, guys!
Don't move. Don't move!

430
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,741
- Get up here, guys. Come on!
- Hang on!

431
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,951
- Hang on! Four, three…
- Pull! Pull!

432
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,787
- Hang on!
- Hurry, hurry! Come on!

433
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,918
<i>Stop.</i>

434
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,422
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

435
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,351
- How did we do?
- No clue.

436
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,229
Was there anyone else out?

437
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,106
I was inside when the whistle blew.

438
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,399
Really?

439
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,734
I went out after.

440
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,737
- Now that was cool to see.
- The alliances?

441
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,322
It's a good idea.

442
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,783
<i>Rematch.</i>

443
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,952
<i>Korea,</i>

444
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,662
<i>Mongolia…</i>

445
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,998
<i>…and…</i>

446
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,591
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

447
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,011
<i>…and Türkiye.</i>

448
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,388
- Yes!
- All right!

449
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,597
Let's go!

450
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,560
So just those three right?
Okay. Three teams.

451
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,896
<i>It was just pure disappointment.</i>

452
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,439
JUSTIN COVENEY
NATIONAL TEAM RUGBY PLAYER

453
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,484
Yeah, it was a really,
sort of depressing moment.

454
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,157
<i>We will now proceed</i>
<i>with our third round of overtime.</i>

455
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,036
<i>For this round of overtime,</i>
<i>one plot remains.</i>

456
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,623
Mongolia's gonna be teamed up on.

457
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,083
Yeah, they're gonna get slaughtered.

458
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,212
<i>With the Philippines out</i>
<i>and having seen the other alliance,</i>

459
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,799
<i>I knew Korea and Türkiye</i>
<i>would keep their united front.</i>

460
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,428
<i>All we could do was try again.</i>

461
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,307
Okay!

462
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,600
Let's go again.

463
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,936
Yes.

464
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,105
It's all right, Recep. Don't rush.

465
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,608
They're gonna do the same tactic.

466
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,818
<i>One team against two.</i>

467
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,029
- Let's take them both down!
- Get around 'em.

468
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,240
<i>Honestly, as long as we get in there</i>

469
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,450
<i>and give it our all…</i>

470
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,413
<i>there's no reason</i>
<i>to feel any sort of regret.</i>

471
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,333
Drag them out one by one!

472
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,963
<i>We came into that fight</i>
<i>fiercer than ever before.</i>

473
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,675
<i>We earned our respect.</i>

474
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,054
Hey! I need help!

475
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,806
- Here!
- Almost there.

476
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,975
Okay, let's do it! Together!

477
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,399
Come here, guys.
Almost there. Everyone in.

478
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,695
Ten seconds!

479
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,030
Everyone, get in!

480
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,786
Five! Four!

481
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,746
Hurry! Hurry! Get in there!

482
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,165
Three! Two!

483
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,876
- Hurry! Hurry! Get in there!
- One!

484
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,548
<i>Game over.</i>

485
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,258
Mongolia?

486
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,302
Korea's been eliminated?

487
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,101
<i>The final survivors from Round One</i>

488
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,770
<i>are Korea and Türkiye.</i>

489
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,940
We were just getting started.

490
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,152
<i>I think we could've</i>
<i>done better. A lot better.</i>

491
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,613
So I was pretty disappointed in the end.

492
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,075
<i>Round one, final results.</i>

493
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,743
<i>The four teams advancing to Round Two</i>

494
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,163
<i>are Japan, Australia, Türkiye and Korea.</i>

495
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,125
Physical: Asia.

496
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,836
<i>Territory Conquest: Round Two.</i>

497
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,507
<i>For this second round,</i>
<i>only two plots remain.</i>

498
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,136
<i>Before we begin,</i>

499
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,973
<i>the remaining teams</i>
<i>will select their new starting positions.</i>

500
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,266
Let's target Team Australia.

501
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,517
Just ram right into 'em.

502
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,601
- Exactly.
- Sounds good.

503
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,936
Knock 'em down in one go.

504
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,230
We settled on Australia
as our target right away.

505
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,815
RECEP KARA
FORMER NATIONAL TEAM OIL WRESTLER

506
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,443
We were pretty determined
to knock 'em down a peg.

507
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,986
You could hear them going,

508
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,280
"Oh, are you too scared? Afraid to lose?"

509
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,364
Things like that.

510
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,533
They were cocky.

511
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,161
No one came. No one came.

512
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,954
Okay, next turn.

513
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,832
Next turn versus, ah?
Okay, easy money. Yeah.

514
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,501
- Easy money, easy money.
- Okay, easy money. Yeah.

515
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,753
You don't want this smoke.

516
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,796
- Okay.
- No one wanted this smoke.

517
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,091
They were confident,
but they were so confident,

518
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,468
you just had to destroy them.

519
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,761
So I told my team,

520
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,387
"Australia's next."

521
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,931
They're talking about coming at us,
I think. Turkey?

522
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,933
- Yeah.
- Yeah. They're, like, looking at us,

523
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,351
and talking back to their team.

524
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,686
Talk all you want.

525
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,396
But bring it to action and beat us.

526
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,190
Show us. Show us what you got.

527
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,860
If it comes down to a one-on-one,
I think we can beat Korea.

528
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,070
- Yeah, I'd say that's a safe bet.
- Yeah.

529
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,158
Given the choice,
looking at the other three teams,

530
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,619
I knew we had to go after Team Korea.

531
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,537
We had to destroy them here.

532
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,290
I think our best option is Japan.

533
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,584
Both Australia and Japan lack experience.

534
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,337
But if we pick Australia,
Japan will get off easy.

535
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,172
I know we'll be able to beat them.

536
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,007
I'm confident in that choice.

537
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,759
<i>Ready.</i>

538
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,013
LOCATION SELECTION

539
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,057
Come on. Come on.

540
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,769
Okay. Come on!

541
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:18,107
<i>The selection has ended. All</i>
<i>starting positions have now been reset.</i>

542
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,276
Turkey's on us, isn't it?

543
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,361
- Sweet.
- Yeah, perfect.

544
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,654
I don't think they want us though.

545
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,031
No. Turkey's no-no.

546
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,575
It's a battle of the giants.

547
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,786
They're staring us down over there.

548
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,287
Doesn't matter.

549
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,915
We'll be face-to-face soon enough.

550
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,293
All right. It's Korea.

551
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,712
It's showtime.

552
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,506
This should be an easy win.

553
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,176
Goodbye. Goodbye.

554
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,763
Goodbye. Goodbye.

555
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,393
Losing to Korea wasn't an option.

556
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,311
We had to win.

557
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,647
For the finals, guys. Ready?

558
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,773
Korea!

559
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,316
Fight on!

560
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,486
- One, two, three.
- Go, Japan!

561
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,282
<i>Stand by.</i>

562
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,536
Godspeed, guys.

563
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,329
- Let's go.
- Let's do our best.

564
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,166
Ready? Here we go.

565
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,086
<i>Ready.</i>

566
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,171
Size against skill.

567
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,548
That's, like, insane.

568
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,051
It's gonna get aggressive. Just watch.

569
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,597
Oh, man, I feel so nervous.
Like my chest hurts.

570
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,352
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

571
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,249
<i>It was like a head-on collision! Bang!</i>

572
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,335
<i>Both teams were notably big,</i>

573
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,670
<i>but they were equally skilled too.</i>

574
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,339
Careful, guys!

575
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,840
Push, push, push.

576
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,884
Yasemin!

577
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,345
Here!

578
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,431
<i>It was like</i>
<i>I was watching the ultimate battle.</i>

579
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,605
Oh, no way.

580
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,981
They're really going at it.

581
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,865
- Was that the judo fighter?
- Yeah, that's him.

582
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,992
Oh, they're all tied up. Wow!

583
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,120
Sit down, sit down. Okay. Good.

584
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,205
Is anyone out?

585
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,082
Hold on to me! Get a grip! That's it.

586
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,751
Just don't let go.

587
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,256
Hey, let go of me! Let go!

588
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,389
- Let go.
- Where's Min-jae?

589
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,890
Min-jae, stop them.

590
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,771
I've got him.
Send him this way! Get him, Min-jae.

591
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,147
<i>He was so small,</i>

592
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,149
<i>I thought he'd be easy to fend off.</i>

593
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,567
<i>But he put me in this hold,</i>

594
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,860
<i>and I couldn't get out.</i>

595
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,154
<i>He may have been small,</i>
<i>but he was no pushover.</i>

596
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,698
<i>I had to adapt.</i>

597
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,616
So I decided to just keep him
out of the ring with me.

598
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,701
KIM MIN-JAE
SSIREUM WRESTLER

599
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,662
I hate to say it, but it did kind of feel
like I was going up against an amateur.

600
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,122
SOICHI HASHIMOTO
NATIONAL TEAM JUDOKA

601
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:23,209
<i>To be fair, I've had a lot of experience</i>
<i>fighting bigger opponents,</i>

602
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,712
<i>so I was confident I could hold him off.</i>

603
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,303
Get off me.

604
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,597
Off you go.

605
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,571
<i>Look, I'm a forty-three year old man.</i>

606
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,281
<i>This challenge was draining.</i>

607
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,576
<i>And Team Australia's ridiculously strong.</i>

608
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,286
They weren't gonna give up out there.

609
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,246
But we weren't gonna give up either.

610
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,874
Hold me, hold me, hold me.

611
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,835
- Got you, got you.
- Hold me, hold me.

612
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,464
One second.

613
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,592
Yeah, come back, just a bit.

614
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,558
<i>Looking over at Turkey,</i>
<i>I could tell they wanted it.</i>

615
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,270
<i>But I felt like we were gonna win.</i>

616
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,647
Grab those. Grab those.

617
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,649
One minute left.

618
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,284
Hold on. Hold on.

619
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,244
- Hold on.
- Okay.

620
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,996
Get 'em.

621
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,956
Let's give Sung-bin a push.

622
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,666
Amotti, pivot towards your knees.

623
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,751
Hold on.

624
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,419
- I can't grab him!
- He lifted him!

625
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,962
Hold on. I can't grab him!

626
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,297
He lifted him!

627
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,511
It's like he's swimming.

628
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,764
He lifted him! Now slam him down!

629
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,943
- There's still time, Sung-bin!
- Fifty seconds!

630
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,529
It's okay. We're good! We're good.

631
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,030
What's the time?

632
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,448
Time's almost up.

633
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,242
- We're good.
- 45 seconds.

634
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,993
Just a bit more. Okay?

635
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,537
Somebody's grabbing on to me.

636
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,622
- Tighter, Seung-yeon!
- Hold tighter.

637
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,290
- Keep holding, Nonoka.
- Okay.

638
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,336
Min-jae! Keep him pinned to the end!

639
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,380
Forty more seconds!

640
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,508
- Get her off.
- Hold.

641
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,718
Hold.

642
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,514
<i>It was an incredibly</i>
<i>difficult fight out there.</i>

643
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,059
<i>But the more we fought,</i>
<i>the more adrenaline we had.</i>

644
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,689
<i>The hard thing was</i>

645
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,691
one of their girls ran straight up

646
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,276
and tried to take…

647
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,319
<i>There was still time,</i>

648
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,155
<i>and we were all fired up.</i>

649
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,120
Can she take those two guys?

650
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,788
She's a world champion wrestler, man.

651
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,960
Take a knee.

652
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,211
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

653
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,631
- Thirty seconds!
- Come on. Thirty seconds!

654
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,091
The turnaround…

655
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,634
Sung-bin, I'm gonna let you go

656
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,719
for 30 seconds!

657
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,391
<i>He was much stronger than he looked.</i>

658
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,853
<i>Even with the difference</i>
<i>in our weight classes, he was strong.</i>

659
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,480
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I'm not much of an aggressive athlete.</i>

660
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,317
<i>So being locked in that hold</i>
<i>was really overwhelming.</i>

661
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,779
Fifteen more seconds, guys.

662
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,281
Fifteen seconds left.

663
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,699
We're tied anyway.

664
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,036
- Hurry up.
- Almost there.

665
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,581
- Is everyone here?
- Get on, get on.

666
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,832
- Nefise!
- Get Anıl!

667
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,709
- On, on!
- Come on. Get up here!

668
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,379
- Get Anıl!
- Nefise!

669
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,006
Come on, get up here!

670
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,176
Get on this.

671
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,262
Get off it.

672
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,389
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

673
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,100
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Come on!

674
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,602
Recep, we need one more!

675
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,145
- Seven seconds.
- Five…

676
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,230
Five seconds!

677
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,900
This is where the match begins.

678
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,110
Come on. Finish it. Push someone out!

679
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,030
<i>I was gonna shake him off</i>
<i>and climb back up,</i>

680
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,365
<i>but he wouldn't budge.</i>

681
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,663
4, 3, 2, 1.

682
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,041
Okay.

683
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,085
Okay.

684
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,503
- Sudden death.
- We win?

685
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,421
- No. Tied Again.
- How did we do?

686
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,798
How about them?

687
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,299
Did Türkiye actually win?

688
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,467
Australia won?

689
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,593
I think so.

690
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,553
7 SECONDS AGO

691
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:48,015
- Recep, we need one more. 7 Seconds.
- Five-- Five seconds!

692
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,809
Four! Guys!

693
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,936
Three, two…

694
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,146
Three, two…

695
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,991
Yeah!

696
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,951
Two!

697
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,621
Yeah!

698
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,669
- Yes! We did it!
- They won?

699
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,587
Turkey wins.

700
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,840
- No.
- Yes.

701
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,466
Yes, man!

702
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,346
<i>The surviving country from Round Two,</i>

703
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,223
<i>is Türkiye.</i>

704
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,934
Bring it in, guys!

705
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:36,772
One, two, three, Türkiye! Yeah!

706
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,857
Bravo!

707
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,567
- Good round. Good round.
- Yeah.

708
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,362
<i>I feel guilty for that,</i>

709
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,740
<i>'cause everyone else was on there,</i>

710
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,701
<i>and I was not on there.</i>

711
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,454
I really felt like I let my team down

712
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:55,499
and just felt so horrible after that.

713
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,295
I just never… I knew I never wanted
to feel that feeling again.

714
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,630
They had a great game plan.

715
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,633
Like, I've gotta give them respect
and props when it's due.

716
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,052
But I'm very proud of my team,

717
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,261
the way we came together.

718
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,056
The heart they all showed.
The heart we all showed.

719
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,224
It felt just as good
as winning a championship.

720
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,517
NEFISE KARATAY
FORMER NATIONAL TRACK ATHLETE

721
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,520
And our team's strategy?
Absolute perfection.

722
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,898
Team Australia
was completely blue in the face!

723
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,608
Man, I'm so happy and proud
of us right now!

724

YASEMIN ADAR YIGIT
NATIONAL TEAM WRESTLER

725
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,861
Honestly, I'm getting a little emotional.

726
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,780
I'm holding my head high.

727
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,406
<i>Rematch.</i>

728
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,868
<i>Korea versus Japan.</i>

729
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,746
Sorry, guys.

730
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,831
You had, like, 17 matches today.

731
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,458
Crazy.

732
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,003
Let's go again.
We need to make up the difference somehow.

733
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,088
Right.

734
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,757
Dong-hyun, and that <i>ssireum </i>fighter,
the big guy.

735
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,258
As long as they're standing,

736
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,386
Korea's a near-impenetrable force.

737
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,263
Our first priority
is taking those two down.

738
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,390
KIM MIN-JAE
SSIREUM WRESTLER

739
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,058
That first round,
Soichi had me pinned down.

740
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,310
I was so annoyed that I couldn't get out.

741
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,188
But that just made me
wanna to take him on again.

742
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,568
<i>Territorial Conquest, Round Two</i>

743
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,696
<i>will now proceed into overtime.</i>

744
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,033
<i>The match time is one minute.</i>

745
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,828
- <i>Korea…</i>
- Let's go, guys.

746
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,496
Let's make this the last one.

747
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,622
<i>…versus Japan.</i>

748
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,542
Let's go!

749
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,210
Fight hard!

750
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,045
Korea!

751
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,297
I wonder if Korea's just gonna bow down.

752
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,590
That's fine.

753
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,092
Oh, no. They've got Big Boy.

754
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,176
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

755
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,387
- Korea's got Big Boy.
- Yeah.

756
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,013
But Japan's got fighters.

757
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,515
Yeah.

758
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,601
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Ready?

759
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,228
We're gonna sprint.

760
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,896
I'll block this side.

761
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,065
One last minute.

762
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,153
<i>Ready.</i>

763
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,837
Seung-yeon!

764
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,931
<i>We all know</i>
<i>that Itoi has an amazing physique,</i>

765
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,726
<i>so I figured he'd be pretty tough</i>
<i>to throw off.</i>

766
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,394
Turns out, it's nearly impossible.

767
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,814
<i>I just couldn't shake him off.</i>

768
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,903
What is this?

769
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,197
- Who did he just pick up?
- Man, can you believe that?

770
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,791
What is this?

771
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,084
Who's he got? Who's he got?

772
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,545
- Oh, he's got the swimmer. That's why.
- Oh, my God.

773
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,214
Yeah, Sung-bin!

774
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,840
Holy moly!

775
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,512
Sung-bin's throwing him down the hill.

776
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,180
Hold him!

777
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,642
<i>I was terrified.</i>

778
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,019
<i>It felt like I'd been taken</i>
<i>by some kind of monster.</i>

779
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,896
But when I took a second to look around,

780
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,273
<i>I noticed everyone was in the same boat.</i>

781
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,484
<i>Each person was in a one-on-one.</i>

782
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,862
<i>I had this feeling in my gut,</i>
<i>and I thought,</i>

783
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,616
<i>"The only way we can win is</i>
<i>if I can fight back." I had to stop him.</i>

784
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,161
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

785
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,581
All right.

786
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,375
- I've got them! Min-jae, Min-jae!
- Soichi, go, go!

787
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,751
- Go!
- Don't let anyone out!

788
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,295
Keep them out.

789
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,256
Keep them…

790
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,549
Min-jae, wait!

791
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,054
Shift your weight!

792
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:38,973
Use your knees!

793
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,896
<i>I didn't care what they did</i>
<i>to me, I wasn't going to budge.</i>

794
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,779
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

795
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,489
Let's go! Ten, nine--

796
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,949
Come on! Come on!

797
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,921
Five, four!

798
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,423
Dong-hyun, get in here!

799
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,550
Dong-hyun, get in here!

800
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,885
Get in here!

801
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:18,929
Stop, stop.

802
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,559
- <i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>
- Is that 3-3?

803
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,729
Okay, one more!

804
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:27,938
One more time, guys!

805
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,572
One more, one more, one more!

806
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,533
Yes, Japan! Let's go!

807
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,078
Ah!

808
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,665
<i>There was one disappointing moment.</i>

809
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,209
I'd gotten a hold of Okami,

810
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,838
<i>I got him. I flipped him under,</i>
<i>and then I climbed back up.</i>

811
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,090
<i>But in the last two seconds…</i>

812
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,176
<i>…he managed to climb back up with me.</i>

813
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,803
They're just a strong team.

814
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,766
It wasn't anything I was doing, because,
physically, I couldn't do anything.

815
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,977
<i>And that same scenario</i>
<i>just kept repeating.</i>

816
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,189
<i>Advancing to the next round was difficult.</i>

817
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,317
- <i>Rematch.</i>
- Okay, team.

818
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,278
<i>Korea versus Japan.</i>

819
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,156
Okay. Push through it.
Use all our strength.

820
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,367
- Let's go!
- Fight on!

821
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,702
- Ready?
- Ready.

822
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,372
They're not having a good time, Korea.

823
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,791
Korea's just on a rematch bender.

824
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:29,875
Shows their…

825
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,294
It shows their willingness
to be on the platform.

826
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,797
Hey, are you just gonna
watch them take it from us?

827
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,091
We're the stars here, all right?
Remember that.

828
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,217
<i>Stand by.</i>

829
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,719
They're exhausted. It's one minute.

830
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,471
<i>Ready.</i>

831
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,201
Okay, okay, okay!

832
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,874
Let's go, Sung-bin!

833
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,342
Oh, single! Nice single leg.

834
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,847
That's it, guys! Come on!

835
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,348
Don't let go, guys!

836
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,268
Pin him from the top! Yes!

837
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,646
Pin him! Pin him!

838
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,398
- That's my guy!
- Pin him!

839
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,862
<i>Yun Sung-bin.</i>
<i>That guy's nuts. He's very, very strong.</i>

840
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,364
I saw him lift Nakamura
during the last round.

841
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,742
I looked up for one second
to get my bearings,

842
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,036
<i>just to see Sung-bin</i>
<i>hauling him over his shoulder.</i>

843
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,207
What was I thinking?
"Sure! I can hold him off!"

844
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,418
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

845
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,963
How many are there?

846
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,508
They're tired. They're losing steam.

847
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,470
Go, go, go, guys! Push 'em out!

848
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,638
- Like this.
- Okay, I'll lift.

849
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,098
- No, pull.
- Sorry. Got it.

850
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,268
- Sorry. Got it.
- Help me, gonna fall!

851
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,811
Here. I'm coming.

852
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,272
- Twenty seconds.
- Here. I'm coming.

853
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,358
Hey! What are you doing?

854
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,277
Wait, come here! Hold on!

855
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,696
It's fine, I've got this guys.

856
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,828
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

857
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,831
Ten seconds!

858
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,416
Eight seconds.

859
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,128
We gotta push! Push!

860
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,546
Hey, push, push, push!

861
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,049
- Gotta push! Push!
- Push him off.

862
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,927
- Gotta push! Push!
- Push, push! Push him off!

863
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,470
Four, three…

864
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,055
His feet! Knock his feet off!

865
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,681
- Push!
- Push him off!

866
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,225
- His feet! Knock his feet off!
- Go, go, go!

867
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,231
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

868
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,609
- Oh, thank you.
- Good?

869
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,694
- Good job.
- Strong. So strong.

870
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,280
So close, Min-jae!

871
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,406
It's another draw.

872
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,574
- Again?
- Yeah.

873
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,076
- A draw?
- Yep.

874
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,080
<i>At that point, I thought,</i>
<i>"When's it gonna end?"</i>

875
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,960
<i>You start to realize just</i>
<i>how long you might have to keep fighting.</i>

876
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,920
<i>Suddenly,</i>

877
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,506
<i>the battle of strength</i>
<i>had become a battle of endurance.</i>

878
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,508
<i>We just had to wait for them to fold.</i>

879
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,885
<i>Rematch.</i>

880
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,346
<i>Ready.</i>

881
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,014
Okay, guys. One more minute.

882
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,604
<i>Having all these rematches,</i>
<i>back-to-back like that,</i>

883
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,108
<i>it just made both of us</i>
<i>all the more determined to win.</i>

884
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,944
<i>Nobody concedes at that point.</i>

885
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,904
Hey! I can't hold this!

886
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,949
<i>You just can't afford to lose.</i>

887
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,784
<i>There's no other option, you have to win.</i>

888
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,828
Come on. Loosen your grip.

889
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,956
- Okay.
- <i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

890
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:57,875
Again?

891
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,294
No, no, no…

892
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,628
<i>It just wouldn't end.</i>

893
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,630
<i>Ready.</i>

894
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,138
<i>That territory battle was excruciating.</i>

895
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:15,517
<i>And honestly, after a while,</i>
<i>I hit my limit.</i>

896
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,854
<i>My mind, my body, my soul…</i>

897
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,732
<i>I'd pushed myself to my breaking point.</i>

898
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:27,029
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

899
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,371
<i>Every time I looked at my teammates,</i>

900
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,749
<i>I could still see</i>
<i>that spark in their eyes.</i>

901
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,586
<i>It kept me going.</i>
<i>I had to win this for them.</i>

902
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,632
<i>By round five, we were in shambles,</i>

903
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,968
<i>but it didn't matter.</i>
<i>Until we won, we'd keep on fighting.</i>

904
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,641
- <i>Stop. Game over.</i>
- What happened? Did we win?

905
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,725
No, a tie.

906
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,442
At this rate, it's never gonna end.

907
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:10,364
<i>Eventually, after multiple rounds</i>
<i>and no end in sight,</i>

908
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,824
they decided to implement some new rules.

909
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,494
<i>For this match,</i>
<i>we'd start on the platform.</i>

910
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,080
<i>But this time,</i>
<i>you weren't allowed to step off.</i>

911
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,374
If you fell off the platform,
you were out.

912
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,126
So the goal was to have
the most players left standing.

913
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,379
And, just to keep it extra fair,

914
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,340
<i>each team's largest and smallest players</i>
<i>were excluded.</i>

915
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:31,385
<i>That way, both teams</i>
<i>were more evenly matched.</i>

916
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:35,639
And by agreeing to those terms,
the sixth rematch became a four-on-four.

917
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,104
I think they're all starting
on there. A four-on-four.

918
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,313
Sudden death!

919
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,983
We have to push right away.

920
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,401
They're gonna charge.

921
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,069
Should we sidestep them?

922
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,570
Nah. Straight on.

923
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,367
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Lower your body.

924
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,247
<i>We couldn't lose this.</i>
<i>It was a matter of National Pride.</i>

925
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,166
<i>We had to do it. We had to win.</i>

926
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,754
All right. Let's grab 'em.

927
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,970
- Go, go, go!
- Let's go!

928
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,764
Oh, oh! Sung-bin's on the edge there.

929
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,607
YUN SUNG-BIN OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
& YOSHIO OF JAPAN ARE OUT

930
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,151
There it is! Go, go, go!

931
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,069
- Oh, God.
- There you go.

932
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,491
Oh, oh!

933
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,911
AMOTTI OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
& KATSUMI OF JAPAN ARE OUT

934
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,164
Push someone out! Come on!

935
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,084
That's right.

936
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,297
KIM DONG-HYUN OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
& SOICHI OF JAPAN ARE OUT

937
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,633
<i>After Amotti and I</i>
<i>were thrown out at the same time,</i>

938
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,635
only the girls were left on the platform.

939
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,388
<i>And that was the moment I realized,</i>

940
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,724
<i>exactly what Japan had been planning.</i>

941
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,060
Oh, one-on-one, one-on-one.

942
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,145
- No way.
- One-on-one, one-on-one.

943
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,613
This is so cool!

944
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,823
One versus one. Girls. Girls are in.

945
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,825
Red's CrossFit, red's CrossFit.

946
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,410
And then blue is…

947
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,454
- Wrestling.
- Wrestling. Yeah.

948
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,414
- Instinct versus technique, huh?
- Especially technique.

949
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,333
- That's what it boils down to.
- We'll see.

950
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,628
<i>We had Japan's super-wrestler, Ozaki.</i>

951
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:33,340
She was the ace up our sleeve.
We knew she could win this.

952
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,552
So, I guess you could say
everything had gone according to plan.

953
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,639
<i>I'm a professional wrestler.</i>

954
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,058
<i>So I figured I'd have an advantage.</i>

955
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,726
<i>I went in confident.</i>

956
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,313
- Come on! Let's go, Seung-yeon.
- Okay.

957
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,024
<i>I'm sure that,</i>
<i>when Japan saw this matchup,</i>

958
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,318
they must've gone, "Man, we've got this."

959
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,402
But, uh…

960
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,571
I'm not discouraged by that sort of thing.

961
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,866
Honestly, I love knowing that
because it gets me fired up.

962
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:04,204
<i>So, in that moment, I was ready to win.</i>

963
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,626
<i>Stand by.</i>

964
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:15,382
<i>Whatever happens up there,</i>
<i>I'll be the last one standing.</i>

965
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,760
<i>I'm ready to go, and take her down.</i>

966
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,388
<i>Ready.</i>
