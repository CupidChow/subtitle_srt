Subtitles are color-coded by country,

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,218

3
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,387
<i>Ten minutes remain.</i>

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,764
We will now reveal the weights.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,272
Whoa! Same, same, same, same!

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,356
We're the same!

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,610
Come on.

8
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,865
We're 400 each! We're 400 each!

9
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,993
We're 400 each. Bro, we're 400 each!

10
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:35,952
Lets' go!

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,330
<i>At that stage,</i>
<i>because it said 400 kilos each…</i>

12
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:43,668
<i>So, my mind-set was to just,</i>
<i>"I have to win this."</i>

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,087
It's 400!

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,964
We're tied at 400!

15
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>I was genuinely surprised</i>

16
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:50,967
<i>that we were tied.</i>

17
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,679
<i>So I thought, "What should I do?</i>

18
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,222
<i>Was I not carrying enough?" I was nervous.</i>

19
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,227
<i>But we're a team of warriors.</i>
<i>We won't stop 'til we win.</i>

20
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,733
Wait, wait! Tie it down! It's slipping!

21
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,277
<i>I kept pushing, but it wouldn't budge.</i>

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,905
Pull!

23
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,824
<i>And then Orgil jumped in to help.</i>

24
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,243
Here, I gotcha. 'Kay.

25
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,579
All right. Good. And push!

26
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,042
I was assigned a position
that gave me a lot of flexibility.

27
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,797
<i>So I'm carrying crates,</i>
<i>I'm carrying sandbags, I'm just</i>

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,883
<i>kind of going back and forth.</i>
<i>Jumping in to help.</i>

29
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,970
- Just a bit more! Okay. Come on.
- Almost there. Go!

30
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,680
- And more.
- Okay.

31
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,933
- And there!
- Hey!

32
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,480
- Nice.
- There.

33
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,689
Good work, guys!

34
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,739
<i>Like… my focus was just,</i>

35
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,116
<i>"Keep on going, keep on going",</i>
<i>up the stairs.</i>

36
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>I just kept going. Even if I was tired,</i>
<i>I kept going to the end.</i>

37
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,378
<i>My knees began to shake.</i>
<i>My body was extremely tired.</i>

38
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,549
<i>I was sore everywhere,</i>
<i>but I just kept pushing.</i>

39
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,050
Nice!

40
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,180
Awesome job! Keep going, keep going!

41
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,683
Low, low, low!

42
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:28,690
<i>The moment I saw the boxes</i>
<i>not arriving towards me,</i>

43
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,151
<i>it was disheartening,</i>

44
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,779
<i>because I saw how fast</i>
<i>Mongolia was moving.</i>

45
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,868
<i>We just… and I still wasn't</i>
<i>receiving any crates.</i>

46
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,121
<i>I knew the only way that I could help them</i>

47
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,164
<i>was just use my voice.</i>

48
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,456
Keep it up! Great job, Manny!

49
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,250
Great job, Mark! Come on, Justin!

50
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,127

00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,185
Great work, guys!

55
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,896
Good work!

56
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,274
<i>I was encouraged when I heard</i>
<i>Robyn cheering and shouting for us,</i>

57
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,610
<i>'cause Justin and I were really dying.</i>

58
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,258
<i>We rushed through</i>
<i>the first half so quickly.</i>

59
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,094
<i>And I was really struggling</i>
<i>to breathe up there.</i>

60
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,598
<i>And, uh… there were a lot of crates, too.</i>

61
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,642
<i>It really took a toll on me.</i>

62
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,731
Shit!

63
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,487
Okay! Ready? Go!

64
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,782

69
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,924
Now hop in.

70
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,342
- No, I got it.
- You sure?

71
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,303
Just keep breathing, man.

72
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,180
Breathe through it.

73
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,434
You ready? One, two, three, yeah!

74
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,728

One more, Ray! One more!

80
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,697
One, two, three, up!

81
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,533

Yes! I got the rest! Go, go, go!

One minute, one minute. Come on.

88
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,817
Let's go, Manny!

89
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,070
Keep going!

90
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,492
Send it down!

91
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,328
Are you sure? I think that's time.

92
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,164
Yes, hurry! Come on!

- All right! Let's go, guys!

97
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,894

I don't know, I just keep picturing
some kind of.

138
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,095
- diving challenge.
- Never know.

139

Anything's possible.

140
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,764
That'd be an easy win for us.

I was like a mermaid, you know?

142
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,767
But now I'm used to land.

143
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,352
Maybe they'll have us shackle someone
to weights…

144
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,479
- Well they're in good spirits.
- …and we'll have to help them underwater.

145
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,232
You just wanna get rid of me, don't you?

146
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,067
No, wait, if you really want to…

147
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,235
We were so busy competing,

148
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,070
we didn't pay attention to our opponents.

149
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,405

- You know?

151
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,782
I didn't see their matches.

152
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,742
None of us got the chance to.

153
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,661
Just, "He didn't make it."

154
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,246
Don't know how strong he is.

155
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,747
Me either, I can't tell.

156
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,999
He's so mysterious.

157
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,417
I guess we can assume that…

158
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,459
Assume that he's strong?

159
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,460
Exactly.

160
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,504

She was in the games, right?

165
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,928
She'll have high stamina.

176
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,953
It was all a big act!

177
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,124
It's simple. We appeared relaxed,
but we never really let our guard down.

178
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,542
We had to play it safe

179
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,252
so that they didn't suspect anything.

180
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,837
20 MINUTES AGO

181
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,921
I think we can win this thing.

182
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,342
Korea seems to have
one obvious weakness: The large guy.

183
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,762
<i>I thought he'd be stronger,</i>
<i>but when I was watching him,</i>

184
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,472
<i>I noticed he relied on his weight</i>

185
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,598
<i>more than his strength.</i>

186
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,475
<i>He couldn't hold his own against</i>
<i>that short guy from Japan.</i>

187
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,601
- <i>You're right.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

188
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,728
<i>Not only that, but their female athletes</i>

189
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,314
<i>aren't strong either. They'd lose to Ploy.</i>

190
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,650
Our opponents don't know
anything about us,

191
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,860
but we know all about them.
We're at an advantage.

192
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,111
- Yeah.
- We know their strengths,

193
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,280
their weaknesses, and how to exploit them.

194
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,824
- We're not pushovers, so let's prove it.
- No way.

195
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,909
SUN
NATIONAL TEAM RUGBY PLAYER

196
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,452
<i>We didn't want them to figure out</i>

197
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,788
<i>our strengths beforehand.</i>
<i>They'd find out during the game.</i>

198
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,581
<i>We were ready for a fight.</i>

199
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,125
<i>As Team Thailand,</i>
<i>as our country's representatives,</i>

200
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,920
<i>we came here to win,</i>
<i>and we're going to win.</i>

201
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,880
- Let's go!
- Okay!

202
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,592
<i>I hope they're overconfident.</i>
<i>That means they're underestimating us.</i>

203
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,260
<i>And there's nothing I love more</i>

204
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,345
<i>than deflating their egos</i>

205
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,555
<i>by sending them home in tears.</i>

206
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,309
<i>I'll be watching the whole time.</i>
<i>Like I'm some kind of crazy person.</i>

207
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,821
Let's… Whoa!

208
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,407
What is this, man? This is insane!

209
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,575
Seriously, it's amazing.

210
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,079
Wow.

211
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,331
What?

212
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,834
No way!

213
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,378
Just look at the scale of this!

214
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,172
Physical: Asia.

215
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,801
<i>We will now begin the second quest.</i>

216
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,387
<i>This quest will determine</i>
<i>our first elimination:</i>

217
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,639
<i>the Shipwreck Transportation Battle.</i>

218
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,976
- What?
- Awesome.

219
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,894
What is this?

220
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,440
<i>It was crazy. Like, unbelievable.</i>

221
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,983
It's just massive!

222
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,236
It's like a set
straight out of Universal Studios.

223
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,780
- Okay.
- Okay.

224
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,699
- It's endurance. Yeah.
- A battle of endurance.

225
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,909
<i>Objectively speaking,</i>

226
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,163
in terms of strength, endurance,
everything, our team outclassed theirs.

227
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,166
<i>Well, to me, it seemed like</i>
<i>the kind of challenge</i>

228
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,500
<i>our team would excel at.</i>

229
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,336
<i>Whatever it was, it looked like fun.</i>

230
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,046
It was something different.

231
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,383
But I liked that. I liked that we got to
do something new. It's more fun that way.

232
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,219
- All right, guys. Let's bring it in.
- All right, let's bring it in!

233
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,765
- Korea…
- Fight on!

234
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,516
All right.

235
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,851
All right, let's have some fun.

236
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,436
- Ready?
- All right, we've got this. Thailand…

237
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,562
Let's go!

238
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,274
<i>Now, then. </i>Physical: Asia.

239
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,151
<i>Second Quest.</i>

240
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,070
- <i>The Shipwreck Transportation Battle.</i>
- Let's go, go, go!

241
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:04,158
<i>The match between Korea and Thailand</i>
<i>will begin momentarily.</i>

242
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,827
<i>Stand by.</i>

243
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,870
Come on, come on.

244
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,914
Get ready, get ready, get ready.

245
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,749
- <i>Ready.</i>
- Let's do it.

246
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,083
Let's work together.

247
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,002
And prove we're in a different league.

248
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,256
<i>I know that we're going to win.</i>

249
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,674
Ready.

250
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,843
Run! Run!

251
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,011
Go, go, go!

252
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,805
- Careful.
- Right. Watch your step.

253
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,265
Let's go.

254
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,193
- Oh, it's metal! Good.
- Okay.

255
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,404
- Watch it.
- Check your harness. Double check.

256
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,242
Come on, guys! Run! Run! Run! Run!

257
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,661
Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!

258
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,538
We're falling behind! Move faster, guys!

259
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,622
Careful, guys!

260
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,500
We don't know how deep the water is! Okay.

261
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,668
It's pretty steep!

262
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,670
James, we're falling behind!

263
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,754
Hurry up!

264
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,757
As fast as you can, James! You too, Sun!

265
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,884
We're behind, so start with the crates.

266
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,929
Get me a crate first!

267
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,390
Okay, you heard her. Crates first. Here.

268
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,891
- I can handle it.
- All right.

269
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,393
'Kay. One, two, three! Okay.

270
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,936
Run! Run! They're coming back!

271
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,606
Good job, good job! We're ahead! Let's go!

272
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:22,069
<i>As long as two of us worked</i>
<i>together, the crates were easy to move.</i>

273
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,572
- One, two! One, two! 'Kay.
- Nice.

274
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,865
Awesome, guys!

275
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,618
- One, two. One, two. One, two.
- You're fast.

276
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,828
- Okay.
- Yes, yes.

277
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,705
Go. Go back, I'll help her, okay?

278
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,874
- One, two!
- Hurry up, guys!

279
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,959
Hurry up, guys.

280
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,045
What do we do?

281
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,840
<i>We just started moving</i>
<i>the crates as fast as we could.</i>

282
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,051
That's it! Good job!
Now run, run, run, run!

283
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,846
Hey, James needs help. Jump in!

284
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,308
Here. I got it. Let's go.

285
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,809
Hurry up, guys!

286
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,270
- Here!
- Slow, slow.

287
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,271
There.

288
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,112
<i>I'd never worked with a zip-line before.</i>

289
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,281
<i>So I was a little worried about using it.</i>

290
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,075
<i>But I figured things would work out</i>
<i>if I stayed calm and kept moving.</i>

291
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,958
Here. Just leave it. Go back. Go back.

292
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,920
<i>Thankfully,</i>
<i>I didn't struggle to lift the crate</i>

293
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,254
<i>and attach it to the ropes.</i>

294
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,882
<i>And it flew across without any issues.</i>

295
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,177
<i>Honestly, I think we've got this.</i>

296
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,308
<i>On my first trip,</i>

297
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,935
<i>I carried up three bags.</i>

298
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,019
<i>The slope was too steep</i>

299
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,813
<i>for me to climb quickly,</i>
<i>but it was fine overall.</i>

300
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,815
<i>It wasn't too much of a challenge.</i>

301
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,152
Hey, watch out! Hey, watch out!

302
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,531
<i>My job</i>
<i>was to stay at the bottom of the ladder.</i>

303
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,117
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>I wasn't supposed to climb it at all.</i>

304
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,245
<i>They come up, drop the bags down,</i>
<i>and then I'd load them in the cart.</i>

305
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,414
<i>That way, they didn't pile up.</i>

306
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,209
<i>Once everyone did a lap,</i>
<i>Sung-bin came down and joined me</i>

307
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,127
<i>and we'd pushed the cart up together.</i>

308
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,712
It's heavier than you think.

309
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,172
Why are they tied up?

310
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,010
- We're good? Everyone did a round?
- Yeah.

311
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,304
We're good then. One, two.

312
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,017
That's it!

313
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,395
One, two!

314
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,730
<i>It was pretty easy.</i>

315
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,942
<i>We ended up moving six,</i>
<i>seven bags at a time.</i>

316
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,026
One, two!

317
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,612
<i>With both of us pushing,</i>
<i>it felt like nothing.</i>

318
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,491
7 BAGS (140 KG)

319
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,537
<i>I didn't think the crates were that heavy.</i>

320
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,207
<i>They were just big. If you had two people,</i>
<i>they were easy to move.</i>

321
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,585
<i>But we were behind.</i>
<i>We couldn't afford two people per crate.</i>

322
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,295
<i>It just… It wasn't gonna work.</i>

323
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,134
<i>So I thought, "Fine then.</i>
<i>I'll just do it myself."</i>

324
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,512
<i>But I couldn't carry it normally.</i>

325
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,723
<i>So I threw it on my back and went for it.</i>

326
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,852
Those crates were extremely heavy,

327
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,438
so James was something else out there.

328
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,442
He was fast, too, couldn't be beat.
I was impressed.

329
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,486
How's he doing that?

330
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,637
I need another crate!

331
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,264
Crate? Got it!

332
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,516
Dong-hyun, she needs a crate.

333
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,518
- Sorry? A crate?
- A crate. Yep.

334
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,361
<i>When we started,</i>
<i>Team Thailand was solely focused</i>

335
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,738
<i>on moving the crates.</i>

336
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,823
<i>Meanwhile, we hardly moved any.</i>

337
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,158
<i>We had to pivot.</i>

338
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,327
<i>The crates had to be our priority.</i>

339
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,287
Thailand's already moved four crates!

340
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,580
We're only on our second!

341
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,959
We're behind. I need another one.

342
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,176
<i>We'd planned it from the start.</i>

343
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,595
<i>It was really simple.</i>

344
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,515
<i>James and Sun</i>
<i>would stack about four crates for me.</i>

345
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,231
<i>And that way, I could just keep moving</i>
<i>them across without wasting any time.</i>

346
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,199
We're out of crates!

347
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,951
She's out.

348
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,287
<i>We had the upper hand on the zip-line.</i>

349
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,458
<i>From what I saw, Bon was superior</i>
<i>in both physicality and strength.</i>

350
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,045
<i>Plus, he was fast.</i>
<i>It was the perfect job for a boxer.</i>

351
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,464
I think I'm waiting longer
than I realized.

352
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,050
That was our winning edge.

353
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,811
5TH CRATE, 4TH CRATE

354
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,358
We need more crates! Bring 'em here!

355
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,735
Bring 'em up!

356
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,073
<i>He was incredibly fast. I mean,</i>
<i>Bon was whipping back and forth up there.</i>

357
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,993
Watching him gave me
this huge surge of energy.

358
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,494
I wanted to keep up.

359
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,206
And, I don't know,
I just transformed into this monster.

360
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,624
It's like my confidence took over.

361
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,299
What was that?

362
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,970
<i>Like… …"Keep fighting. Don't give up!"</i>

363
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,472
<i>Y'know? It was motivating.</i>

364
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,727
<i>I shouted in-sync with my movements.</i>

365
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,731
<i>Like a soldier.</i>

366
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,692
Okay!

367
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,738
Go up! Go up! Go up!

368
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,618
<i>The shouting not only</i>
<i>encourages the rest of the team</i>

369
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:07,706
<i>to keep pushing ahead, it also intimidates</i>
<i>our opponents. It's a great tactic.</i>

370
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,626
You're doing great, James!
Let's keep it up!

371
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:20,135
<i>Man, that shouting, it really</i>
<i>caught me off guard. It was so powerful.</i>

372
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,179
<i>He dominated the space.</i>

373
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,641
James was definitely their dark horse.

374
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,271
It's heavy. Here.

375
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,941
Let's go together. And… Go!

376
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,567
Dong-hyun, I need a crate!

377
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,737
- Dong-hyun, I need a crate!
- Let Seung-yeon handle that.

378
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,821
Let's grab more crates!

379
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,616
<i>I thought we'd have a lot more time</i>

380
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,867
<i>in between each stack,</i>

381
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,411
<i>but they moved</i>
<i>a lot faster than I thought they would.</i>

382
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,330
<i>I knew we were out of crates,</i>

383
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,540
<i>but the sandbags were already in my hand.</i>

384
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,625
I need more!

385
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,585
I'll go, I got it.

386
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,842
<i>If we wanted to move more cargo than</i>
<i>Thailand we couldn't afford to waste time.</i>

387
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,553
<i>Even stalling for</i>
<i>a second would be inefficient.</i>

388
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,805
I'm gonna go.

389
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,267
<i>We just kept moving back</i>
<i>and forth, nonstop.</i>

390
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,067
- One, two, three.
- One, two.

391
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,736
<i>That's when the energy shifted.</i>

392
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,988
One, two. One, two.

393
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,907
<i>Having support</i>
<i>from my teammates was very encouraging.</i>

394
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,410
- Grab me another one!
- Okay. One, two, three.

395
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,997
<i>Sung-bin had to help</i>
<i>with the crates, which meant…</i>

396
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,873
<i>I was on my own.</i>

397
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,676
8 BAGS (160 KG)

398
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,263
It's slippery!

399
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,931
It's slippery!

400
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,976
<i>I was trying my best</i>
<i>to push it up the incline,</i>

401
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,602
<i>but it kept sliding down.</i>

402
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,944
<i>I just had to get it past</i>
<i>the first foothold,</i>

403
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,155
<i>but there wasn't enough momentum to do so.</i>

404
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,990
<i>And that was really frustrating.</i>

405
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,908
It keeps sliding!

406
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,246
Okay. Hey, Min-jae's struggling
to push the cart. He needs help.

407
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,206
He's trying, but--

408
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,291
Hey, Sung-bin.

409
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,418
One, two.

410
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,880
<i>My only job was to transport the bags.</i>

411
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,257
<i>And I needed someone else</i>
<i>to help me do it.</i>

412
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,676
<i>It caught me off-guard.</i>
<i>I was annoyed at myself…</i>

413
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,720
- One, two. One, two.
- <i>…and really embarrassed.</i>

414
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,269
Wanna bring more sandbags?

415
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,480
Okay, I'll move some.

416
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,196
- Let's test it.
- Okay.

417
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,699
One, two

418
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,784
three!

419
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,828
Two, three!

420
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,914
9 BAGS (180 KG)

421
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,290
You good?

422
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,584
Two, three!

423
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,461
Two, three!

424
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,587
How 'bout step-by-step?

425
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,297
There's not enough room.

426
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,175
<i>I kept pushing and pushing,</i>

427
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:08,595
<i>but it was hard. My legs were too short.</i>
<i>At least, that's how it felt.</i>

428
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,765
<i>I kept trying to gain a strong foothold,</i>
<i>but then I'd slip.</i>

429
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,267
<i>So, each time I pushed, I took two steps.</i>

430
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,728
One, two, three.

431
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,981
One, two, three.

432
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,279
<i>I couldn't just pull it up</i>
<i>with my arms. I used my whole body.</i>

433
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,615
<i>You start thinking,</i>
<i>"How can I use more force?</i>

434
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,493
<i>Okay, if I sit and push my legs,</i>
<i>I can pull harder."</i>

435
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,828
One, two!

436
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,496
I got it. Push!

437
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,083
<i>We may have overloaded the cart.</i>

438
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,336
<i>Even so, I still had to find</i>
<i>a way to get it up the ramp.</i>

439
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,963
- One, two.
- Push!

440
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,758
Push!

441
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,594
- One, two!
- Push!

442
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,846
Good!

443
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,806
<i>In the moment, I struggled a lot.</i>

444
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,891
<i>It felt impossible,</i>
<i>but I couldn't give up.</i>

445
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,269
- One, two!
- Push!

446
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,521
You got this! Almost there, c'mon!

447
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,911
Thailand's slowing down!
They're struggling!

448
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,956
<i>When my opponents struggle,</i>
<i>it motivates me.</i>

449
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,000
<i>It's like, "If we're both struggling here,</i>

450
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,961
then I just need
to push myself a little harder."

451
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,672
I knew slowing down wasn't an option.

452
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,424
I just had to keep moving,

453
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,509
back and forth, back and forth,
over and over.

454
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,805
That's it, Seung-yeon! Let's go!

455
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,557
Just a little more! Let's win this!

456
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,142
Just a little bit more!

457
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,936
<i>I ended up with sand in my shoes.</i>

458
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,148
<i>They got so heavy,</i>
<i>it felt like sandbags tied to my feet.</i>

459
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,985
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>climbing got a lot more difficult.</i>

460
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,029
<i>And my legs? They just got heavier.</i>

461
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,074
<i>The bags and the crates</i>
<i>both eventually drained our stamina.</i>

462
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,953
<i>But I couldn't afford</i>
<i>to take a break. So I didn't.</i>

463
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,038
Don't stop moving.

464
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,539
- No breaks, no breaks.
- Push through it, man.

465
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,208
- Nice, guys!
- Okay, let's go!

466
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,834
- That's right! Nice job.
- One, two, three!

467
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:03,919
That's it!

468
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,171
C'mon! Let's win this!

469
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,257
Let's win this!

470
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,800
Good job, Sung-bin!

471
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,302
Korea!

472
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,637
Fight on!

473
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,930
Let's go!

474
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,141
Five minutes!

475
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,518
Five more minutes!

476
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,354
Five minutes, guys! Five minutes, guys!

477
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,606
Let's go, Min-jae! We're close!

478
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,775
- Just five more minutes to go!
- Just a little bit longer!

479
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,445
<i>When I heard my teammates cheering for me,</i>

480
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,988
<i>it gave me strength.</i>

481
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,950
<i>I was ready to fight.</i>

482
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,661
6 BAGS (120 KG)

483
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,041
Min-jae!

484
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,834
Just a bit more!

485
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,919
Just a bit more!

486
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,588
Extend and push! Extend and push!

487
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,508
- Come on!
- You got this! Just a bit more.

488
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,592
Come on!

489
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,011
Keep going, Min-jae! You're almost there!

490
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,016
<i>All I could hear was, "Push! Push!"</i>

491
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,601
<i>So I just kept pushing.</i>

492
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,480
Come on, Min-jae!

493
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,363
<i>By the end,</i>
<i>I think Min-jae figured it out.</i>

494
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,115
<i>He really came into his own.</i>

495
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,703
I don't think I realized
how far I'd pushed myself…

496
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,787
KIM MIN-JAE
SSIREUM WRESTLER

497
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,038
…until my nose started bleeding.

498
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,752
<i>It was completely exhausting.</i>

499
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,716
<i>We were slowing down,</i>
<i>we kept taking breaks.</i>

500
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,967
<i>It was obvious</i>

501
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,802
<i>that we were really struggling.</i>

502
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,433
- C'mon, James!
- Let's go!

503
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:50,400
All right! Their will is broken!
Their will's broken, guys.

504
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,070
Min-jae!

505
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,324
<i>If Superbon's waiting</i>
<i>because there's nothing for him to move,</i>

506
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,243
<i>then we're wasting time,</i>
<i>and we can't get that back.</i>

507
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,911
Ploy, help me lift this.

508
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,371
Ploy, help. Please.

509
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,248
On your back, right?

510
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,252
<i>I guess…I guess you</i>
<i>could call it a self-sacrifice.</i>

511
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,758
<i>No matter what, I couldn't stop.</i>
<i>I had to get those crates to Superbon.</i>

512
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,136
<i>'Cause if I didn't,</i>
<i>all his effort would be in vain.</i>

513
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,305
You're amazing, James!

514
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,810
<i>Watching James lug</i>
<i>that crate all by himself,</i>

515
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,021
<i>I started to question</i>
<i>what I was doing there</i>

516
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,105
<i>in the first place.</i>

517
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:33,526
<i>All I could think was, "I have</i>
<i>to do something. I have to do more."</i>

518
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,364
<i>I wasn't just fighting for myself.</i>
<i>I was fighting for us.</i>

519
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,865
<i>I was fighting for my team.</i>

520
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,452
<i>This was a fight for victory,</i>
<i>for Team Thailand's victory.</i>

521
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,082
Three minutes! Three minutes, guys!

522
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,708
Three minutes!

523
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,835
We need crates.

524
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,046
Crates, guys!

525
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,551
Let's go!

526
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,762
Let's go!

527
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,724
- Hurry! They've only got four crates left!
- Come on!

528
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,850
Get the crates.

529
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,894
- Just crates! Crates only.
- Crates only?

530
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:08,853
One more!

531
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,314
All the way, Korea! C'mon!

532
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,484
- Let's go! Great job!
- One, two.

533
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,281
One, two. Okay. One, two.

534
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,784
Anucha! Anucha, push!

535
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,371
C'mon! Hang on! We're almost there!

536
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,998
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

537
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,209
- That's the last one!
- Here, I got it.

538
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,346
- Keep going!
- Right!

539
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,682
Let's go together. C'mon.

540
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,559
One, two, three!

541
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,687
Minute-thirty!

542
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,275
I'll just take one, 'kay?

543
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,736
You got it. Here.

544
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,653
One more.

545
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,281
Hurry up! One minute left!

546
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,700
<i>One minute.</i>

547
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,243
We won't make another trip.

548
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,579
Let's take what we have. Let's go.

549
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,914
Besides, it'll be easier if we all push.

550
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,169
<i>We were down to the last minute.</i>

551
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,297
<i>And I thought, "Why not</i>
<i>bring an extra 40 kilograms?"</i>

552
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,048
Forty-seven to go! Come on!

553
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,259
Last run! Come on, guys!

554
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,554
One, two, push!

555
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,599
One, two, push!

556
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,480
<i>We were too close. We had to finish it.</i>

557
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,567
One more! One more!

558
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,070
Thirty seconds! Come on, everyone!

559
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,036
- One more trip.
- Okay. One more trip.

560
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,996
Thirty seconds. We need to go!

561
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,623
Thirty seconds!

562
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,250
- Not yet.
- Just go, guys!

563
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,044
- All right. One, two, three.
- 'Kay.

564
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,837
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

565
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,718
<i>I just tried to keep moving</i>
<i>until the very last second.</i>

566
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,970
<i>I wanted to end on a high note.</i>

567
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,058
<i>No matter what,</i>
<i>I was gonna deliver that last crate.</i>

568
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,394
<i>I thought, "If we make this,</i>
<i>we'll win for sure."</i>

569
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,523
We gotta go!

570
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,358
- Min-jae, come on!
- Right.

571
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,236
- Ten seconds!
- Ten.

572
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,904
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

573
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,573
Five!

574
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,867
<i>I had to make it in time, I had to.</i>

575
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,744
- Three, Two!
- <i>I was going to make sure we won.</i>

576
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,040
One second left!

577
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,250
Hurry up!

578
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,126
Three! Two!

579
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,127
Hurry up!

580
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,592
- Oh, yeah.
- <i>Stop.</i>

581
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,262
- <i>Game over.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

582
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,729
<i>When the game ended, and you</i>
<i>saw everyone panting and sweating…</i>

583
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,983
<i>I think that was the moment</i>
<i>when we kind of realized</i>

584
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:03,111
<i>that every single one of us</i>
<i>had really given it our all.</i>

585
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,572
I'm so proud of you!

586
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,243
Man. That was awesome!

587
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,374
<i>In some ways, this</i>
Physical: Asia <i>quest is a perfect test.</i>

588
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,959
<i>The kind that exposes</i>

589
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,252
<i>your physical limitations,</i>

590
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,087
<i>and pushes you to your breaking point.</i>

591
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,424
<i>It was excruciating. I was drained.</i>

592
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:28,219
<i>But the worst part was that</i>
<i>I never delivered those last two bags.</i>

593
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,555
<i>And that guilt ate away at me.</i>

594
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,475
Physical: Asia.

595
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,980
<i>Second Quest:</i>
<i>Shipwreck Transportation Battle.</i>

596
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:43,484
<i>Korea versus Thailand.</i>
<i>Here are the final results.</i>

597
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,534
All right!

598
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,663
Whoa, we really packed it in!

599
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,956
Look at that! Nice job!

600
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,000
The crates are on top.

601
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,169
<i>Korea.</i>

602
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,422
<i>I had one goal.</i>

603
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,467
<i>To make an impression, to prove ourselves.</i>

604
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,514
That's a lot.

605
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,935
<i>2,120 kg.</i>

606
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,728
That's a lot.

607
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,230
We managed to haul 2,100 kilograms

608
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,399
out of six tons of treasure.

609
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,485
I figured we were going to win.

610
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,195
<i>We really gave it our all.</i>

611
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,197
<i>I was really proud</i>
<i>of what we accomplished.</i>

612
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,865
Wow.

613
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,409
Man, that's a lot.

614
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,161
I wanna see theirs now.

615
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,162
<i>Thailand.</i>

616
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,081
I can't look!

617
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,921
Same last digit.

618
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,881
Come on, come on.

619
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,426
Let's go. Give us a two! Two, two…

620
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,220
Two?

621
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,888
Is it a toss-up?

622
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:54,806
1,000…

623
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:58,977
<i>Everyone gave this challenge</i>
<i>their all, blood, sweat, and tears.</i>

624
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,145
<i>We had a good chance of winning.</i>
<i>I was confident.</i>

625
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,271
Come on, come on.

626
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,815
It's gotta be two!

627
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,651
One, one, one. Come on, one! Come on…

628
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,574
<i>1,380 kg.</i>

629
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,666
- Korea…
- Fight on!

630
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,506
- That's a huge difference!
- It really is.

631
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,009
- It was the sandbags.
- I couldn't tell.

632
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,096
THAILAND
16 CRATES, 29 BAGS

633
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,601
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
16 CRATES, 66 BAGS

634
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,520
Yeah, they got more bags.

635
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,230
<i>I made the error.</i>

636
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,649
I assumed the crates weighed
a lot more than the bags,

637
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,609
so I assumed we'd win with more crates.

638
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,572
We need more crates! Bring 'em here!

639
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,949
As many as you can!

640
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,578
<i>I think Team Korea came up</i>
<i>with a really good strategy.</i>

641
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:03,041
<i>They were systematic. They allocated well</i>
<i>and it played to their strengths.</i>

642
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,125
I'll go, I got it.

643
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,293
<i>They had assigned tasks</i>

644
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,836
<i>and knew how to do them well.</i>

645
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,213
I need more crates!
Come on guys, let's go!

646
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,131
She's out!

647
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,383
<i>Honestly,</i>
<i>I think it helped them move faster.</i>

648
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,177
<i>And they never had to stop.</i>

649
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,720
<i>Ten minutes remain.</i>

650
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,346
<i>We will now reveal the weights.</i>

651
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,432
All right! We're in the lead!

652
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,351
Just keep pushing, guys! Keep pushing!

653
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,020
Okay!

654
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,313
Feeling motivated!

655
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,774
<i>Every single member</i>
<i>stepped up and did their job.</i>

656
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,359
<i>Our teamwork was</i>
<i>as perfect as you could get.</i>

657
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,486
Bravo!

658
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,407
<i>The winning team is Korea.</i>

659
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,037
- Amazing job, guys. Well done, well done.
- Nice job, team!

660
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,248
<i>The losing team is Thailand.</i>

661
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,084
<i>It sparked something in us, y'know?</i>

662
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,711
<i>Like, "We can't give up.</i>
<i>We gotta keep fighting."</i>

663
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,892
So, what did you make of 'em?
Team Türkiye.

664
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,312
What do I make of 'em?
I think we can take 'em.

665
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,356
At this point, they're probably exhausted.

666
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:12,193
I mean, they fought all day yesterday,
and we only went two rounds.

667
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,738
We also have a fun little surprise
for them today. Now that…

668
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,656
Isai?

669
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,865
'Cause Isai's here with us…

670
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,992
- Let's go, Isai.
- …and they're not prepared for him.

671
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,702
INDONESIA

672
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,456
DUE TO MARCUS GIDEON'S INJURY,
ISAI KESEK HAS TAKEN HIS PLACE

673
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:31,754
ISAI KESEK
BODYBUILDER

674
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,298
Hey, Isai. How you doing? You ready?

675
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,218
Absolutely, hundred-percent.

676
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,894
Okay.

677
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,731
All right then. We can take 'em on.

678
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,156
Guys.

679
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,828
Yo, you ready for today?

680
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,371
- Ready.
- Of course.

681
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,498
- You're sure?
- Of course. Bring it on.

682
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,876
Wanna think about it again? No?

683
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,588
Maybe you will. Maybe you should.

684
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,633
We've thought enough.

685
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,848
<i>I wanted to rile them up.</i>

686
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,099
ANIL BERK BAKI
NATIONAL TEAM SAILOR

687
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,309
Just a bit, as motivation.

688
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,810
I kept throwing things at them,

689
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,770
<i>but they just ignored me.</i>

690
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,023
Honestly, it was a little annoying.

691
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,567
Ask them if they've checked their tickets.

692
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,902
Uh, my friend asking you,

693
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,570
did you check your tickets?

694
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,654
Airplane tickets.

695
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,573
I can already see how this'll end.

696
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,242
Today's their last day on set.

697
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:47,038
Yeah, I hope you can keep
that spirit. Yeah.

698
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:53,002
<i>In that moment, I just saw red.</i>
<i>I was so pissed off.</i>

699
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,588
<i>I could feel my anger boiling up inside.</i>

700
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,672
I was ready to go.

701
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,924
JEREMIAH LAKHWANI
HYBRID ATHLETE

702
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,258
Like, "Come on! Next challenge!"

703
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,678
We're not as weak as they think we are,
and I wanted to prove it.

704
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,390
Even when they were picking teams,
they targeted us.

705
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,268
<i>Smirking, giving us the side-eye.</i>

706
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,563
<i>We knew what they were thinking,</i>
<i>and what those smiles meant.</i>

707
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,567
Let's show 'em what happens
when you underestimate us.

708
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,529
Today, we'll wipe those stupid smiles
off their faces. You with me?

709
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:28,162
<i>Physical: Asia</i>, second quest.

710
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,789
<i>Now then.</i>

711
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,753
<i>The match will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

712
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,047
<i>Ready…</i>

713
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:49,934
The stairs are steep!

714
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,813
Watch the stairs!
Avoid the water if you can!

715
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,109
Come on, come on, go.

716
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,363
<i>I chose to do bags,</i>
<i>so I began sorting them into smaller piles</i>

717
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:07,034
<i>to transport. Isai chose the crates,</i>
<i>so he could just grab and go.</i>

718
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,289
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

719
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,168
Nice, Isai! Good, Isai! Good!

720
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,878
Come on!

721
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,548
<i>When the game began,</i>

722
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,717
<i>I guess we kinda choked for a sec,</i>

723
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,677
- <i>like we didn't know what to do.</i>
- Take that bag.

724
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,761
- Come on, let's go
- Which bag?

725
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,305
- Stop standing there, and go.
- Right there.

726
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,265
No, not this. Take that instead.

727
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,142
- Which one?
- That one. You see it, right?

728
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,060
They're bundled in threes.

729
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,062
- Like this?
- Just take it.

730
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,188
They're tied together!

731
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,233
Then take all of them!
It doesn't matter. Just move, man.

732
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,111
<i>I didn't expect the bags</i>
<i>to be tied together like that.</i>

733
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,989
<i>So it caused a bit of a delay for us.</i>

734
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,073
Come on!

735
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,701
- Isai. I'll take it. Hey, be careful.
- Wait!

736
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,662
- Move!
- Let's go' let's go.

737
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,040
Over here, Igedz. Over here, over here.

738
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,208
- Let's move it, come on.
- Forward. A bit more.

739
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,253
<i>The whole thing just made me anxious.</i>

740
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,255
<i>We were completely uncoordinated.</i>

741
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,975
<i>I remember thinking,</i>
<i>"Man, 50 kilos is freakin' heavy!"</i>

742
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,687
<i>I kept trying to shove it in the hold,</i>
<i>but it put up a fight.</i>

743
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,861
<i>We got a late start, but it didn't matter.</i>

744
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,156
<i>We were armed with a good strategy</i>
<i>and excellent tactics.</i>

745
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,366
Let's go, Anıl.

746
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,159
- One, two.
- One, and…

747
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,702
Don't drop 'em, keep going!

748
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,082
Don't drop 'em, keep going!

749
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,214
Wasn't expecting to see that. Just… Wow.

750
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,260
<i>For the first trip,</i>
<i>since we'd be at full strength,</i>

751
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,345
<i>we added some bags</i>

752
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,930
<i>on top of the crates.</i>

753
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,308
- Watch it, watch it!
- Here!

754
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,811
- Let's go.
- You got it?

755
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:22,503
One, two, three.

756
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,756
Grab it, grab it. Recep, the bag. Hold on.

757
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,180
Mar, don't do that. No one can take it.

758
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,141
We'll go one by one.

759
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,309
That's 60 kilos, just leave it.

760
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,729
- Ali, throw one over my shoulder.
- What do you need? One?

761
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,356
Here! No, that bundle!

762
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,442
- Ready?
- Do it!

763
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,485
- You sure about this?
- I'm sure.

764
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,578
<i>I wanted to show everyone</i>
<i>the power of Turkish women.</i>

765
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,706
<i>So I slung all three sandbags</i>
<i>over my shoulder,</i>

766
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,749
<i>and carried them all the way up.</i>

767
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,965
Let's keep using our shoulders!

768
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,508
It's much easier.

769
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,323
<i>Three times.</i>

770
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,075
<i>Three times I forgot my harness</i>
<i>and doubled back.</i>

771
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,164
No! My glove!

772
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,795
Seriously?

773
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,259
Meanwhile,
my counterpart, from team Indonesia,

774
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,053
is just zippin' around!

775
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,514
Back and forth, back and forth.
It was ridiculous.

776
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,536
<i>And she's yelling the whole time.</i>

777
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,246
<i>Like, who is she? Tarzan?</i>

778
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,707
Let's go!

779
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,420
<i>It was hard. My teammates kept</i>
<i>bringing me crate after crate,</i>

780
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,757
<i>and I knew that, with how much was left,</i>
<i>I couldn't keep them waiting.</i>

781
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,718
<i>So I pushed myself</i>
<i>to go faster and faster,</i>

782
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,679
<i>and delivered crates until we ran out.</i>

783
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,893
Here, let me help you out!

784
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:50,651
<i>As team lead, I knew we needed to</i>
<i>win this. Not just because we wanted it,</i>

785
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,653
<i>but because it'd prove to everyone</i>

786
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,989
<i>that we had the means</i>
<i>to win this whole thing.</i>

787
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,123
8 BAGS (160 KG)

788
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,417
Come on, come on. You got this!

789
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,210
- A little harder.
- It's heavy.

790
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,170
Try pulling the front.

791
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,422
You got this.

792
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,258
How's five more?

793
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,260
- No way, man.
- It's fine, we got this!

794
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,974
- Sacks! Sacks!
- All right. Let's go.

795
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,978
10 BAGS (200 KG)

796
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,065
Pull!

797
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,623
Let's go again.

798
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,791
One, two, up!

799
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,793
- Come on!
- One, two, up!

800
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,587
Come on!

801
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,756
One, two, up!

802
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,174
One, two, up!

803
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,927
- Come on!
- Let's go!

804
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,017
Come on, Igedz. We've gotta win this, man.

805
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,644
- We've gotta win this.
- That's right.

806
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,562
<i>After that delivery, I was confident.</i>

807
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,399
<i>If we combined all our strength,</i>
<i>we could beat Türkiye at their own game.</i>

808
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,780
Here.

809
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,449
- Got it.
- Hey, they're moving their bags now.

810
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,367
Huh?

811
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,785
I said they're moving their bags.

812
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,497
<i>That was one of</i>
<i>the initial strategies we had.</i>

813
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,458
<i>Instead of making multiple,</i>
<i>smaller trips with the cart,</i>

814
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,127
<i>we'd amass a ton of bags</i>
<i>to transport all at once.</i>

815
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,837
15 MINUTES AGO

816
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,714
How about we pile up the bags
at the halfway point?

817
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,509
- Over there?
- That way we can leave the cart for last.

818
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,471
<i>But then, as we were struggling</i>
<i>to haul all these bags up,</i>

819
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,473
<i>I turned to see the other team</i>

820
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,058
<i>already emptying their crate.</i>

821
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,478
<i>It kind of shocked my system a bit,</i>
<i>and I came to my senses.</i>

822
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,234
I'll head down.

823
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,960
Hey!

824
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,171
- No, just one of you.
- One? Here.

825
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,715
One, two…

826
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,799
14 BAGS (280 KG)

827
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,883
Got it?

828
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,390
Push against the stakes for support.

829
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,267
On the sides, Oge.

830
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,107
<i>I wasn't expecting the ramp to be</i>

831
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,692
<i>anywhere near as steep as it was.</i>

832
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:41,488
<i>I was panting and gasping for breath.</i>
<i>Honestly, it was a real challenge.</i>

833
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,324
There we go.

834
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,784
This is nothing, guys.

835
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,206
You can go. I'll get it.

836
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,499
Run, run, run!

837
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,045
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

838
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,673
- <i>Ten minutes remain.</i>
- Get the rest of the crates! Come on!

839
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,675
<i>We will now reveal the weights.</i>

840
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,102
<i>I was completely shocked.</i>

841
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,693
<i>I mean, what a low blow. That felt awful.</i>

842
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,989
It's 'cause they moved a ton of bags!

843
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,117
<i>Your mind just starts racing,</i>

844
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,996
<i>"What happened? Is it my fault?"</i>
<i>You know? "Is this it?"</i>

845
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,458
<i>I was excited,</i>

846
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:38,212
<i>but I knew that we couldn't</i>
<i>let ourselves get carried away.</i>

847
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,594
<i>At first, I was like,</i>
<i>"Yes! We're gonna win this!" But then…</i>

848
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,639
Box!

849
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,435
<i>…the deliveries took longer,</i>
<i>and I started to worry.</i>

850
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,146
Box! Box!

851
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,733
Box! Box!

852
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,573
Sandbags!

853
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,700
More sandbags!

854
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,745
More sandbags.

855
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,373
We need more, load 'em up.

856
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,084
- Don't let 'em get wet.
- Don't worry, I'll grab 'em.

857
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,669
Last few.

858
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,088

00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,008
<i>They were only focused on the bags.</i>

860
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:30,389
I think that was the moment
where everything just kind of went wrong.

861
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,017
<i>There was some kind of miscommunication.</i>

862
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,234
They're focused on the crates!

863

They're focused on the crates!

864
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,866
Hurry. You guys work on bags.

- Isai! Come with me.
- Yes.

866
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,752
Just worry about the crates!
I got it, guys. Just bring more.

<i>All I could focus on was my team, myself,</i>
<i>and all the crates I needed to transport.</i>

873

Three minutes left!

874
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:41,460
<i>Looking at our side, and</i>
<i>judging by the small stack that remained,</i>

875
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,504
<i>I assumed that we'd already</i>
<i>moved all of our crates across.</i>

876
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,465
<i>Türkiye hadn't moved nearly as many.</i>

877
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,384

Hey, do you still need me?

881
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,818
No, we're good.
We've gotta move fast, guys.

882
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,283
One sec!

883

<i>I knew I had to do something.</i>

885
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,961
<i>So I gathered my strength</i>
<i>and made one last trip.</i>

886
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,010

887
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,516

<i>Indonesia! My homeland… </i>

889
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,900
<i>I wanted to motivate them to the very end.</i>

890
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:50,696
<i>Like, "Don't give up! Let's keep</i>
<i>on fighting and win this thing!"</i>

00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,030
We're out of time!

892
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,323
Let's move now!

893
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,535
- Wait!
- Hold on!

894
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,120
- We have to push! Hurry up!
- Hold on!

895
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,329
Hold on!

896
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,747
<i>We needed that bag,</i>

897
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,749
<i>even if it killed us.</i>
<i>Whatever it took to win.</i>

898
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,668
Push. Go!

899
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,213
Yasemin, run! Go on, help!

900
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,760

I think we lost.

910
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,274
I think you're right.

911
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,152
How many crates were left?

912
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,404
No clue. We might've lost.

<i>Losing that challenge</i>

You blame yourself for everything. "If I'd

942
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,946
My biggest regret was
not pushing myself more.

00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,804
<i>The team that manages to reach the ball,</i>

1028
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:59,601
<i>take possession and score a goal will win.</i>

1029
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:03,104
Ah, it's like basketball then.
Just aim for the other goal.

1030
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,899
<i>Each match will last three minutes.</i>

1031
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:09,110
<i>If the match doesn't end</i>
<i>after three minutes,</i>

1032
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:13,198
<i>the winner will be determined</i>
<i>by a one-minute rematch.</i>

1033
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,366
If we go over, we'll have a rematch.

1034
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,162
<i>If neither team manages</i>
<i>to score during the tiebreaker,</i>

1035
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,830
<i>while in possession of the ball,</i>

1036
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,169
<i>the team that lands closest to</i>
<i>their opponent's goal will win the match.</i>

1037
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,005
Actually, it's like rugby.

1038
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,340
Yeah, yeah.

1039
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,344
<i>However, if the rematch comes to an end…</i>

1040
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,596
<i>…and nobody has the ball,</i>

1041
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:40,767
<i>the teams will reset</i>
<i>for another tiebreaker.</i>

NONOKA OZAKI
NATIONAL TEAM WRESTLER

1043
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,354
<i>I liked that it was different</i>
<i>from previous games.</i>

1044
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,314
You couldn't win by possession alone,

1045
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:49,734
<i>which meant that the martial artists</i>
<i>wouldn't have their usual advantage.</i>

1046
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,110
<i>We'd all be on equal footing.</i>

1047
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,904
<i>On the other hand,</i>

1048
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:56,574
if you only needed one goal to win,
you just had to be fast enough.

1049
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,202
<i>So I figured the matches would fly by.</i>

1050
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,371
<i>I was confident going into this,</i>

1051
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,249
<i>but the variable which made it challenging</i>
<i>was the water.</i>

1052
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,042
There's no water in rugby.

1053
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,126
<i>The more I listened,</i>

1054
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,211
<i>the more I got into it.</i>

1056
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:12,048
<i>I knew I was gonna be good. It was the</i>
<i>kind of game that played to my strengths.</i>

1057
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,968
<i>Each team will be playing five rounds.</i>

1058
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,511
What? Five rounds?

1059
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,055
<i>Once both games are over,</i>

1060
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:22,392
<i>the teams that managed</i>
<i>to win three of the five rounds</i>

1061
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,477
<i>will have survived.</i>

1062
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,063
Well, let's win the first three.

1063
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:31,192
<i>Round One: One-on-one match.</i>

1064
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,527
A one-on-one?

1065
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,823
<i>Round Two: Two-on-two match.</i>

1066
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,367
- Oh, so it gets bigger.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1067
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:43,162
<i>Round Three: One-on-one match.</i>

1068
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,958
<i>Round Four: Two-on-two match.</i>

1069
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,086
<i>Round Five: One-on-one match.</i>

1070
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,754
Three one-on-ones.

1071
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,257
One, two, one, two, one.

1072
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:55,883
This is gonna be rough.

1073
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,136
- Oh, absolutely.
- Matchups won't be balanced.

1074
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,556
<i>The two teams who are defeated today…</i>

1075
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,349
We can't go home, not yet.

1076
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,018
<i>…will be eliminated.</i>

1077
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,814
<i>And their time here</i>

1078
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,066
<i>will come to an end.</i>

1079
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,069
<i>We'll have to fight</i>
<i>with everything we've got.</i>

1080
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,155
That's the only way we're moving on.

Uh, try to finish strong
or win the quest again.

1083
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:24,162
<i>We've been given a golden</i>

<i>Contestants,</i>

1085
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:31,127
<i>the time has come to determine</i>
<i>the Death Match matchups.</i>

1086
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,920
This is gonna make or break them.

1087
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,131
It's like who you match up against.

1088
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:39,093
<i>Among the four defeated teams</i>
<i>who stand here today,</i>

1089
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,888
<i>the team that transported</i>
<i>the highest amount of goods</i>

1090
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,641
<i>will get to choose their opponent today.</i>

1091
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,977
The standings! Let's see, let's see…

1092
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:52,774
<i>Now then. We'll reveal each team's scores</i>
<i>from the Ship Transportation Battle.</i>

1093
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,402
- <i>And now, Korea…</i>
- Please.

1094
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,196
<i>…Mongolia, Türkiye,</i>

1095
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:01,157
<i>and Australia.</i>
<i>Here's how your scores compare.</i>

1096
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,707
Korea? Korea?

1097
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,000
Us? no way!

1098
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,169
1ST PLACE: REPUBLIC OF KOREA

1099
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,925
- Korea…
- Fight on!

1100
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,552
<i>The energy had shifted, you could feel it.</i>

1101
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,887
We were already strong,

1102
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,139
but with our endurance,
no one could beat us.

1103
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,016
We were a force to be reckoned with.

1104
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,311
<i>Moving on. Let's now compare…</i>

1105
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:33,064
<i>…the final scores</i>
<i>of the four losing teams.</i>

1106
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,528
Let's see.

1107
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,657
Yay! Pretty good. Very good.

1108
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,076
Man, 1,800.

1109
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,411
Japan was up there!

1110
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,413
They've gotta advance to the next round.

1111
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,498
They have to come back
for us to beat them again.

1112
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,458
That's right. That's how you do it, man.

1113
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:57,547
<i>Even though we had the best of the lower</i>
<i>scores, coming fifth place still sucked.</i>

1114
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:02,593
I think the best thing for us,
strategically, is to be more unified.

1115
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,179
Not just working together,
but as one team.

1116
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,807
<i>Now then, Team Japan,</i>

1117
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:12,019
<i>you will now get to decide</i>
<i>who your opponent is for the Death Match.</i>

1118
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,066
I guess it's up to us, huh?

1119
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,901
You got this!

1120
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,154
I'm scared!

1121
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,323
Japan has four
world-class, uh, martial artists.

1122
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,869
<i>They have two</i>
<i>Olympic bronze medalists from Paris.</i>

1123
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,412
NONOKA OZAKI
NATIONAL TEAM WRESTLER

1124
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,914
<i>They have a Japanese MMA legend,</i>

1125
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,209
<i>and they have a female MMA fighter</i>
<i>that fights in ONE Championship.</i>

1126
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,129
That's why I'm really scared
to go against them.

1127
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:41,007
But I have no choice.
We need to play the game.

1128
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,508
<i>Thailand,</i>

1129
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,010
<i>Philippines,</i>

1130
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,803
<i>Indonesia.</i>

1131
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,639
We knew we could kind of pick whoever.

1132
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:52,727
After all, we were the strongest.
This game was made for us.

1133
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,895
We weren't worried.

1134
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:57,482
<i>Thailand kind of has a weak team.</i>

1135
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:00,902
<i>They've got one really strong member,</i>
<i>but that's about it.</i>

1136
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,278
We should…

1137
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,032
still think about it.

1138
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:10,286
Everyone looks so
uncomfortable. Just look, they're nervous.

1139
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,414
I'd choose Philippines.

1140
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,249
Could be Philippines.

1141
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,751
What about the Philippines?

1142
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,252
Could be tough.

1143
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:26,636
They're looking at us.
They're looking at us.

1144
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,972
Yeah, they will pick us.

1145
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,351
As long as they don't pick us, guys.

1146
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,061
It's a bad matchup for us.

1147
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,731
So what's the plan? Who…

1148
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,566
Sounds good. Okay.

1149
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:47,281
Uh, Indonesia.

1150
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,826
Indonesia.

1151
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:50,952
Seriously?

1152
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,709
Seriously?

1153
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,087
- Wow.
- Great.

1154
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,840
<i>At first glance, Indonesia's Captain Igedz</i>

1155
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,217
<i>appears to be the most intimidating.</i>

1156
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,971
But he's not a fighter, so he's not
a threat. That's the main reason.

1157
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,431
He's a bodybuilder, not a martial artist.

1158
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:17,645
Dude, look at his face.
You see that stare? That's terrifying.

1159
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,647
Show your skills, or no?

1160
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,732
Bring it on.

1161
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,528
At the end of the day, it doesn't matter
who you are, where you come from,

1162
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,905
how great you are,
or how great you think you are.

1163
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,867
'Cause the second the game starts,
it doesn't matter anymore.

1164
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,743
Everyone's the same in the arena.

1165
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,416
We're facing Pacquiao.

1166
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,043
Okay.

1167
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,798
<i>I was happy. Going up</i>
<i>against Thailand was probably</i>

1168
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,718
<i>the best we could ask for,</i>
<i>and that was because</i>

1169
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,221
we knew beating Thailand
would be pretty easy.

1170
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,223
<i>I like Pacquiao. He has my respect,</i>

1171
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,934
<i>so getting to fight him</i>
<i>would be really special.</i>

1172
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,185
<i>However,</i>

1173
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,770
I don't think he's as strong

1174
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:00,980
as he used to be.

1175
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,239
- Let's go!
- Nothing in the tank.

1176
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,824
All or nothing.

1177
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:12,742
Rip in, boys.

1178
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,619
- Leave nothing behind, guys. Let's go.
- And girls.

1179
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:17,788
Man, just imagining myself
standing there is exhausting enough.

1180
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:18,873
Yeah, no kidding.

1181
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,751
We'll fight you with all we've got.

1182
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:25,004
We'll do whatever it takes to win,
whatever it takes to keep playing.

1183
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,010
We promise to do our best,

1184
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,221
and win this game,
because God is good all the time.

1185
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:35,932
Let's go!

1186
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,185
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1187
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,269
Dig deep.

1188
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,855
<i>With the matches set,</i>

1189
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,399
<i>each team must decide who they'll be using</i>

1190
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:46,817
<i>for each of the rounds.</i>

1191
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,111
Okay, listen up guys.

1192
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,782
No matter what we're up against,
we're winning the first three rounds.

1193
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,242
We have to. Sun's gonna go first.

1194
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:58,329
That gives you time to rest up if
we pull you in for round five.

1195
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,413
SUPERBON
MUAY THAI FIGHTER

1196
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,707
With so much at stake, it's crucial
that we win in the first round.

1197
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,919
And since this game
involves ball possession, tackling,

1198
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:08,547
and trying to score goals,
Sun is going to be our best choice.

1199
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,716
<i>I play for our National Rugby Team.</i>

1200
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,552
<i>It's a contact sport,</i>
<i>so obviously there's been times</i>

1201
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:17,139
<i>when, you know,</i>
<i>both sides collide with each other.</i>

1202
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:20,351
<i>So whatever's out there, I can handle.</i>

1203
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,853
Who do you reckon
they're gonna pick first?

1204
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,236
<i>Death Match, round one.</i>

1205
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,822
<i>The game will begin.</i>

1206
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:36,993
Bring it in. Come on, everyone,
bring it in now.

1207
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,327
All right, Sun. Hands in.

1208
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,954
One, two, three! Thailand…

1209
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,330
Go!

1210
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,255
- Go on.
- This is tough!

1211
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,673
He's gonna be tough.

1212
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:55,678
- He knows exactly what he's doing there.
- Yeah, he could easily win this.

1213
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,681
Come on, Philippines.

1214
01:06:58,764 --> 01:06:59,890
Let's see it!

1215
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,524
MARK MUGEN
NATIONAL TEAM SAMBO ATHLETE

1216
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,485
Wow!

1217
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,321
- Oh, boy!
- We've got the upper hand.

1218
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,490
<i>I was surprised when I saw my opponent.</i>

1219
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,576
<i>I thought they'd pick their rugby player.</i>

1220
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:21,162
But once I realized who I was up against,

1221
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:22,538
I was a lot less nervous.

1222
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:24,373
The first thought that came to my head is,

1223
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,751
we anticipated that Mark,

1224
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:29,503
<i>being our sambo athlete, can take him,</i>

1225
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:32,048
<i>coming from a grappling background.</i>

1226
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:41,974
<i>I'm thinking, "I don't wanna go back home.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna be the first country."</i>

1227
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,727
<i>I had the advantage.</i>

1228
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,520
<i>That meant I had to win.</i>

1229
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:48,773
<i>Ready…</i>

1230
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,321
Yeah!

1231
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,707
<i>He immediately beat me to the ball.</i>

1232
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,543
<i>Just too big, too fast.</i>

1233
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,926
- Wow.
- Yeah, both of them are really strong.

1234
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,306
They're insanely fast.

1235
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,559
- Get him, Mark!
- Oh, my God.

1236
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,105
<i>At that point, I jumped on his back</i>

1237
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,564
<i>to try to slow him down.</i>

1238
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,360
Hey, get him off your back!

1239
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,528
Throw forward!

1240
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:41,534
<i>But he carried me like, uh,</i>
<i>like I was his little brother.</i>

1241
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:42,952
<i>And it's actually embarrassing.</i>

1242
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:47,456
<i>He carried me and the ball</i>
<i>and continued to walk towards the goal.</i>

1243
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,750
Get up! Walk, walk! That's it, that's it!

1244
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,460
- Go, Mark!
- Get him, Mark!

1245
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,922
Yeah!

1246
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:57,007
Yeah, good charge, good charge!

1247
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,802
That's just insane.
He's not strong enough.

1248
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,679
- Wow.
- He's not strong enough.

1249
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,516
He's a Sambo athlete, right? Or--

1250
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:07,351
Yeah, they said he's a sambo fighter.

1251
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,982
<i>Luckily, I was in possession of the ball.</i>

1252
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:16,360
<i>It was easy to hold onto,</i>
<i>I just pressed it down.</i>

1253
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:19,446
<i>He used more strength to steal it</i>
<i>than I used to keep it.</i>

1254
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:23,450
And that was when I realized, like,
"Okay, size matters."

1255
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,162
<i>And I know that</i>
<i>I have to find a way to win</i>

1256
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:30,040
<i>and look for an opening,</i>
<i>look for a weak spot.</i>

1257
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:33,878
<i>He may have been small,</i>
<i>but he was more than capable.</i>

1258
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:37,256
<i>He was a skilled fighter</i>
<i>and used some good jiujitsu techniques.</i>

1259
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,134
Two minutes, two minutes!

1260
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:43,179
Hang in there Sun!
You're closer to the goal right now!

1261
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,849
If he could just get up…

1262
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:49,101
I-I would reset my… my body.

1263
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,360
- Hey, check that out!
- Nice moves, man!

1264
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,821
He's in. His arm's in.

1265
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,489
He's gonna lose the ball.

1266
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:09,872
Look! He's losing his grip!

1267
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:11,665
Grab it, Mark! You got this, Mark!

1268
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:15,169
- Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!
- Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

1269
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:17,004
Holy moly. Submission.

1270
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,173
Whatever he's doing, it's working.

1271
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,051
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1272
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,637
What? Mark can wrestle!

1273
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,848
Grab the ball!
Grab the ball, grab the ball!

1274
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,516
Grab the ball. Grab the ball, yes!

1275
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,311
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1276
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:35,105
<i>I just kept pushing towards</i>
<i>the goal. Closer and closer.</i>

1277
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,775
Hang on!
Just 30 seconds left, Sun. All right?

1278
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,194
Thirty seconds!

1279
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:42,821
Put your force to the side! Sun!

1280
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,866
- Hang in there, Sun!
- almost there!

1281
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:47,534
Don't let go!

1282
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,453
Look!

1283
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:52,081
- That's rugby for ya.
- He's never gonna let go

1284
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,707
- of that ball, is he?
- That's crazy.

1285
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,722
<i>The match has ended.</i>

1286
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,141
The rugby player's good. I told you.

1287
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,310
Okay!

1288
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,437
- All right!
- Big match!

1289
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:19,024
Holy moly. What a fight, boys.

1290
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,151
<i>Since neither team scored,</i>

1291
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,821
<i>we will now enter our tiebreaker match.</i>

1292
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:25,864
Oy, in the tiebreak,

1293
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,409
if you're closest, that's…
that's the win then, yeah?

1294
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:31,662
This one, the one minute,
you've got to get the ball.

1295
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,831
Take it off, take it off.

1296
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:35,833
- Take a deep breath, okay?
- Here.

1297
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,418
You gotta get to the other side.

1298
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:41,171
Gonna be a rematch, one minute.

1299
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:43,757
Hold onto the ball, no matter what.

1300
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:47,303
<i>I was solely focused on the ball.</i>

1301
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:49,388
<i>All I had to do was steal it.</i>

1302
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:52,516
<i>I've gotta get</i>
<i>to the ball first this time.</i>

1303
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:54,476
<i>'Cause he beat me to it last time.</i>

1304
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,562
- Yeah!
- Feed him!

1305
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,398
- Huzzah!
- He's hungry, bro. Feed him.

1306
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,026
This is a match between men.

1307
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,236
<i>Stand by.</i>

1308
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:07,740
<i>Ready…</i>

1309
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,283
Let's go, bro. Get that ball.

1310
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:10,784
Yep, you have this.

1311
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:28,385
No.

1312
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,475
<i>I was sure that</i>
<i>as long as I got to the ball first,</i>

1313
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:37,811
<i>I could win. It would all fall into place.</i>

1314
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,356
<i>He was too big. He was too big to let up.</i>

1315
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:43,484
<i>And to… to risk having him stand up again,</i>

1316
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:46,070
<i>'cause I couldn't control him</i>
<i>in the first round…</i>

1317
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,365
- Sun! Push towards his side!
- You need to push harder!

1318
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,741
- Can't advance if you don't!
- Come on, push!

1319
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:58,540
- Head to their side!
- <i>If he is able to get to the ball</i>

1320
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,502
<i>and just crawl a few feet, he's gonna win.</i>

1321
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,212
<i>So I had to stop him in the middle.</i>

1322
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:06,090
- He's trying to push him.
- No way.

1323
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,763
Ooh, good technique.

1324
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:15,516
- Nice! Nice! Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes! Yes!

1325
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,226
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1326
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,937
- Which side wins?
- That side.

1327
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,605
- The Philippines?
- Yeah, the Philippines wins.

1328
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:22,731
- 'Cause they're closer?
- Yeah.

1329
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,025
<i>I was completely in the dark.</i>

1330
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,235
<i>I didn't know where we were.</i>

1331
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:27,945
Don't give up! Come on!

1332
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:30,572
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll!

1333
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,617
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on! Let's go, let's go!

1334
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,328
<i>And then once I got on top,</i>

1335
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,956
<i>I managed to squeeze side mount position.</i>

1336
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:42,334
That's it, man. There's no escape.

1337
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,044
Twenty seconds!

1338
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,297
- Go! Hold it!
- Fifteen seconds!

1339
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,466
- Fifteen seconds! Hold it, hold it!
- Hold it!

1340
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:53,137
- Ten seconds! Ten seconds!
- Hold it! Ten!

1341
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,013
Eight! Seven!

1342
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,349
Six! Five! Four!

1343
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,935
Three, two, one!

1344
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,815
<i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>

1345
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:14,366
<i>The winner of round one</i>

1346
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:16,743
<i>is the Philippines.</i>

1347
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:35,888
<i>I felt amazing.</i>

1348
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,348
<i>And I felt relief,</i>

1349
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:41,185
<i>because it was so much harder</i>
<i>than I thought it would be.</i>

1350
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:43,896
I honestly thought that
it wouldn't be as difficult as it was.

01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:53,405

01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:11,548
This will be more entertaining.

1359
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:14,843
Someone's gonna grab the ball
during a scuffle.

1360
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,222
Someone's gonna start
chasing them around the arena.

1361
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,558
I wonder who they're gonna pick.

1362
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:26,230
Second match, we do our… men.
Both men. Yeah?

1363
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,273
- Okay. Speed.
- Yeah.

1364
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,526
Guys, the ball is only three kilos.

1365
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:33,070
- And then I block the other one.
- When we get the ball,

1366
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:37,074
like, make sure that you get,
go closer to our goal.

1367
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:38,408
Yes, the other… the other…

1368
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,285
Yeah, the… the other side, other side.

1369
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,913
<i>It is a good pair</i>
<i>because I have the strength…</i>

1370
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:43,997
RAY
STRONGMAN

1371
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,124
<i>…and Manny Pacquiao has the speed.</i>

1372
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,044
<i>When I saw the team standings</i>
<i>for the first time…</i>

1373
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,128
MANNY PACQUIAO
BOXER

1374
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:53,131
…I was embarrassed to learn
that we came in eighth place overall.

1375
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,967
<i>We were in last place.</i>

1376
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,386
We told ourselves,

1377
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:02,224
"No need to worry. We'll make up for it."
So that's what we've set out to do.

1378
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:05,227
<i>We won't just win this challenge,</i>
<i>we'll restore our reputation.</i>

1379
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,396
Oh.

1380
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,941
Look at that. I think Pacquiao's up.

1381
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:13,026
It's you and James, right?

1382
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,906
At its core,
it's all about who has the ball, right?

1383
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,991
SUPERBON
MUAY THAI FIGHTER

1384
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,159
And to get the ball, you need to be fast,
and you need to be strong.

1385
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,829
<i>So I thought James and I would</i>
<i>make a pretty good team.</i>

1386
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:25,914
<i>One that could win us the second round.</i>

1387
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,416
JAMES RUSAMEEKAE
FORMER VOLLEYBALL PLAYER

1388
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,793
<i>Round two participants, it's time.</i>

1389
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:31,545
<i>Please enter the arena.</i>

1390
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:41,388
Superbon, Superbon, Superbon!

1391
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:43,307
Isn't he a Muay Thai fighter?

1392
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,810
Yeah.
He's a professional Muay Thai fighter.

1393
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:49,896
Wow. That's rough.

1394
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,857
What are they gonna do with the strongman?

1395
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:53,817
He's huge.

1396
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:57,863
Manny!

1397
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,118
Represent!

1398
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,538
Go, Manny! Let's go!

1399
01:17:07,247 --> 01:17:08,248
Nice, Manny.

1400
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:12,586
Come on, guys, let's go.
Dig deep. Come on!

1401
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:15,714
Well now, boxer versus kickboxer.

1402
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:17,090
Boxing against Muay Thai.

1403
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,053
How's it gonna go?

1404
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:25,557
<i>You know, the best part</i>
<i>about fighting against the Philippines</i>

1405
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,225
<i>is that I get to fight Pacquiao.</i>

1406
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:31,813
<i>It's a once-in-a lifetime chance,</i>
<i>facing off against an exceptional athlete.</i>

1407
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:34,358
<i>Which means I gotta beat him</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

1408
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,529
Is that a hair tie?

1409
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,532
Oh, he's switching it up, huh?

1410
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:45,202
I wanna see him get aggressive.
I wanna see if he can get aggressive.

1411
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:46,995
I wanna see him, like, get the sass out.

1412
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,246
Yeah, I wanna see if he can do it.

1413
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,041
<i>I decided I was gonna run up</i>
<i>and grab the ball.</i>

1414
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,336
<i>I knew we could take 'em, no problem.</i>

1415
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:56,171
<i>We're not gonna be eliminated.</i>

1416
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:57,964
<i>We will win this challenge.</i>

1417
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:00,592
As quick as you can, Manny.

1418
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,679
You have to get the ball first.

1419
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,765
<i>Death Match, round two.</i>

1420
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:07,974
<i>Stand by.</i>

1421
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,687
Let's go guys, push off, push off!
Get the ball first, come on!

1422
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,112
<i>Ready…</i>

1423
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,576
Let's go!

1424
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:30,455
Get it, get it!
