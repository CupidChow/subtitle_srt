00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:13,847
<i>Stand by.</i>

3
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,356
<i>Ready…</i>

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,614
Go!

5
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,201
Okay! Okay!

6
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,286
- Yes, like that.
- Flip her, c'mon!

7
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,079
- That's it! That's it!
- Flip her, c'mon! Come on!

8
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,212
- Hey, watch it! Careful!
- Don't go out of bounds!

9
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,465
<i>I kept trying</i>
<i>to grab her legs and flip her,</i>

10
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,967
<i>but she's a pro wrestler,</i>
<i>she wouldn't budge.</i>

11
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,218
Keep going! You can do it!

12
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,553
Take her out of bounds! Go with her!

13
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,637
Hang on!

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,723
- Her foot's dropping, you can do it!
- Make her drop it!

15
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,725
- You can do it!
- Make her drop it!

16
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,186
Make her drop it, come on!

17
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,645
No, no. No, it's not over yet.

18
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,106
Make her drop it, come on!

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,067
Push, push, push!

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,736
Come on, push her out!
Come on, push her out!

21
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,782
- That's it! That's it, just like that!
- She fell off!

22
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,118
- She's out!
- Out!

23
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,369
- Hey!
- Stop.

24
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,497
- Hey!
- <i>Game over.</i>

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,581
Hey!

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,126
<i>The team that survived</i>
<i>to Round Two is: Japan.</i>

27
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,377
- Okay!
- That's our girl!

28
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,129
- Let's go!
- Yeah.

29
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,423
- You crushed it! All right.
- Yeah, she did!

30
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,966
Nice job!

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,052
- Chin up, it's okay.
- Yeah, you did great.

32
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,179
<i>I really wish I held on longer.</i>

33
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,515
Who knows,
maybe I would've done a bit better.

34
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,350
That kind of regret stays with you.

35
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,852
Ah! I was so excited!

36
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,270
NONOKA OZAKI
NATIONAL TEAM WRESTLER

37
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,897
And it was such an intense match too!

38
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,149
I was so happy that I won.

39
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,112
My heart was like…
You know? I was really proud of myself.

40
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,948
- Nice, nice.
- Nice, nice, nice, nice.

41
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,241
Good job, really good.

42
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,325
- Thank you.
- Yeah, good job.

43
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:01,204
<i>Honestly, when we beat Korea,</i>
<i>I was so happy, like…</i>

44
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,791
Man, it just-- it felt incredible.

45
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,710
We've got only one more round to go.

46
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,339
And if we win, then Japan
gets to choose all the matchups.

47
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:15,301
<i>That's a huge advantage,</i>
<i>so we're determined to win this round too.</i>

48
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,262
<i>To be honest,</i>

49
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,681
<i>I'm still not over losing.</i>

50
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,975
It's like the shame's
etched into my bones.

51
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,227
Next time we meet, I won't just win,

52
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,187
<i>I'll wipe the floor with you.</i>

53
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,397
<i>Just you wait.</i>

54
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,025
<i>The Round Two overtime matches have ended.</i>

55
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:35,155
<i>Team Japan and Team Türkiye</i>
<i>will be advancing to Round Three.</i>

56
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,742
Final match! Woo-hoo!

57
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,329
Any idea what their game plan is?

58
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,916
<i>Uh, I feel like Türkiye</i>

59
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,003
is like this big, looming presence.

60
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,546
YOSHIO ITOI - FORMER
NATIONAL TEAM BASEBALL PLAYER

61
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,841
And so, when I was watching their match,

62
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,803
I got the impression that they
were also an incredibly strategic team.

63
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,305
KANA WATANABE
MMA FIGHTER

64
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,223
I noticed that
one of their players didn't fight.

65
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,392
<i>She stayed out of the circle.</i>

66
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,479
<i>And she would relay information to</i>
<i>her team. Her job was to watch the clock.</i>

67
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,939
Nefise, time?

68
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,357
Minute thirty-five!

69
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,692
Thirty-eight seconds!

70
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,445
Watch out! There's two on the outside!

71
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,488
- Five seconds!
- Nefise!

72
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,365
- On! On!
- Come on, get up here!

73
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,117
Two!

74
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,785
Yes! Yes!

75
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,537
NEFISE KARATAY -FORMER
NATIONAL TEAM TRACK ATHLETE

76
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,831
<i>I started to catch on</i>
<i>to what they were doing…</i>

77
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,791
SOICHI HASHIMOTO
NATIONAL TEAM JUDOKA

78
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,377
…and once I figured it out,
I passed it along to my own team.

79
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,006
We should try to cover them one-by-one…

80
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,090
KANA WATANABE
MMA FIGHTER

81
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,134
…then make sure Kana faces her in the end.

82
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,179
They've got a female wrestler.

83
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,348
- She's gonna be tough.
- Yeah, she looks tough.

84
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,807
YASEMIN ADAR YIGIT
NATIONAL TEAM WRESTLER

85
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,018
And with her height, it's like
going up against a male wrestler.

86
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,021
I guess I'm gonna have to take her on.

87
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,731
<i>I was nervous.</i>

88
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,524
<i>Our classes are completely different.</i>

89
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,111
<i>She's a world heavyweight champion,</i>
<i>76 kilograms</i>

90
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,447
and I'm way, way below that.

91
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,908
I'd convinced myself that there was no way

92
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,160
I'd end up facing her directly.

93
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,829
I think they're intimidated by us.

94
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,082
That, and they've gotta be tired.

95
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,208
- Tired?
- Yeah.

96
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,584
RECEP KARA - FORMER
NATIONAL TEAM OIL WRESTLER

97
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,795
Both Japan and Korea
had a lot of overtime matches.

98
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,131
I think they went overtime
like, four, maybe five times?

99
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,549
YASEMIN ADAR YIGIT
NATIONAL TEAM WRESTLER

100
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,968
I think it'll be an easy win.

101
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,972
We need to settle this
in one go, okay? No overtime.

102
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,390
- Right, let's do it.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,226
We'll take them down together.

104
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,395
Let's stick to our tactics.

105
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,105
Allah, please protect us.

106
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,734
Physical: Asia.

107
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,571
<i>Territorial Conquest: Final round.</i>

108
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,449
<i>In this third round, you will compete</i>

109
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,286
<i>to claim one territory.</i>

110
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,668
<i>It's time for the final match to begin.</i>

111
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,256
We'll prove that Japan's the strongest!

112
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,008
We plan to win! Let's go!

113
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,843
- Hey!
- Yeah!

114
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,557
As Team Türkiye,
we'll fight to secure a Turkish victory!

115
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,934
Bravo. Bravo, bravo! That's right!

116
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,936
Let's go!

117
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,875
PHYSICAL: ASIA

118
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,631
3. SHIPWRECK

119
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,593
<i>Stand by.</i>

120
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,095
Let's go!

121
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,181
<i>Ready.</i>

122
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,444
Go! Go! Go!

123
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,279
Go! Go! Go!

124
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,698
- Leg it! Leg it! Leg it! Leg it! Leg it!
- That's it!

125
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,867
- Come on, let's go!
- Fight!

126
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,286
Take 'em out! Get 'em away! Get 'em away!

127
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,419
Big guy's going for Okami.

128
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,296
Turn!

129
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,631
- Okay.
- Turn!

130
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,549
Hold on, hold on!

131
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,511
Whoa, Okami went flying!

132
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,519
<i>My goal was to take down</i>
<i>the captain of Team Japan.</i>

133
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,938
<i>No one else, he was my only target.</i>

134
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,567
<i>I was so hyper-fixated</i>
<i>on attacking the other contestants</i>

135
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,320
that I gave Recep
an opening to get behind me.

136
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,323
And that was a huge mistake.

137
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,329
Get down!

138
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,747
No, no! Don't let go!

139
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,418
<i>Everything went according to plan.</i>

140
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,963
<i>Each member of our team</i>
<i>subdued their designated opponent,</i>

141
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,591
<i>so I was free to let my target go</i>
<i>and get to where I needed to be.</i>

142
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,343
I thought, "What are they doing?

143
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,761
What's going on?"

144
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:13,724
It psyched me out. I just thought,
"What's gonna happen? Are we gonna lose?"

145
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,688
Looks like they pinned down
one contestant each.

146
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,566
- Ooh.
- This is getting intense.

147
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,276
They're fighting outside the ring.

148
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,325
Ali!

149
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,579
I'll take him down!

150
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,083
Hurry up, Ali! Get inside! Now!

151
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,418
- Look at that, she's got his leg!
- Go! Go!

152
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,130
Man, she's really strong!

153
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,677
For the team! For the team!

154
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,847
<i>If we wanted to win, we needed to move.</i>

155
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,432
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
- What?

156
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,191
- Whoa, she's…
- Oh!

157
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,859
- Oh, look at her go!
- She's pretty strong!

158
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,322
She's a powerhouse.

159
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,282
- Man, that's crazy…
- Yeah.

160
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,661
<i>I knew that I could beat her.</i>

161
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,914
<i>So I went for it, right then and there.</i>

162
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,998
Anıl!

163
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,669
Come on!
Give it everything! Let's go, girls!

164
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,505
Let's go!

165
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,424
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

166
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,843
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

167
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,969
We need one more!

168
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,348
- Somebody go for it!
- Get inside!

169
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,432
Just one!

170
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,267
There's seven seconds left!

171
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,983
- Come on, hurry up!
- Nefise!

172
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,402
Nefise!

173
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,698
- Come on, hurry up!

174
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,951
- Hold it! Stay right there! Don't move!
- Hang on, hang on!

175
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,035
- Stay!
- Hold!

176
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,330
- Hold it! Stay right there! Don't move!
- Hang on, hang on!

177
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,512
- Stay right there!
- Hang on, hang on!

178
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,514
- Yes!
- It's over! We won!

179
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,598
<i>Game over.</i>

180
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,851
- Stop, stop, stop!
- It's over! We won!

181
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,812
- Recep got in.
- We won.

182
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,440
- Right down to the second.
- Okay.

183
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,984
Yes!

184
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,778
Oh, yeah! We won!

185
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,154
Look here!

186
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,865
- Take a good, long look!
- Come on, let's go!

187
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,577
Bravo!

188
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,583
- Amazing, man.
- Nice job.

189
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,126
- Amazing.
- Nice.

190
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,130
Amazing, man. Amazing.

191
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:56,178

We lost 'cause Anıl threw me out.
And it cost us the win.

194
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,354
I messed up. He got behind me.

195
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,941
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

196
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,279
<i>Türkiye managed to win the match.</i>

197
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:18,159
<i>But I took comfort in knowing</i>
<i>that we really had given it our all.</i>

198
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,119
I mean, obviously I was upset.

YOSHIO ITOI

200
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,456
I hadn't felt that way in so long.

201
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,583
<i>And it was all the more frustrating</i>

202
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,461
<i>because we'd worked so hard</i>
<i>to make it to the final round.</i>

203
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,049
<i>This marks the end of the first quest.</i>

00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,509
<i>The Territorial Conquest winner</i>

205
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,219

Let's go, man!

207
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,767
- Good job, Japan!
- Well done, Japan!

208
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,269
Whoa…

209
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,730
- One, two, three! Team Türkiye!
- One, two, three! Team Türkiye!

210
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,445
Now everyone knows
the power of the Turkish people…

00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,912

218
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,589
Ah. Here, Captain.

219
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,341
Thanks.

220
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,721
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

221
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,232
<i>Team Türkiye.</i>

222
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,694
<i>As the winners of the first quest,</i>
<i>you have been given an advantage.</i>

223
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,239
<i>You will decide the matchups</i>
<i>for the next quest.</i>

224
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,824
Whoo!

225
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,453
- Must be nice.
- Yeah.

226
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,580
That's a huge advantage. Huge.

227
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,710
<i>However, before you deliberate,</i>

228
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:55,506
<i>we will reveal the keyword that describes</i>
<i>the second quest.</i>

229
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,757
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

230
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,801
Oh, no…

231
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,594
Physical: Asia.

232
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,390
<i>The keyword that describes</i>
<i>your second quest…</i>

233
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,271
<i>is "shipwreck."</i>

234
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,189
Yes!

235
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,483
- <i>…is "shipwreck."</i>
- Yes!

237
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,945
- Nice!
- We got this, man. We got this.

238
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,116
- Okay.
- We've got this one.

239
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,952
When we heard "Shipwreck,"
we thought, "Awesome.

240
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,246
That means we're probably
hauling something up."

241
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,540
<i>It sounded like a test of strength,</i>

242
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,126
<i>or maybe something that required</i>
<i>a lot of stamina.</i>

243
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,128
<i>With my explosive power and endurance,</i>

244
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,547
<i>I was feeling pretty confident.</i>

245
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,507
<i>We're the ones picking the matches.</i>

246
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,925
<i>They should be nervous.</i>

247
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,981
Who should we pick?

248
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,151
I was thinking that group.
The one next to Japan…

249
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,279
No, wait, two teams over.
The one two over from Japan.

250
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,784
They're looking right at us.

251
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,285
They're comin' after us.

252
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,620
That's fine.

253
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,372
- Maybe Team… Yeah.
- Thailand?

254
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,916
Maybe. He's certainly fit, but…

255
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,796
I mean, it's possible
that they'll choose to fight us.

256
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,380
Team Philippines is good too.

257
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,465
So…

258
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,178
They're-they're looking at us.

259
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,096
They are thinking
that they will choose us.

260
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,264
Yeah, maybe.

MARK MUGEN
NATIONAL TEAM SAMBO FIGHTER

262
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,019
We were concerned if, uh,
Türkiye would choose us, because they won.

263
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,189
So we were a little bit nervous
because they're much bigger than us.

264
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,233
As long as we weren't against Türkiye,
I knew we'd be fine.

JANG EUN-SIL

266
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,319

JAMES RUSAMEEKAE

268
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,906
that everybody's trying to avoid
facing off against, you know?

269
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,159
I mean, the strength they showed
in the first challenge was insane.

270
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,787
<i>Contestants.</i>

271
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,957
<i>The time has come to announce the matchups</i>

272
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,793
<i>for the second challenge</i>
<i>of </i>Physical: Asia<i>.</i>

273
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,713
<i>Captain of Team Türkiye, Recep Kara,</i>

274
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,843
<i>please reveal the first picks</i>
<i>for each group pairing.</i>

275
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,805
I think they're gonna pit
the strongest teams against each other.

276
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,140
I'm so curious to see.

277
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,601
If it's Japan versus Korea, we'd win.

278
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,812
I mean, at least we'd know
what we're up against.

279
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,816
You know, I thought, "Türkiye's seen
first-hand just how strong we are."

280
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,111
<i>So I assumed we'd get paired with</i>
<i>either Korea or Australia,</i>

281
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,281
<i>teams we were evenly matched with</i>
<i>in terms of strength.</i>

282
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm fine if we're paired with Japan.
It's a chance for payback.

283
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,828
<i>We will now announce the matchups.</i>

284
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,917
Oh…

285
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,169
Oh, man…

286
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,345
Okay, Australia's a better matchup
than Korea.

287
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,223
Looks like we've been separated, huh?

288
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,769
<i>And now,</i>

289
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,023
<i>we will announce the chosen opponents</i>
<i>for each team on the board.</i>

290
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,608
<i>Group A.</i>

291
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,444
<i>Team Japan,</i>
<i>you will be facing off against…</i>

292
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,196
Come on, let's see who it is.

293
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:11,160
I hope we're up against a smaller team.
You know, smaller players.

294
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,669
Come on, come on, come on.

295
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,838
- <i>…Australia.</i>
- Yeah!

296
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,011
Yeah!

297
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,055
Yeah!

298
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,726
- Seriously?
- Put strong teams together, makes sense.

299
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,395
Have at it, you two…

300
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,690
Australia and Japan are…

301
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,692
both really strong opponents.

302
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,779
So obviously we put them
against each other.

303
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,364
We plan on winning!

304
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,158
<i>I do think they're underestimating us,</i>

305
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,912
but I'm ready to prove that our team
is the strongest one here right now.

306
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,830
We're gonna crush them!

307
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,374
We're coming for them.

308
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,792
Let's go!

309
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,879
<i>We weren't concerned about</i>
<i>who they were gonna match us up with.</i>

310
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,130
They better watch out

311
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,466
because they're gonna get shipwrecked.

312
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,804
<i>Next,</i>

313
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,473
<i>The selected matchup for Group B will be…</i>

314
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,309
All right, who are we up against?

315
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,603
God, please let it be our team.

316
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,940
<i>…Mongolia</i>

317
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,943
<i>versus Philippines.</i>

318
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,236
Philippines.

319
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,572
This should be a breeze.

320
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,950
Yeah.

321
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,082
We will make sure
that we will win this, uh… next level.

322
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,960
I can say this with confidence.

323
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,754
For this next challenge,
we're going to do whatever it takes.

324
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,423
And win the match.

325
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,466
Let's fight, Philippines!

326
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,885
We'll show you the might
of the Mongolian warriors!

327
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,349
This time around, Team Mongolia won't
go easy on Team Philippines.

328
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,852
We're gonna wipe the floor with them.

329
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,774
<i>Next up,</i>

330
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,194
<i>The selected matchup for Group C will be…</i>

331
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,321
Indonesia or Thailand.

332
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,239
Yep.

333
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,366
Doesn't matter, either or.

334
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,544
<i>…Korea</i>

335
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,963
<i>versus Thailand.</i>

336
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,341
Oh, it's us!

337
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,886
Oi!

338
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,305
- Okay!
- Okay, okay.

339
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,431
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

340
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,932
Let's go, let's go!

341
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,768
When I heard "Thailand", I went,

342
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,772
"Hmm? Okay then. I'll take an easy win."

343
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,315
I'm confident.

344
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,025
But please cheer for Team Korea.

345
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,068
Hey, Korea, let me tell you.

346

PLOY
MUAY THAI COACH

347
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,821
No matter what happens next,
Thailand's gonna win.

348
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,822
Guaranteed.

349
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,574
Look, I'm not afraid of anything.

350
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,451
Korea might have kimchi,

351
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,952
but Thailand's got som tam.

352
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,623
Korea might have Korean Air,
but we've got Thai Airways.

353
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:06,919
And sure, you gave us BLACKPINK's Jisoo,
but we gave you BLACKPINK's Lisa.

354
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,213
We're practically equals,
so I say let's go!

355
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,677
<i>Group D is Türkiye versus Indonesia.</i>

356
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,224
Come on, guys.

357
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,184
Come on! Let's fight again!

358
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,103
All right, let's do this.

359
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,562
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

360
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,149
It's the blood spilled on the flag
that makes it a flag.

361
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,903
Your homeland
is the land you are willing to die for.

362
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,029
Bring it on!

363
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,280
Good luck!

364
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,033
All right. Keep fighting 'till the end.

JEREMIAH LAKHWANI
HYBRID ATHLETE

366
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,372
Look, let's get one thing straight,
all right? It's not gonna be easy.

367
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,542
Yes! Okay, fight me!

368
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,339
Physical: Asia.

369
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,133
<i>Contestants,</i>

370
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,970
<i>as of this moment, you are all at risk</i>
<i>of elimination.</i>

371
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,513
Ooh…

372
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,561
<i>Please prepare yourselves</i>
<i>for your second quest.</i>

373
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,420
Here again.

374
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,464
Back in the torso heaven.

375
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,549
Oh, wow…

376
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,552
Oh…

377
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,180
- Shipwreck, right?
- Shipwreck.

378
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,681
What do we reckon?

379
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,476
I feel like this next quest is gonna be
a lot more to our strengths of

380
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,604
- strong, moving shit.
- Yeah.

381
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,107
Previous two seasons, that's what
the next challenge was, was loading stuff.

382
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,568
It was loading sand,
whoever had the most sand.

383
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,486
Hey, morning!

384
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,989
Hey! Here they are!

385
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,617
- Hey!
- Hey, morning!

386
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,035
- Hey! Morning!
- Morning!

387
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,536
Good morning!

388
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,537
You ready?

389
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,706
- Let's go!
- Huge day! Huge day.

390
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,042
- Excited? Excited.
- Yeah, excited.

391
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,877
<i>I have a lot of respect for Japan, but</i>

392
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,213
honestly it didn't matter who
you put us in there with.

393
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,632
<i>Team Australia was gonna</i>
<i>run through anybody.</i>

394
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,636
What do you guys think of Team Australia?

395
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,388
I think they've got the strongest roster
as far as physique goes, right?

396
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,306
Like strength?

397
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,891
They've got the…

398
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,309
- Strongman?
- They've got the strongman, right.

399
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,519
I mean, it's in his name.

400
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,397
Strongman! Japan team, come in!

401
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,690
- Want me to join the team?
- Yes, come in!

402
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,816
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Yeah!

403
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,989
- Bring everyone!
- Please, please! One people!

404
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:48,330
Australia's all about power.
All the power!

405
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,125
Oh, yeah!

406
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,463
I'd expect nothing less.

407
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,340
<i>I think that man fears nothing.</i>

408
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,883
Honestly, it freaks me out a bit.

409
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,969
I thought they were lacking
in agility, but--

410
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,262
They've got that too, right.

411
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,931
- We should be giving 120 percent.
- Absolutely.

412
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,933
- We're actually pretty well balanced.
- Yeah.

413
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,393
- Yeah, we're the most balanced.
- Yeah.

414
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,937
Don't underestimate them.

415
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,438
Everyone's world-class, so…

416
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,233
- Our opponents today are Japan.
- Yeah.

417
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,192
I respect them,

418
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,361
but they're not friends
until after this whole thing.

419
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,279
Yeah, absolutely.

420
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,321
All right, guys.

421
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,240
Let's absolutely decimate this one.

422
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,871
<i>I'm more confident than ever.</i>

423
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,040
<i>This is how strong we are,</i>
<i>come and get us.</i>

424
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,169
<i>We can't just rely on strength, we need to</i>
<i>use our agility, speed, and intelligence.</i>

425
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,256
<i>That's how we'll destroy</i>
<i>the super-physique of Australia.</i>

426
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,634
- Let's go, guys!
- Let's go, Japan!

427
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:09,328
- What?
- Wow. What the hell.

428
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,996
Holy moly.

429
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,419
Whoa!

430
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,757
- Ah, look, it's a real shipwreck!
- Amazing. Just look at this.

431
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,592
There it is.

432
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,054
<i>I mean, man.</i>
<i>What are we gonna do with this?</i>

433
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,640
Oh, my goodness.

434
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,100
Yes! Water?

435
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,227
Water, sand…

436
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,772
What's up with the water?

437
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,106
Can we swim in it?

438
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,900
I think it's a bit too shallow.

439
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,485
I mean, with a little effort.

440
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,612
- That looks like a prison.
- Maybe we can chuck them in here.

441
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,115
- No, I think you're right.
- That is a prison!

442
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,409
Maybe if we tag them,
they have to go to jail.

443
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,577
Play on giant kids' stuff, so…

444
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,495
ELONI VUNAKECE

445
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,829
…I can't wait to do it.

446
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,415
Physical: Asia.

447
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,627
<i>We will now begin the second quest</i>

448
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,922
<i>whose outcome will determine</i>
<i>our first elimination.</i>

449
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,342
<i>Your second quest is…</i>

450
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,185
<i>…The Shipwreck Transportation Match.</i>

451
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,610
Whoa. Yes.

452
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,530
I felt like I was in
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

453
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,907
<i>It was like an actual shipwreck.</i>

454
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,909
<i>You know, it was unreal.</i>

455
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,081
<i>I mean, I was blown away.</i>
<i>I'd never seen anything like it.</i>

456
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,874
<i>It was just this incredible set.</i>

457
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,167
YOSHIO ITOI
FORMER BASEBALL PLAYER

458
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,711
<i>In this battle of the high seas,</i>

459
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,632
<i>each team must transport</i>
<i>over six tons of goods</i>

460
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:49,553
<i>from the site of the shipwreck,</i>
<i>to the cargo hold in your team's base.</i>

461
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,641
- Come on!
- Go, Eddie. Go, Eddie, go!

462
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,270
Six tons?

463
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,479
Six?

464
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,481
Shit, this is crazy.

465
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,859
<i>You must transport two types of goods.</i>

466
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,403
<i>Large crates and small sacks.</i>

467
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,531
<i>The crates must travel by air</i>

468
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,076
- <i>and the sacks must travel by cart.</i>
- Everyone, push!

469
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,330
<i>Whoever is selected to move the crates</i>

470
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,041
<i>cannot be replaced</i>
<i>for the duration of the match.</i>

471
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,044
Whoever does crates can only do
crates for the rest of the…

472
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,088
We'll need to choose carefully.

473
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,716
<i>The duration of the match is 20 minutes.</i>

474
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:32,053
<i>Before we begin,</i>
<i>please take a moment to strategize.</i>

475
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,016
- I think to start--
- All five of us should move cargo.

476
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,934
We'll start with the men
each grabbing a crate,

477
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,103
- and leave them over here.
- We'll leave it here. Exactly.

478
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,358
So, we'll start with those four crates…

479
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,818
- And push through it.
- …just right off the bat.

480
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:51,323
We figured that the key to winning
was to find the most efficient method

481
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,991
to move these crates across the sky.

482
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,577
We decided to have Hashimoto do
the air transport,

483
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,039
since among the male members,
he's got both good strength and agility.

- I'm excited!
- Let's go, buddy!

487
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,047
Twenty minutes in the air. I've got it.

488
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,633

490
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,593
…I should slip into the role.

491
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,637
- We don't want to overexert ourselves.
- Yeah.

492
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,347
- Yeah, you're right.
- We need to keep it consistent.

493
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,973
And remember, guys, we gotta be flexible.

494
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,350
Let's say shit starts happening.

495
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,185
Everyone's doing something. No dead time.

496
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,811
Yep. Communication, communication.

497
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,855

<i>The Shipwreck Transportation Match.</i>

500
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,495
- All right, let's use our heads!
- Twenty minutes!

501
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,581
<i>The match will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

502
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,832
Yeah, I'm ready, bro.

503
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,253
<i>Stand by.</i>

504
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,547
<i>We can't go home just yet.</i>

505
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,967
<i>I do what needs to be done for my team</i>
<i>to win. That's what I'm here for.</i>

506
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,051
<i>Ready.</i>

507
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,021
Take your time, take your time.

508
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,403
- Let's go, bro. Enjoy.
- Good luck.

509
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,913
Yes, Eloni!

510
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,040
It's sturdy.

511
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,433
<i>There were</i>
<i>all these huge obstacles everywhere.</i>

512
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,820
All right. Got it.

513
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,325
- Can you carry one by yourself?
- Let's go together.

514
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,246
<i>We had to carry the crate together.</i>

515
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,126
<i>And their rugby player's</i>
<i>just going for it.</i>

516
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,172
Let's go, team. Come on.

517
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,132
It was a precarious situation.

518
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,675
Leave it there! Leave it there!

519
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,969
All right, bring her up, Eddie.
Bring her up.

520
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,054
Off you go, Eloni.

521
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,974
Good, girls.

522
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,143
<i>You had to watch the steps</i>
<i>really carefully</i>

523
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,270
<i>because it was so, like, vertical.</i>

524
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,147
It feels much heavier.

525
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,940
- Come on.
- It's crushing my hand.

526
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,734
Leave it there. Go, go, go, go!

527
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,653
Go, go, go! I got it.
I got it. Go, go, go!

528
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,321
- You good?
- Yep.

529
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,447
Careful.

530
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,202
Yeah, perfect. Thank you.

531
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,398
<i>I knew he'd excel in aerial maneuvering.</i>

532
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,024
<i>I expected nothing less.</i>

533
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,486
<i>But I was struggling to keep up with him.</i>

534
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,994
<i>I had to hurry. There wasn't a choice.</i>

535
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,289
50 kilos! Hurry up!

536
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,259
<i>Two men on Japan's crates.</i>

537
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,553
I think that just gives us
a boost of confidence.

538
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,805
Beautiful.

539
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,978
Slide it down. Slide it down.

540
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,067
Good job. Leave it there.

541
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,152
Yeah. Go.

542
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,698
Leave the bags at the bottom!

543
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,034
Okay, while everyone's here,

544
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,745
- throw me the bags.
- Okay, bags. Bags.

545
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,038
<i>Eddie was gonna be the big man.</i>

546
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,875
<i>He was gonna be that middleweight,</i>

547
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,086
<i>and me and Eloni were just gonna</i>
<i>run 'em back and forth. Back and forth.</i>

548
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,556
<i>As hard as we can, we'll win.</i>

549
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,391
<i>We'll beat any team at any challenge.</i>

550
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,852
Okay!

551
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,696
FIFTH CRATE - THIRD CRATE

552
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,510
<i>Our initial strategy was</i>
<i>to try and outpace Team Australia</i>

553
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,137
<i>and get our crates across</i>
<i>much, much faster.</i>

554
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,185
Let's go!

555
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,907
<i>I could feel the difference in strength,</i>

556
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,744
<i>at least, endurance-wise,</i>
<i>when moving the crates.</i>

557
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,999
But when we switched over
and started moving the sandbags…

558
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,376
KATSUMI NAKAMURA
NATIONAL TEAM SWIMMER

559
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,752
…we were able to keep up a faster pace.

560
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,802
That's… three!

561
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,306
Should we move 'em?

562
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,810
The sandbags actually piled up
a lot faster than expected.

563
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:54,894
Let's go!

564
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,689
<i>So we ended up deciding</i>
<i>to do a few more trips.</i>

565
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,440
- Throwing it over.
- Okay.

566
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,363
- Should we go for it?
- Sure.

567
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,574
7 BAGS (140 KG)

568
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,950
This is heavy!

569
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,286
Two, three!

570
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,624
<i>When we started pushing,</i>
<i>it was heavier than I expected,</i>

571
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,126
<i>which caught me off guard.</i>

572
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,005
- Keep going.
- Ready?

573
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,674
<i>We would alternate.</i>

574
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:28,011
<i>I would push the crate up</i>
<i>while he regained his footing,</i>

575
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,679
<i>and then he'd do the same for me.</i>

576
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,180
And go!

577
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,643
<i>There was a surprising amount</i>
<i>of strategy required to move the sandbags.</i>

578
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,695
<i>Ten minutes remain.</i>

579
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,453
<i>We will now reveal the weight.</i>

580
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,836
We're ahead!

581
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,962
We're in the lead!

582
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,340
I was surprised.
I thought, "This might just work!"

583
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,925
Yes!

584
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,889
<i>We can win this. I know we can.</i>

585
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,599
Keep it up!

586
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,148
<i>Wow, we didn't expect it.</i>

587
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,275
<i>Did they swap the scores around?</i>

588
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,777
<i>What was going on?</i>

589
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,613
<i>But also, we're still in the game.</i>

590
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,906
<i>We've just got to move on.</i>

591
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,827
<i>As they've made me team captain,</i>

592
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,622
so I-I feel like it is my responsibility.

593
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,749
Come here.

594
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,710
<i>So if we saw crates needed help,</i>
<i>we were moving on crates.</i>

595
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,795
Let's go!

596
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,464
Almost halfway. Let's go.

597
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,843
<i>If we saw the bags were</i>
<i>piling up, we got the bags down the chute.</i>

598
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:55,098
Ten, twenty kgs. One…

599
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,559
<i>We were also going to</i>
<i>have to switch on a dime</i>

600
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,353
<i>depending on who needed what.</i>

601
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,737
Oh, Mum!

602
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,239
Okay, let's push.

603
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,323
14 SACKS (280 KG)

604
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,408
Ready?

605
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,451
Lift! Now!

606
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,537
Lift! Now!

607
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,747
Oh, my God.

608
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,626
<i>The first time me and Eloni</i>
<i>pushed the cart,</i>

609
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,128
I thought to myself, "Oh, shit."

610
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,463
<i>That thing, I think we loaded</i>
<i>about 400-odd kilos in it.</i>

611
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,923
<i>We both really struggled.</i>

612
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,342
<i>No movement. No luck.</i>

613
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,228
One, two, three, go.

614
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,688
Almost there.

615
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,068
Let's go.

616
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,696
<i>It was tricky.</i>
<i>We almost died two or three times.</i>

617
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,864
- Come on.
- Yeah!

618
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,615
Good shit, boys!

619
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,909
- Good shit, boys!
- Let's go!

620
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,244
Yeah, it was heavy.

621
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,664
<i>We threw our first load in the mine cart.</i>

622
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,672
FIRST CART - FOURTH CART

623
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,050
Okay.

624
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,516
- Five's good.
- Let's go.

625
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,604
<i>We eventually figured out</i>
<i>how to go faster,</i>

626
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,689
<i>and that meant we could make more trips.</i>

627
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,526
<i>I think we figured that</i>

628
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,279
<i>if we could make multiple trips</i>
<i>with smaller loads,</i>

629
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,698
<i>we'd be able to amass</i>
<i>more weight than Australia.</i>

630
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,203
<i>And I knew that the only way I could win</i>
<i>the match was to give it my all.</i>

631
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,504
You good?

632
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,756
More sandbags, please!

633
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,093
Bring us as many as you can, guys!

634
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,639
I'm not giving up.

635
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,235
Are we good?

636
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,903
If there's no more crates…

637
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:14,987
We're done.

638
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:21,452
<i>To be honest, we never anticipated that</i>
<i>we would eventually run out of crates.</i>

639
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,871
5 MINUTES AGO

640
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,792
Take that one, Dom. This is the last one.

641
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,794
So I'm coming across,
and my team is telling me

642
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,045
there's no more crates.

643
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,797
<i>But then I look to the right</i>

644
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,216
<i>and notice Japan hasn't finished</i>
<i>loading their crates.</i>

645
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,386
Grab one of their boxes!

646
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,013
Grab one of their boxes!

647
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,849
Then they can't catch up!

648
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,560
Then they can't catch up!

649
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,774
<i>Dom was the one</i>

650
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,860
that was, like, our eyes in the sky.

651
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:58,156
Good shit, girls. That's the way to
do it. They can't catch us with boxes out.

652
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,407
- Leave it.
- Smashed it.

653
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,659
Yep!

654
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,703
Yes! Good shit, Rob. I got it.

655
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,039
- Come on.
- Let's go for that last one.

656
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,878
Let's go!

657
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:13,963
Get it.

658
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,550
<i>And then we ended up taking</i>
<i>some of Japan's crates as well.</i>

659
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,430
<i>We turned around</i>

660
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,850
<i>and noticed that Australia was stealing</i>
<i>some of our crates for themselves.</i>

661
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,435
<i>And that was really frustrating.</i>

662
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,772
<i>I realized if we could take</i>
<i>some of Japan's crates,</i>

663
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,108
there was no way
that they could catch up to us.

664
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,454
<i>I didn't expect them</i>
<i>to leave Hashimoto hanging.</i>

665
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,834
<i>But even then, despite</i>
<i>what had happened, I didn't give up.</i>

666
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:52,960
<i>I was determined.</i>

667
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,755
So I just clung to what I could do.

668
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,174
- Hey, let's have fun!
- Okay!

669
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,383
Let's try to enjoy this!

670
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,177
We've got four more minutes!

671
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,596
I know it's hard, guys! I know!

672
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,057
But we're in the home stretch,
so keep it up!

673
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,017
<i>I definitely thought</i>
<i>we had a fighting chance.</i>

674
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,352
Just a little more!

675
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,481
<i>I could hear my muscles screaming in pain.</i>

676
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,034
<i>Straight for the win.</i>

677
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,454
I've got two!
Yes, Eloni, you f****** animal!

678
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,376
Let's go!

679
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,256
Bring 'em up! Yes, Rob!

680
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,840
- That's my boy!
- Three minutes!

681
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,093
Three minutes! 02:50, come on!

682
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,679
- You keep pushing, gang. Keep pushing!
- Go!

683
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,180
One more! One more! One more!

684
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,018
Everyone, come here!

685
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,604
Oi, come down! Come down!

686
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,314
Let's go!

687
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,402
01:45, everyone push the cart!

688
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,947
Let's go, team!
Bring it, bring it, bring it!

689
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,115
Chain, gang! Let's go!

690
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,159
Let's go! Hurry!

691
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,245
- 01:30! 01:30!
- Slowly. We got time. We got time.

692
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,329
Push the cart!

693
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,874
- We've cleared out the sand now!
- We're good on sand.

694
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,252
Hey, everyone! Help us out!

695
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,878
Go, go, go!

696
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,343
Hey, guys! Get down here!

697
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,014
- All right, I'm going up.
- Push it up.

698
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,182
One-twenty!

699
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,267
Push! Push!

700
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,269
Good! Go, go, go! Start, start!

701
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,854
- Go! Push!
- Come on!

702
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,105
Let's go!

703
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,607
Go!

704
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,527
<i>It felt like we'd pushed</i>
<i>the pedal down in a car.</i>

705
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,070
<i>Like we went full throttle.</i>

706
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,784
Let's go!

707
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,454
This is us! Let's go!

708
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,913
Last minute!

709
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,416
- All together!
- Everybody, push!

710
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,168
Everybody, push!

711
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,378
Push on our backs! Let's go!

712
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,297
<i>We had to see it through to the end.</i>

713
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,674
<i>We combined our strength</i>
<i>and pushed through.</i>

714
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:13,142
This is us! This is us!
Let's go! Last minute!

715
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,727
- Unload! Unload!
- Unload.

716
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,193
All right, grab it.

717
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,447
Carry it all together, guys! Let's go!

718
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,203
That's it. That's it. Easy money.

719
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,497
- Thirty-five, thirty seconds to go!
- Here!

720
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,083
Get a bag, get a bag, get another bag!

721
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,001
Keep going!

722
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,753
You can get it. You can get one bag.

723
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,171
We don't quit!

724
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,923
Let's go! Keep it up till the end!

725
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,592
Together, guys! Together!

726
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,600
- Okay, we're good to go!
- Hurry!

727
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,310
Go!

728
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,978
Come on!

729
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,146
Go, pull it!

730
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,731
Seven, six…

731
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,149
Go, now!

732
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,237
- Five, four, three…
- Come on, let's go!

733
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,489
- Let's go!
- It derailed!

734
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,657
Hurry, hurry!

735
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,450
- It's okay. Good.
- Nice!

736
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,329
<i>Stop. Game over.</i>

737
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,665
Nice fight!

738
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,291
Nice fight!

739
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,627
Yeah!

740
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,631
Whoo!

741
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,426
Yes!

742
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,678
Bags, crates, everything.
You guys were amazing.

743
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,054
- Let's go.
- Amazing.

744
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,222
Eloni!

745
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,015
Well done. Well done.

746
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,435
- Come here. Good job.
- Well done.

747
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,270
Nice. Hey.

748
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,438
Good job, guys.

749
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,734
Physical: Asia.

<i>Second quest:</i>
<i>Shipwreck Transportation Match.</i>

751
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,994
<i>Japan versus Australia.</i>
<i>The final results are as follows.</i>

752
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,502
Look at our crates stacked up.

753
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,712
We've got this.

754
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,173
<i>Japan.</i>

755
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,050
<i>1,820 kg.</i>

756
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,598
- Really good job. That's a lot. Two ton.
- Well done.

757
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,142
You moved two ton.

758
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,477
<i>Australia.</i>

759
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,023
Two, give us two.

760
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,740
<i>2,100 kg.</i>

761
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,202
<i>2,100 kg.</i>

762
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,956
<i>The winning team</i>

763
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,918
<i>is Australia.</i>

764
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,347
JAPAN
18 CRATES, 46 BAGS

765
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,974
AUSTRALIA
22 CRATES, 50 BAGS

766
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,394
<i>At the end of the day,</i>
<i>Australia was simply the stronger team.</i>

767
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,563
<i>But Japan really gave it their all.</i>

768
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,025
<i>I really thought we were going to win.</i>

769
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,735
It's really frustrating.

770
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,112
Well, that was disappointing.

771
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,989
Sorry, I let you down.

772
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,370
Genuinely the best feeling ever.

773
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,747
- Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!
- Oi! Oi! Oi!

774
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,999
<i>Our endorphins were just out of control.</i>

775
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,919
<i>So we were… we were on a huge high.</i>
<i>We were so excited.</i>

776
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,216
<i>The key factor for winning quest two</i>
<i>was teamwork.</i>

777
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,093
<i>Without a doubt, it was teamwork.</i>

778
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,511
Yeah, I was very proud.

779
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,181
<i>I feel like the team</i>
<i>is becoming a family even more.</i>

780
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,474
I'm just gonna throw that out.

781
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,948
Oh, this is legitimately…

782
00:42:56,031 --> 00:43:00,411
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow.

783
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,167
It's a shipwreck.

784
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,754
They weren't kidding.
There's a literal shipwreck here.

785
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,382
Physical: Asia.

786
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,968
<i>Second quest:</i>

787
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,429
<i>the Shipwreck Transportation Match</i>

788
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,848
<i>…Transportation Match.</i>

789
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,559
- Yeah.
- All right, all right. All right.

790
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,605
<i>Each team must transport</i>
<i>over six tons of goods</i>

791
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:31,233
<i>from the site of the shipwreck</i>
<i>to the cargo hold in your team's base.</i>

792
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,570
<i>The crates must travel by air,</i>

793
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,947
<i>and the sacks must travel by cart.</i>

794
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,408
<i>The duration of the match is 20 minutes.</i>

795
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,829
'Cause the thing is, it might be
more efficient to focus on the bags

796
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,498
because it's…
Three is already more than one crate.

797
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,584
- Yeah.
- Fifty's not that heavy, right?

798
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,294
- It's light. It's light.
- Yeah, it's light.

799
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,171
I can do that. I can do the crate.

800
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:56,133
<i>I went ahead</i>
<i>and assigned each of my teammates a task.</i>

801
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,552
<i>We had to divide up what to do.</i>

802
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,971
<i>I assigned Ray to carry the box.</i>

803
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,974
<i>And also, Robyn will be on the rope.</i>

804
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,477
Okay, here's what I think.

805
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,687
We should prioritize
the crates over the bags.

806
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,439
They need to go first.

807
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,817
- Ochir on the ropes, right?
- That's right.

808
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,611
As soon as I saw the aerial ropes…

809
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,695
LKHAGVA-OCHIR
ACROBAT

810
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,614
…I was like,
"Well, I guess I know what I'm doing."

811
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,200
Team Mongolia,
they're gonna go home after this.

812
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,826
- Yeah, 100% right?
- Yeah, of course, 100%

813
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,162
Send 'em home, Manny. We'll send 'em home.

814
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,790
- Definitely. Let's get in here.
- Let's go!

815
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:28,999
Let's fight!

816
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,459
Philippines!

817
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,797
<i>Mongolia's got a strong team too.</i>

818
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:40,344
<i>But with our teamwork and our strategy,</i>
<i>I know we can beat them.</i>

819
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,180
<i>My focus is on winning.</i>

820
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,725
- Warriors, mount up!
- Mount up!

821
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,893
Whoo!

822
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,437
ORKHONBAYAR
MONGOLIAN TRADITIONAL WRESTLER

823
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,273
None of us are really worried about
what Team Philippines is planning to do.

824
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,819
<i>They have their own strategy,</i>
<i>and we'll simply proceed with ours.</i>

825
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,113
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Get ready, guys.

826
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,407
<i>Ready…</i>

827
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,574
Let's go. Come on!

828
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,668
Go!

829
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,338
Mongolians, attack!

830
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,051
Mongolians, attack!

831
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,405
Go, go, go, go! Let's go!

832
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,118
Great job, guys!

833
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,621
<i>Each one weighs 20 kilos,</i>

834
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,958
<i>so our plan was to have most of</i>
<i>the team focus on the bags at the start.</i>

835
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,128
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>to make things more efficient,</i>

836
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,590
<i>our strategy was</i>
<i>to ask Ray to start on the boxes.</i>

837
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,697
I'm good. Go, go, go, go. Ray, go. Ray.

838
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,743
<i>The reason is because</i>
<i>I'm the lightest out of everyone,</i>

839
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,745
<i>um, and the quickest.</i>

840
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:36,251
<i>So we agreed that my speed</i>
<i>would be able to sail me across the ship.</i>

841
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,092
<i>We're doing our tasks already,</i>

842
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,471
<i>as I notice the other team… a two-man job.</i>

843
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,600
- Here. Let's go. Come on.
- Got it. Khandaa! Khandaa, here.

844
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,313
<i>When I lifted the box,</i>

845
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:59,358
<i>I realized that it wasn't nearly</i>
<i>as heavy as I thought.</i>

846
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,904
<i>But since we were running</i>
<i>across the water and up the steps…</i>

847
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:10,160
<i>we thought that it would be</i>
<i>too taxing for just one person to do.</i>

848
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,793
<i>One crate, two guys carrying it,</i>

849
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,962
<i>and it's very efficient.</i>

850
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,046
RAY
STRONGMAN

851
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,632
We should have adjusted our strategy.

852
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,217
Crates!

853
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,302
Let's share one. Come on. Let's go.

854
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,477
<i>The crates are very big and bulky.</i>

855
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,480
<i>It's not just…  …an easy lift.</i>

856
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,525
<i>You have to have balance,</i>
<i>and it's… it's really tricky.</i>

857
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,236
- Come on! Come on!
- Let's go, guys!

858
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,157
I got it.

859
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,827
Good. Go, go, go, go. Ray, go.

860
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,706
Wait!

861
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:16,310
<i>The first thing that crossed my mind</i>
<i>when I pulled a crate is,</i>

862
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,270
<i>"I really underestimated the weight."</i>

863
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,983
<i>And then, I'm running out of breath.</i>

864
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,779
Here we go!

865
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,874
<i>Our strategy was to focus on the crates</i>
<i>for the first ten minutes.</i>

866
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,797
<i>We couldn't leave Ochir without a crate,</i>
<i>so we moved those first.</i>

867
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,179
<i>Working in the circus means, you know,</i>

868
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,891
<i>tons of ropework, trapezes and such,</i>
<i>so I'm used to it.</i>

869
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,476
<i>I felt really confident.</i>

870
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,729
Breathe, Ray. You got this.

871
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,314
Keep breathing. You got it.

872
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:05,567
Ray! Ray! Focus, focus!

873
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,444
Ray!

874
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:12,491
<i>So when I saw Ray, uh,</i>
<i>having a difficult time,</i>

875
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,868
<i>that's why I started, uh, telling him…</i>

876
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,455
Ray! Ray!
Come down and help us with the bags!

877
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,752
<i>Him… like, give him a different role,</i>

878
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:27,297
<i>as if he could understand,</i>
<i>just to help the team.</i>

879
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,009
You got this, Ray.

880
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,803
Come on, guys!

881
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:44,106
<i>I keep on telling myself that,</i>
<i>"You really have to keep on pushing.</i>

882
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,484
<i>Do not give up. Help your team."</i>

883
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,826
<i>I really didn't want to lose.</i>

884
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,787
<i>So I just kept going.</i>

885
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,832
<i>I kept moving the bags</i>
<i>because I was so determined to win.</i>

886
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,501
<i>That desire is what kept me pushing.</i>

887
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,462
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Let's go!

888
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,755
On my back.

889
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,635
- On my back!
- You got it?

890
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,095
- Give me one more.
- One more?

891
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,389
Yeah, I can handle it. Come on.

892
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,559
- No, no, no, wait. I'll hold it.
- Okay. Careful.

893
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,313
<i>It's really important</i>
<i>that I uphold the honor of our country</i>

894
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,523
<i>while we're here.</i>

895
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:31,695
<i>Our entire team is determined</i>
<i>to win the championship.</i>

896
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,958
Whoo!

897
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,210
Whoo!

898
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:53,008
<i>I was so determined</i>
<i>that I let out a shout of excitement.</i>

899
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:59,514
<i>Manny. I can see the motivation</i>
<i>and his dedication for the team.</i>

900
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,769
<i>I think, for me,</i>
<i>that was my motivation also,</i>

901
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:07,105
<i>so that I won't stop,</i>
<i>um, doing the transportation.</i>

902
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,572
- One, two.
- And three! Here.

903
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,705
- Bring some bags! Thanks, man. Let's go!
- Here!

904
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,541
Let's say we get a stack of crates going,

905
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,002
but Ochir can only move one at a time.

906
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,506
So while he's getting through the crates,
we can start moving the bags over.

907
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,051
We'll grab as many as we can and throw
them down there so we don't waste time.

908
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,887
Okay, we're gonna grab, then turn!

909
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:41,890
That's it.

910
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,602
Carry 'em on your shoulders!

911
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:50,065
- Here, on your shoulders. There you go.
- Oh, man.

912
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,612
Some of the bags
were already tied together,

913
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,114
which was super convenient.

914
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:01,159
<i>I saw that and thought, "Oh, that works.</i>
<i>The more bags the better."</i>

915
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:06,248
<i>Being able to carry multiple at a time</i>
<i>was super helpful.</i>

916
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,294
Okay, come on, let's go! Let's load it up!

917
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:19,761
Come on, guys.

918
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,723
Come on!

919
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,101
7 BAGS (140 KG)

920
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,437
Come on!

921
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,690
Get low, guys! Get low! Push low!

922
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,693
Yes! Yes! Push low, guys.

923
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:38,196
Next step, come on. Next step, come on.

924
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,490
Come on!

925
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,038
Let's unload.

926
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,209
- This one's f****** 80 kilos.
- Yeah.

927
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,460
This one's 80 kilos.

928
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:01,178
- One, two, three!
- Two, three.

929
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,699
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

930
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,242
<i>Ten minutes remain.</i>

931
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,370
Ten minutes. Come on!

932
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,831
<i>We will now reveal the weights.</i>

933
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,838
Come on.

934
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,967
Oh, same, same, same, same!

935
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,514
We're 400 each!

936
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,105
<i>We're the same, same, same!</i>
