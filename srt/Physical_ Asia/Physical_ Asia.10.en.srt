00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,369
<i>Fourth Quest: Death Match.</i>

5
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,915
<i>The 1200 kilogram Pillar Push.</i>

6
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:47,172
<i>The first two teams to make 100 laps</i>
<i>will be moving on to the fifth quest.</i>

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,385
Whoever finishes last will be eliminated.

8
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,515
It's more a test of willpower.

9
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,100
Exactly. It's about mental strength.

10
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,727
<i>Stand by.</i>

11
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,063
Let's go!

12
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,524
Wait, we shouldn't push that high.

13
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,443
- Okay.
- Push from the middle.

14
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>Nothing was gonna stop us.</i>

15
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,491
<i>We were ready to fight</i>
<i>tooth and nail to the end.</i>

16
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,784
Outlast everyone.

17
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,204
Hundred laps, don't quit!

18
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,498
- Come on, we can do this.
- This is my shit. This is my shit.

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,084
I can do this forever. I could live here.

20
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,754
Here, adjust your legs. Stay synchronized.

21
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,966
Does their stance look off to you?

22
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,054
<i>Ready.</i>

23
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,347
All right, here we go.

24
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,827
All right, chilling.

25
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,954
Just keep pushing.

26
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,874
Ah, easy, guys. Let's go.

27
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,586
<i>The pillar was easier to move</i>
<i>than I thought it would be.</i>

28
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,631
But a hundred laps?
This was gonna be brutal.

29
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,715
DOM TOMATO
PARKOUR ATHLETE

30
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,342
Hands out, head-on.

31
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,011
Just keep walking, keep churning,
no matter what.

32
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,639
<i>I knew this was gonna be a long haul.</i>

33
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,933
- Really good, Dom. Come on, drive, drive!
- Beautiful!

34
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,810
- Hold that now, hold that.
- Hold it!

35
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,029
Hey, let's all ease up
on our shoulders, all right?

36
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,032
Use your core, Min-jae.
Extend your arms out. That's it.

37
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,244
<i>The weight kind of surprised me.</i>

38
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,204
<i>You really had to put your back into it.</i>

39
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,582
AMOTTI
SEASON 2 WINNER

40
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,000
If we didn't have Min-jae… yeah.

41
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,252
I honestly think we would've been screwed.

42
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,336
I mean, it wasn't light…

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,588
KIM MIN-JAE
SSIREUM WRESTLER

44
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,674
…but I didn't think it was impossible
to move or anything.

45
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,385
<i>Still, with how much force</i>
<i>we had to exert,</i>

46
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,889
<i>finishing a hundred laps</i>
<i>was going to take a while.</i>

47
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,557
It was gonna be tough.

48
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,934
Use your core, Min-jae.

49
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,603
Extend your arms out. That's it.

50
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,899
Looking good!

51
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,358
Just pace yourselves.

52
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,278
All right, let's keep going.
Nice and easy.

53
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,322
Just like this.

54
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,289
Is Mongolia out for a walk?

55
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,582
What're they doing?

56
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,792
- Their form is interesting.
- They're not pushing.

57
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,711
It's like they're hugging the pillar.

58
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,713
Great job.

59
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,592
Have you seen what Mongolia's doing?

60
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,093
Why?

61
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,511
I don't know. I don't know.

62
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>To minimize body strain,</i>

63
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,561
<i>we had to push</i>
<i>with an even distribution of weight.</i>

64
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,396
<i>That's why we used our chests.</i>

65
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,440
If we're behind, don't worry about it.

66
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,194
<i>We had a ways to go,</i>
<i>we didn't want to use up</i>

67
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,779
<i>all our energy right away.</i>

68
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,240
Coming up on number one now.
Mongolia's struggling.

69
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,908
Let's go. That's one!

70
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,243
Australia's got one.

71
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,706
We're actually gonna be
ahead of Korea after this.

72
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,377
- Australia's fast.
- Don't worry.

73
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,461
We're in second.

74
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,630
They're faster than I expected.

75
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,841
Together, together, that's it!

76
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,134
Lock in like that!

77
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,930
Yeah, good, girls, good.

78
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,184
Let's keep that pace,

79
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,978
- just keep that pace.
- Don't try and rush.

80
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,523
Beautiful, Dom! Great speed!

81
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,525
Korea's gassed.

82
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,611
Keep it! Keep it moving.

83
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,950
We need to at least get second.

84
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,118
Keep pushing.

85
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,162
Min-jae, adapt as you go.

86
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,414
- Okay.
- All right.

87
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,460
<i>I used my shoulders,</i>

88
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,337
<i>changed the angle, anything to get comfy.</i>

89
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,965
- Nice, Min-jae.
- You can use your head too.

90
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,968
We need to push harder.

91
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,056
That's it, Min-jae. Keep it up.

92
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,393
- Nice job, guys.
- Keep at it.

93
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,853
We're speeding up.

94
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,105
- Korea's in the lead.
- They're ahead.

95
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,278
And Mongolia's still behind, right?

96
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,697
Yeah, I think they're down half a lap.

97
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,116
Mongolia's gone.
Let's go, let's go, we're good.

98
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,451
This is a marathon!

99
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,411
Long-haul, all day, let's go!

100
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,496
- Just nice and steady.
- That's it.

101
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,915
Try pushing it upwards!

102
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,918
That team's doing well with that.

103
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,128
We shouldn't rush, right?

104
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,589
No, just keep going. Nice and steady.

105
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,134
<i>Even though it was a race,</i>
<i>we couldn't rush.</i>

106
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,636
<i>We had to try and conserve our energy.</i>

107
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,929
So, step by step, bit by bit…

108
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,015
KHANDSUREN
NATIONAL TEAM VOLLEYBALL PLAYER

109
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,642
…slowly but surely, we were gonna make it
to a hundred laps.

110
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,769
ORKHONBAYAR BÖKH
WRESTLER

111
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,395
Of course,
we still had to mind our pacing.

112
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,190
<i>But as long as we didn't slow down,</i>
<i>we were fine.</i>

113
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,524
Good job, you two.

114
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,778
We can't get tired now, okay? Good.

115
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,155
Watch your stamina.

116
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,907
- We'll need to push in the back half.
- Sounds good.

117
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,620
That's ten. One tenth done.

118
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,497
And we're winning.

119
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,089
<i>Time just seemed to drag.</i>

120
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,549
<i>Pushing it for a hundred laps…</i>

121
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,468
<i>It was going to take forever.</i>

122
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:30,390
<i>It felt like a punishment, like I'd</i>
<i>push that thing for the rest of my life.</i>

123
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,812
That's 12!

124
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,315
- Let's keep it up.
- Yeah, yeah. Eighty-eight to go.

125
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,900
<i>It was an endless task.</i>

126
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,153
<i>You think you've done ten laps,</i>
<i>but you've only done two.</i>

127
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,321
<i>It's exhausting.</i>

128
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,449
<i>The more laps we did,</i>

129
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,534
<i>as we pushed on,</i>

130
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,869
<i>the heavier and heavier</i>
<i>the wheel started to feel.</i>

131
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,207
It's a lot heavier than I thought.

132
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,668
Don't get discouraged. You're doing great.

133
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,546
- Let's go.
- You've got this.

134
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,797
Min-jae, you're killing it.

135
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,133
Mind the pace.

136
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,428
Okay, that's 20.

137
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,595
- What?
- Twenty.

138
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,390
- Are you kidding? Only 20?
- Yep.

139
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,100
They just had to torture us…

140
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,853
Man, this hurts…

141
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,939
Okay, 100 laps is insane.

142
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,774
It really is.

143
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,526
We totally dodged a bullet, huh?

144
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,030
Korea's gone guys, let's go. Let's get
'em, let's get 'em. They're gassed.

145
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,365
Just getting warmed up.

146
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,328
<i>Honestly, it's really tough out there.</i>

147
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,080
<i>I don't know how many laps,</i>

148
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,790
<i>my legs started to go numb,</i>

149
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:42,753
<i>my ankles were seizing up</i>
<i>and locking up stepping in the sand.</i>

150
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,880
<i>It was tough.</i>

151
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,217
Shorter steps!

152
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,886
Go, Alex, come on!

153
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,555
I can't really get the shorter steps

154
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,308
because I'm right on this f****** hill.

155
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,102
<i>I've got a new sand mountain</i>

156
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,604
<i>every time I come around</i>

157
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,106
<i>because of where the ball is, so…</i>

158
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,692
<i>I can't even feel one of my legs.</i>

159
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,361
<i>I have that out-of-body experience.</i>

160
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,822
<i>It's pure torture all over again.</i>

161
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,535
Alex, lean into Kate.

162
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,370
Alex, get right across.

163
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,499
I can't! F*** off.

164
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,417
The wider you go,
the more torque we get, Kate.

165
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,628
So shift over into Dom's lane if you can.

166
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,630
Everyone, take a little shift.

167
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,841
I can't!

168
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,593
Don't worry about them.
Just do your thing, girl.

169
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,720
I'm f****** locked in.

170
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,395
Hey! Australia's getting tired.
They're tired.

171
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,649
- One. One.
- Two.

172
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,111
Two.

173
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,363
Let's pick up the pace.

174
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,199
- Let's pick up the pace.
- Faster. One.

175
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,660
- Two. Two.
- One. One.

176
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,371
- All right! Let's go, Team Mongolia!
- All right, Orkhon!

177
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,914
- That's what I wanna see!
- Awesome job, guys!

178
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,123
There you go!

179
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,416
- Nice job!
- Wow.

180
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,210
Excellent, that's perfect!

181
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,461
Keep up the pace!

182
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,797
Way to go team, way to go!

183
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,175
They're picking up their rate, we've got
to pick up the rate! Pick up the rate!

184
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,344
We need more speed, let's go!

185
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,096
Need more speed, you can't slow down!

186
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,223
Come on, Mongolia's catching us,
Dom, let's go!

187
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,975
Stay in front of them.

188
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,852
Charge through!
We need you guys to pick it up!

189
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,610
One, two. Two. One, two.

190
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,406
Australia's speeding up!
You've gotta push a little bit harder.

191
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,783
Okay, team. Palms out.

192
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,451
I actually think it's easier.

193
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,717
- All right, we've pulled ahead now.
- That's it, that's what I like to see!

194
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,552
Don't slow down now!

195
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,432
Mongolia's jumping us guys, come on,
you've got to dig deep, find something!

196
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,227
Good shit, guys. Good shit.

197
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,022
Let's just keep churning.
We've got the engine for this.

198
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,898
Consistency's gonna win us.

199
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,484
Just keep breathing.

200
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,155
You're half a lap ahead!

201
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,243
- Mongolia's getting faster!
- Fight on, Min-jae!

202
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,536
How big's the gap?

203
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,080
You're still two laps ahead.

204
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,418
None of the other teams had stopped
to take a break yet.

205
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,796
What if we took longer strides? Huh?

206
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,382
Come on.

207
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,344
- Speed it up!
- Straighten those arms, everyone!

208
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,682
<i>They were moving so fast,</i>

209
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,517
<i>I'd assumed they'd be more tired.</i>

210
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,603
Oh, come on.

211
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,064
<i>We couldn't let them catch up to us.</i>

212
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,982
I mean, ideally, I wanted a five-lap gap.

213
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,067
KIM DONG-HYUN
MMA FIGHTER

214
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,860
We need to go all out.

215
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,154
Right now. 'Cause if we dont,

216
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,114
and we go home, we'll regret it.

217
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,240
So come on.

218
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,742
- Let's go!
- Fight on!

219
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,455
<i>It felt like some kind</i>
<i>of divine punishment,</i>

220
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,333
<i>to be on the brink</i>
<i>of elimination once more.</i>

221
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,710
<i>But if we came back once,</i>
<i>we could come back again.</i>

222
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,422
We'll rest when we're dead.

223
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,092
- I feel dead.
- I know, but we're not dead.

224
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,635
He's right.

225
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,557
Gotta drive, or we're going home!

226
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,527
Come on, Mongolia!

227
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,325
Okay!

228
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,036
At least it'll end eventually.

229
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,871
Eventually…

230
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,039
Let's keep going.

231
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:54,338
<i>Contestants. In a moment,</i>
<i>we will announce the current standings.</i>

232
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,262
<i>Korea: 50.</i>

233
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,391
Did they say 50?

234
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,226
All right, we're in first!

235
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,186
They can't catch up to us. No way.

236
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,649
We've gotta catch up!

237
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,194
We should go up one ahead. Come on.

238
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,155
Yes, come on.

239
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,991
<i>We kind of just discounted Korea</i>

240
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,744
<i>'cause we knew that they would</i>
<i>probably be ahead of us,</i>

241
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,787
<i>but with Mongolia,</i>
<i>they weren't an issue at all.</i>

242
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,585
<i>You never realize how hard</i>

243
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,253
<i>a challenge is until you're doing it.</i>

244
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,758
<i>And if I was tired,</i>
<i>I knew the girls had to be tired too.</i>

245
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,428
One. Two. One. Two.

246
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:46,515
<i>At the halfway point, I could tell</i>
<i>Khanda was starting to run out of steam.</i>

247
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,519
<i>And where I was standing, the imbalance</i>
<i>of force would impact me the most.</i>

248
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,438
Khanda. Push harder.

249
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,941
Sorry, I'm trying.

250
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,446
<i>Since I was closest to the center,</i>

251
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,365
<i>I was struggling to stay in sync</i>
<i>with the other two.</i>

252
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:08,037
<i>Even though I did my best to match their</i>
<i>rhythm, I sometimes stumbled.</i>

253
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,799
They're slowing down again.
You've gotta go faster!

254
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,925
Come on!

255
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,009
Khanda, speed up!

256
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,556
Let's go, guys. We gotta catch up, guys!

257
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,518
Time to catch up!
We gotta catch 'em now, guys!

258
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,105
F***.

259
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,777
<i>Alex was really hurting,</i>

260
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,071
<i>so I was just trying</i>
<i>to do as much as I could to help.</i>

261
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,824
<i>We wanna give everything</i>
<i>to not be eliminated,</i>

262
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:49,745
<i>so we were just gonna give absolutely</i>
<i>everything to whatever it was gonna be.</i>

263
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,039
We're strong.

264
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,542
We've got guts.

265
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,710
Yes, Kate.

266
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,963
You're our secret weapon, Kate.

267
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,758
How can any of them
push something that big?

268
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,843
I know.

269
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,302
- It's really impressive.
- They're all killing it.

270
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,137
- I can't look away.
- It's crazy.

271
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,973
Australia's catching up!

272
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,349
They're catching up fast.

273
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,560
There we go, that's it! That's it!

274
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,478
They're right behind you!

275
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,564
You can't let them catch up to you, okay?

276
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,774
- Okay, let's go.
- And, go!

277
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,153
One, two, one.

278
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,613
They're quitting first!

279
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,490
As long as you don't stop.

280
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,534
Ready? I'll give a little bit more?

281
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,244
You guys, just follow the feet.

282
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,330
Thanks, Kate.

283
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,876
That speed! We need that!

284
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,795
Dark places, dark places!

285
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,215
Let's not slow down. Come on.

286
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,300
Nothing!

287
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,679
<i>Australia's female athletes</i>
<i>were doing a lot better than I thought.</i>

288
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,099
<i>I didn't think they'd be</i>
<i>any competition for us,</i>

289
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,809
<i>but they proved themselves</i>

290
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,020
<i>to be very formidable opponents.</i>

291
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,855
<i>It was a really fierce fight.</i>

292
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,857
They look even.

293
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,191
Yeah, I think they might be.

294
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,027
Australia just overtook them.

295
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,197
- Yeah, good, pick up the speed.
- That's great.

296
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,949
We're falling behind now.

297
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,245
You're about three steps behind Australia!

298
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,874
Come on.

299
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,627
Let's push! One, two. One.

300
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,795
I know it hurts, but we can do it.

301
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,255
Let's pick up the pace!

302
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,050
Mongolia's wavering.
Don't waver, bro, come on!

303
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,428
Come on.
We didn't f****** come all this way…

304
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,721
Let's link up.

305
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,432
Come on, girls.

306
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,892
Show them what we're made of.

307
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,562
Leave it all here!

308
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,022
They're hurting more than you!

309
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,523
No regrets!

310
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,943
Use every bit of energy!

311
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,319
They're in sync now.

312
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,241
They're neck-and-neck.

313
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,119
I didn't think Australia would be able
to keep up with everyone else, but…

314
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,204
LKHAGVA-OCHIR
ACROBAT

315
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,455
…they really surprised me.

316
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,708
Probably one of the hardest events
in anything I've ever come across.

317
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,793
ELONI VUNAKECE

318
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,169
The competition's fierce, huh?

319
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,422
We can't afford to slow down right now!

320
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,386
One, two. One, two. Faster.

321
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,054
We have to win.

322
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,806
Let's go!

323
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,726
Keep pushing, guys. That's it.

324
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,187
Just stay in sync with each other!

325
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,022
You're way ahead, so don't worry.

326
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,358
Ah, shit!

327
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,361
<i>I know it's not polite to swear like that,</i>

328
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,487
<i>but it was heavy…</i>

329
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,656
<i>My legs were swollen…</i>

330
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,951
And sand kept flying into my mouth.

331
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,327
I couldn't help it.

332
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,122
Fight on, Min-jae!

333
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,957
Fight on, Amotti! Dong-hyun!

334
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,375
- Let's go!
- You're almost done!

335
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,712
We can do this.
It all comes down to willpower.

336
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,672
No more negative thoughts.

337
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,299
Yes, exactly. This is nothing, right?

338
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,927
- We can do 200.
- Exactly.

339
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,596
- Are we at 80?
- Yeah. Just about.

340
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,557
It'll be easy after 90.

341
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,392
We can power through when we get there.

342
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,144
- But until then--
- Let's focus.

343
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,562
Let's get 90 first.

344
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,063
Then we'll deal with 100.

345
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,192
Look at that!

346
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,277
- Great job.
- They're killing it.

347
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,319
That's crazy fast.

348
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,655
- Team Korea!
- Fight on!

349
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,867
That's it, guys! Let it out!

350
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,201
Fight on!

351
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,662
100 laps is harsh.

352
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,747
It's ridiculous.

353
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,373
It's literally hell on earth.

354
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,796
Pick it up, come on!

355
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,966
Pace now! We've got to pick up the pace!

356
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,229
Temporary pain, Australia!

357
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,148
We're not going home here, come on!

358
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,941
I need some speed, guys!

359
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,113
Alex, come on.
When are you gonna make the call?

360
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,490
We've got to go for it!

361
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,245
Australia's collapsing!

362
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,792
Let's go.

363
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,712
One, two. One, two.

364
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,132
- One, two. One, two.
- That's it! Let's go, Mongolia!

365
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,884
Just push a little bit more.

366
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,010
Don't fall behind again.

367
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,476
They're picking up their rate.
We've gotta pick up the rate!

368
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,228
I'm pretty spent, but I'll keep going.

369
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,397
- I'm pushing as hard.
- Yeah.

370
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,316
Thanks, Kate.

371
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,862
<i>I was blown away by every so often,</i>
<i>Kate would just</i>

372
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,157
<i>churn in and push that thing</i>
<i>a little bit faster.</i>

373
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,079
Dom, take over.

374
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,041
<i>And it was just about taking turns</i>

375
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,585
<i>and really working as a unit</i>
<i>the whole way through,</i>

376
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,546
<i>and I couldn't be more proud of the girls.</i>

377
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,923
We have to go!

378
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,675
We've got to catch them, guys!

379
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,884
Come on, we're behind.

380
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,553
We've gotta catch up, we've gotta dig in.

381
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,888
We've f****** got this.

382
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,642
<i>It's not just about physical endurance,</i>

383
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,227
<i>it's about mental endurance.</i>

384
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,312
<i>Putting one foot in front of the other.</i>

385
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,982
<i>Continually. Do not stop.</i>

386
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,569
Literally, the only way I'm stopping

387
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,029
is if it's over, the game's over,

388
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,031
or I'm literally dead.

389
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,117
Let's just keep going. One step.

390
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,827
F*** everyone else.

391
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,912
We know what we're doing.

392
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,706
This is the Death Match, guys!

393
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,542
There's nothing else after this!

394
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,836
Nothing else after this!

395
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,304
<i>It was harder to walk without any rhythm.</i>

396
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,893
<i>You're so focused on trying</i>
<i>to move the huge pillar for 100 laps,</i>

397
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,312
<i>all while trying to avoid</i>
<i>the divots in the sand</i>

398
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,688
<i>and tripping over your feet…</i>

399
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,274
<i>That counting is the only thing</i>
<i>that makes it bearable.</i>

400
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,903
<i>It was already hard enough to do 50.</i>

401
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,196
<i>Why make it 100?</i>

402
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,700
<i>By the halfway point,</i>
<i>I could tell that Adiya and Orkhon</i>

403
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,494
<i>were starting to get just as tired</i>
<i>as I'd been feeling.</i>

404
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,206
<i>I'd hoped it'd get easier,</i>
<i>but it never did.</i>

405
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,042
Everyone's struggling,
so don't get discouraged!

406
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,544
<i>Not only was I exhausted,</i>

407
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,504
<i>I was struggling to breathe.</i>

408
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,090
<i>And I thought, "Great.</i>
<i>The pain and the fatigue</i>

409
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,426
<i>were bad enough. Now my throat hurts too."</i>

410
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,305
They're slowing down! That's good!

411
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,598
We've got to catch 'em!

412
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,232
Okay, push.

413
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,193
Okay, push.

414
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,362
Keep that pace,
we've got to catch up a lap!

415
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,408
Dom, got to jump!
Mongolia's just stopped, Dom!

416
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
- Let's go!
- Mongolia's stopped!

417
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,871
Kate, you reckon
you're sure you wanna do another burst?

418
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,414
Yeah, but I'd just die.

419
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,083
- Yeah.
- You still need to help me though.

420
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,669
All right.

421
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,006
There we go.

422
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,342
I'm pushing, I promise.

423
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,061
Come on, now! Don't stop!

424
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,604
You can't stop. It's too close.

425
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,022
You've gotta keep moving.

426
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,358
Okay, push.

427
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,531
- Just go.
- All right.

428
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,116
You're doing great, Khanda.

429
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,575
- Thanks.
- You both are the best.

430
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,161
Let's do it. And do it together.

431
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,413
Almost there.

432
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,040
Ninety.

433
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,209
All right, final stretch!

434
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,505
Yes, yes, keep pushing!

435
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,299
Keep going! Go, go, go!

436
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,759
We're on fire! You good, Min-jae?

437
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,012
- Giant Baby!
- You can do it!

438
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,180
- Fight through the pain!
- Yeah! Let's go!

439
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,099
<i>Knowing that we were so close to the end</i>

440
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,268
<i>definitely gave me some energy.</i>

441
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,231
<i>Those last ten laps</i>
<i>were the hardest for me.</i>

442
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,275
<i>By that point,</i>

443
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,985
<i>it felt like I was pushing a wall.</i>

444
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,739
I feel like I'm dying.

445
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,867
Just focus on how strong we are.

446
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,329
- We're almost there!
- Yeah.

447
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,496
I think this is it.

448
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,665
I may have missed a count, though.

449
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,791
So let's keep going.

450
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,378
Let's bring it home, you guys!

451
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,921
Way to go, Min-jae.

452
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,007
Seriously, Min-jae! You're a machine!

453
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,426
One more. Just in case.

454
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,720
I think we missed one.

455
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,475
<i>I thought we'd done a hundred,</i>
<i>but the light didn't turn on.</i>

456
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,559
I can't tell.

457
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,936
Let's keep going.

458
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,021
All right.

459
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,819
- Keep going.
- Okay, this should be it.

460
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,364
We can do it, let's go!

461
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,076
<i>We kept going around and around,</i>

462
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,161
<i>hoping each lap was the last one.</i>

463
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,789
<i>We kept doing laps</i>

464
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,749
<i>but the light never turned on.</i>

465
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,502
I was worried that I was way off
with my counting.

466
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,795
How many?

467
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,380
You're right there, guys.

468
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,964
- You're right there!
- Final lap!

469
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,841
One more, and it's all over.

470
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,052
All right, you two. Last one, let's push.

471
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,929
Nice job, Min-jae.

472
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,896
It's over!

473
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,148
<i>Team Korea has survived.</i>

474
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,608
- We did it!
- Finally.

475
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,866
Wow…

476
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,120
- You're done, it's over.
- We won!

477
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,208
- Let's go!
- Great job! First place!

478
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,585
We did it, we survived.

479
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,548
Our strategy worked,

480
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,426
and even though we got ahead,
we never got complacent.

481
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,510
We just kept going.

482
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,095
<i>I felt amazing afterwards.</i>

483
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:53,181
<i>The shackles came off,</i>
<i>and the light shone down on us…</i>

484
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,476
<i>We had somehow escaped hell.</i>
<i>It was liberating.</i>

485
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,979
My feet are killing me.

486
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,525
That was the most painful thing
I've ever experienced.

487
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,609
Yeah, that was hard.

488
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,612
We were all determined
to keep going until we finished.

489
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,406
I really thought I was gonna pass out.

490
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,037
Hey, look at us! We're alive!

491
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,122
Great work, guys.

492
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,957
- Bravo!
- Whoo!

493
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,210
That went by pretty quickly.

494
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,463
- Good job!
- Good job!

495
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,509
- Team Korea finished a hundred laps.
- They're done, come on!

496
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,512
I don't think I realized
how fast Korea was going.

497
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,224
But hearing that they finished
made me realize we were almost at the end.

498
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,768
And that gave me the strength
to push even harder.

499
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,688
One. One.

500
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,607
You don't run, we're going home.
You've gotta run!

501
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,026
Your engines are gonna beat theirs,
keep going!

502
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,986
Let's go, Dom! Dom, you've gotta run!

503
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,070
Last pump.

504
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,990
I need you guys to catch up!

505
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,494
Come on. We're nearly finished.

506
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,287
- Let's go. Come on.
- Yeah.

507
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,705
Australia's speeding up.

508
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,416
- Australia's booking it!
- They're starting to catch up!

509
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,959
You're gonna have to push more!

510
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,587
- Australia's moving.
- Two. Two.

511
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,964
Judo power!

512
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,049
Let's go!

513
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,467
They're fast.

514
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,802
- Let's push. All right.
- Push.

515
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,444
You can't lose speed, okay?
You have to go!

516
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,446
It's almost over. Hang on.

517
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,448
Two, one. Two.

518
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,242
One, two.

519
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,327
Sprint finish!

520
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,454
They're slowing down,
let's go, change speed.

521
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,705
Go, Australia!

522
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,583
Come on! Come on!

523
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,086
We pushed
a hundred laps for this, come on.

524
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,880
We didn't push a hundred laps to lose.

525
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,965
Come on!

526
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,841
Let's go!

527
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,261
Push, push, push!

528
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,721
Let's go!

529
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,267
Come on!

530
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,771
<i>We were ready to do anything</i>
<i>in order to win the Death Match.</i>

531
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,774
<i>I wasn't gonna stop. Even if I got tired,</i>

532
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,276
<i>even if I felt like passing out.</i>

533
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,528
We have to win this, team.

534
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,612
Come on, let's go.

535
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,074
One. Two. One. Two.

536
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,826
<i>I thought, "Whatever it takes."</i>

537
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,579
<i>We couldn't give Australia</i>
<i>the opportunity to beat us.</i>

538
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,671
Who wants it more? Who wants it more?

539
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,131
We do!

540
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,842
We don't want to go home.
Come on, speed it up!

541
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,261
Last little push, guys.

542
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,514
You're amazing.

543
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,017
I'm trying to leverage.

544
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,272
<i>Redlining, pushing 100,</i>
<i>doing everything we can.</i>

545
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,441
<i>Putting our blood,</i>
<i>sweat, and tears into this.</i>

546
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,236
<i>My hair was everywhere, I was disheveled,</i>

547
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,531
<i>I was salivating, I was dripping in sweat.</i>

548
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,618
Yeah, fully exhausted,

549
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,330
but I wasn't gonna miss the opportunity to
give everything I had to this challenge.

550
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,165
Come on.

551
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,958
Don't stop.

552
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,085
Never.

553
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,087
Come on, light,
come on, light, come on, light.

554
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,380
Come on, light. Come on, light.

555
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,924
Come on, light. Come on.
Give us the light. Give us the light.

556
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,602
Come on, guys, give me more!

557
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,984
You can do it!

558
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,486
You're almost done!

559
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,489
Keep fighting, team.
I'm fighting right here with you.

560
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,033
We can do this.

561
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,911
Keep going, watch the light!

562
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,793
Keep pushing, all right?
Just give it a little bit more!

563
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,628
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

564
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,755
- One, two.
- Let's go, just a little faster.

565
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,924
Two. One, two.

566
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,510
Keep that speed, keep that speed!

567
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,221
Keep going, Australia. Come on!

568
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,682
Even harder, you can do it!
Come on, let's go!

569
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,518
Give it everything you've got!

570
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,689
Do not stop!

571
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,704
<i>Team Mongolia has survived.</i>

572
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,736
You killed it!
I'm proud of you. High-five.

573
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,529
Great job.

574
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,699
- I think that may have broken them.
- Oh no, I think she's crying.

575
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,701
- All right, Team! Proud of you!
- They look overwhelmed.

576
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,952
Incredible.

577
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,623
<i>I was emotional.</i>

578
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,293
Obviously, I was relieved,

579
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:17,130
but I was overwhelmed by this sense
of pride I had for myself and my team.

580
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,258
I still can't believe
we managed to pull it off!

581
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,969
I think I might still be in shock.
Just a bit.

582
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,597
<i>But the best part</i>
<i>about crossing that finish line</i>

583
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,432
<i>was that I'd never have to do it again.</i>

584
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,230
Yeah, just rest for a bit.
We earned it. There.

585
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,484
Fuck!

586
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,821
Fuck!

587
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:53,082
<i>The pure exhaustion</i>
<i>and emotional fatigue just collapses you.</i>

588
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,965
It sucked, honestly, 'cause…

589
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,885
Like, we're eliminated.
We're out of the competition,

590
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:08,598
and three of your members
who would kill to be in this game…

591
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,934
<i>I just, like, feel like,</i>
<i>you've let them down as well.</i>

592
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:14,771
And you kind of can't believe
that you've been eliminated.

593
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,231
It's all right, guys.

594
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,398
So bloody proud of you guys.

595
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,026
- Great effort! Great effort, guys!
- You were amazing! Great job, team!

596
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,076
Good effort, guys.

597
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,662
Let's go, Mongolia!

598
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,293
It sucks. My pride is definitely hurt

599
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,754
just not being able
to finish the challenge,

600
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,382
but I was really proud
of my teammates, and…

601
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,133
Yeah, we gave it everything we could.

602
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,053
It's the name of the game.

603
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,639
We're one of the strongest,
if not the strongest team here,

604
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,225
so we did not expect
to be eliminated today.

605
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,185
Oh, God, here we go.

606
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,943
Great heart, guys.

607
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,029
I'm sorry, bro.

608
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,115
- No, don't be silly.
- Don't be sorry, bro.

609
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,075
Did my best.

610
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,579
We did it, babe.
We represented Australia well.

611
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,586
They gave everything they had.
I am so sure.

ROBERT WHITTAKER
MMA FIGHTER

613
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,463
They gave everything they had.

614
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,090
Some days aren't yours.

615
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,470
Physical: Asia.

616
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,642
<i>The country that has been eliminated…</i>

617
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,313
<i>is Australia.</i>

618
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,444
<i>They were probably</i>
<i>the strongest team here.</i>

619
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:48,990
<i>But they relied too much on strength</i>
<i>instead of trying to use it effectively.</i>

620
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,035
Can you believe we defeated these guys?

621
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,119
It's crazy.

622
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:59,334
My team gave everything they had,
and I'm proud of them.

623
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,086
And I know Australia will be as well.

624
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,090
I've grown a lot from this experience,

625
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,176
and I'm grateful for the opportunity.

626
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,844
Always leading by example.

627
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,054
O captain. My captain.

628
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,768
Leading from the front,
as always, skipper.

629
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:21,230
I am so grateful to be
a part of this amazing team,

630
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,359
and also surrounded by
these other amazing athletes.

631
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,445
Thank you for such an amazing event.
We'll go out with a bang.

632
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,447
Hey!

633
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,785
I guess it's good he's smiling.

634
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,455
It's hard to watch. I feel bad.

635
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,376
<i>I'm so proud of our team.</i>

636
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,212
<i>We put blood, sweat, and tears into this.</i>

637
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,216
<i>I've made lifelong friends here.</i>

638
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,677
<i>I love them to bits.</i>

639
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,348
<i>Bring us back next season,</i>
<i>and let's see what happens.</i>

640
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,892
<i>What an experience.</i>

641
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,769
<i>Super grateful for the opportunity.</i>

642
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,604
<i>Super grateful.</i>

643
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,988
<i>I think there were a lot of cool,</i>
<i>memorable moments during this experience.</i>

644
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,033
<i>Doing the ship challenge</i>
<i>collectively as a team</i>

645
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,828
<i>was definitely one</i>
<i>of the-the highest points.</i>

646
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,455
<i>We were so new to each other, still,</i>

647
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,334
<i>we came together</i>
<i>to form a real, true team.</i>

648
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,716
You know, I-I had planned to win this
and then move into my K-pop career,

649
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,053
but I think I'm going to have
to go back to fighting.

650
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,599
I thought that I was going to be
more sad destroying my torso,

651
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,812
<i>but we went out the way we came in,</i>
<i>with big smiles and a lot of laughter.</i>

652
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,689
Cheers! What's goin' on?

653
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,653
This team has just been incredible,
and without them…

654
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:55,074
<i>I wouldn't have been able to push past</i>

655
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,619
<i>every physical</i>
<i>and mental barrier that I have.</i>

656
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,829
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!

657
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:00,955
Oi, oi, oi!

658
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,249
- Aussie! Aussie!
- Oi! Oi!

659
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,334
- Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!
- Oi! Oi! Oi!

660
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,461
Oh, God…

661
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,337
Ah!

662
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,381
Man…

663
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,010
It's unfortunate
that it has to kinda end like this.

664
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,512
But we still definitely
wholeheartedly believe

665
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,723
that we're the… we're the best team here.

666
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:22,060
So it's quite sad to be having to leave.

667
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:29,150
It was an honor representing Australia
at <i>Physical: 100.</i>

668
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,528
We're gonna dominate the world
the next time we do this.

669
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,949
Let's do it.

670
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,035
When I say "cattle," you say "dog."

671
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,536
- Cattle!
- Dog!

672
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,251
That is strong!
I'm keeping that till the end.

673
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,064
Physical: Asia.

674
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,191
<i>Three countries have survived.</i>

675
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,071
<i>Team Japan is…</i>

676
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,865
<i>like a phoenix.</i>

677
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,160
Even when we're knocked down,

678
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,371
we always manage
to get back on our feet again.

679
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,916
<i>The Shipwreck Transportation Match.</i>

680
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,668
<i>The winning team…</i>

681
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,920
<i>is Australia.</i>

682
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,630
<i>We continue to persevere.</i>

683
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,549
<i>Even during the Death Match.</i>

684
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,344
<i>The surviving country is Japan.</i>

685
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,180
<i>It was a bumpy start, but…</i>

686
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,723
we're kind of on a roll.

687
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,308
It feels like victory's on our side.

688
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,686
<i>The Battle Rope Relay.</i>

689
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,772
<i>In first place, Team Japan.</i>

690
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,277
We've already come this far.
It's time to win this.

691
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,779
- One, two, three!
- Go Japan! Go Japan!

692
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,246
<i>We're not just athletes. We're fighters.</i>

693
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,875
Warriors!

694
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,043
Mount up!

695
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,589
Throughout each and every quest,

696
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,217
from the first to the fourth,
we've worked together as a team

697
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,927
<i>to overcome every challenge.</i>

698
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,764
<i>That's just who we are.</i>

699
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,142
<i>We were born strong.</i>

700
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,313
<i>The blood of warriors runs in our veins,</i>

701
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,106
we never accept defeat.

702
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,943
We're not here to be top three.
We're here to win.

703
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,279
- Warriors.
- Mount up!

704
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,823
Mount up!

705
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,413
<i>The Shipwreck Transportation Match.</i>

706
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,957
<i>The winning team is Korea.</i>

707
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:55,922
As a team, I think our
greatest strength is our overall tenacity.

708
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,090
Don't give up!

709
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,638
<i>If we just keep doing what</i>
<i>we're doing, winning will come easily.</i>

710
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,806
Stay calm!

711
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,437
<i>The surviving country is Korea.</i>

712
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,190
We did it!

713
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,862
Team Korea's going to win.

714
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,324
- Korea!
- Fight on! Fight on! Fight on!

715
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,204
<i>Strength comes from mental fortitude.</i>

716
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,958
<i>And we'll show you what Korea's made of.</i>

717
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,969
<i>Survivors, you are all fierce competitors.</i>

718
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,012
<i>You may now enter the hall.</i>

719
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,308
- What's going on?
- What's this?

720
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,810
That's suspicious.

721
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,443
What?

722
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,696
What's that?

723
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,614
Wait, those look like chairs.

724
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,157
Oh, come on…

725
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,159
- Let's see what this is.
- What are we doing, guys?

726
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,205
From here,
they kind of look like exam tables.

727
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,917
Physical: Asia.

728
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,003
Every time I hear him, I freak out a bit.

729
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,214
Whatever these are,
they're stressing me out.

730
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,510
<i>The fifth quest will begin momentarily.</i>

731
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,803
- Huh?
- Eh?

732
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,557
Really? Quest five? This is it?

733
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,435
I mean, the referees are here too…

734
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,020
Don't say that.

735
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,897
Don't even joke about it.
You're gonna give me a heart attack!

736
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,942
Okay, you four can hype yourselves up
over there

737
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,569
while Khanda and I try not to panic.

738
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,780
Oh, no, my heart! I'm gonna pass out!

739
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:49,285
<i>But first,</i>
<i>we will play a preliminary game.</i>

740
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,455
<i>The winner of this game will be rewarded</i>

741
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,832
<i>with an advantage in the upcoming quest.</i>

742
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,794
Okay, so the winner
gets an advantage in quest five.

743
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,756
As we learned early on
in this competition,

744
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,092
not winning the advantage could end up
putting you at a disadvantage.

745
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,180
<i>I couldn't let that happen again.</i>
<i>We needed to win this time.</i>

746
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,475
Physical: Asia. The preliminary game…

747
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,273
Huh?

748
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,609
- Okay, let's see it.
- All right.

749
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,950
<i>The preliminary game…</i>

750
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,705
<i>is the Manual Treadmill Relay.</i>

751
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,002
That caught me off guard, like, "Wait."

752
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,921
Anything but treadmills.

753
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:42,880
- Relay?
- Relay.

754
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,256
Again?

755
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,885
<i>Gotta be honest, I don't know</i>
<i>what I expected, but it wasn't that.</i>

756
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,554
<i>For the Manual Treadmill Relay,</i>

757
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,349
<i>each team will select two participants.</i>

758
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,142
<i>One male and one female.</i>

759
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:59,188
- Oh, so it's just two? That's it?
- So one of each.

760
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,065
<i>You and your teammate</i>

761
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,943
<i>will take turns on the Manual Treadmill.</i>

762
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,362
<i>The number of allotted substitutions…</i>

763
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,364
How many? Tell us.

764
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,825
<i>The number of allotted substitutions</i>

765
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,992
<i>is unlimited.</i>

766
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,661
<i>…is unlimited.</i>

767
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,246
No limits?

768
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,248
- Well, that helps.
- Yeah.

769
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,083
So we can switch as much as we want.

770
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,628
<i>The duration of the game is three minutes.</i>

771
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,839
<i>When time runs out,</i>

772
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,592
<i>the team that managed to cover</i>
<i>the most distance will win.</i>

773
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,469
Do you wanna do it?

774
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,346
- Three minutes is a bit much.
- For you?

775
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,722
Little bit, yeah.

776
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,018
If it was three people,
then I'd volunteer.

777
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,938
I mean, I could do it. If I had to.

778
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,441
But, I think Amotti's
our best all-rounder here.

779
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,651
And you run all the time, right?

780
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,027
Yeah, for Crossfit.

781
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,155
Then I think it should be you and Amotti.

782
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,115
That's our dream team.

783
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,908
Think we can beat Japan?

784
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,619
Absolutely, but it's gonna be hard.

785
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,079
Stretch your legs out.

786
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,539
You'll have to start right away.

787
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,916
<i>We were fighting for a spot in the finals.</i>

788
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,711
<i>Any advantage we could get,</i>
<i>we had to try and take.</i>

789
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,547
We had a pretty hard time
picking a male runner.

790
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,967
<i>We were torn between Hashimoto,</i>
<i>a more speedy, agile athlete,</i>

791
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:15,097
<i>and Itoi, who had more individual power.</i>
<i>Both of them were equally good options.</i>

792
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,726
And as the captain of the team,
I was really conflicted about what to do.

793
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,353
Who wants to run?

794
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,732
Deciding between Adiya
and myself wasn't much of a challenge.

795
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,735
<i>Between the two of us,</i>
<i>I was taller, my legs were longer,</i>

796
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,404
<i>and I had a lighter build.</i>
<i>So I volunteered to run.</i>

797
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,991
But when it came to the boys,
we couldn't really make up our minds.

798
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,326
<i>We discussed it for a while.</i>

799
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:39,288
<i>Now, those who have</i>
<i>been selected to participate in the relay,</i>

800
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,082
<i>please make your way to your treadmill.</i>

801
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,752
- Korea!
- Fight on!

802
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:45,836
Okay!

803
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,173
<i>Even though</i>
<i>it was just a preliminary challenge,</i>

804
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,341
<i>I was still nervous.</i>

805
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,551
<i>Whatever the advantage was,</i>

806
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,845
<i>I knew that not having it</i>
<i>could hurt my team.</i>

807
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,806
<i>I couldn't let that happen.</i>
<i>So I had to make sure we got it.</i>

808
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,892
<i>I wasn't sure I could do it.</i>

809
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:00,976
CHOI SEUNG-YEON
CROSSFITTER

810
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,312
<i>I didn't wanna be nervous,</i>
<i>but I wasn't very confident.</i>

811
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,814
- One, two, three!
- Go, Japan!

812
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,693
Who did Japan pick? Can you see?

813
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,988
- It's the baseball guy.
- They're sending Itoi?

814
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,532
I didn't expect that.

815
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,283
Is he fast?

816
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:21,163
<i>I managed to steal 300 bases</i>
<i>during my 18-year professional career.</i>

817
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,331
YOSHIO ITOI
FORMER BASEBALL PLAYER

818
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,291
So I thought, "I'm fairly confident
in my running skills.

819
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,752
I can win this for my team,
no problem. Let's go."

820
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,963
I know wrestlers aren't
exactly known for their speed…

821
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,047
NONOKA OZAKI
WRESTLER

822
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,549
…but I'm good at short-distance sprinting.

823
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,842
<i>So I ended up joining Itoi in the relay.</i>

824
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,763
I think Itoi might be their secret weapon.
Don't you think?

825
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,974
- That guy's a machine.
- He really is.

826
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,644
<i>Competing against Itoi</i>
<i>was challenging enough.</i>

827
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:48,857
<i>But in my opinion,</i>
<i>Enkh was actually a much bigger threat.</i>

828
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,779
In general, MMA fighters are known
for having incredible stamina.

829
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,614
I figured he'd outrun all of us.

830
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,824
Yeah!

831
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,534
- All right!
- Let's go!

832
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:03,914
<i>Again, the winner of this game</i>
<i>will win an advantage in the next quest.</i>

833
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,376
<i>We will begin momentarily.</i>

834
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,628
<i>I grew up in the countryside,</i>

835
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,631
<i>where I rode horses, went hiking</i>
<i>and climbed mountains.</i>

836
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,551
<i>I was confident</i>
<i>I could handle a treadmill.</i>

837
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,386
<i>I knew my team believed in me,</i>

838
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,139
<i>which made me all the more determined</i>
<i>to win it for them,</i>

839
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,099
<i>even if I had to push beyond my limits.</i>

840
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,936
<i>I knew I could only do the best I could,</i>

841
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,479
<i>but I had to win this.</i>

842
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,732
- <i>Ready…</i>
- All right.

843
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,109
Don't be nervous, you can win this.

844
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,743
All right, good start!

845
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,412
Nice pace, Itoi. Very, very nice.

846
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,747
Good, good, good.

847
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,208
- You're doing great! Take big strides!
- Let's go!

848
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,170
<i>We decided</i>
<i>that I'd do most of the running,</i>

849
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:55,466
and when I needed a break, Khanda would
jump in for some short-term sprinting.

850
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,010
<i>The time it'd take to switch out</i>

851
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,679
could very easily
cut into your overall run time.

852
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,558
<i>So, to try and conserve that time,</i>
<i>you couldn't swap too often.</i>

853
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,936
Gotta pull out all the stops!

854
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,980
Pace yourself.

855
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,482
Okay.

856
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,775
Nice!

857
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,943
They switched already?

858
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,946
Hey, hey! Your opponent tagged out.

859
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,907
You're doing great!

860
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,202
- Two minutes, 30 seconds.
- Okay, 30.

861
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,372
Get ready.
Time to switch, step to the side.

862
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,875
<i>We used a method</i>
<i>I often practice while working out.</i>

863
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,629
<i>You sprint for a bit, then rest for a bit.</i>
<i>Rinse and repeat.</i>

864
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,050
<i>The longer you run, the more</i>
<i>you tend to slow down. It's inevitable.</i>

865
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,678
<i>So, whenever one of us started</i>
<i>to slow down,</i>

866
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,680
<i>we'd just switch to maintain our speed.</i>

867
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,892
<i>Having an advantage</i>
<i>could get us to the finals.</i>

868
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,603
<i>So we had to fight for it.</i>
<i>We had to go all out.</i>

869
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,654
You can switch anytime.

870
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,239
Switch out if you're tired.

871
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,907
It's okay to tap out, all right?

872
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,036
I noticed that Korea would switch runners
every 20 seconds or so.

873
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,707
<i>I thought it'd slow them down,</i>
<i>but they managed to switch very quickly.</i>

874
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,210
<i>And the more I watched them,</i>
<i>the more I started to doubt our strategy.</i>

875
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,295
Tag out if you need to.

876
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,215
You've been going a while.

877
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,299
- Switch.
- Okay.

878
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,427
All right, let's go! Go, Nonoka, go!

879
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,595
- All right, Nonoka! That's it!
- Go, go!

880
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,723
That's it! Push off
with your legs, keep your balance.

881
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,891
- Keep going!
- Okay!

882
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,060
Nice job, Nonoka. Keep that pace.

883
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,396
I think they'll switch at the minute.

884
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,772
They haven't switched yet.

885
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,735
<i>I could feel the desire</i>
<i>to win literally burning inside of me.</i>

886
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,988
<i>I planned on pushing until the very end.</i>

887
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,407
You should tag out.

888
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,409
Go, go!

889
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,246
- All right! Let's go, Khanda!
- Run at your own pace.

890
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,582
- Eyes ahead!
- Let's go! Keep swinging those arms.

891
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,666
Seven seconds…

892
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,543
- Watch your form.
- …eight, nine seconds.

893
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,005
Ten seconds, 11 seconds, 12 seconds.

894
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,298
Get ready!

895
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,717
Amotti is crazy fast.

896
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,011
- Man, he's booking it!
- Look at him!

897
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,973
<i>Because we kept tagging out,</i>
<i>I had the energy to really push myself.</i>

898
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,684
- The second it hits you, switch.
- Switch.

899
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,437
Let's go! Go! That's it! Back to it.

900
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,899
- Just swap the second you get tired.
- If you slow down, switch out.

901
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,735
After I swapped out,
I started watching Korea.

902
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:23,238
<i>And I realized that their strategy</i>
<i>was probably more effective than ours.</i>

903
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,658
<i>So we decided,</i>
<i>while in the middle of the challenge,</i>

904
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:30,204
<i>to switch it up a bit.</i>
<i>And took inspiration from Korea.</i>

905
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,705
- Switch.
- Ready.

906
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,795
<i>And the more that we switched,</i>
<i>the faster we ran.</i>

907
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,713
- Good!
- Switch!

908
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,840
- Don't keep going if you're tired.
- Exactly.

909
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,884
- Switch!
- Nice job.

910
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,929
- Perfect! Just keep doing that!
- Really great work, nice!

911
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,931
- Just a little bit more, okay?
- You're good!

912
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,182
You can pace yourselves!

913
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,725
- Watch your pace.
- You're doing great!

914
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:52,893
Keep it up!

915
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,396
<i>I know I was doing the best I could, but…</i>

916
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,566
<i>my best didn't feel that great.</i>

917
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,903
<i>But I kept pushing anyway.</i>

918
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,989
Mind your pace!

919
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,118
<i>The breaks between were really short.</i>

920
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,330
<i>At first,</i>
<i>I felt like I was doing all right.</i>

921
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,748
<i>But after a few rounds,</i>

922
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,542
<i>I started to feel more stressed.</i>

923
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,211
Go, go, go!
Just tag out whenever you need to.

924
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,963
No penalty to switch, feel free to swap!

925
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,674
- Eighty seconds left!
- At full power, as long as you can.

926
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,133
Full power!

927
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,928
- Switch!
- Ten seconds. Go!

928
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,763
- All right.
- Go, Itoi!

929
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,890
Full power, okay? Pick up the pace!

930
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,228
<i>When I wasn't running, I focused</i>
<i>on recovering as quickly as possible.</i>

931
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,064
<i>And when I ran, I tried to stay motivated</i>

932
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,400
<i>by telling myself, "This is too easy!"</i>

933
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,986
Man, their baseball guy's great.

934
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,696
He's good at everything.

935
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,617
Don't push too hard!

936
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,831
One minute!

937
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,083
- Let's go. You got this.
- <i>One minute.</i>

938
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,294
- Almost there!
- Keep it up!

939
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,170
- All right!
- Final stretch, you two!

940
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,380
You should tag out!

941
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,716
- It's okay to switch.
- Go! Switch!

942
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,844
Don't panic! You two are doing great!

943
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,138
- We're nearly there, Itoi.
- You can do it!

944
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,681
Go, Nonoka! Go!

945
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,641
Yes, keep running!

946
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,727
- Push, that's it.
- Yeah. That's it, Nonoka!

947
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,896
- Just keep pushing!
- You've got this!

948
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,857
- Itoi, you finish it!
- I'll do the last 30, okay?

949
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,276
- Hang in there, all right?
- We're down to the last 40 seconds!

950
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,694
That's ten more to go, Nonoka!

951
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,613
You two are doing great!

952
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,865
Switch out. Time to switch!

953
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,533
Fight on!

954
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,286
Try to switch every ten seconds!

955
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,747
Try to switch every ten seconds!

956
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,169
Come on! Move those legs!

957
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,088
- Five seconds to go, as fast as you can!
- All right! Keep going!

958
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,673
- Switch!
- Go!

959
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,592
All right! Keep going!

960
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,760
Go!

961
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,054
<i>I'd depleted most of my stamina</i>
<i>by the end,</i>

962
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,973
<i>so those last 30 seconds were rough.</i>

963
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,226
<i>But I just had to push through it.</i>
<i>I couldn't afford to lose.</i>

964
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,728
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

965
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,105
- <i>Thirty seconds.</i>
- Thirty!

966
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,149
Enkh needs to rest for about five seconds.

967
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,068
Khandsuren, you gotta get on!

968
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,153
- You're almost done!
- Come on, switch!

969
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,237
All right! Let's go!

970
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,448
Beautiful job, Khanda! Run, run, run!

971
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,909
- Ten more seconds! You're almost done!
- Ten-second sprint!

972
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,496
Let's finish this!

973
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,123
- Final stretch!
- Come on, Amotti!

974
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,459
- Final stretch!
- Come on!

975
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,002
- Hang on!
- Finish strong!

976
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,505
Twenty more seconds! You're almost there!

977
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,173
- Go, go, go!
- Fifteen.

978
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,884
- Final push! You've got this!
- Tag out if you need to. It's okay!

979
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:31,969
Switch!

980
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,554
Go! Let's go, Nonoka!

981
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,473
- Straight to the end!
- Go, go!

982
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,183
- As fast as you can!
- Full power!

983
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,935
- One last push, come on!
- Let's go, Nonoka!

984
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,353
Go, go, go!

985
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,855
- Okay, you can change! It's time, come on!
- Stop Khanda, time to switch!

986
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,567
- Swap back!
- Don't look at the time!

987
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,569
- Just go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

988
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,738
All right, as fast as you can! Let's go!

989
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,866
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

990
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,785
- Nine!
- Eight!

991
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,745
- Seven!
- Six!

992
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,789
- Five!
- Four! Three!

993
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,791
- Let's go! Come on!
- Two!

994
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:03,959
One!

995
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,422
- <i>Game over.</i>
- That was intense!

996
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,173
- <i>Game over.</i>
- Nice.

997
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,759
Great job. That was a tough fight.

998
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,512
- High-five.
- Great work!

999
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:16,805
Great job, you two!

1000
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:17,889
They look dead.

1001
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,891
My legs feel heavy.

1002
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,477
So do mine. Great job, man.

1003
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,901
<i>I was completely and utterly exhausted.</i>

1004
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,863
<i>I could also taste</i>
<i>a little blood in my mouth.</i>

1005
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,032
<i>So I knew that I had tried my very best.</i>

1006
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,411
That was harder than I thought.

1007
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,289
Great job, well done.

1008
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,466
<i>I really did hit my limit at the end.</i>

1009
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,260
<i>I tried to push through,</i>
<i>but I was really struggling.</i>

1010
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,930
I think this is the hardest thing
I've done so far.

1011
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,559
Physical: Asia.

1012
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,770
<i>We will now reveal the results</i>

1013
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,355
<i>of the Manual Treadmill Relay.</i>

1014
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,274
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

1015
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,903
Come on. Say Japan.

1016
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:16,990
<i>First,</i>
<i>we will reveal the team in third place.</i>

1017
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,701
Let's go.

1018
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,078
<i>Third place:</i>

1019
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,832
<i>Mongolia.</i>

1020
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,087
- I thought so. Well done, though.
- Thanks, you too.

1021
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,797
You did well.

1022
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:37,344
<i>Team Mongolia, 917 meters.</i>

1023
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,223
- Good effort.
- Good teamwork.

1024
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,808
It's okay, you did a good job.

1025
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,227
<i>We will now reveal the winning team.</i>

1026
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,562
- Okay.
- Please, please, please.

1027
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,274
Say Japan. Please say Japan.

1028
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,401
Please.

1029
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,864
Please, please. Japan, Japan.

1030
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,494
<i>Korea.</i>

1031
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,706
<i>Korea.</i>

1032
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,918
- See? What'd I tell you? Look at this guy.
- He's such a hypocrite.

1033
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,002
- He's nuts.
- What? I'm happy.

1034
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,462
You said, "Don't get too excited!"

1035
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,547
Nice job!

1036
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,007
Come on. I just wanna see
how much we beat them by.

1037
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,384
<i>Team Korea,</i>

1038
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,637
<i>1,114 meters.</i>

1039
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,267
<i>Team Japan, 1,024 meters.</i>

1040
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,435
Oh.

1041
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,062
- Wow, 100 meters.
- Is that a lot?

1042
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,356
I mean,
that's only a ten-second difference?

1043
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,484
- Yeah.
- Maybe a bit more, like 14 or 12, max.

1044
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,153
It's not by much.

1045
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,363
They were actually pretty close.

1046
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:42,659
<i>The advantage in the fifth quest</i>
<i>will be given to Korea.</i>

1047
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,952
Thank you!

1048
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,537
Of course.

1049
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,414
We did it for the team.

1050
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,167
At this rate,
I might owe you too many favors, man.

1051
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,751
It is what it is.

1052
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,588
- We're gonna be fine.
- Exactly. Not a big deal.

1053
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,257
- Hey, nice job.
- You too.

1054
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,341
Thank you.

1055
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,220
So unfortunately, we were beaten by Korea.

1056
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,181
But that's okay.

1057
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,726
It's not like we lost a quest,
so there's no reason to feel discouraged.

1058
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:10,478
We're gonna beat them
the next time we face off.

1059
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,189
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1060
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,607
- And your legs?
- It's good.

1061
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,774
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1062
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,443
- Oh, good. I was worried.
- Thanks, man.

1063
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,320
- Great job there, Seung-yeon!
- Bring it in.

1064
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,989
I know it wasn't
the most important challenge,

1065
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,450
but there was still a lot at stake.

1066
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,368
So yeah, I'm proud of myself.

1067
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,705
Physical: Asia.

1068
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,250
<i>We will now reveal…</i>

All right. Bring it.

1071
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,926
What's it gonna be?

1072
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,678
<i>The fifth quest…</i>

1073
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,515
<i>is a Record Match.</i>

1074
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,309
- Record match?
- What's that?

1075
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,393
"Record?"

1076
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,687
Are they recording weight?

1077
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,023
Speed?

1078
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,316
I don't know.

1079
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,652
<i>Each team</i>

1080
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,321

<i>one by one.</i>

1082
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,951
- Only one at a time.
- Okay.

1083
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,328
I see.
So we're not competing together then.

1084
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,997
I think they'll be ranking us by speed.

1085
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,874
I think that, whatever it is,

1086
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,043
it'll probably be similar
to the Shipwreck quest.

1087
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:19,297
<i>Only two of the three teams will survive.</i>

1088
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,176

- <i>will be eliminated.</i>
- Wow.

1091
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,724
- Okay.
- No death match.

1092
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,101
- Nope. This is it.
- Yep.

1095
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,569

1096
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,659

1097
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:53,623

1098
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,542
<i>…a map of the arena.</i>

1099
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,668
A map?

1100
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,586
Of what?

1101
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,922
- So we get a map of the arena?
- Yeah.

1102
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,507
That's really good.

1103
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,717
Jackpot.

1104
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,553
If we were one of the other two teams,

1105
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,055
yeah, having a map is a huge advantage.

1106
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,016
There's a map?

1107
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,105
Whatever. We'll be fine.

1108
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,817
<i>I mean, I really couldn't imagine</i>
<i>how having a map</i>

1109
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,111
was going to make
a significant difference.

1110

Whatever the fifth quest is,
I'm not too worried.

1111
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,948
We're gonna win.

1112
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:30,285
Whoever goes home next,
it's not gonna be us.

1113
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,459
<i>You may now review the map.</i>

1114
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,419
Okay, let's huddle up.

1115
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,921
- Don't let them see.
- Here, come here.

1116
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,298
Well, there it is.

1117
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,305
Oh, no.

1118
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,473
- Oh, no.
- Come on. Come here.

1119
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,600
- Oh, no.
- Come on. Come here.

1120
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,934
Ah, sorry, sorry!

1121
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,189
- Wow.
- Oh. It's huge.

1122
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,315
What is it?

1123
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,567
- Is that a bridge?
- Hey, don't say it.

1124
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,111
- They can't speak Korean.
- Oh, yeah. That's right.

1125
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,947
Come on, Dong-hyun. Give us a peek.

1126
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,909
What are they talking about?

1127
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,745
What's in that map?

1128
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,414
<i>I was definitely jealous.</i>

1129
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,041
I mean, I'm allowed to be, right?

1130
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,793
When he opened it, I just…

1131
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,711
Mmm…

1132
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,130
Of course I wanted to see it.
It's right there.

1133
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,549
Should we join them?

1134
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,260
- All right. You guys coming?
- You're captain, you go.

1135
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,721
What if you snuck up behind them
and poked your head in?

1136
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,641
I was this close to peeking.

1137
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,273
Is that some kind of pole?

1138
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,692
Maybe we're walking on them.

1139
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,237
- What's this? Are they walls?
- I think they're barricades.

1140
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,072
It looks like we have to go over them?

1141
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,240
Like this?

1142
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,370
This is on the ground, right?
I guess this means we'll need to lift it?

1143
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,579
- Is this another one?
- This here.

1144
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,373
It also has one of those lines.

1145
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:01,126
Yeah. If those lines are ropes,
I think you're right.

1146
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:04,671
<i>Your first instinct is</i>
<i>to create some kind of game plan.</i>

1147
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:08,216
<i>But it's just a map.</i>
<i>There's no instructions, no specifics.</i>

1148
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,678
<i>So we spent most of our time trying</i>
<i>to speculate what we might have to do.</i>

1149
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,431
<i>The time has come.</i>

1150
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,642
<i>Contestants, please move to the arena.</i>

<i>Team Korea. Please enter the arena.</i>

00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,492
Doesn't this look like a battlefield?

1155
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,202
- Yeah, it does.
- Crazy.

1156
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,620
Ah…

1157
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,455
It's bigger than I thought.

1158
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,499
I think we have to move this.

1159
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,001
- Not just the cargo, all of it.
- I think you're right.

1160
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,921
What are we moving? Military supplies?

1161
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,340
Physical: Asia.

1162

- That's what this is.
- Okay, a conquest.

1165
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,858
Oh, wow.

1166
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,985
That's what we saw earlier.

1167
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,240
It's a sand dune.

1168
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,669
<i>The set was massive.</i>

1169
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,505
It looked a lot smaller on the map.

1170
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,882
<i>The castle, the carriage, everything.</i>

1171
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,135
<i>You know it's going to be bigger</i>
<i>in person, but still…</i>

1172
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,221
<i>It was absolutely huge.</i>

1173
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,099
<i>I felt like I'd shrunk</i>
<i>to the size of a toy or something.</i>

1174
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,061
<i>In Castle Conquest,</i>
<i>you will race against the clock</i>

<i>to transport a loaded supply wagon</i>
<i>to a destination within the castle.</i>

1176
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,526
Well, that's gonna be a nightmare.

1177
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,902
This thing is heavy.

1178
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:36,072
