2
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,927
and this setting cannot be changed.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,221
<i>The team that will join Korea</i>

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,473
<i>and advance to the Final Quest…</i>

5
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,320
<i>Mongolia.</i>

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>Mongolia.</i>

7
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,501
<i>We made it to the</i>
<i>final round of </i>Physical: Asia.

8
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,919
<i>It feels amazing.</i>

9
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,671
One! Two!

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,757
<i>I'm so grateful</i>
<i>to have such an incredible,</i>

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,550
<i>hardworking team.</i>

12
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,802
<i>Game over.</i>

13
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,513
See? You really did save us!

14
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,646
<i>Mongolia's final time was</i>
<i>25 minutes and 15 seconds.</i>

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,981
Ooh, that's a bit slow.

16
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,775
- Okay, 25.
- Don't you think?

17
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,359
<i>Mongolia.</i>

18
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,198
It's okay, it's okay.

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,450
It is what it is.

20
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,082
<i>Team Japan…</i>

21
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:29,005
<i>you have been eliminated</i>
<i>for failing to complete the quest.</i>

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,424
Oh! They didn't finish?

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,093
What?

24
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,345
I bet it was the gate.

25
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,430
Maybe the gate didn't lock or something.

26
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,849
- That sucks…
- Ah.

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,978
- Good job, team. We did our best.
- It still sucks.

28
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,607
One, two…

29
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,152
- Come on.
- What's going on?

30
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,487
What's happening?

31
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>The bridge wouldn't move</i>
<i>past the halfway point.</i>

32
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,078
And no matter what we did,
it was just kind of stuck there.

33
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,371
Try jumping.

34
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,416
- What's going on?
- Are we doing it wrong?

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,752
What else are we supposed to do?

36
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,962
One, two!

37
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,342
<i>It wasn't for lack of trying.</i>

38
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,136
<i>Everyone was pulling</i>
<i>as hard as they could.</i>

39
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,568
<i>Time just kind of flew by without notice.</i>

40
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,070
Man! Not even a little…

41
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,241
<i>I was getting anxious.</i>
<i>And this… really ate away at me.</i>

42
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,869
<i>I just didn't know what to do.</i>
<i>What could we do?</i>

43
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,996
It moved a bit.

44
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,332
<i>All I could hear was,</i>
<i>"Quest failed. Quest failed."</i>

45
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,671
Last stand. We've got five minutes.

46
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,590
We can't give up now, all right?

47
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,425
- One, two!
- We can do this!

48
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,346
It's still not moving!

49
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,056
Don't give up!

50
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,486
<i>Game over.</i>

51
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,875
We did all we could.

52
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,210
It's okay. It's fine.

53
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,755
- We're fine.
- Good job. You okay?

54
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,506
- You did good.
- Yeah, we did our best.

55
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,591
- Good job, team.
- Thank you.

56
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,593
<i>Despite our best efforts…</i>

57
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:43,765
the clock ran out, and we weren't able
to raise the gate again.

58
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,268
The worst part was realizing that

59
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,646
our team just wasn't strong enough.

60
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,564
As team captain…

61
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:56,194
I'm really frustrated.
And I feel like I let everyone down.

62
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,075
Physical: Asia.

63
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,955
<i>Japan, you have been eliminated</i>
<i>from </i>Physical: Asia.

64
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,000
<i>You must now destroy your torsos</i>
<i>with your very own hands.</i>

65
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,298
Sucks they're going home.

66
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,970
We came here intending
to leave as champions.

67
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,304
And during our time here,

68
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,640
I remained confident
in our ability to win.

69
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,976
- All right!
- Nice job!

70
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,060
We did it!

71
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,312
You're the best, man!

72
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:40,280
However, in spite of this confidence,
and our intentions, we were defeated.

73
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,284
But Japan always manages to bounce back

74
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,202
from defeat, no matter what.

75
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,830
And as Captain, I couldn't be more proud

76
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,081
of this incredible team.

77
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,666
Thank you for everything.

78
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,093
<i>Everyone here really believed in me.</i>

79
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,013
Nice, Nonoka.

80
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,931
- Hang in there!
- You can do it.

81
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,766
<i>And because of them,</i>

82
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,437
<i>I realized that I don't have</i>
<i>to fight by myself anymore.</i>

83
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,647
I know that my time here will be something

84
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,774
I treasure for the rest of my life.

85
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,662
I'm disappointed about
how things turned out.

86
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,958
But through
all the trials and tribulations,

87
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,585
I'm glad I kept going.

88
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,088
And I wouldn't have been able to do that
without the support of my teammates.

89
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,760
I believe that this experience
has made me a stronger person.

90
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,055
I really mean that.

91
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,557
And as for my team,
I can't imagine a better group of people.

92
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,810
For all the thrills,
and all the excitement…

93
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,937
I'm so grateful
for having this opportunity

94
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,065
to be a part of <i>Physical: Asia.</i>

95
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,071
Uh…

96
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,947
I had a lot of fun here.

97
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,908
I'm glad I got to push myself.

98
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,161
He's an amazing athlete. Amazing.

99
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,829
Yeah, he really is.

100
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,915
I wish things were different.

101
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,627
But, at the end of the day,
serious physical competition is…

102
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,672
Great job!

103
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,466
Push him back!

104
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,843
…always inspiring

105
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,304
and beautiful to see.

106
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,894
That's it, man! That's it!

107
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,938
Yes, Soichi!

108
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,023
And being here reminded me of that.

109
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,817
So, thank you.

110
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,820
I actually think that's quite beautiful.

111
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,448
- Ready?
- Look at that.

112
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,866
There's the swing.

113
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,834
I know the six of us here fought
as hard as we could.

114
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,004
<i>Getting to represent our country</i>

115
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,757
<i>on </i>Physical: Asia <i>has been</i>
<i>an incredible honor.</i>

116
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:12,557
We're not just colleagues
and teammates, we've all become… family.

117
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,641
So, uh…

118
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,733
It hurts. It just feels like there's
this big hole in my heart.

119
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,154
Yeah, I already feel a bit lonely.

120
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,699
<i>I'm so grateful</i>
<i>that the universe brought us together.</i>

121
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,035
<i>I'll always remember this.</i>

122
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,207
Even though we're leaving,
we're leaving with our heads high.

123
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,543
- One, two, three!
- Go, Japan!

124
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,669
Go, Japan!

125
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,795
Go, Japan!

126
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,762
Attention! Bow.

127
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,847
Bow.

128
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,229
- Thank you.
- Great job.

129
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,898
- Thank you.
- Well done.

130
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,445
- Thanks, man.
- Okami…

131
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,656
Yeah, it's a shame.
But it is what it is. Good luck.

132
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,408
- Thank you!
- Good job, good job.

133
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,951
Nice fight!

134
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,745
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

135
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:48,361
PHYSICAL: ASIA

136
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,825
12. ALL-OUT BATTLE

137
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,874
- No way!
- Look at that!

138
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,376
- It smells so good.
- Wow.

139
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,502
That's awesome.

140
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,088
It looks like a party!

141
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,215
- Yay!
- Oh.

142
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,260
That looks delicious.

143
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,594
I'm so excited!

144
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,013
- Mongolian food?
- I think so.

145
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,515
That looks good.

146
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,935
If we make the finals, I wanna celebrate…

147
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,353
with lots of <i>Khorkhog</i>.

148
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,981
A pot of boiled beef, a platter of <i>buuz</i>…

149
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,274
I think that's my favorite.

150
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,358
Goulash!

151
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,901
Mongol food?

152
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,945
You have to try it. This name, "buuz."

153
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,947
- Delicious?
- Delicious!

154
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,492
- <i>Khorkhog.</i>
- <i>Khorkhog, Khorkhog.</i>

155
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,163
I can't help it,
I get so excited when I see food.

156
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,999
There's Korean cuisine too.

157
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,625
Oh.

158
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,377
What would I wanna eat?

159
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,088
- Samgyetang.
- I'd want sotbap.

160
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,841
Some samgyeopsal and kimchi jjigae.

161
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,050
Kimchi jjim!

162
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,719
That looks amazing.

163
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,304
Baeksuk!

164
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,722
That looks so good!

165
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,020
- Wow!
- That rice looks beautiful.

166
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,271
Yay!

167
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,107
<i>It was our own Last Supper.</i>

168
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,734
You know, that one big meal,

169
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,862
that occurs right
before someone gets killed.

170
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,946
Eat up, more.

171
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,407
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy!

172
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,285
Mmm.

173
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:23,164
<i>Getting to eat Mongolian food</i>
<i>before the final was really wonderful.</i>

174
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,292
<i>I felt rejuvenated and full of energy.</i>

175
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,048
<i>On the other hand,</i>

176
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,675
<i>it was a bit of an awkward situation.</i>

177
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,887
<i>We were sharing a meal</i>
<i>with the people we were about to fight.</i>

178
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,099
Wow. The lamb's great.

179
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,726
Mmm.

180
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,229
It's amazing.

181
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,981
Mmm.

182
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,281
Enjoy it while you can,
before you taste defeat.

183
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,867
Enjoy it while you can,
before you taste defeat.

184
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,414
<i>The fight began</i>

185
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,292
<i>long before we entered the final arena.</i>

186
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,211
<i>They kept glancing over at us.</i>

187
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,295
<i>Probably wondering,</i>

188
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,963
<i>"What's going on in their heads?</i>

189
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,465
<i>Are they relaxed? Anxious?"</i>

190
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,343
It felt like we were being analyzed.

191
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,886
How did they do it?

192
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,097
How did they close the gate so fast?

193
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,600
I think they're just that strong.
It's because of all that kimchi.

194
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,852
Mongolia's gonna be tough to beat.

195
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,064
I really didn't think
they'd make it this far.

196
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,273
Me neither.

197
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,859
Khandsuren.

198
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,696
Did you think we'd make it to the finals?

199
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,947
Or were you surprised?

200
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,157
We weren't all that surprised.

201
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,534
At least, not me.

202
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,911
Hmm.

203
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,705
What about you?

204
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,833
Are you surprised to see us
in the finals with you, or no?

205
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,252
- I think they're surprised.
- I think you're right…

206
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,632
Honestly, I think we were all surprised.

207
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,092
None of us really expected it.

208
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,429
At first, I kind of assumed
that you'd just gotten lucky.

209
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,098
But the fact that you're here
means you deserve to be here.

210
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,308
We're "Lucky Vicky," huh?

211
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,519
Or maybe we're just that skilled.

212
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,603
Let's go with that.

213
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,607
<i>I kept an eye</i>
<i>on Korea the entire time while eating.</i>

214
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,360
<i>I wasn't going to let</i>
<i>our opponents intimidate us.</i>

215
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,154
<i>Looking at Orkhonbayar,</i>

216
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,906
<i>I could tell he thought the same thing.</i>

217
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,702
I love that we're sitting here,
eating together,

218
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,413
as if… there's not
a billion won on the line.

219
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,167
I guess it's really
all or nothing, isn't it?

220
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,005
I know it's the finals,
but I don't feel all that stressed out.

221
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,632
Converting the prize money
sounds more stressful.

222
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,637
They're hilarious.

223
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,681
<i>I think they were a bit overconfident.</i>

224
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,392
We're winning this thing.

225
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,395
Hey, what will you do
with the prize money?

226
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,982
If our team wins today,
and we get the prize money,

227
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,735
we'll buy all of you
some plane tickets to visit Mongolia.

228
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,488
We'll buy all of you
some plane tickets to visit Mongolia.

229
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,531
Oh.

230
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,866
That's nice.

231
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,661
Let's both give it
everything we've got today.

232
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,079
We'll fight with no regrets.

233
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,961
Going into the final match today,

234
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,131
I'm glad that it's shaping up
to be a really intense battle.

235
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,759
And while we would love to visit Mongolia,

236
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,094
I'm determined to do so
with our own prize money.

237
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,388
I'm determined to do so
with our own prize money.

238
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,106
Physical: Asia.

239
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,441
<i>Final Quest.</i>

240
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,485
All right, we made it! Final Quest.

241
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,073
<i>Contestants, please make</i>
<i>your way to the arena.</i>

242
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,658
- Whoa.
- All right, here we go!

243
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,909
Okay!

244
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,994
- May the best team win.
- Bring it on, guys.

245
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,496
Absolutely.

246
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,941
Physical: Asia.

247
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,610
<i>The Final Quest is about to begin.</i>

248
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,904
<i>Korea, Mongolia,</i>

249
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,948
<i>please enter the arena.</i>

250
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,330
What's all of this?

251
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,707
Look at that…

252
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,543
- A track?
- It's big.

253
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,006
- I guess we're all gonna be running.
- Yeah…

254
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,884
- There's boxes too.
- Whoa.

255
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,344
- And we'll be pushing those. Right?
- Right.

256
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,431
<i>There was a huge track</i>
<i>on the outside of the arena,</i>

257
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,850
<i>and on the inside there were these boxes.</i>

258
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,978
I think we're supposed
to move them that way.

259
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,981
- So, we're pushing boxes…
- Wait, there's a ball, too.

260
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,568
I see a rope. That's all iron.

261
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,613
Do you see all those carabiners?

262
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,197
Maybe we have to drag it across?

263
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,282
Maybe.

264
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,368
- Who knows, man?
- Hmm?

265
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,995
- It could be anything.
- Yeah…

266
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,205
I've got no idea.

267
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,294
<i>I assumed the "Final Quest"</i>
<i>would be pretty straightforward.</i>

268
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,546
<i>I thought we'd be playing</i>
<i>a large-scale game.</i>

269
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,466
But there were all these… things.

270
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,968
<i>There were these iron weighs</i>
<i>with ropes attached,</i>

271
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,012
<i>and these weird, long boxes.</i>

272
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,474
<i>And all of them were surrounded</i>
<i>by this running track.</i>

273
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,518
<i>Whatever they had in store</i>
<i>for us was certainly finals-worthy.</i>

274
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,983
<i>Of the eight competing nations,</i>

275
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,235
<i>only two have made it to the Final Quest.</i>

276
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,154
<i>Korea.</i>

277
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,407
<i>Mongolia.</i>

278
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,371
<i>Between the two of you,</i>

279
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,582
<i>only the nation</i>
<i>that displays the finest teamwork…</i>

280
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,543
<i>will prove that they,</i>
<i>above all other nations,</i>

281
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,088
<i>have the best and most perfect physiques.</i>

282
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,219
<i>The team that emerges victorious</i>
<i>in today's Final Quest</i>

283
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,596
<i>will receive a grand prize…</i>

284
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,518
<i>of one billion won.</i>

285
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,521
- <i>Of one billion won.</i>
- Wow.

286
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,693
<i>Of course, the money's nice.</i>

287
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,778
But just winning the competition,

288
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,991
and proving to everyone that Korea is
the strongest of all eight nations…

289
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,201
to me, that's the real prize.

290
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,997
<i>Everything we went through,</i>
<i>everything we did, was for Mongolia.</i>

291
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,000
We had to fight
for her till the bitter end.

292
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,419
<i>We will now invite the Captains to speak.</i>

293
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,046
<i>From South Korea, Kim Dong-hyun.</i>

294
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,718
At the start of this competition,

295
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,262
I said that true strength comes
from within.

296
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,724
And even now,
I still believe those words to be true.

297
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,935
Korea has made it
here through pure grit and determination.

298
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,353
Even at our lowest point,

299
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,522
we never once surrendered
or gave up the fight.

300
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:07,067
And now that we're here, we have
no intention of stopping until we prove

301
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,445
that Korea's the strongest.
Even if it kills us.

302
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,490
<i>I know Korea has what it takes to win.</i>

303
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,118
All of us are
already strong as individuals.

304
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,328
<i>But we're at our best</i>
<i>when we work together,</i>

305
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,372
<i>our teamwork is our greatest strength.</i>

306
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,125
<i>We won't just win this,</i>
<i>we're gonna crush them.</i>

307
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,296
<i>And now the opposing team's Captain.</i>

308
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,591
<i>From Mongolia, Orkhonbayar Bayarsaikhan.</i>

309
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,219
Our team stands united in one common goal:

310
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,056
To win this competition
on behalf of Mongolia.

311
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,225
No challenge has ever managed
to weaken our resolve.

312
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,480
That's why today, no matter what happens,
we'll walk away as champions.

313
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,190
Let's go! Whoo!

314
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,861
<i>Our intentions have always been clear.</i>

315
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,363
<i>We're going to win.</i>

316
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,742
<i>And if we continue as we have,</i>
<i>fighting together,</i>

317
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,579
<i>with every last ounce of our strength,</i>
<i>I know that we'll be victorious.</i>

318
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,625
Physical: Asia.

319
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,670
<i>The Final Quest will now be revealed.</i>

320
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,218
<i>The Final Quest…</i>

321
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,390
<i>…is a six-on-six All Out Team match.</i>

322
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,477
Okay. This is good.

323
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,107
<i>The six-on-six All Out Team match…</i>

324
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,319
<i>will consist of three games.</i>

325
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,403
Three?

326
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,032
- We're winning everything. We got this.
- Ideally.

327
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,076
<i>For each of the three games,</i>

328
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,036
<i>all six teammates</i>

329
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,747
<i>will be participating.</i>

330
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,873
Ooh.

331
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,544
<i>If it's our six against their six,</i>

332
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,755
<i>then I think our team</i>
<i>might have the upper hand here.</i>

333
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,966
<i>Out of the three games,</i>

334
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,136
<i>the team that manages</i>
<i>to win two of the games…</i>

335
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,555
<i>will be crowned the winner</i>

336
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,058
<i>of </i>Physical: Asia.

337
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,228
<i>First game:</i>

338
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,856
<i>the Wall-Pushing Match.</i>

339
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,608
<i>In this game,</i>

340
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,237
<i>your goal is to push the central walls</i>
<i>into your opponent's territory.</i>

341
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,657
<i>Whoever covers more</i>
<i>of their opponent's territory will win.</i>

342
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,325
Okay, it's battle of strength.

343
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,910
It's kind of like tug-of-war.

344
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,203
But the opposite.

345
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,038
We'll have to overpower them.

346
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,331
<i>Second Game:</i>

347
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,293
<i>the Iron Ball Dragging Match.</i>

348
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,172
<i>In this game,</i>

349
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,842
<i>all six members of</i>
<i>a team must work together to drag</i>

350
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:41,138
<i>an iron cluster across the finish line</i>
<i>within a preset time frame.</i>

351
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,601
From the looks of it, each of the teams
will have their own set of weights.

352
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,687
<i>Game Three:</i>

353
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,108
<i>the Infinite Tail Tag Match.</i>

354
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,736
<i>The Infinite Tail Tag Match.</i>

355
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,820
Ah.

356
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,489
- That sounds exhausting.
- Where's that arena?

357
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,949
<i>In this game,</i>

358
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,995
<i>two teams will simultaneously run</i>
<i>a relay-type race.</i>

359
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:08,665
<i>From their designated side of the track,</i>
<i>each team must run fast enough</i>

360
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,543
<i>to pass three runners</i>
<i>on their opponent's team to win.</i>

361
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,922
So, one team starts on this side,
and the other on that side.

362
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,884
And you wanna try to run fast enough
to pass three people on their team.

363
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,762
That's all mental strength. Yeah…

364
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,973
Sorry, but if you fall behind,
we're gonna have to push you.

365
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,808
If it's like a 10k sprint,

366
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,727
it'll all come down to speed.

367
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,648
We're gonna win.

368
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,611
<i>The first game you will be playing…</i>

369
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,412
<i>is the Wall-Pushing Match.</i>

370
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,999
I already know
that the finals are gonna be tough.

371
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,461
- Okay, we've gotta win this.
- Mm-hmm.

372
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,588
We have to.

373
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,675
<i>Out of all the games,</i>

374
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,094
<i>I figured the Wall Push would be</i>
<i>the easiest for us.</i>

375
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,138
We've been able to win
by leveraging our strength before,

376
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,890
so I knew we could do it again.

377
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:12,479
<i>The second game will be selected</i>
<i>by the team that loses the first game.</i>

378
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,563
Ah.

379
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,942
Okay.
So we need to prepare for both games.

380
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,946
Okay. I've got it,
I think I have a plan. Let's do this.

381
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,866
Physical: Asia. <i>Final Quest.</i>

382
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,496
<i>Your first game, the Wall-Pushing Match,</i>

383
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,790
<i>is about to begin.</i>

384
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,322
<i>We will now explain the rules</i>
<i>of your first game,</i>

385
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,490
<i>the Wall-Pushing Match.</i>

386
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,578
<i>There are three lanes,</i>
<i>each with a movable wall.</i>

387
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:14,458
<i>Your goal is to push these walls as far</i>
<i>as you can into your opponent's territory.</i>

388
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,544
<i>The team that covers</i>
<i>the most territory will win.</i>

389
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,172
They're all different sizes too.

390
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,346
All right, this is gonna be fun, isn't it?

391
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,056
Whoo!

392
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,390
<i>During the game,</i>

393
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:34,311
<i>you may distribute your teammates</i>
<i>throughout the lanes as you see fit.</i>

394
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:38,065
<i>All participants are free to switch lanes</i>
<i>whenever they'd like.</i>

395
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,818
So we're doing all three at once.

396
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,445
Yeah, we're gonna have to think fast.

397
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,199
<i>You will play for a total of five minutes.</i>

398
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,828
<i>The team that manages to cover more</i>
<i>of their opponent's territory across all</i>

399
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,623
<i>three lanes will be declared the winner.</i>

400
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,795
So basically, there's no way
to end the game prematurely, right?

401
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,088
That's right.

402
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,133
<i>The game will consist</i>
<i>of three separate rounds.</i>

403
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,888
<i>The first team to win two of the three</i>
<i>rounds will be declared the winner.</i>

404
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,099
- Three rounds?
- Yeah, best two out of three.

405
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,392
Of course it is…

406
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,686
<i>On the surface,</i>
<i>it looks like a battle of strength.</i>

407
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,482
And yet… It doesn't really matter
how strong you are.

408
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,111
<i>If you push an object away from you</i>
<i>while someone pushes it towards you,</i>

409
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,279
<i>it creates a lot of strain on your body.</i>

410
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,782
<i>The rules were easy enough to understand.</i>

411
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,033
<i>It was simple.</i>

412
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,744
As long as we could take two
of the three lanes,

413
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,995
we'd be able to win.

414
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,998
<i>Contestants, take a moment to strategize.</i>

415
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,505
All right, so, my thought was
we should really only focus on two lanes.

416
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,383
I think we should prioritize
the big boxes,

417
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,844
and put two groups of three on each one.

418
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,764
For group one, I think Adiya,
Dulguun, and Ochir.

419
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,184
And for two, that leaves Khanda,

420
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,186
Orgil, and myself.

421
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,729
All right. So…

422
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,816
there's lots of ways we could do this.

423
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,902
We could assign each
of us to shadow someone

424
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,279
on their team based on weight.

425
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,365
So if your guy goes that way,
then you follow them to counter them.

426
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,950
Maybe one of us can stay here,

427
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,660
and two can go back and forth?

428
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,036
- How about…
- Uh-huh?

429
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,205
- …we do two lanes. Yeah.
- Two lanes?

430
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,665
Okay, say we do that,

431
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,792
and we're losing on both of them.
What should we do?

432
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,877
Actually,

433
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,088
maybe we should try to take the center.
'Cause if you think about it…

434
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,174
<i>I think Dong-hyun was panicking a bit.</i>

435
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,842
<i>He pitched a lot of ideas,</i>

436
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,511
<i>and he kept asking for our input on them.</i>

437
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:35,390
But he… didn't really have a plan,
if that makes sense.

438
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,184
<i>And right before we reached an agreement…</i>

439
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,188
<i>Contestants,</i>
<i>you have one minute remaining.</i>

440
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,399
I think we should pick
who's going to stay center with Min-jae.

441
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,776
<i>Yeah, that was</i>

442
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,113
<i>kinda rough. I'm a planner,</i>

443
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:54,326
so I like running different simulations
of various scenarios.

444
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,454
<i>But in this game,</i>
<i>there were so many variables,</i>

445
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,206
<i>so it was hard to predict everything.</i>

446
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,084
Physical: Asia.

447
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,546
<i>Final Quest. The Wall Pushing Match.</i>

448
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,089
<i>At the sound of the whistle,</i>

449
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,175
<i>round one will begin.</i>

450
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,929
- Let's get a good start.
- Don't overthink it, just go for it.

451
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,514
- As fast as you can.
- Okay.

452
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,434
<i>We kind of gave up</i>
<i>on having an official strategy</i>

453
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,395
<i>and decided to experiment. Who knows,</i>
<i>maybe we'd have more power.</i>

454
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,650
Hey. Those two are gonna run this way.

455
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,943
<i>Stand by.</i>

456
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,611
I think they're going for the big one.

457
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,946
Adiya, come with me.

458
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,030
<i>Ready.</i>

459
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,453
Push!

460
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,829
Got it, got it.

461
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,457
Stay on them.

462
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,792
Push!

463
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,544
Okay. Nice work.

464
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,628
Go.

465
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,714
Push!

466
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,758
You go over there!

467
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,892
One, two, three!

468
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,143
One, two!

469
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,522
- Push, push. Yeah, we're locked.
- Good?

470
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,777
Okay, good.

471
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,571
Okay.

472
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,947
Keep pushing.

473
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,909
- Seung-yeon, stretch your leg.
- Yeah, like that.

474
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,202
Don't lose your balance.

475
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,957
One, two!

476
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,084
- All right. Let's back up a bit.
- One, two.

477
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,836
- One, two, three!
- Three!

478
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,926
<i>We figured that the middle</i>
<i>lane was the most important one to take,</i>

479
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,430
<i>so we decided to send Amotti,</i>
<i>Min-jae, and Sung-bin there.</i>

480
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,640
Okay, we can't
just keep holding our ground.

481
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,852
<i>In the meantime, the rest</i>
<i>of us would deal with the medium box.</i>

482
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,020
<i>It was a good plan.</i>

483
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,273
<i>But as it turns out,</i>
<i>Mongolia had the same idea.</i>

484
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,649
One, two, three!

485
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,027
You're winning, so just keep holding.

486
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,613
- We're behind, right?
- Yeah, by a bit.

487
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,283
- One, two, three! Push!
- Come on.

488
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,161
- One, two, three! Push! Push!
- One, two, three!

489
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,038
Don't use up your strength, guys.

490
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,164
Just apply pressure.

491
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,332
Wait for an opening.

492
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,625
- When they weaken.
- One, two!

493
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,834
One, two, push!

494
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:08,960
All right! That's it, yes!

495
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,630
- Two, push!
- All right! That's it, yes!

496
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,757
We're not pushing efficiently.

497
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,092
- Just hold steady.
- Yeah, but if we don't push,

498
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,511
- they'll overtake us.
- One, two, three!

499
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,596
One, two!

500
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,848
One, two!

501
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,892
That's it! Push!

502
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,853
- Ready.
- One, two, three! There we go!

503
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,480
Okay, let's hold now.

504
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,564
- One, two, three!
- Ready.

505
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,649
Hold!

506
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,861
<i>I thought we could overpower them.</i>

507
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,363
<i>Especially because</i>

508
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,282
<i>we were up against two men and one woman.</i>

509
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,660
<i>But little by little, they pushed us back.</i>

510
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,788
<i>I mean, our trio had to be stronger.</i>

511
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,958
<i>Realistically, Adiyasuren couldn't be</i>
<i>that strong, could she?</i>

512
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,837
One, two, three!
All right, that's it! One, two, three!

513
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,132
One, two!

514
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,635
- We need to push in sync.
- You're right.

515
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,180
Did we do it?

516
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,432
- Yeah, we got there.
- Okay, good.

517
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,309
Let's keep pushing like this then.

518
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,936
One, two, three.

519
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,564
- Nice job! Nice job!
- Thanks. Thanks.

520
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,691
Again.

521
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,609
- They're pushing us back.
- Yeah.

522
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,029
Let's give it a big push.
One, two, three! Push!

523
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,948
One, two, three! Push!

524
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,324
- One, two, three!
- Push!

525
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,992
- One, two, three!
- Push!

526
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,953
It's not working.

527
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,916
<i>Time just seemed to fly by out there.</i>

528
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,001
<i>We were doing our best to hold our ground,</i>

529
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,212
<i>but our strategy wasn't working.</i>

530
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,506
Hey Dong-hyun, no one's in that last lane.

531
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,590
You're right.

532
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,758
What if we switch to that one?

533
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,926
Let me think…

534
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,761
- They won't be expecting it.
- Mmm.

535
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,388
Yeah? Let's do it.

536
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,514
The one on the end.

537
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,976
- I think they said, "Watch the clock…
- All right.

538
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,769
- …and hold still."
- Okay.

539
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,855
- Push! Push!
- One, two, three!

540
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,648
<i>It felt like pushing a wall.</i>

541
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,567
<i>Mongolia was strong.</i>

542
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,320
<i>Of course I was worried.</i>
<i>I knew we had to do something,</i>

543
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,822
<i>but I didn't know what to do.</i>

544
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,867
Should we?

545
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,076
Let's go on the count of three.

546
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,370
- Okay. Yes.
- All of us? Are you sure?

547
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,205
Maybe one of us should stay here
to keep hold.

548
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,459
No, no, no… All right, let's go at three.

549
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,918
- Okay.
- All three?

550
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,754
- Three seconds.
- Yes, in two, one…

551
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,380
- Go! Come on.
- Run!

552
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,758
- Go, go, go!
- Run!

553
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,848
Okay! Push it as far as you can!
Push, you guys!

554
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,518
Let's go!

555
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,896
I'll take this one.

556
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,898
- You sure? Okay.
- Go back. Help 'em out.

557
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,524
You too, Seung-yeon.

558
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,318
Wait, come here!

559
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,987
<i>I was keeping an eye</i>
<i>on Korea the whole time.</i>

560
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,617
<i>And even though they took the first lane,</i>
<i>we continued to follow our own plan.</i>

561
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,454
<i>Keeping our lead in the third lane,</i>
<i>and overtaking Korea in the second lane.</i>

562
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,707
Wait, come here!

563
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,461
This way! This way!

564
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,713
All right, ready? One, two, three.

565
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,507
- Push!
- Keep it up!

566
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,887
- One, two, three! One, two, three!
- Push! Push! Push!

567
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,389
- One, two.
- Push.

568
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,475
- Keep it up!
- One, two, three!

569
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,185
Farther, farther!

570
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:22,278
- Keep it up! Push!
- One, two, three! One, two, three!

571
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,576
One, two, three! One, two, three!

572
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,286
One, two, three!

573
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,123
- One, two, three!
- Seung-yeon. Hey! Seung-yeon!

574
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,625
- One, two, three!
- Can you go over there?

575
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,210
- One, two, three!
- Quickly!

576
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,878
- One, two, three!
- They're going to lane 3!

577
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,672
Run, Khanda! Run, run, run!

578
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,549
Run, run, run, run, run.

579
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:46,010
Hey, they're going to lane three!
Run, Khanda! Run, run, run!

580
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,679
Run, run, run, run, run.

581
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,055
Run, run, run.

582
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,100
- One, two, three!
- Let's go!

583
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,686
- Stay there!
- Stay there, Khanda!

584
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,896
One, two, three!

585
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,065
- One, two, three!
- How we doing, Eun-sil?

586
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,733
It's in our zone, push, push!

587
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,360
We're losing.

588
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,487
No, no, you need to stay there, all right?

589
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,864
We just need to push.

590
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,324
- Okay! One, two, push!
- All right!

591
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,911
- Keep going, okay? All right.
- One, two, three!

592
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,041
<i>Getting pushed</i>
<i>around like that really hurt my pride.</i>

593
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,587
<i>It kind of felt</i>
<i>like they were hunting us down.</i>

594
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,550
<i>By that point, it was clear</i>
<i>that our tactics weren't working.</i>

595
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,677
<i>And I started to question</i>

596
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,304
<i>whether or not we could</i>
<i>actually beat Mongolia.</i>

597
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,395
What do you think?
Should we ditch and go left?

598
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,521
Sure. Let's try it.

599
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,732
Okay, we're all gonna go left in a sec.
But wait, we have some time.

600
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,901
How 'bout now?

601
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,444
Hold on, just a sec.

602
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,738
Okay, get ready to move left.

603
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,239
Left, Min-jae.

604
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,824
- We'll go with Amotti, okay?
- Ready?

605
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,451
One, two, three! Go!

606
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,079
- Run! We need to block them!
- You two go!

607
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,418
One, two, three!

608
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,047
- One, two, three-
- Come help us!

609
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,883
One…

610
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,595
Come on, we're out of time!

611
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,263
<i>One minute.</i>

612
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,224
- One, two, three!
- Ugh!

613
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,809
One, two!

614
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,144
This isn't working…

615
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,688
Khanda! Run that way!

616
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,399
<i>We'd lose anyway if we leave it,</i>

617
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,525
<i>so let's just try it.</i>

618
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,779
Run!

619
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,656
One, two, three!

620
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,908
One, two, three!

621
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,119
Come here, Eun-sil!

622
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,245
Ready?

623
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,083
One, two, three! One, two, three!

624
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,418
Great job, team! We're almost there!

625
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,548
Let's go.

626
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,300
Oh, come on!

627
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,427
Push! Harder.

628
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,887
Everyone, here!

629
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,931
- Come over here!
- Help us!

630
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,227
- Seung-yeon, here.
- One, two, three!

631
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,812
- Your stance. Let me help you.
- One, two, three!

632
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,355
- Get lower.
- Yeah, get lower.

633
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,523
One, two, three!

634
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,406
Ah…

635
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,949
Just stay where you are.

636
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,326
We're so close…

637
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,423
- <i>Stop. The match has ended.</i>
- Man, they're strong…

638
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,259
<i>The winner of round one is Mongolia.</i>

639
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,344
All right!

640
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,762
- Nice job!
- You too.

641
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,389
We're stronger than them.

642
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,683
- Well done, yeah.
- I think we made the right call.

643
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,268
We did.

644
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,312
<i>We felt amazing,</i>
<i>we'd been able to overwhelm Korea.</i>

645
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,897
If we could do the same in round two,

646
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,983
we'd win this whole thing.

647
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,153
Everyone did great, but I think our MVP

648
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,487
<i>was definitely Adiya.</i>

649
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,406
<i>She really gave us an edge in there.</i>

650
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,324
One, two, three!

651
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,826
Oh man…

652
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,871
She's strong.
Their judoka just wouldn't budge.

653
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,375
Man, she's strong! What should we do?

654
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,835
I have no idea…

655
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,049
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

656
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,384
<i>I was completely out of ideas.</i>

657
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,927
Would anything work?

658
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,971
Are we just gonna lose again?

659
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,724
In that moment,
nothing seemed scarier than losing.

660
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,809
We need to win this round.

661
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,187
But the question is how?

662
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,105
We keep losing our ground.

663
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,274
<i>After that first round,</i>

664
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,902
everyone was down.
Morale was really, really low.

665
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,111
<i>We knew we had to do something,</i>

666
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,572
<i>but that was easier said than done.</i>

667
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,742
We just have to get the lead first.

668
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,203
I think they were struggling
to hold their ground.

669
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,662
That's why they kept pushing.

670
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,997
It was a good strategy,

671
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,540
and they were able to pull it off.

672
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,334
I'll take the far one.

673
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,252
I'll sprint over once we start.

674
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,588
All right, sounds good.
To the small one, right?

675
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,090
Yeah, and the rest of us go center.

676
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,801
Okay, okay. So we're split five and one.

677
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,346
Honestly, I think we started off well
in round one.

678
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,140
<i>But once Mongolia started</i>
<i>to move between lanes,</i>

679
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,433
<i>we lost our ground.</i>

680
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:06,145
<i>So as the fastest person on my team,</i>
<i>I thought I could function</i>

681
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,481
<i>as the designated lane hopper</i>
<i>and assist as needed.</i>

682
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,274
- As soon as we win this-
- It's over for them.

683
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,318
Plus, we won't have to do a third round.

684
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,112
I think we should do something similar.

685
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,905
Sound good? Two groups of three?

686
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,782
We can adjust as needed.

687
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,619
<i>We were pretty optimistic</i>
<i>going into round two.</i>

688
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:26,040
We started with an initial strategy,
and modified it based on Korea's actions.

689
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,461
<i>When they gathered in the center,</i>
<i>we gathered in the center.</i>

690
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,256
<i>When they split themselves up,</i>
<i>we split up as well.</i>

691
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,718
<i>Now that we've seen how they play,</i>
<i>it'll be easier to counter them.</i>

692
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:44,392
<i>Final Quest.</i>
<i>First game: the Wall-Pushing Match.</i>

693
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,355
<i>Round two will now begin.</i>

694
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,234
<i>Stand by.</i>

695
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,696
Get ready. Pay attention.

696
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,864
Be speedy.

697
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,284
<i>Ready.</i>

698
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,958
Come on, steady!

699
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,042
Lower.

700
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,670
There they go.

701
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,130
Get ready!

702
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,051
- Ready!
- One, two, three!

703
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,515
<i>In this game, it's much easier</i>
<i>to maintain a lead than it is to take one.</i>

704
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,144
<i>So if we moved</i>
<i>one block to the end of one lane,</i>

705
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,563
<i>and moved</i>
<i>the center block a little over halfway,</i>

706
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,773
<i>then all we had to do was hold our ground.</i>

707
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:38,738
One, two, three! Push! One, two, three!

708
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,365
One, two, three!

709
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,451
One, two, three!

710
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,119
One, two, three!

711
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,704
One, two, three!

712
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,164
Wait for that opening.

713
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,083
<i>With all of us working together,</i>

714
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,253
<i>little by little,</i>
<i>we kept advancing towards Korea.</i>

715
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,380
<i>And the farther we went,</i>
<i>the more convinced I was.</i>

716
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,299
We were going to win this challenge.

717
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,509
One, two, three!

718
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,470
One, two, three!

719
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:06,015
One, two, three! One, two, three!

720
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,475
One, two, three!

721
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,061
<i>We were trapped in the middle.</i>

722
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,021
<i>It was bad. I knew it was bad.</i>

723
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,606
One, two, three!

724
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,107
Wait for that opening.

725
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,026
Hold! Hold! Hold on!

726
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,153
- Ready!
- One, two, three!

727
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,780
All right! That's it!

728
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:24,242
One, two, three! One, two, three!

729
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,536
One, two, three! One, two, three!

730
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,747
One, two, three!

731
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,960
- Almost there!
- One, two.

732
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,544
One, two, three!

733
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,881
- One, two, three!
- Come on, team! Keep going!

734
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,467
One, two, three!

735
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,594
Let's do this! Three!

736
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,013
Let's wait 'til they're tired.

737
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,557
Way to go! We did it!

738
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,686
One, two, three! One, two, three!

739
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,562
- Should I slip out?
- Sure. I'll switch with you.

740
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,439
- I'll get low.
- I'll take the left side, okay?

741
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,233
Go for it.

742
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,071
- Go! Khanda!
- Hurry!

743
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,368
Ugh!

744
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,708
Nice block, Khanda!
Nice job! Just stay there!

745
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,793
Okay, just hold it. Good.

746
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,878
She can't push back.

747
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,673
Go and help her, Seung-yeon.

748
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,591
Ochir, run!

749
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,513
One, two, three! Come on, hold.

750
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,723
One two three!

751
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,934
One, two, three!
Here, like this. Get down.

752
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,067
- I should go.
- No, wait, hold on!

753
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,779
- There's three! Somebody go!
- Here. We can handle it. Go!

754
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,533
One, two, three!

755
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,994
- One, two, three!
- Ugh!

756
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,412
<i>I was fired up.</i>

757
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,124
<i>I could feel my blood boiling</i>
<i>with the desire to win.</i>

758
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,334
One, two, three!

759
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,794
<i>We were so close to victory.</i>

760
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,382
One, two, three! One, two, three!

761
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,594
- One, two, three!
- Even harder!

762
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,013
You've made it over!
Just hold your ground!

763
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,599
One, two, three!

764
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,225
One, two, three!

765
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,769
One, two, three!

766
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,020
Min-jae. Stance.

767
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,857
One, two, three! One, two, three!

768
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,319
One, two, three! One, two, three!

769
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,571
We're still losing here.

770
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,115
Let's go, you three! We can't lose!

771
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,408
We're close!

772
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,078
Let's try it again. More force, okay?

773
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,204
On my count.

774
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,207
<i>We were losing ground</i>
<i>and running out of time.</i>

775
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,084
<i>But we just had to keep going.</i>

776
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,044
Ready!

777
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,254
One, two, three! Push!

778
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,548
Nice job, you two. Let's go again.

779
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,968
<i>It was endless.</i>
<i>Step after step, they pushed back.</i>

780
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,262
<i>We were powerless.</i>

781
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,140
<i>Mongolia was unshakable.</i>

782
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,603
They're weaker now,

783
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,480
but they're watching our counting.

784
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,190
It'll be fine, we're doing great.

785
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,651
All right, Min-jae. Let's push.

786
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,111
One, two, three!

787
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,487
They still won't budge!

788
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,951
- One, two.
- Harder, Min-jae.

789
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,913
Just tell us when.

790
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,748
<i>We may have lost the first round,</i>

791
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,625
<i>but I learned something very important.</i>

792
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,545
<i>I knew how strong we could be</i>
<i>with Min-jae,</i>

793
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,505
<i>so I didn't know why we</i>
<i>were being overpowered.</i>

794
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:28,008
<i>That's when I realized that,</i>
<i>if we didn't all push at the same time,</i>

795
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,343
<i>the force wasn't as strong.</i>

796
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,637
<i>So I thought,</i>
<i>if we can all push in unison,</i>

797
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,139
<i>we could maybe overpower them.</i>

798
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,476
- We gotta push with Min-jae.
- Okay.

799
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,689
Hey Min-jae, you cue us in. On three.

800
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,482
One, two, three!

801
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,444
One, two, three!

802
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,697
One, two, three!

803
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,575
That's it! Keep pushing, keep pushing!

804
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,368
- Harder!
- Come on, guys! Push!

805
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,162
Keep pushing, keep pushing!

806
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,872
- Harder!
- Come on, guys! Push!

807
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,623
Okay, that's it! That's it!

808
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,253
Are we back on our side?

809
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,088
One, two, three!

810
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,008
Keep pushing, keep pushing!

811
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,968
Come on, guys! Push!

812
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,470
That's great! Now hold!

813
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,556
Hey, come on! Let's go! Come here!

814
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,099
Wait, you go over there.

815
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,728
- Come here! We need help!
- Hurry! Before they push back!

816
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,439
- Go, go! Go, go, go!
- Over here!

817
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,523
One, two, three!

818
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,859
- One, two, three!
- That's it! Three!

819
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,445
- One, two, three!
- Push!

820
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,946
- One, two, three!
- Push!

821
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,242
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>we lost control of the center lane.</i>

822
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,704
<i>Korea unleashed an offensive attack</i>
<i>and caught us all off-guard.</i>

823
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,498
<i>Not only had they overpowered us,</i>

824
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,875
<i>they did so</i>
<i>in the final minute of the game.</i>

825
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,878
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

826
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,255
- Again! One, two--
- Run to the small wall.

827
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,090
- What?
- That one.

828
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,551
- We need to push it. I'll tell you.
- When?

829
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:56,805
One, two, three, push!
Okay! One, two, three!

830
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,474
Go, Adiya! Go!

831
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:01,393
Go, go, go! Sung-bin, hurry! Go, go!

832
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,449
What's your call?

833
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,328
Okay, push. Dulguun! Go over!

834
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,330
- You too, Ochir! Come on! Push!
- Go back! Come on!

835
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,792
Run, Amotti! Go, go, go! Come on! Go!

836
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,210
Ten seconds!

837
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,837
Run, Amotti!

838
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,799
- Go, go, go! Come on!
- No, Sung-bin! Turn around!

839
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,936
One, two, three!

840
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,480
- Hold on, guys!
- Come on, hold!

841
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,690
Hold.

842
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,568
We did it!

843
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,819
- Yeah!
- <i>Stop.</i>

844
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,071
- We won, guys. Nice.
- <i>The match has ended.</i>

845
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,992
<i>The winner of round two is Korea.</i>

846
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,828
Hey, we're stronger! We're stronger!

847
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,538
- Killed it with that lead.
- You're good…

848
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,998
- …at the start.
- Gotta support Min-jae.

849
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,791
Yeah, you're right.

850
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,626
<i>I'd used up a lot of stamina.</i>

851
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,169
<i>So I was a little disoriented.</i>

852
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,754
But even though I was tired…

853
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,633
I was having fun.
Because we could take 'em on.

854
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,137
So I had to win this,
even if it killed me.

855
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,848
<i>I was going to mow them down</i>
<i>with those boxes.</i>

856
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,476
- They're not gonna miss a box.
- Right.

857
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,186
- I'll do it again. Yeah.
- You?

858
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,271
'Cause you're the fastest.

859
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,023
- Yeah, exactly.
- Okay, so if we're doing that,

860
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,317
then the rest of us go center.
Is that good?

861
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,611
<i>Now that we had a winning strategy,</i>

862
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,195
<i>Mongolia didn't stand a chance.</i>

863
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,656
<i>Sung-bin was already</i>
<i>the fastest one there,</i>

864
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,576
<i>but combined with Min-jae's strength</i>
<i>and everyone else,</i>

865
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,369
<i>we were unstoppable.</i>

866
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,537
We passed the line earlier.

867
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,913
- It was fast.
- We should've held.

868
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,333
I think they waited until we held.

869
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,336
Support like this.
And try to use your knees.

870
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,881
<i>Obviously, I wasn't happy that we lost.</i>

871
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,884
I think our biggest mistake
was our positioning.

872
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:01,472
<i>We tried to hold off Korea</i>
<i>by pushing back, but it didn't work.</i>

873
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,476
<i>After our defeat in the second round,</i>

874
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,478
<i>I knew we had to update our strategy.</i>

875
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,314
They were strongest as one unit,
so if we wanted to weaken them,

876
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,899
<i>we had to spread them thin.</i>

877
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,901
<i>Separated, they wouldn't stand a chance.</i>

878
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:20,449
<i>Final Quest. First game:</i>
<i>the Wall-Pushing Match.</i>

879
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,912
<i>Round three will begin</i>
<i>at the sound of the whistle.</i>

880
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,752
<i>Stand by.</i>

881
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,297
<i>Ready.</i>

882
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,218
Okay, let's push.

883
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,178
- Ram into it!
- All right, push.

884
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,222
Ram into it!

885
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,433
- Okay, let's push.
- All right, push, push.

886
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,441
All right, push, push.

887
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,069
- He's good over there.
- One, two. Push!

888
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,737
One, two. Push!

889
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,240
<i>My job was to isolate Sung-bin.</i>

890
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,660
<i>If I could keep him on the first lane,</i>
<i>he couldn't reinforce on the second.</i>

891
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:05,953
<i>But I couldn't do it alone.</i>

892
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,166
- Push!
- Orgil!

893
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,085
- One, two. Push!
- One, two, three.

894
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,963
One, two, push! One, two, push!

895
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:19,216
One, two, push! One, two, push!
One, two, push! One, two, push!

896
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,135
- Dong-hyun, there! Go!
- Hey, he's going! Sung-bin, run!

897
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,230
Keep going!

898
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,777
Push!

899
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,988
<i>All we had to do was hold our position.</i>

900
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,197
<i>That's how we'd win.</i>

901
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,367
- One, two. Push!
- Okay, guys. Hold!

902
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,786
- One, two. Push!
- Get ready to push. One, two.

903
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,581
One, two. Push!

904
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:54,543
<i>It was working. On lane one,</i>
<i>Sung-bin was maintaining our lead.</i>

905
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,838
<i>And in the center,</i>
<i>Min-jae kept Mongolia from advancing.</i>

906
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:02,009
<i>Playing defensively was very beneficial.</i>
<i>It gave us more insight.</i>

907
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,054
Hold it! Hold it! Hold on.

908
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,516
Okay? Hold, hold, hold!

909
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,394
I need backup!

910
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,229
Somebody help me! Hurry!

911
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,356
One, two, three! Good.

912
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,733
One, two, three.

913
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,276
- One, two, three.
- All right.

914
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,320
- I'll go. You can go, Eun-sil!
- No, I'll go.

915
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,280
- Go for it!
- You sure? I got it.

916
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,032
- Come here.
- Sorry.

917
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,492
Hey, no worries. You're good.

918
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,368
Push, push, push.

919
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,621
One, two, Sung-bin. One, two, push!

920
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,372
- One, two…
- One, two. Push!

921
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,457
One.

922
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,334
- Two. Got it!
- Assume the position and hold!

923
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,418
One. Two.

924
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,045
- Three.
- Assume the position.

925
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,923
Ready? One, two!

926
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,800
One, two.

927
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,926
One, two.

928
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,012
- Keep pushing!
- Okay.

929
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,348
Get low. Try to push back more, you two.

930
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,557
You're struggling.

931
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,809
Okay, okay.

932
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,519
- Hold, hold, hold.
- All right.

933
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,313
Hold. Let's push in sync with their chant.

934
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,981
- One, two. Push!
- Wait a minute.

935
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,691
No. We need to match with Min-jae.

936
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,776
Hold!

937
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,654
<i>When pushing,</i>
<i>you had to watch your timing.</i>

938
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,740
<i>And the best time to go on offense</i>
<i>was when they switched to defense.</i>

939
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,826
- Ready? Okay.
- Ready.

940
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,578
- One, two, three. Push! Good job.
- One, two, three.

941
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,331
- Okay. One, two, three!
- One, two. Push!

942
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,208
- One, two, three.
- Go lower!

943
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,793
- One, two. Push!
- One, two, three.

944
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,087
- One, two, three!
- Go lower!

945
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,463
One, two, three.

946
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,881
- Hey.
- One, two…

947
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:23,966
Come on!

948
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,426
- One, two…
- Come on!

949
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,012
- One, two, push! One, two--
- Come on.

950
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,097
- No, wait, let's hold.
- Okay.

951
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,058
How are they doing that?

952
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,227
Okay. One, two, three!

953
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,314
<i>How were they able to overpower us?</i>

954
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,400
<i>We were giving it everything we had.</i>

955
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,777
<i>But every time we took a step forward,</i>

956
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,320
<i>they pushed us two steps back.</i>

957
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,905
<i>We should've been stronger,</i>

958
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,158
<i>but Korea seemed to have</i>
<i>the technical skills to hold us off.</i>

959
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,911
One, two, push!

960
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,913
- One, two, heave!
- Hold, hold, hold!

961
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,290
- One, two--
- Wait!

962
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,749
- Sorry. What is it?
- We need to hold.

963
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,334
We need to push back.

964
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,711
Holding isn't working.

965
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,256
One, two!

966
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,175
Whoa, hold on! Sung-bin, lower!

967
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,512
Don't angle towards us, face forward!

968
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,892
- Get ready to push. One…
- Okay.

969
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,144
- Push farther! We're halfway done.
- One, two, three.

970
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,562
One, two…

971
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,771
Push!

972
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,901
Hey Min-jae,

973
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,944
let us know when you're ready. All right?

974
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,070
One, two.

975
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,238
- Push!
- Hold on.

976
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,323
One, two.

977
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,532
- Push!
- Hold on.

978
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,993
- All right, come on.
- One, two, three.

979
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,079
- One, two, three.
- Again.

980
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,958
Let's just wait. We can go
when we're ready. Min-jae?

981
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,877
- One, two, three.
- Again.

982
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,382
<i>When I glanced at our opponents,</i>

983
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,468
<i>they looked puzzled and worried.</i>

984
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,054
<i>That's when I knew they were done.</i>

985
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,515
Let's try again. One, two!

986
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,364
Keep holding, keep holding! Come on!

987
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,448
One, two.

988
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,785
Keep holding, keep holding! Come on!

989
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,620
<i>Suddenly, they pushed us again.</i>

990
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,039
<i>It was noticeably stronger</i>
<i>than what we'd felt before.</i>

991
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,249
<i>And that's when I realized</i>
<i>how powerful they were.</i>

992
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,086
- You good?
- Hold! Please, hold!

993
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,089
Dulguun! Leave that and come here!

994
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,466
Come help us! Somebody, anybody!

995
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,009
Wait, wait, wait!

996
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,721
<i>It looked like</i>
<i>the center lane was a lost cause.</i>

997
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,349
<i>That's why I asked them</i>
<i>to come help Khanda and I.</i>

998
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,981
Ready? One, two--

999
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,816
- Three! Run!
- Okay.

1000
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,275
- Okay.
- Run!

1001
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,240
I'll go too.

1002
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,702
I'll go too.

1003
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,370
- One, two.
- Two, three!

1004
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,958
Come on, Min-jae! Help us out!

1005
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,042
Push!

1006
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,711
One, two, push!

1007
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,796
One, two, three!

1008
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,298
- Come on. Ready?
- Harder! One!

1009
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,675
Minute thirty!

1010
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,385
Khanda, run back over.

1011
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,095
- You sure?
- Go on, go.

1012
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,596
Go, go, go! Push!

1013
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,058
You're doing great! That's it. Spread out!

1014
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,143
Two, three!

1015
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,731
Come here. Come on!

1016
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,108
Go! Hurry up! Go!

1017
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,194
Two, three, push!

1018
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,738
Go!

1019
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:33,905
- All right, push!
- Okay.

1020
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,574
One, two, three!

1021
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,286
- Push on three.
- All right.

1022
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,496
- One!
- Dong-hyun, we need you!

1023
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,123
One, two, three!

1024
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,755
Min-jae, let's hold!

1025
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,051
Push forward in one, two…

1026
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,135
<i>One minute.</i>

1027
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,056
One, two, three, push! Push!

1028
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,267
One, two, three, push! Push!

1029
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,977
One, two, three!

1030
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,062
Keep pushing, guys!

1031
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,354
One, two, three!

1032
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,690
- Keep pushing, guys!
- Again! One, two…

1033
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,400
Two! Three!

1034
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,527
One, two, three!

1035
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,864
<i>We were desperate,</i>
<i>and we were running out of time.</i>

1036
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:19,951
<i>So we returned to the center lane,</i>
<i>hoping we could take it for ourselves.</i>

1037
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,203
<i>And yet…</i>

1038
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,332
- No, no!
- One, two!

1039
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,625
Okay, we should push now.

1040
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,502
One, two, three!

1041
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,885
Finish 'em off!

1042
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,226
Okay!

1043
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,270
We just need to hold!

1044
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,523
- Hold!
- Twenty!

1045
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,650
Spread out.

1046
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,776
Go that way.

1047
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,487
Hey! Someone's coming!

1048
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,865
One more push! One, two, three.

1049
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:02,494
Come on!

1050
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,585
- One, two! Push!
- One, two!

1051
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,629
One, two, three!

1052
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:15,465
Three! Two! One!

1053
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,800
We did it!

1054
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,805
- <i>Stop. Game over.</i>
- Yeah!

1055
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:28,353
<i>The winner of round three is Korea.</i>

1056
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,730
Oh, man.

1057
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,317
- You killed it, great!
- Nice job.

1058
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,737
- Let's go! All right!
- Nice job, Min-jae.

1059
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,157
Sung-bin! Come on, get up here!

1060
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,908
You did it, man!

1061
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,202
Great job, Sung-bin.

1062
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,580
Seriously, man. I'm proud of you.

1063
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,582
Way to be the team sled!

1064
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,668
<i>That first game was exhausting.</i>

1065
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,379
My limbs felt like jelly.
I could hardly move my legs.

1066
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,840
<i>It was rough at first.</i>

1067
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,467
<i>But we managed to turn it around</i>
<i>by the end.</i>

1068
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,053
<i>So I was happy. We all were.</i>

1069
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,809
<i>Min-jae and Sung-bin</i>
<i>won us this game. Mongolia's strong.</i>

1070
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,645
<i>But those two made us stronger.</i>

1071
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,398
<i>One strong push from Min-jae,</i>
<i>and boom! That was it.</i>

1072
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,608
<i>They just crumbled.</i>

1073
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,068
<i>As expected from</i>
<i>The Strongest Man Under Heaven.</i>

1074
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,114
Wow. Now that…

1075
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,783
that was the strength of Korea.

1076
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,578
- Hey, it's okay. We're okay.
- We are fine.

1077
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,413
We did our best.

1078
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,998
- Yes, exactly.
- Hey.

1079
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,750
How did they do that so easily?

1080
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,212
<i>It's hard losing</i>
<i>when you think you can win.</i>

1081
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:39,007
We were too scattered
and didn't have enough strength.

1082
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,594
<i>But even though we lost</i>
<i>the first game, I'm not too worried.</i>

1083
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,846
<i>We still have two more games to go.</i>

1084
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,806
<i>We just need to focus.</i>

1085
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,975
<i>We can still win this competition.</i>

1086
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,863
Physical: Asia. <i>Final quest.</i>

1087
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:05,533
<i>Team Mongolia, since you were defeated</i>
<i>in the first game,</i>

1088
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,827
<i>you must now choose the second game.</i>

1089
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,038
<i>The remaining games are…</i>

1090
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,418
<i>the infinite tail tag match,</i>

1091
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,587
<i>and the Iron Ball Dragging Match.</i>

1092
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,263
All right.
Should we play tag, or drag the ball?

1093
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,226
What do you think they'll pick?

1094
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,270
Hopefully not tag.

1095
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,064
The last game proved that our team
was stronger than theirs

1096
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,191
so I was kind of hoping for the iron ball.

1097
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:42,112
But that would put them
at a disadvantage, right?

1098
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,697
So, I assumed they'd pick tag.

1099
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,033
We can't lose this.
We need to pick what we're good at.

1100
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,159
Right.

1101
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,622
Honestly,
I think if we pick the running game,

1102
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,082
they have a good chance of winning.

1103
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:57,919
Yeah, remember the treadmills?
When we were fighting for that map?

1104
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,923
<i>Before the fifth quest,</i>
<i>we'd done a mini running challenge.</i>

1105
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,551
<i>And Team Korea ended up beating us</i>
<i>by quite a bit.</i>

1106
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,970
<i>They were intense.</i>
<i>It was almost scary to see.</i>

1107
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,389
The iron ball is better.

1108
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,724
- That what we're going with?
- Hold on.

1109
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,142
I mean, that last game…

1110
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,477
they were clearly stronger.

1111
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,690
<i>We kind of</i>
<i>went back and forth for a while.</i>

1112
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,442
<i>But we had to play to our strengths.</i>

1113
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:24,446
<i>The time for deliberation</i>
<i>has come to an end.</i>

1114
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:30,118
<i>Captain of Team Mongolia,</i>
<i>Orkhonbayar Bayarsaikhan.</i>

1115
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,620
<i>Please reveal the game you have chosen.</i>

1116
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,415
Let's see.

1117
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,175
Our team has chosen
the Iron Ball Dragging Match.

1118
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:55,060
Our team has chosen
the Iron Ball Dragging Match.

1119
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,978
Wow.

1120
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,731
That's good for us. It works in our favor.

1121
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,734
<i>Sure, we could win.</i>
<i>But it wouldn't come easy.</i>

1122
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:05,487
I knew that weight class
and overall body weight

1123
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,780
would make a difference here.

1124
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:10,825
And comparatively speaking, their team
seemed to be a bit heavier than ours.

1125
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,660
I was worried about that.

1126
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,288
Strength is one thing.
But if you want to measure power,

1127
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,625
based on weight class,
I think Mongolia's got us beat there.

1128
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,211
It's gonna be tough.

1129
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,546
Strength test round two.

1130
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,756
Let's do it.

1131
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,175
We should do iron ball.

1132
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,219
Yeah, I think that's better.

1133
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,972
I mean, that last game
they were clearly stronger.

1134
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,682
I don't think they were stronger.

1135
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,643
They just had better tactics.

1136
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,853
We can win this. We're strong enough.

1137
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,273
I think that it's
not really fair to assume

1138
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,652
one team's stronger than the other
based on one game.

1139
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,655
And when it comes to sheer power,
I have no doubt we're the best.

1140
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,532
So I didn't feel discouraged at all.

1141
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:53,410
It's a power game.
So, if we managed to win here,

1142
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,370
we'd also be wearing them down.

1143
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,540
<i>And if we did that, we'd have a better</i>
<i>chance at winning game three.</i>

1144
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,041
Can't run fast when you're tired.

1145
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,753
Physical: Asia.

1146
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,714
<i>Final quest. The second game</i>

1147
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,300
<i>is the iron ball dragging match.</i>

1148
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,553
It's about to begin.

1149
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,097
This ends here, okay?

1150
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,432
As fast as we can.

1151
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,566
Okay, that looks like a wrecking ball.

1152
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,527
That looks heavy. Painfully heavy.

1153
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,281
<i>I wasn't sure how we'd hold the ropes.</i>

1154
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,909
<i>And just off to the side</i>
<i>you could see three more balls.</i>

1155
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:38,621
<i>I wasn't sure if all three</i>
<i>were gonna be used, or just one or two.</i>

1156
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,540
<i>In this game</i>

1157
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,041
<i>all six members of your team</i>

1158
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,587
<i>will be tethered to a large, iron ball.</i>

1159
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,382
<i>Your goal is to work together to reach</i>

1160
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,010
<i>and touch your team's designated flag.</i>

1161
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,473
Doesn't this kinda feel like
we're getting leashed like dogs?

1162
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,060
I see some wood planks.
Let's use them for leverage.

1163
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,481
<i>There are five footholds within each lane.</i>

1164
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,399
Two!

1165
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,193
Again.

1166
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,653
<i>You have three minutes</i>
<i>to complete your goal.</i>

1167
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,781
<i>If you do not reach the flag</i>
<i>within three minutes,</i>

1168
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,575
<i>you will fail the round.</i>

1169
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:20,079
<i>This game will consist of five rounds.</i>

1170
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,541
<i>Every round,</i>
<i>the weight will increase proportionally</i>

1171
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,377
<i>to the sum of each team's combined weight.</i>

1172
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,963
- Okay. So a fivefold increase?
- Yeah.

1173
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:33,760
So, as it turns out,
Korea actually has a weight average

1174
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,470
that's higher than ours.

1175
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:38,932
Which meant that they had to carry
more weight than us.

1176
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,017
<i>It was very advantageous.</i>

1177
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,114
<i>Starting with round one,</i>

1178
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,867
<i>each team will take turns</i>
<i>completing the challenge.</i>

1179
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,244
ORDER OF PLAY WAS DETERMINED
BY DRAWING LOTS

1180
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,579
<i>If both teams manage to pass,</i>

1181
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,499
<i>they will continue into the next round.</i>

1182
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,209
Okay, interesting.

1183
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,420
<i>If one team ends up failing,</i>

1184
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,964
<i>then the game will end,</i>

1185
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,967
<i>and the team that passed</i>
<i>will be declared the winner.</i>

1186
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,804
So if they fail, we gotta win that round.

1187
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,390
<i>If there is no determined winner,</i>

1188
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:23,977
<i>then both teams will compete in a final,</i>
<i>simultaneous round.</i>

1189
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,604
<i>The team that reaches the flag first</i>

1190
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,273
<i>will be declared the winner.</i>

1191
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,817
Uh.

1192
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,362
I think it's safe to say
that in the last game,

1193
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,948
we felt the might of Mongolia's warriors.

1194
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:39,826
But no matter how strong
our opponents are,

1195
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,494
Korea will face them head on.

1196
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,870
We'll continue to persevere

1197
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,123
as we've done throughout this competition,

1198
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,333
as that's the Korean spirit.

1199
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:51,337
And we will be victorious.
This right here, this second game,

1200
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,047
will also be the last game.

1201
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,259
We promise to keep things interesting.

1202
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,553
So don't let your guard down
for even a second.

1203
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,557
We've come too far to lose now.

1204
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,559
I will give it everything I've got.

1205
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,604
Physical: Asia.

1206
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,481
<i>Final quest, second game.</i>

1207
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,611
<i>The iron ball dragging match.</i>

1208
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,154
<i>Round one.</i>

1209
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,781
<i>Mongolia will go first.</i>

1210
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,117
Wait, why is their wrestler down there?

1211
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,327
- Not sure.
- Weird.

1212
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,579
I know, I've been trying to figure it out.

1213
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,832
<i>I assumed</i>
<i>that Orkhonbayar would be center.</i>

1214
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:28,958
<i>But instead,</i>

1215
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:32,378
<i>he was actually off to the side,</i>
<i>which was unexpected.</i>

1216
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,340
<i>They had Adiyasuren in the middle.</i>

1217
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,717
<i>And Dulguun was in the middle too.</i>

1218
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,219
<i>I wondered why Orkhonbayar</i>
<i>was off to the side.</i>

1219
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:44,515
It's because I'm the tallest.
I could reach the flag first.

1220
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:45,808
Here, do this.

1221
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,269
- Yeah, it's longer.
- Exactly.

1222
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,481
<i>Dulguun had a significantly</i>
<i>longer reach than the rest of us.</i>

1223
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,857
By putting him in the middle,

1224
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,734
we could reach the flag from further away.

1225
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,528
<i>Still, he was going to need</i>
<i>some extra support there,</i>

1226
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,614
<i>which is why Adiya and I</i>
<i>stood on either side of him.</i>

1227
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,324
<i>Whatever formation we made,</i>

1228
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:04,786
<i>our main goal was to distribute</i>
<i>the weight evenly on both sides.</i>

1229
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,624
Let's show 'em what we're made of.

1230
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,000
That's right. Go team!

1231
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,045
Let's watch.

1232
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,506
Let's see how they do this.

1233
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,091
<i>Stand by.</i>

1234
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:26,891
<i>Ready.</i>

1235
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,770
Remember, we have three whole minutes.

1236
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,692
No need to run.

1237
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,776
Light steps.

1238
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:37,860
No need to run.

1239
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,446
- Light steps. That's right.
- Slow and steady.

1240
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,365
Oh, they're slow.

1241
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,825
They're pacing themselves.

1242
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:44,909
Hmm.

1243
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:47,203
<i>The first round was gonna be the easiest.</i>

1244
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:49,205
<i>So we decided to take things slowly</i>

1245
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,165
<i>so we could get a feel</i>
<i>for what worked for us.</i>

1246
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:57,130
Careful.

1247
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,381
Slow and steady.

1248
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,759
- Careful.
- Slow and steady.

1249
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,846
<i>It wasn't that heavy.</i>

1250
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,806
<i>Turns out the first round was pretty easy.</i>

1251
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,185
Wow,
I barely even pulled and we still made it.

1252
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:13,896
<i>Stop. The round has ended.</i>

1253
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,022
It doesn't look too heavy.

1254
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,983
- At least for now.
- Yeah.

1255
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,276
It's lighter than it looks.

1256
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:21,237
<i>Mongolia. The Iron Ball Dragging Match.</i>

1257
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,906
<i>Round one. Success.</i>

1258
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,242
<i>Korea will be going second.</i>

1259
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,245
Hey,
we should all pace ourselves to start.

1260
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,955
It's a team effort, okay.

1261
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,373
Let's combine our strength.

1262
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,001
<i>In this kind of exercise,</i>
<i>you have to move in unison.</i>

1263
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,128
You don't want anyone to feel burdened,

1264
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,213
or like they're adding
to the overall weight.

1265
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,549
Let's see, what order should we go in?

1266
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,176
- Min-jae, here.
- Yeah, you go here.

1267
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,178
Stand in the center as our anchor.

1268
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:48,222
Then one person on each end
to even it out. Great.

1269
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,767
<i>Balancing our team was the hardest part.</i>

1270
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,478
We didn't want our force to disperse out
in a V shape.

1271
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:57,023
<i>So, to prevent that, we put our</i>
<i>strongest guys in the middle of the line.</i>

1272
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,193
<i>That way,</i>
<i>our force was always directed center.</i>

1273
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,070
We should
pay attention to their movements.

1274
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,906
They might have some cool techniques.

1275
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,576
Their ball is ten kilos more, right?

1276
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,412
<i>Stand by.</i>

1277
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,248
- All right, let's go.
- Feel it out.

1278
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,333
<i>Ready.</i>

1279
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,516
Oh, now I feel it.

1280
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,101
Okay. We're starting off easy.

1281
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,687
Uh, what? It was super light.

1282
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,940
<i>No wonder it looked so effortless,</i>

1283
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,024
<i>it just was.</i>

1284
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,902
<i>As we were watching</i>
<i>Korea in the first round,</i>

1285
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:46,155
<i>I noticed that they moved with</i>
<i>the same amount of ease as we did.</i>

1286
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,535
Okay. Here we go.

1287
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,747
- It's really light.
- Yeah, it is.

1288
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,999
<i>Stop. Success.</i>

1289
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,586
<i>Korea. Round one. Success.</i>

1290
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:10,012
<i>Round two.</i>

1291
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,806
<i>Team Mongolia.</i>

1292
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:17,103
- One, two.
- Left. Right.

1293
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,021
- Left. Right.
- Okay.

1294
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,481
<i>Even though it was heavier,</i>

1295
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:24,110
<i>the weight on the second round didn't</i>
<i>feel that different from the first round.</i>

1296
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,028
Left!

1297
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,905
<i>Mongolia. Success.</i>

1298
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,825
<i>Round two. Team Korea.</i>

1299
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,120
Come on, quickly, come on.

1300
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,124
Nice, this is also pretty light.

1301
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,918
Round two? Easy.

1302
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,253
Super easy.

1303
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,338
<i>Korea. Success.</i>

1304
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,717
<i>Iron Ball Dragging Match, round three.</i>

1305
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,093
<i>Team Mongolia.</i>

1306
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:52,847
- One, two.
- One, two.

1307
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,140
Bend forward.

1308
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,266
All together.

1309
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:56,976
- One…
- Okay, let's go.

1310
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,855
One, two. All right.

1311
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,027
They're so low to the ground.

1312
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,945
They're using gravity to help them out.

1313
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:11,198
<i>The third round</i>
<i>was when it started to feel heavier.</i>

1314
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,783
<i>To make it easier,</i>

1315
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:16,120
<i>I thought we could try crawling together</i>
<i>so that we didn't strain our backs.</i>

1316
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,039
We just gotta touch it!

1317
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,958
<i>Round three. Success.</i>

1318
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,336
We should lean forward too.

1319
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,462
Let's do it.

1320
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:25,755
<i>Round three.</i>

1321
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,965
<i>Team Korea, begin.</i>

1322
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,760
One, two.

1323
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:31,844
Here we go.

1324
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:32,929
Lean forward, guys.

1325
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:37,099
<i>If we didn't want to get hurt,</i>
<i>we had to lower our center of gravity.</i>

1326
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,310
One, two.

1327
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:40,645
Same method as us.

1328
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:41,854
Yep.

1329
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,814
- One, two.
- One, two.

1330
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,024
<i>It was still manageable,</i>

1331
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:48,152
<i>but I could tell that the next round</i>
<i>would be challenging.</i>

1332
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,236
Okay, grab it.

1333
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:52,073
<i>Round three, success.</i>

1334
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,533
<i>More weight will now be added.</i>

1335
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,828
Something tells me
it's about to get a lot heavier.

1336
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,455
Here we go.

1337
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:00,581
Wow, there's three.

1338
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,666
These last two rounds

1339
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:02,750
will be the hardest.

1340
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:04,669
This one's gonna be tough.

1341
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,379
<i>I was starting to get nervous.</i>

1342
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:08,297
<i>I wasn't sure how it'd feel.</i>

1343
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,925
<i>Given the amount of weight</i>
<i>we were dealing with,</i>

1344
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:13,970
<i>I figured it was going to be</i>
<i>a long and painful trip.</i>

1345
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,555
<i>Iron Ball Dragging Match. Round four.</i>

1346
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,224
<i>Team Mongolia.</i>

1347
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,310
Okay. As soon as we get to the boards,
let's go down.

1348
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,354
We should try to reach over our heads too,

1349
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,647
- like we're digging.
- Yeah.

1350
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,816
It's kind of like climbing a tree, right?

1351
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,484
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>Stand by.</i>

1352
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,992
Please fail.

1353
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,536
Once they fail, that's our opening.

1354
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:39,829
<i>Ready.</i>

1355
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,497
<i>I believe in my team.</i>

1356
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,541
<i>Together, we're capable of anything.</i>

1357
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,335
One, two, three.

1358
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,797
One, two, three. Get down.

1359
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,842
One, two.

1360
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,511
Keep going.

1361
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,389
<i>My stomach dropped.</i>

1362
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:03,310
<i>This, it wasn't just heavy,</i>
<i>it felt almost impossible to deal with.</i>

1363
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,478
- Come on.
- Hold on.

1364
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:05,771
- One, two.
- Okay, I'm good.

1365
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,231
One, two, three.

1366
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,733
It's too heavy.

1367
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:09,859
Not so light anymore.

1368
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:15,364
- Okay, one, two, three! Crawl.
- Ready, set, go.

1369
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,661
One, two, reach.

1370
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:21,787
- All right.
- One…

1371
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,206
All right. Come on.

1372
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,459
One. Two.

1373
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,419
<i>Round four was brutal.</i>

1374
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:32,048
<i>We were struggling to gain a foothold,</i>
<i>and moved painfully slow.</i>

1375
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,883
- Two.
- Come on.

1376
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:36,927
- One. Two. Reach!
- Shoot!

1377
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,220
They're almost there.

1378
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:39,805
Wow.

1379
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:44,435
- One, two.
- Almost!

1380
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,272
Try grabbing it.

1381
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:52,693
- One, two. Two. One.
- Stretch!

1382
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:56,489
<i>Because we were all bent</i>
<i>over, we couldn't coordinate our breathing</i>

1383
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,491
<i>which knocked us off-balance.</i>

1384
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,035
<i>We needed to combine our strength,</i>

1385
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:03,079
<i>so working in unison was crucial.</i>

1386
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,997
<i>But that's easier said than done.</i>

1387
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,124
Two, pull!

1388
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,584
Almost… Shoot!

1389
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,711
Almost… Shoot!

1390
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,463
Almost… Shoot!

1391
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,343
- Okay. One, two, three.
- Go.

1392
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,929
- Reach!
- Get it! That's it, right there.

1393
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,935
Got it.

1394
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,270
- <i>Success.</i>
- Twenty-nine seconds.

1395
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,022
It's only getting heavier.

1396
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:33,025
<i>Mongolia. Round four. Success.</i>

1397
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,574
I think it's harder
'cause we're not in sync.

1398
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,326
We need to fix that next time.

1399
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:43,410
We're not together.

1400
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:44,829
We gotta chant louder.

1401
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,164
- We should count together. Okay?
- We can't count separately.

1402
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:49,583
We should try to have a designated leader,

1403
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,252
or else it'll happen again.

1404
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,795
We can't be that scattered.

1405
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,421
One, two!

1406
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:55,673
On the beat.

1407
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,299
Chant exactly like that.

1408
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:58,884
And step together too.

1409
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,220
Everyone needs to move at the same pace.

1410
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:04,265
<i>Iron Ball Dragging Match, round four.</i>

1411
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:06,475
<i>Team Korea.</i>

1412
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,352
Let's do this. Stay together.

1413
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,354
<i>Stand by.</i>

1414
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:11,647
We should watch them.

1415
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,440
Yeah, let's see what they do.

1416
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:17,194
<i>I knew it was going to be just</i>
<i>as difficult for them as it was for us,</i>

1417
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:20,072
<i>so I was selfishly hoping</i>
<i>they'd manage to slip up.</i>

1418
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,198
<i>Ready.</i>

1419
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,451
<i>I tried to be in the moment</i>
<i>as much as possible.</i>

1420
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:27,454
<i>I didn't want to distract myself</i>
<i>or stress out.</i>

1421
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,789
Come on.

1422
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,083
Come on. Hook your foot here. Okay.

1423
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,294
Oh!

1424
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:35,171
One, two!

1425
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,133
One, two!

1426
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:42,136
One, two!

1427
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:43,888
One, two!

1428
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:44,972
Whoa.

1429
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:46,223
One, two!

1430
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:49,226
<i>My upper body lifted</i>
<i>a lot more than I anticipated.</i>

1431
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,479
<i>I kept trying to stabilize,</i>
<i>but it wasn't really working.</i>

1432
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,107
<i>It felt like</i>
<i>I couldn't properly apply my strength.</i>

1433
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,692
- One, two.
- Go lower.

1434
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,986
- I'm trying. One, two.
- Lower. One, two.

1435
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:03,365
One, two.

1436
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,534
<i>It was heavy.</i>

1437
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:09,496
<i>I kept myself as low as I could,</i>
<i>but I couldn't keep up.</i>

1438
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,708
- Use your foot to push off.
- Hook it under.

1439
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,543
- One, two.
- One.

1440
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,378
See how the two on the end are lagging?

1441
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:19,256
- Yeah, few of them seem to be struggling.
- Yeah.

1442
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,426
- One, two.
- One, two.

1443
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:25,137
- Use your foot to push off.
- Hook it under.

1444
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,097
One, two.

1445
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,850
<i>For our plan to work,</i>
<i>we had to move together.</i>

1446
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:33,020
<i>But, just like Mongolia,</i>
<i>we got a little out of sync.</i>

1447
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,064
- Grab it.
- One, two…

1448
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:37,107
- Reach!
- Grab it.

1449
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,193
- There.
- All right.

1450
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,653
Man, that's heavy.

1451
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:41,737
<i>Success.</i>

1452
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,113
I think we were faster.

1453
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:45,699
- By one second.
- Yeah.

1454
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,868
<i>Korea. Round four: success.</i>

1455
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,703
- Well, we appear to be evenly matched.
- Yeah.

1456
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,290
Man, you're kidding.

1457
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:57,294
I remember thinking,
"How? How did Mongolia do it?"

1458
01:10:57,378 --> 01:11:01,131
<i>I assumed they'd look as tired</i>
<i>as we did, but they looked fine.</i>

1459
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:03,634
<i>Mongolia was a real threat.</i>

1460
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,012
- We were too off-beat.
- Totally.

1461
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,431
We needed to stay in sync, but we didn't.

1462
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,600
We have to stay together
and move as a team.

1463
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,144
Man, that hurts…

1464
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,648
<i>After the fourth round,</i>
<i>my legs were really strained,</i>

1465
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:19,149
<i>especially my calves and hamstrings.</i>

1466
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:20,734
<i>I felt out of breath too.</i>

1467
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:24,029
But it wasn't over yet.
The worst was yet to come.

1468
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,657
<i>More weight will now be added.</i>

1469
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,202
All right, we've got four. This is it.

1470
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:33,706
<i>We knew the last round</i>
<i>would be the hardest.</i>

1471
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,916
<i>We had a plan, but</i>

1472
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,836
<i>whether or not we could</i>
<i>execute it remained to be seen.</i>

1473
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,462
<i>I was prepared for the worst.</i>

1474
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,757
<i>Could we do it? I genuinely didn't know.</i>

1475
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,636
<i>Iron Ball Dragging Match, round five.</i>

1476
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,513
<i>Team Mongolia.</i>

1477
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,849
Let's see this through. We got this!

1478
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:52,975
Okay, ready?

1479
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,101
<i>Stand by.</i>

1480
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,146
<i>Ready.</i>

1481
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,691
Don't run.

1482
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,611
- Ready?
- Hold on.

1483
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,489
- Ready?
- Hold on.

1484
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,450
- Ready?
- Go ahead.

1485
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:13,245
<i>It felt impossible.</i>

1486
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,748
<i>It felt like we were trying</i>
<i>to drag a mountain.</i>

1487
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,250
<i>No matter what I did, I couldn't move.</i>

1488
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:19,918
Okay, one, two!

1489
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:21,545
Come on.

1490
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:23,464
Come on.

1491
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,469
It's not easy.
I'm tired just watching them.

1492
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:31,305
One, two. Okay, good. It's up now.

1493
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,098
All right, all together now.

1494
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,683
One, two--

1495
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,101
Reach!

1496
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:39,980
One, two!

1497
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:42,024
- Together!
- Reach.

1498
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,485
One, two!

1499
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:46,612
Okay.

1500
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,197
- One, two!
- One, two!

1501
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,408
- Again.
- Okay.

1502
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,327
- One, two!
- One, two!

1503
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,040
<i>This time, we would combine</i>
<i>our strength and move as one.</i>

1504
01:12:58,123 --> 01:12:59,208
Two!

1505
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,210
<i>At the end of the day,</i>

1506
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,587
<i>winning the Iron Ball drag</i>
<i>would depend on two things.</i>

1507
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,799
<i>Better team cooperation,</i>
<i>and better utilization of momentum.</i>

1508
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,426
They're all chanting together, right?

1509
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:12,179
Let's do that as well the next time we go.

1510
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,807
<i>Even though we were struggling,</i>

1511
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,725
<i>I knew we could do it by working together.</i>

1512
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,479
One, two!

1513
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,982
- Wait! I've got it.
- Reach for it!

1514
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,068
Wait, wait. I need a sec.

1515
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:27,778
Okay, step off the plank.

1516
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:29,530
- Everyone step!
- Ready?

1517
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:33,742
One, two!

1518
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,537
- Reach for it! Come on!
- I can't.

1519
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,996
- Come on!
- I can't.

1520
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,791
Ready? One, two, three!

1521
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,629
- They're just out of reach.
- They're falling short at the end.

1522
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:48,757
<i>Without another</i>
<i>wooden plank in front of us,</i>

1523
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:49,967
<i>we couldn't move forward.</i>

1524
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:53,137
<i>The only way we could reach</i>
<i>the flag was if we propelled ourselves.</i>

1525
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,140
Dulguun! Use me as support!

1526
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,474
Grab it.

1527
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:00,144
We need to support the legs! Come on.

1528
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:01,478
Let's push from behind.

1529
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,856
- Come on. I've got you.
- We can do it, okay?

1530
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,899
One, two. Ready? Three!

1531
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,318
Two! Ready! Three!

1532
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,572
- You close?
- No.

1533
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:13,115
- Okay…
- Fifty-four seconds.

1534
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,244
<i>My mind was racing. Was this it for us?</i>

1535
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:19,204
- All together, now.
- Okay.

1536
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:22,040
- Let's go!
- One, two, three!

1537
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,296
- Again!
- Okay.

1538
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:30,883
- Ready?
- One! Two! Three!

1539
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,724
- Almost!
- Okay, one! Two!

1540
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:40,225
Three!

1541
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,566
We still have time.

1542
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:52,070
<i>Success. Mongolia. Round five: success.</i>

1543
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,280
- Wow.
- They did it.

1544
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:55,282
Just barely, too.

1545
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:01,038
Seeing just how hard they were working
made me realize how heavy ours would be.

1546
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:05,125
<i>Iron Ball Dragging Match,</i>
<i>round five. Team Korea.</i>

1547
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,962
So each foothold, we go "One, two!" Right?

1548
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:11,298
- On three. One, two, three!
- Count to three.

1549
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:14,676
Just try to keep in time with us.
Everyone should match Amotti.

1550
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,345
Steps and chanting.

1551
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,597
We're the center, Min-jae. It's all on us.

1552
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:20,933
<i>Stand by.</i>

1553
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,392
Ready? We can do it.

1554
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,978
- Steady. Don't psych yourselves out.
- <i>Ready.</i>

1555
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:29,358
Okay, let's take it slow.

1556
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:31,735
First foothold. Everyone down.

1557
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,571
Everyone down. Get ready to step.

1558
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:37,115
- One, two, three!
- Nice.

1559
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,035
- Hook your foot.
- Okay, one, two, three!

1560
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:41,453
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Good, good.

1561
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,871
One, two, three!

1562
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,581
Okay. It worked.

1563
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,458
- One, two, three!
- three!

1564
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,626
- Wait a sec.
- Hold on, guys.

1565
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,337
- It's okay. Wait a sec.
- Hold on, guys.

1566
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,047
- Got it.
- Please slip.

1567
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,341
Please.

1568
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,468
- Wait a sec.
- Hold on, guys.

1569
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,136
<i>I felt pretty helpless out there.</i>

1570
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:01,682
<i>It was hard to control my body</i>
<i>so I couldn't really use my strength.</i>

1571
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,685
- Oh, come on…
- Okay, one, two--

1572
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:07,271
<i>In Round Five it was absurdly heavy.</i>

1573
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:10,816
<i>I had a hard time staying on the ground.</i>
<i>It kept pulling me up.</i>

1574
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,610
It was hard. But as long
as we had Min-jae,

1575
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,820
we were going to win.

1576
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,864
<i>Our new strategy was</i>
<i>to follow Min-jae's lead.</i>

1577
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:21,034
<i>He'd tell us when he was ready,</i>
<i>and then he'd cue us in.</i>

1578
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,327
All right. You ready?

1579
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,371
One, two, three!

1580
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:26,206
- Okay.
- Okay.

1581
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,291
Three!

1582
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,792
- Okay.
- Okay.

1583
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,086
- There they go.
- They're moving.

1584
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,171
One, two, three.

1585
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,592
There, much easier. Keep going, Min-jae.

1586
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,093
One, two, three!

1587
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:41,305
- Good!
- Let's go again.

1588
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:44,224
- Ready?
- One, two, three!

1589
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,185
- Great.
- Okay, hook, hook!

1590
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,353
Come on…

1591
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,063
<i>Every time I went to grab the next plank,</i>

1592
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,190
<i>it was always just out of reach.</i>

1593
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,610
<i>And then…</i>

1594
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:55,694
Don't float up.

1595
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,571
<i>Sung-bin actually grabbed my wrist.</i>

1596
01:16:57,654 --> 01:16:59,573
One, two, three.

1597
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,325
- Okay.
- Got it.

1598
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,162
I've got it.

1599
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:07,122
One, two three.

1600
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:09,166
Dig your foot in.

1601
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,294
<i>Then suddenly,</i>
<i>I felt my strength dwindling.</i>

1602
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,549
<i>It felt off. Something was wrong.</i>

1603
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,135
<i>Our strength wasn't unified.</i>
<i>We were all scattered.</i>

1604
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:24,014
Min-jae, your feet. Hook your feet.
It's fine, you can do it.

1605
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:25,807
Hook your feet. Come on.

1606
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,142
- Hold on…
- Just dig them into the sand.

1607
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:29,770
It's my legs.

1608
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,522
<i>I slipped when reaching</i>
<i>for the next plank.</i>

1609
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,984
One, two, three.

1610
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,071
<i>I had no foothold, so I just laid there,</i>

1611
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,865
<i>holding onto the plank</i>
<i>so I didn't get dragged away.</i>

1612
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:43,700
One, two, three.

1613
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:47,412
Watch your feet,
Min-jae. Okay? Watch your feet.

1614
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,997
Yeah, hook 'em, hook 'em.

1615
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,123
Wait…

1616
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:54,586
<i>I kept trying to fix my foot,</i>
<i>but every time I moved, I floated up.</i>

1617
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,963
- I'm sorry. I just…
- We'll help you. Are you ready?

1618
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,882
- Let's try to pull him forward.
- One, two, three!

1619
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:00,342
- Okay.
- Okay.

1620
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,511
- You got it? Great.
- Yeah.

1621
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,600
Yeah, that's the part
that nearly did us in. There.

1622
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,686
- That stretch?
- Yep.

1623
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:13,563
One, two, three!

1624
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:15,482
One, two, three!

1625
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:16,775
Okay.

1626
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:20,362
- You gotta pull as much as you can.
- Yeah.

1627
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:23,949
Min-jae, bury your feet.
You gotta fix your feet.

1628
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,493
Come on, you got it.

1629
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:27,619
- Let's go.
- Ready?

1630
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:28,995
One, two, three!

1631
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,831
Okay! Got it.

1632
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:34,584
Almost there.

1633
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,087
- One, two, three!
- Come on!

1634
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,798
One, two, three!

1635
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,049
- Go!
- Almost!

1636
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,259
- One more, guys.
- Let's do it.

1637
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:44,553
One, two, three!

1638
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,098
Shoot.

1639
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:49,182
They're getting close.

1640
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,517
Less than a minute left.

1641
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:53,478
- Let's give it another go.
- Yeah. We've got it.

1642
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,689
One, two, three!

1643
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,399
Reach!

1644
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:03,405
All right, we did it!

1645
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,031
It's still the same.

1646
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:06,283
Same time?

1647
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:10,537
- We're tied.
- Thirty-five!

1648
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:11,621
Thirty-five exactly.

1649
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:14,332
<i>Korea. Round five, success.</i>

1650
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,417
Thirty-five.

1651
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,627
- Got it.
- All right, we did it!

1652
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:19,796
- Okay.
- Yeah,

1653
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,881
thirty five seconds left.

1654
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:23,675
- It took a while, didn't it?
- Hmm.

1655
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,927
<i>I thought we would be faster,</i>

1656
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:27,304
<i>but we weren't.</i>

1657
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:29,222
<i>That was the moment when I realized</i>

1658
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:31,266
<i>just how close the competition was.</i>

1659
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:36,354
<i>After the first game, I got the impression</i>
<i>that we were stronger than Mongolia.</i>

1660
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:40,650
<i>But their performance</i>
<i>in the second game proved me wrong.</i>

1661
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:43,653
If we're not careful,

1662
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,530
they're gonna snatch the win from us.

1663
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:49,075
<i>At that point, neither team</i>
<i>seemed to be better than the other.</i>

1664
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:52,704
<i>It was anyone's game, which meant</i>
<i>the final round would be intense.</i>

1665
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,456
So it's whoever gets there the fastest?

1666
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:55,832
Yep, first one there wins.

1667
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,251
It'll be hard, but since it was 35-35,

1668
01:19:58,335 --> 01:19:59,878
we really need to push our speed.

1669
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:00,962
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

1670
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,547
Now's the time to start running.

1671
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,257
One second can make a difference.

1672
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:06,384
We need to go faster.

1673
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,596
- So, every time we start to lift…
- Yeah?

1674
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,224
- Push as hard as you can.
- Right, okay, push.

1675
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:13,892
Min-jae, this time

1676
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,977
don't lay down like this, okay?

1677
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:17,229
It makes it harder.

1678
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,106
From that position, you have no leverage.

1679
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,650
You wanna be a bit lifted.

1680
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:23,902
You were just using your arms.

1681
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,695
- Yeah, 'cause my feet slipped.
- Right.

1682
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:27,948
All right, so, if that happens again…

1683
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:30,158
- Uh-huh? Okay.
- …you gotta dig your feet in.

1684
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,494
<i>I slipped up a lot in round five.</i>

1685
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:35,413
I got kind of paranoid.
I didn't wanna mess up.

1686
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:38,959
<i>So to calm myself, I tried to focus</i>
<i>on my hand and foot placements.</i>

1687
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,045
<i>Mongolia.</i>

1688
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:43,880
<i>Korea.</i>

1689
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:46,007
<i>Since no winner was decided,</i>

1690
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,301
<i>we will proceed to a tiebreaker round.</i>

1691
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,136
It all comes down to this.

1692
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,763
<i>In this final round,</i>

1693
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,140
<i>both teams will start simultaneously.</i>

1694
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:57,394
<i>The team that reaches the flag first</i>
<i>will be declared the winner.</i>

1695
01:20:57,894 --> 01:21:02,440
<i>The weight you will be pulling is the</i>
<i>same amount you had in the fifth round.</i>

1696
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,027
It'll be close.

1697
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,696
We gotta be fast.

1698
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:09,364
We gotta win this tiebreaker.

1699
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:10,782
Take this for ourselves.

1700
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:13,702
<i>This was Mongolia's last hope,</i>

1701
01:21:13,785 --> 01:21:15,412
<i>and we were going to snuff it out</i>

1702
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:17,205
<i>and crush them where they stood.</i>

1703
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,124
<i>We're not playing a third game.</i>

1704
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,126
<i>We were going to end it here.</i>

1705
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,253
- Korea!
- Fight on!

1706
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:26,381
If we won the second game,

1707
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:28,216
then we'd be tied with Korea.

1708
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,927
<i>That's why we were so determined</i>
<i>to beat them.</i>

1709
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:33,013
<i>Everything had come down to this.</i>

1710
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:35,223
<i>I want Mongolia to win.</i>

1711
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:37,309
- Warriors!
- Mount up!

1712
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,479
- All right.
- Don't get distracted.

1713
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:42,939
Let's go!

1714
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:45,775
<i>Stand by.</i>

1715
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:47,569
This is the end.

1716
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:49,404
- At first, remember to run.
- Got it.

1717
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:50,572
<i>Ready.</i>

1718
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:54,743
<i>We are Mongolian warriors. We'd be faster.</i>

1719
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:58,663
<i>We're gonna move fast</i>
<i>and put an end to this.</i>

1720
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,352
<i>Our plan was to run to the first foothold,</i>

1721
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,813
<i>lower our stances,</i>
<i>and push ourselves forward.</i>

1722
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:25,774
One, two, three!

1723
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:28,860
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

1724
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,156
<i>We kept it simple.</i>
<i>Sprint to the first plank,</i>

1725
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:35,909
<i>stop, drop, and use that momentum</i>
<i>to propel ahead.</i>

1726
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,166
<i>I tried to fall forward.</i>

1727
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:45,126
<i>But somehow, I got pulled back.</i>

1728
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:50,799
It's okay, just get up.

1729
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:52,217
Okay, one, two.

1730
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,302
<i>While everyone else pulled ahead,</i>

1731
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,596
<i>I tried to quickly fix my position.</i>

1732
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,682
Okay, close. Grab the plank.

1733
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:00,684
One, two, three!

1734
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:02,686
- Got it!
- All right!

1735
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,229
Nice.

1736
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:05,689
<i>When I looked over at Korea,</i>

1737
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:08,108
<i>I noticed that we were</i>
<i>basically parallel to each other.</i>

1738
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:09,401
<i>It was neck-and-neck.</i>

1739
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:11,444
- You got it?
- Ready?

1740
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:12,946
Everybody hold on. Adiya.

1741
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:14,531
One, two, three!

1742
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:16,658
- That's it!
- Okay. One!

1743
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:18,201
Two! Three!

1744
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:20,745
- Again!
- One, two, three!

1745
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,038
- There we go!
- That's it.

1746
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:25,875
One, two, three!

1747
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,836
Reach. One, two, three!

1748
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:30,922
One, two, three!

1749
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,216
<i>That was the moment it finally clicked.</i>

1750
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:36,052
<i>After trying and failing to stay in sync,</i>

1751
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,430
<i>we finally figured out</i>
<i>how to move as one unit.</i>

1752
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,639
One, two, three.

1753
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:41,516
One, two, three.

1754
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:44,686
<i>As soon as I felt myself rising,</i>

1755
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:47,397
<i>I was able to anchor myself</i>
<i>with my hands and feet.</i>

1756
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,982
One, two, three!

1757
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:51,109
- Reach. One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

1758
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:52,861
One, two, three!

1759
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:57,157
One, two, three!

1760
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,700
One, two, three!

1761
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,829
One, two, three!

1762
01:24:03,913 --> 01:24:05,790
- One, two.
- Three!

1763
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:08,626
- We're good.
- Use your feet.

1764
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:09,794
One! Two!

1765
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,004
Three!

1766
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:12,797
One! Two! Three!

1767
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,800
<i>I planned on using</i>
<i>every last ounce of strength.</i>

1768
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,219
<i>I would keep fighting</i>
<i>till my body collapsed.</i>

1769
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:22,515
One, two, three!

1770
01:24:23,349 --> 01:24:25,602
<i>We were close. So close.</i>
<i>It was right there.</i>

1771
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:27,979
<i>Everything we'd been fighting for</i>

1772
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,814
<i>was just out of arm's reach.</i>

1773
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,400
<i>It was grueling, and we were desperate.</i>

1774
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,902
<i>We wanted to win.</i>

1775
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:36,780
One, two, three!

1776
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:38,656
- Almost!
- One, two, three!

1777
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,366
- One, two, three!
- Come on, guys!

1778
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,702
Come on!

1779
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,079
One, two, three!

1780
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,206
One, two, three!

1781
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:47,665
One, two, three!

1782
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:48,792
Come on, grab it!

1783
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:08,978
That's it?

1784
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,271
All right.

1785
01:25:12,982 --> 01:25:14,692
Man, they were fast!

1786
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:17,695
<i>Game over.</i>

1787
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:26,746
<i>The winner is Korea.</i>

1788
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,958
- We won!
- Yeah!

1789
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:38,091
No way!

1790
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:41,427
Because of the weight,
I just kind of fell backwards.

1791
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:43,763
Man, I was… I was so happy.

1792
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,143
<i>All our wires got tangled together,</i>

1793
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:50,436
<i>and we flew back, laughing like kids.</i>

1794
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:52,438
<i>And as I looked around, I thought…</i>

1795
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:54,649
<i>"We actually did it."</i>

1796
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,861
<i>It was like a dream.</i>

1797
01:25:58,444 --> 01:26:00,780
I don't know what else to say.
I'm just kind of over the moon.

1798
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,157
How I feel?

1799
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,701
We actually won, we took first place!

1800
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:06,369
I can't believe it.

1801
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:08,663
I think we did pretty well.

1802
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:10,248
- Better than before, right?
- For sure.

1803
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:12,792
Much better.

1804
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,502
That's what's important, right?

1805
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,381
<i>Team Korea is amazing.</i>
<i>They really surprised me.</i>

1806
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:21,009
<i>I still don't know</i>
<i>how they got there that fast.</i>

1807
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:23,428
<i>I actually checked</i>
<i>the clock when I heard the whistle.</i>

1808
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,346
<i>And it only took them one minute.</i>

1809
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:29,684
Looking back on it, I do think
I underestimated Korea just a bit.

1810
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:32,312
<i>They were really strong,</i>
<i>it was undeniable.</i>

1811
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:35,440
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it's always somewhat disappointing.</i>

1812
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:38,067
<i>But I was still so proud of my team.</i>

1813
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:41,404
<i>Even though we didn't win,</i>
<i>I didn't have any regrets.</i>

1814
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:45,241
<i>We got all the way to the finals,</i>
<i>and we fought until the very end.</i>

1815
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,369
Chin up, guys.

1816
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:49,662
We made it far, team.

1817
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:51,080
- We did a great job.
- Yeah.

1818
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:55,043
Physical: Asia.

1819
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:58,254
<i>The winner of </i>Physical: Asia

1820
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,798
<i>is Team Korea.</i>

1821
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,803
Ah! I can't believe it.

1822
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,972
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1823
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:10,975
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1824
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,268
- You guys amazing.
- Thank you.

1825
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:13,978
- You guys amazing.
- Thank you.

1826
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:16,147
Well done.

1827
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:20,902
<i>Kim Dong-hyun,</i>
<i>as the Captain of Team Korea,</i>

1828
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:23,655
<i>please share your final thoughts with us.</i>

1829
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:26,366
Uh.

1830
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:31,287
First of all, I'm still in shock.

1831
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:35,500
Halfway through the competition,
I wasn't sure if we'd survive.

1832
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,627
So it's amazing to see how far we've come.

1833
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:38,795
But winning today

1834
01:27:40,129 --> 01:27:44,133
wouldn't have meant nearly as much
without a worthy opponent.

1835
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:47,887
Team Mongolia is a formidable team
of incredible athletes.

1836
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:49,597
They really kept us on our toes.

1837
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,642
So I want to thank them
for such a memorable final.

1838
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:55,645
I'm so grateful for my team.
And as captain,

1839
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:58,022
honestly, I'm just so happy.

1840
01:28:07,573 --> 01:28:09,075
I still can't believe it.

1841
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:12,287
<i>Orkhonbayar Bayarsaikhan.</i>

1842
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:16,541
<i>As the Captain of Team Mongolia, please,</i>

1843
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:19,085
<i>share your final thoughts with us.</i>

1844
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:22,338
From the start of the competition

1845
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:23,464
to its end,

1846
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,341
our only goal was to win.

1847
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:27,885
And although we didn't achieve that goal,

1848
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:30,638
we made great connections, learned a lot,

1849
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:33,308
and got to be a part
of an incredible competition.

1850
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:39,897
Thank you.

1851
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,076
<i>Even though we had lost,</i>

1852
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,747
<i>I noticed that the Mongolian flag</i>
<i>was still standing.</i>

1853
01:28:57,248 --> 01:28:58,875
<i>And when I saw that,</i>

1854
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:01,377
<i>I approached to pay my respects.</i>

1855
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,600
Look at it go, still flying high.

1856
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:16,893
- Right.
- It is, huh?

1857
01:29:16,976 --> 01:29:18,811
Guess it's nice we didn't knock it over.

1858
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,956
Physical: Asia.

1859
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:45,963
<i>This concludes the final quest.</i>

1860
01:29:48,132 --> 01:29:51,803
<i>Mongolia, you have been eliminated</i>
<i>from </i>Physical: Asia<i>.</i>

1861
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:54,972
<i>Please share your final thoughts.</i>

1862
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,351
<i>And then destroy your torsos.</i>

1863
01:29:59,852 --> 01:30:01,729
First, before anything else,

1864
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:03,815
I'd like to congratulate Korea.

1865
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,364
And I'd like to thank my teammates
for being here with me.

1866
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:17,286
I'm grateful I get to leave
with no regrets.

1867
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,580
We competed as best we could.

1868
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:21,916
And as captain, I'm proud of our team.

1869
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:25,253
As a team, Korea's incredibly strong,

1870
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:27,213
more so than I gave them credit for.

1871
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:30,258
So I'd like to thank them
for challenging us,

1872
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:33,052
and helping us realize that we need
to be stronger than we currently are.

1873
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:35,721
We fought as warriors, bravely,
with all our might.

1874
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:38,808
That's all we could hope to accomplish.
So I'm satisfied.

1875
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,443
To our Captain,
who was always cheering us on,

1876
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,653
and who always had confidence in me…

1877
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,669
<i>When I first arrived here,</i>

1878
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:09,922
<i>I remember walking in and looking around</i>

1879
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:12,550
<i>at all the other athletes in that room.</i>

1880
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:13,676
<i>And I remember thinking,</i>

1881
01:31:13,759 --> 01:31:15,720
<i>"I don't know if I'm really that strong."</i>

1882
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,389
<i>But even so,</i>

1883
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:22,602
I don't think I ever really felt scared,
or ever worried about losing.

1884
01:31:22,685 --> 01:31:24,353
Because I had faith in my team.

1885
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:25,480
- Orgil.
- Yeah?

1886
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:27,106
I think we can actually win this!

1887
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,316
Yeah, we can.

1888
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:30,276
<i>That's why I fought as hard as I did,</i>

1889
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:31,736
<i>I wanted to make them proud.</i>

1890
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,446
Way to go!

1891
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:35,865
<i>And that made me realize</i>
<i>what I was capable of.</i>

1892
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:38,284
- Keep it up.
- Great job, nice and easy.

1893
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:41,120
<i>In the end</i>
<i>I've realized how strong I actually am,</i>

1894
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:43,122
and how strong a judoka can be.

1895
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:49,879
<i>And I'm honored</i>
<i>to have represented Mongolia.</i>

1896
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:54,592
It's been an honor to compete here

1897
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,803
as a representative of Mongolia
and our circus arts.

1898
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:01,432
For the past ten years or so, I've
been trying to answer this one question.

1899
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:05,228
<i>What other things can I do</i>
<i>as a professional acrobat?</i>

1900
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:07,021
<i>And I couldn't figure it out.</i>

1901
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:12,485
<i>What can I do with this physicality,</i>
<i>these skills, this endurance?</i>

1902
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,073
<i>And what else could I be capable of?</i>

1903
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:23,996
But being here,
being a part of <i>Physical: Asia</i>,

1904
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,498
<i>has given me the opportunity</i>

1905
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,333
<i>to really explore that question.</i>

1906
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:28,417
And because of that,

1907
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:31,587
I think this has become
an important turning point in my life.

1908
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:36,342
I'll see you soon, buddy.

1909
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:40,680
<i>I don't feel discouraged,</i>

1910
01:32:40,763 --> 01:32:42,098
<i>and I don't plan on stopping.</i>

1911
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:44,308
I'm gonna work harder.

1912
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:45,935
<i>I promise.</i>

1913
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:51,774
Of course I'm crying.

1914
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:55,570
One thing I've realized while being here,

1915
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:56,654
hmm,

1916
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,115
is that you don't have to be perfect

1917
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:01,576
or successful at everything you do.

1918
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,828
One! Two! Three!

1919
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:10,001
<i>More often than not,</i>
<i>it's actually the act of doing something.</i>

1920
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:12,628
<i>How it makes you feel.</i>

1921
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:16,799
<i>What you learn from it.</i>

1922
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:20,553
<i>The kind of friends that you make.</i>

1923
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:23,222
One, two, three!

1924
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:26,726
<i>And the memories you create,</i>
<i>that ends up mattering more…</i>

1925
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:28,144
You did so well!

1926
01:33:28,227 --> 01:33:29,979
<i>…than getting the result you wanted.</i>

1927
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:33,733
To everyone at home,
I hope we've made you proud,

1928
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:36,569
<i>and that you've felt a sense of joy</i>
<i>in watching us.</i>

1929
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:40,072
<i>And for everyone who has supported us,</i>
<i>and continues to support us,</i>

1930
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:42,241
I just want to take a moment to thank you.

1931
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:44,452
Watch me do this.

1932
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:08,851
<i>Korea,</i>

1933
01:34:08,934 --> 01:34:13,064
<i>as the winners of </i>Physical: Asia<i>,</i>
<i>please share your final thoughts.</i>

1934
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:15,775
I was an MMA fighter for about 20 years.

1935
01:34:16,567 --> 01:34:20,154
And throughout all those years,
the championship belts,

1936
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:23,449
all those gold medals,
they were always out of reach.

1937
01:34:23,532 --> 01:34:26,577
Maybe I was unlucky,
or maybe I just wasn't good enough.

1938
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,163
I used to beat myself up for it
all the time.

1939
01:34:29,246 --> 01:34:32,583
But winning <i>Physical: Asia</i>
on behalf of Korea with this team

1940
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:37,254
means more than any medal
or belt I could've won on my own.

1941
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,423
This is truly the honor of my career.

1942
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:40,883
I'm just so grateful.

1943
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:45,137
Man, I just…

1944
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:49,225
I guess the tears are finally coming now.

1945
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:52,812
Ah, man.

1946
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:59,276
For me,
it wasn't about any specific moment.

1947
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,196
It's about our whole team,
every step of the way.

1948
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:06,492
Korea!

1949
01:35:06,575 --> 01:35:08,160
- Korea!
- Korea!

1950
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:09,370
Fight on!

1951
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:16,252
- Get down, guys. Huddle.
- Get in.

1952
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:18,337
<i>I don't feel very strong on my own.</i>

1953
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:19,964
One, two, three!

1954
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:22,383
<i>But I feel strong with this team.</i>

1955
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:27,138
<i>Being together gives us all strength.</i>

1956
01:35:27,763 --> 01:35:29,598
- Korea!
- Fight on!

1957
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:32,017
Ultimately,

1958
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:34,437
I think we managed to win

1959
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,939
because we worked together as a team.

1960
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:39,984
<i>Through every high, and every low.</i>

1961
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:43,696
One, two, three!

1962
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:45,781
<i>The six of us</i>
<i>were together through it all.</i>

1963
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:48,826
We can do this.
It all comes down to willpower.

1964
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:50,953
<i>Through each and every step of the way,</i>

1965
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,206
<i>I felt myself grow stronger.</i>

1966
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:58,627
In the middle of the third quest
when I did the rings challenge,

1967
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:00,838
I was really, really struggling.

1968
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:04,800
Obviously, I struggled physically,
but even more so mentally.

1969
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:10,139
<i>I think that was probably my lowest point.</i>

1970
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:12,516
<i>I just felt completely inadequate.</i>

1971
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,643
- I'm so sorry.
- You did great.

1972
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:16,479
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you dare apologize.

1973
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:17,938
You worked hard and did your best.

1974
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:22,735
In spite of everything,
my team continued to support me.

1975
01:36:22,818 --> 01:36:25,488
Even when I felt like giving up,
they never did.

1976
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,406
And it's because they never gave up on me

1977
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:30,451
that I was able to become even stronger
than I was before.

1978
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,499
Min-jae. That was great.

1979
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:38,918
Hey, Min-jae. That was amazing.

1980
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:41,170
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't you dare. You did great.

1981
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:43,547
<i>I feel like I've learned</i>
<i>a lot of life lessons.</i>

1982
01:36:44,423 --> 01:36:47,676
Honestly, I don't know what else
to say except thank you.

1983
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:49,845
Just a bit more!

1984
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:52,097
<i>I've definitely learned to never give up.</i>

1985
01:36:55,267 --> 01:36:58,395
<i>But I also learned</i>
<i>what it means to do my best.</i>

1986
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:01,482
Let's go!

1987
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:02,691
Great job!

1988
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:08,280
I guess I'm trading one sand pit
for another.

1989
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:11,408
But my memories
from the <i>Physical: Asia </i>arenas

1990
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:14,745
are memories that I'll never forget.

1991
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:18,207
At the end of season two,
this joy of victory

1992
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,544
was something I experienced
just by myself.

1993
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:24,463
But today I get to share that joy

1994
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:26,340
with my incredible teammates here.

1995
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:28,467
And that feels special.

1996
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:31,178
We did it!

1997
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:49,989
<i>Today's victory feels extra special.</i>

1998
01:37:51,323 --> 01:37:53,033
<i>Having fought long and hard together,</i>

1999
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:56,078
<i>and having won together,</i>

2000
01:37:56,161 --> 01:37:57,246
<i>it feels indescribable.</i>

2001
01:37:58,122 --> 01:37:59,123
Korea!

2002
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:00,833
Fight on!

2003
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:04,879
As team Korea leaves today,

2004
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:07,298
<i>our torsos remain untouched.</i>

2005
01:38:13,012 --> 01:38:14,430
<i>And our flag hangs high.</i>

2006
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:20,311
Physical: Asia.

2007
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:24,023
<i>The world is full of different physiques.</i>

2008
01:38:24,106 --> 01:38:26,233
<i>In order to find the ultimate athlete,</i>

2009
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:30,738
<i>we will continue to study</i>
<i>a variety of different bodies.</i>

2010
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:36,911
<i>Regardless of gender, age, race,</i>
<i>and nationality.</i>

2011
01:38:38,537 --> 01:38:42,666
<i>Our quest to find</i>
<i>the perfect physical form…</i>

2012
01:38:44,668 --> 01:38:46,253
<i>will continue.</i>
