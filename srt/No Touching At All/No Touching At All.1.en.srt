1
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,420
I can move forward because of that guy.

2
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,030
"No Touching At All"

3
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,840
Stop!

4
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,080
Thank you.

5
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,540
Oh.

6
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,640
Same floor?

7
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:30,930
Are you a contractor?

8
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,210
Huh?

9
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,915
Why are you making such

10
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:40,075
an obvious expression?

11
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,286
Ah, got it.

12
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,490
I stink, right?

13
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:54,266
Makes sense.

14
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,197
Been drinking all night,

15
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:57,210
didn't even shower.

16
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,260
Ugh.

17
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,880
Togawa-san.

18
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,120
Whoa. It reeks of booze.

19
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,870
What?

20
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
- You're still drunk?
- Yeah.

21
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,800
Huh?

22
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,326
Wait, so you're not the contractor?

23
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:32,546
I told you someone new

24
00:04:32,553 --> 00:04:33,792
was starting today.

25
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,960
This is Shima-kun. Shima-kun.

26
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,160
Ah.

27
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,060
Shima-chan, huh?

28
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm Togawa.

29
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,993
Don't call me 'section chief,'

30
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:47,246
it's too old-man-like.

31
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,457
Togawa-san, please go to

32
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:49,690
the smoking area.

33
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,730
The manager said there'd be

34
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:53,246
a fine if you're caught again.

35
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,770
Togawa-san, can you do a quick check?

36
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,390
Sure.

37
00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:59,250
- Comin'. Be right there.
- Yes.

38
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,740
What was your name again?

39
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,250
Shima.

40
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,412
That's it? No ‘Nice to meet you'

41
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:12,432
or anything?

42
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,230
Even though it's off-cycle hiring,

43
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:22,684
but you passed the interview.

44
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,370
Must have one hell of a résumé.

45
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,240
Well...

46
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,920
Something like that.

47
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,920
I see.

48
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,916
Here I thought you got

49
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:35,989
hired for your face.

50
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,740
Don't be so tense.

51
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,120
What a jerk.

52
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,530
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

53
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,600
Three customers.

54
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,696
Shima-kun.

55
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:00,344
Welcome to the Systems Department.

56
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:01,226
Cheers!

57
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,810
Yay!

58
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,200
- Yay!
- Looking forward to working with you!

59
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,160
Likewise.

60
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
- So delicious.
- Truly delicious.

61
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,720
Anything you feel like eating, Shima?

62
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,070
No.

63
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,400
Not really.

64
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,730
- Takada,
- Yes.

65
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,960
- just order whatever.
- Yes.

66
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,160
Wait, juice?

67
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,220
- I can't drink.
- No way.

68
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,190
And beer? Not even beer?

69
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,092
The smell of beer is

70
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:36,326
especially bad for me.

71
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,900
Even the scent on other people.

72
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,930
How about cigarettes?

73
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,500
I don't smoke.

74
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,600
Huh?

75
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,516
That's so dull.

76
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,043
It contradicts to your appearance.

77
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,287
Togawa-san, maybe learn

78
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,416
something from him?

79
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:50,924
No way. I'm lonely.

80
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:52,976
Can't imagine a life without alcohol.

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,346
Then why not find a bride?

82
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:55,573
You're popular enough.

83
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,210
A bride.

84
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,520
I do want one.

85
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:03,113
Hook me up, Takada.

86
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,620
No thanks. Your standards seem scary.

87
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,640
Is that so?

88
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,700
Sakita-san just got a shotgun marriage.

89
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,570
Umm... Sakita was...

90
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,853
The woman who worked

91
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,093
in this position before you.

92
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,580
Think you'll last here?

93
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,560
Probably.

94
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,150
Is that so?

95
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,873
Onoda said you're

96
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:25,146
insanely knowledgeable.

97
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:25,720
Mm.

98
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,670
Thank you.

99
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,010
Where'd you work before this?

100
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,500
A place called TAG.

101
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,120
TAG?

102
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,560
You worked at a big company!

103
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,020
Huh? You got fired?

104
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,190
No.

105
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,850
That's not it.

106
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,480
But...

107
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,370
- Huh? But what?
- What?

108
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,390
- Hey! What the heck?
- Togawa-san, seriously...

109
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,030
The beer's empty.

110
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,830
- Can't you say it nicely?
- Your face was so close.

111
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,010
That's totally harassment.

112
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,530
Oh yeah, Takada,

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,520
weren't you going to that facial spa?

114
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,080
Any results?

115
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,450
Geez. Onoda-san, don't tell them.

116
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,583
Forget about the facial spa,

117
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:05,036
just hurry up and order more beer.

118
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,810
Yes. I'm sorry.

119
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,130
Okay. Thanks for your hard work.

120
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,750
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks for your hard work.

121
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,120
Umm...

122
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,980
About earlier...

123
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,160
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,950
Huh?

125
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,250
For what?

126
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,680
Oh. Never mind.

127
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,120
It's nothing.

128
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:40,740
Thank you for the welcome party.

129
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,570
- I feel so bad.
- Yes.

130
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,741
The world keeps spinning and spinning,

131
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:04,788
so I think I must have

132
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:06,256
had too much to drink.

133
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,200
That's no good.

134
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,480
Can't even get up.

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,600
But you're here.

136
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,780
- Mm.
- Togawa-san, Sakita-san is here.

137
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,020
Oh, Sakita!

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,430
You're doing fine.

139
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,823
Yes, we're both doing well.

140
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,030
How many months now?

141
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,930
Five months already.

142
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,600
Let me see.

143
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,710
Ah, sorry, sorry.

144
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,480
- Come on, come on.
- Come here.

145
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,130
Come on.

146
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,320
- It's crying now.
- Ah, I can't handle it huh?

147
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:38,907
- It must have been scared.
- Come here.

148
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,780
Crying so loudly.

149
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Kids are amazing.

150
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,236
A kid can grow without a parent,

151
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,560
but a parent can't become one

152
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:46,787
without a kid.

153
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,990
So true.

154
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,130
- I'm sorry.
- Crying again.

155
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
You should learn your lesson.

156
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,535
I see. So that's what happened

157
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:00,842
with Shima-kun.

158
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,680
Mm.

159
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,580
There's no way he can forget it.

160
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,680
The ex?

161
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,710
No.

162
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,220
The pain.

163
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,960
Haa...

164
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,950
I couldn't do anything.

165
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,075
Even if I were in your shoes,

166
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,095
Deguchi-san,

167
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,981
I don't think I could've done

168
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:41,355
anything either.

169
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,640
Oh.

170
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,679
I'm heading out.

171
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:53,816
I'll leave thee rest to you.

172
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,530
Yes.

173
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,400
- Take care.
- Be safe!

174
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,910
Where is Togawa-san going?

175
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,120
He is in a suit, too.

176
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,250
Business trip. Kyoto.

177
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,550
He'll be gone for a while, I think.

178
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,940
How long is ‘a while'?

179
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,700
What is it?

180
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,930
Nothing.

181
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,090
Umm... You see...

182
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,990
I had some documents

183
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:27,483
I wanted him to review.

184
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,440
I see.

185
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,863
He'll probably be back

186
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,949
in about two weeks.

187
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,940
- I see.
- Mm.

188
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:47,173
Alright.

189
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,940
Shima-chan.

190
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,100
Yes.

191
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,280
Togawa-san's back.

192
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,630
How was Kyoto?

193
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,860
Mmm...

194
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,000
How were the maiko?

195
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,960
You think I had time for that?

196
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,258
But the girls' dialects over there

197
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:45,565
were super cute.

198
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,800
Huh...

199
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,470
- Takada.
- Yes?

200
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,220
- You got a smoke? I'm out.
- Sure.

201
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,880
- Sorry about that.
- No worries.

202
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,080
Shima, how are you doin'?

203
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,640
Fine.

204
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,410
That's all I get after two weeks?

205
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,570
But Shima was all lonely.

206
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,000
- Huh? This guy?
- Mm.

207
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,400
I wasn't lonely.

208
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,980
You're cute, you know that?

209
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,075
What kind of face are you

210
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:26,095
making saying that?

211
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,720
Oh right,

212
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:35,707
I got souvenirs. Some local sake

213
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:36,840
and craft beer.

214
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,510
I wanted yatsuhashi.

215
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,650
I didn't get that.

216
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,740
C'mon, yatsuhashi's a Kyoto classic!

217
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,410
I've never met a guy who likes those.

218
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,960
Togawa-san.

219
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,990
Ah.

220
00:14:57,616 --> 00:14:58,450
What is it?

221
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,440
Sorry to bother you out here,

222
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,320
but this is urgent.

223
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,340
Sure thing.

224
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,480
Looks good to me.

225
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,610
Thank you.

226
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,380
You were making that face, huh?

227
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,490
Wanna grab lunch?

228
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,240
I already bought something.

229
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,760
Shima, smoke break?

230
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,850
You know I don't smoke.

231
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,660
- Then… wanna go pee together?
- No.

232
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,500
- Then...
- What is your deal?

233
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,690
Why are you so stubborn?

234
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,010
That's...

235
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,260
Just how I am.

236
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,340
Honestly, it just makes it feel like

237
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:35,854
you're really interested in me.

238
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,453
It's not like I'm trying to

239
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,840
hit on you or anything.

240
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,530
I never...

241
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,390
thought that.

242
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,040
Then come eat with me.

243
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,540
C'mon?

244
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,120
Alright, let's go.

245
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:17,916
Wait...

246
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,463
Shima, you live with your parents?

247
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,250
No,

248
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,320
I live alone.

249
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,730
You eating proper meals?

250
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:39,860
Of course, I do.

251
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,250
Excuse me.

252
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,720
Yes.

253
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,590
- One draft beer.
- Yes.

254
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,370
You want anything?

255
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,570
I don't drink.

256
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,400
Is that so?

257
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,176
You hate the smell.

258
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,436
Same with smoke, huh?

259
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,880
I don't like it.

260
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,020
Should I get an air purifier then?

261
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,740
Everyone in our office smokes.

262
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,530
Isn't smoking banned at work?

263
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,090
Right.

264
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,790
Something on my hand?

265
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,460
Sorry.

266
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,450
I zoned out.

267
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:52,420
You...

268
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,330
never look me in the eye when we talk.

269
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,180
But you watch me when I'm not looking.

270
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
I wasn't.

271
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,090
You're imagining things.

272
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,180
Really?

273
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,000
You're overthinking.

274
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,630
If I overthink, you also overthink.

275
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,640
No, I didn't.

276
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,660
About overthinking...

277
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,110
Mm...

278
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,626
Really? You didn't?

279
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,673
That's disappointing.

280
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,300
Ah, your meat's burning.

281
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,040
Ah...

282
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,160
Haa... I'm so full.

283
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,320
I'm sorry. And thank you for the meal.

284
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,110
You're going this way, right?

285
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,510
Ah...

286
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,820
Yes.

287
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,400
Then...

288
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Let's part here.

289
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,230
Sorry. I dragged you out, after all.

290
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,760
Next time, come with those guys.

291
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,700
Yes.

292
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,750
Then...

293
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,230
See you later.

294
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,320
Not going home?

295
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,210
I'm going.

296
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,770
We got caught.

297
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,350
What are you doing?

298
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,800
Kissing.

299
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,880
I know that.

300
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,520
Well, it felt like the moment, you know?

301
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,540
The moment?

302
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,460
Aren't you embarrassed?

303
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,280
Doing this here.

304
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,520
Then...

305
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,830
Let's go somewhere we won't be seen.

306
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,860
No.

307
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,440
Wait, Togawa-san, um…

308
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,810
That's not what I meant.

309
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,200
This is the worst.

310
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,390
Cigarettes,

311
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,280
beer,

312
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,990
- grilled meat...
- You talk a lot when you're flustered.

313
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,060
You're trouble, seriously.

314
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,720
I feel...

315
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,347
I feel like doing something weird

316
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:32,372
with you.

317
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,580
Wait.

318
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,670
Wait...

319
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:42,986
You...

320
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,200
Are you gay?

321
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,950
Well...

322
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,680
Yes.

323
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,400
But Togawa-san...

324
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,230
isn't, right?

325
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,070
Hey.

326
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,070
I'm your type, aren't I?

327
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,830
Not even close.

328
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,680
Actually, you're the opposite.

329
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,740
Liar.

330
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,040
You were totally interested in me.

331
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:26,800
That was...

332
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,840
Just a moment of weakness.

333
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,750
I've snapped out of it now.

334
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,943
That was the most monotone thing

335
00:25:35,957 --> 00:25:36,850
I've ever heard.

336
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,970
Don't worry.

337
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,280
I got caught up in the moment too.

338
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,088
I was teasing you, but you made

339
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,153
a cute face so I did it.

340
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,310
I'm not cute.

341
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,240
Don't pin this on me.

342
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,600
You're staying the night, right?

343
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,280
Okay.

344
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,220
Wait.

345
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,150
Ah...

346
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,680
It's embarrassing, honestly.

347
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,340
A family photo and all.

348
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,680
Well...

349
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,050
They're all gone now, though.

350
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,530
All of them?

351
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,490
My dad died in an accident

352
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:29,955
when I was seven.

353
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,213
My mom got depressed after that.

354
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,360
It was a snowy day...

355
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,613
When I came to, there was only

356
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,720
a sea of fire around me.

357
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,540
Me and my mom made it out,

358
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,840
but my little brother died.

359
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,810
Well...

360
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,870
Shortly after that, she took her life.

361
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,200
As a kid, I used to wonder…

362
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,430
Why doesn't snow put out the fire?

363
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,370
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,210
Hmm?

365
00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:29,200
What're you apologizing for?

366
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,781
That I made you think of things

367
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,515
you don't want to think about.

368
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,690
No,

369
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,250
it's just the past for me.

370
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,276
I'm used to people pitying me.

371
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:43,363
I got used to it.

372
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,550
But…

373
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,206
Actually, I probably dream

374
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:53,000
about having a family a little bit.

375
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,420
Why didn't you wake me up?

376
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,140
I ended up being late, y'know.

377
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,870
That's not my problem.

378
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,380
That is...

379
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,400
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

380
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,630
Thanks for your hard work.

381
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,310
Shima-kun is kind of cute, isn't he?

382
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,750
Well,

383
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,240
I guess his face isn't bad.

384
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,292
Do you know why Shima-kun

385
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:11,212
left his previous job?

386
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,050
Hmm?

387
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,320
- I didn't know that.
- He was apparently bullied badly.

388
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,870
Bullied?

389
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,489
Word got out that Shima-kun was dating

390
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:23,443
a guy in the same department.

391
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,987
That guy wanted the rumor gone,

392
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:27,547
so he started treating Shima-kun

393
00:31:27,572 --> 00:31:28,807
like crap.

394
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,920
Spread rumors that Shima-kun

395
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:32,440
was seducing him first,

396
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,230
blamed all his work mistakes

397
00:31:34,243 --> 00:31:35,283
on Shima-kun,

398
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,590
made it tough for him to stay.

399
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,190
Apparently they were dating, though.

400
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,730
So what?

401
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,200
- Am I supposed to do something?
- No. It's just...

402
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,200
I saw that you took good care

403
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:55,327
of Shima-kun.

404
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,107
Well, we've worked together

405
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:01,581
for a while so you can tell.

406
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,130
Then...

407
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,840
I'll head out for the day.

408
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,840
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks for your hard work.

409
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,840
Thanks for your hard work.

410
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,905
How long have you even

411
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,096
been doing this job?

412
00:32:58,842 --> 00:32:59,955
Maybe he's too distracted

413
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:01,409
thinking about something else?

414
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,330
Sorry about earlier.

415
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,030
Please don't be angry with me.

416
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,880
Shima!

417
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,200
Yes?

418
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,840
Hello, it's me.

419
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,230
What is it?

420
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,740
What're you doing right now?

421
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,760
Watching TV.

422
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,900
I see, rubbing one out, huh?

423
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,320
I am not.

424
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,880
What do you want?

425
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,750
Mmm...

426
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,830
Say something, will ya?

427
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,300
You're the one who called me,

428
00:34:34,325 --> 00:34:35,325
aren't you?

429
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,600
Right.

430
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,030
You see...

431
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,590
- About yesterday...
- Come pick me up.

432
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:53,880
Huh?

433
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,150
I'm at the station near your place.

434
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,310
Why?

435
00:35:01,693 --> 00:35:03,393
Well, I don't know your address.

436
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,840
That's not the issue.

437
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,140
You've got 10 minutes.

438
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,563
If you don't come, I'm dropping

439
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:14,716
your performance score.

440
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,950
What even is that?

441
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,980
Say goodbye to your bonus,

442
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,116
Could be like

443
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:22,436
100,000 yen down the drain.

444
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,510
Do what you want.

445
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,670
Hey. Wait.

446
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,990
My bonus...

447
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,630
Please take care of it,

448
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,480
Section Chief Togawa.

449
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,640
I said it might drop,

450
00:35:55,665 --> 00:35:57,173
didn't say it could go up.

451
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,738
You don't actually have

452
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:01,972
that much power, do you?

453
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,170
Shut it.

454
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,980
Make some room.

455
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,500
It's a single bed,

456
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,290
unlike yours.

457
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,480
So warm.

458
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,320
It's hot.

459
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,710
You...

460
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,030
Why do you make that expression?

461
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
I did not.

462
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,590
Cause Onoda found out?

463
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,220
He found out?

464
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,090
Not sure.

465
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,830
But you don't like it, right?

466
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,760
I'm fine with it, though.

467
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,680
What did your ex say to you?

468
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,250
Huh?

469
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,570
It's related to

470
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,560
the reason why you quit your old job.

471
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,970
Onoda knows someone

472
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,490
at your previous company.

473
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,443
You don't have to talk about it

474
00:37:58,463 --> 00:37:59,489
if you don't want to.

475
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,690
I hate that I'm into guys.

476
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,920
I wish I'd never met you.

477
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,200
Huh?

478
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,650
- Good morning.
- Yes.

479
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,760
Good morning.

480
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,730
Togawa-san, late again?

481
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,610
Maybe he's got a girl now?

482
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:47,970
What did you want

483
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,640
to talk about?

484
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,100
Well...

485
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,900
how should I put it...

486
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,080
Shima-kun, it's all over your face.

487
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,678
Since you're usually so unreadable,

488
00:39:04,698 --> 00:39:05,718
it's extra obvious.

489
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,269
I mean, I didn't think you two

490
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:14,969
were already together...

491
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,580
We're not together.

492
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,250
Huh? Really?

493
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,000
We're not dating or anything.

494
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,630
- So...
- Oh. It's okay.

495
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,840
What did Shima say?

496
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,880
He didn't deny it.

497
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,040
Huh...

498
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,750
But he said you're not together.

499
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,250
And?

500
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,380
Man, this feels like tattling,

501
00:39:44,407 --> 00:39:45,436
I don't like it.

502
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,120
I'll bump up your bonus.

503
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,600
You've said that too many times already.

504
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,100
Trust me.

505
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,560
You see...

506
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,300
I...

507
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,950
I'm gay.

508
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,820
But he's not.

509
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,030
It's just...

510
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:09,970
He probably sees me

511
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,990
as something strange.

512
00:40:12,149 --> 00:40:13,590
He'll get bored eventually.

513
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,880
You think so?

514
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,410
I feel like it might be the opposite.

515
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,020
Normally, it should feel more connected.

516
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,529
Isn't it harder to keep having something

517
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,785
with the same person

518
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,370
if you're not emotionally invested?

519
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,760
That's why…

520
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,530
He'll get bored.

521
00:40:47,803 --> 00:40:48,950
Honestly, he seemed

522
00:40:49,943 --> 00:40:51,549
more like he thinks you are the one

523
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,930
who'll get bored.

524
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,330
Damn.

525
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,040
That's cute.

526
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,790
Togawa-san.

527
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,280
What?

528
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,560
Smoking.

529
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,473
You'll be in trouble if the boss

530
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,540
catches you smoking.

531
00:41:30,773 --> 00:41:31,720
Really?

532
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,400
Right, Shima-kun?

533
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,540
Yes.

534
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,210
Why are you dragging Shima into this?

535
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,010
Because when the boss

536
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,010
cannot tell you, he tells Shima-kun.

537
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,270
He vents about this and that.

538
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,540
Said ‘What's the point of

539
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,625
having a smoking area?

540
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,580
Something like that.

541
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,970
Is that true, Shima?

542
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:52,580
More or less.

543
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,970
Why didn't you tell me?

544
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,100
- I figured it wouldn't matter if I did.
- Fair.

545
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,680
I'll quit then.

546
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,030
Huh?

547
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,980
I'll quit smoking.

548
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,800
- Seriously?
- No way.

549
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,810
No, I mean it.

550
00:42:08,327 --> 00:42:10,393
I've been thinking about

551
00:42:10,418 --> 00:42:11,633
quitting anyway.

552
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,620
Okay.

553
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,280
Shima,

554
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
hold onto this.

555
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,410
Next time I wanna smoke,

556
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:33,790
I'm getting it from you, got it?

557
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,560
So don't lose it.

558
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,450
If you're heading out, invite me too.

559
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,970
- Why?
- We're going to the same place.

560
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,101
Right now you're thinking about how I

561
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:01,575
smelled the first time we met, huh?

562
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,110
Please stop doing this.

563
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,340
Why?

564
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,130
Well...

565
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,120
- It's weird.
- How so?

566
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,260
Like, being strangely kind suddenly,

567
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,860
or quitting smoking.

568
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,250
Huh?

569
00:43:23,816 --> 00:43:25,886
I've always been kind.

570
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,830
I'll make dinner today,

571
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,760
so, wait for me at my place.

572
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,379
I'll catch up after I talk to the boss.

573
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,400
Excuse me.

574
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:54,710
Oh.

575
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:57,430
Ah.

576
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,960
You're smoking.

577
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
Keep it a secret.

578
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,982
I heard you lecture my subordinate

579
00:44:05,996 --> 00:44:07,196
about quitting?

580
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,670
Yeah, I was just saying it.

581
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,000
So I can cover up for other people.

582
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:13,890
Mm.

583
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,000
Please sit first.

584
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:23,330
Got any plans to get married?

585
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,160
- Are you matchmaking me?
- You're not getting my daughter.

586
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,360
- Don't want her.
- What'd you say?

587
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,660
She's 12, isn't she?

588
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:32,560
Mm.

589
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,970
What is this about?

590
00:44:44,376 --> 00:44:45,516
Togawa,

591
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:48,040
do you like Kyoto?

592
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,880
What?

593
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,260
I'm home.

594
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,600
Sorry I'm late.

595
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,593
Let's hurry up and make dinner

596
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:37,586
so we can eat it.

597
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,360
Oh.

598
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,320
Ah.

599
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,850
I knew it.

600
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,150
It's better to eat you first.

601
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,040
It's cold.

602
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,660
Ah...

603
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,720
What's wrong with you?

604
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,080
You seem off…

605
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,050
Mm.

606
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,500
It's nothing.

607
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,890
I'm just glad.

608
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,400
Glad I met you.

609
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,720
Shima? What's wrong?

610
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,430
Are you crying?

611
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,940
I'm not crying.

612
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,880
You're right. Not crying.

613
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,650
But...

614
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,770
You look like you're about to.

615
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,440
- Is that so?
- Mm. I also don't know.

616
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,740
- Got it.
- Shima.

617
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,333
Let's go get lunch.

618
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,190
I already bought it.

619
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,160
Then take it with you.

620
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,120
No thank you.

621
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,920
If you don't hurry, I'm eating it.

622
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,670
Where are we going?

623
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,200
Somewhere nice.

624
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,360
So what's so nice about this place?

625
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,730
It's nice, right? A city park.

626
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,040
What about my cup ramen?

627
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,890
What am I supposed to do?

628
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,930
Yeah. What to do?

629
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,440
Want my melon bread?

630
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,430
No thanks.

631
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,360
Ah.

632
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,870
Why bring me all the way here?

633
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:32,440
Shima.

634
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,160
I...

635
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,730
Ah, take it.

636
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,270
- Here.
- Thanks, Uncle.

637
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,200
- Wait. Call him big brother.
- Uncle?

638
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,100
Nah, it's fine. I am almost 30.

639
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,882
It's not strange for someone at this age

640
00:48:57,907 --> 00:48:58,913
to become a father.

641
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,080
- Thanks!
- Mm.

642
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,210
Try it.

643
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,520
Ah, hey, hey.

644
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,260
It's actually hard.

645
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,960
- It's hard. You must juggle it high.
- You...

646
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,690
Don't smile like you're going to cry.

647
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,830
It's not cute at all.

648
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,600
Because I'm a man.

649
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,550
I'm not cute.

650
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:31,360
Besides,

651
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,840
I'm not cheerful like you.

652
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,490
Shima, what's wrong?

653
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,420
Sorry.

654
00:49:43,896 --> 00:49:45,576
I've got some things to take care of.

655
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,010
I'll head back first.

656
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:53,823
An executive from headquarters

657
00:49:53,848 --> 00:49:55,976
has his eye on you.

658
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,156
Well, it's probably

659
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,970
a good opportunity for you.

660
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:03,960
No reason for you to turn it down…

661
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:09,720
Ah, welcome back.

662
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:10,808
You were quick.

663
00:50:11,848 --> 00:50:13,656
Where's Togawa-san?

664
00:50:15,832 --> 00:50:16,984
I came back first.

665
00:50:17,608 --> 00:50:18,328
Oh.

666
00:50:19,454 --> 00:50:20,414
Are you okay?

667
00:50:23,912 --> 00:50:24,840
You must have heard

668
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,248
The matter of Togawa-san

669
00:50:29,144 --> 00:50:30,248
having to move branches.

670
00:50:36,552 --> 00:50:37,352
Huh?

671
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,192
Huh?

672
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:46,952
Could it be...

673
00:50:49,336 --> 00:50:50,520
that you didn't know?

674
00:50:53,144 --> 00:50:54,856
I'm sorry.

675
00:50:56,952 --> 00:50:57,752
No.

676
00:50:58,136 --> 00:50:59,704
I thought since you two left together,

677
00:50:59,731 --> 00:51:01,498
it would be something you'd talk about.

678
00:51:04,152 --> 00:51:05,144
Togawa-san.

679
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:08,088
He said to disclose it.

680
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:09,935
So I thought

681
00:51:10,472 --> 00:51:12,392
maybe he wanted to tell you personally.

682
00:52:05,928 --> 00:52:08,408
I'm just glad. Glad I met you.

683
00:52:29,384 --> 00:52:30,936
So he wants to end it, huh?

684
00:52:41,448 --> 00:52:43,128
Mm. Yes?

685
00:52:47,985 --> 00:52:48,721
Today...

686
00:52:50,306 --> 00:52:51,352
Can we meet?

687
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,240
Did you wait long?

688
00:53:18,776 --> 00:53:19,512
No.

689
00:53:20,776 --> 00:53:21,784
I just got here.

690
00:53:22,936 --> 00:53:23,928
Haa...

691
00:53:25,304 --> 00:53:27,032
It's so rare

692
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,826
you're actually saying,

693
00:53:28,851 --> 00:53:30,531
'I want to meet you.'

694
00:53:31,672 --> 00:53:33,096
I didn't say it like that.

695
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:37,864
But you wanted to meet me, right?

696
00:53:41,224 --> 00:53:42,248
Yes,

697
00:53:45,048 --> 00:53:46,312
I did want to meet you.

698
00:54:02,136 --> 00:54:03,528
What's wrong with you?

699
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:06,104
You're acting strange.

700
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:11,432
When I thought this was the last time,

701
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,360
I wanted to leave some feelings behind.

702
00:54:16,344 --> 00:54:17,288
Congratulations

703
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:19,832
on your promotion.

704
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,824
Thank you for everything.

705
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,880
Thanks to you,

706
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,408
I've had a pretty fun time.

707
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,136
Is it hard for you to tell me?

708
00:54:35,368 --> 00:54:37,000
You don't have to worry too much.

709
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:39,480
You can just say it...

710
00:54:50,616 --> 00:54:51,864
I like you.

711
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,336
Is that really such a surprise?

712
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:00,392
Did my actions not reach you at all?

713
00:55:04,088 --> 00:55:04,696
So why...

714
00:55:07,352 --> 00:55:08,856
Why are you saying this now?

715
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,640
I wanted to say it, and I want to be

716
00:55:10,665 --> 00:55:11,740
with you from now on.

717
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:13,656
What are you talking about?

718
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,424
It's not going to be easy.

719
00:55:16,504 --> 00:55:18,232
You don't know that.

720
00:55:19,592 --> 00:55:20,392
Well...

721
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,008
Togawa-san.

722
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:26,408
Aren't you straight?

723
00:55:28,696 --> 00:55:29,496
Shima.

724
00:55:31,784 --> 00:55:32,856
I...

725
00:55:33,912 --> 00:55:35,976
think you're the cutest.

726
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,176
Your past,

727
00:55:40,488 --> 00:55:43,064
- or that fact that you're gay.
- Ha...

728
00:55:44,264 --> 00:55:45,336
Are you pitying me?

729
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:48,821
Whether it's love, pity, or whatever,

730
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,101
it's all feelings.

731
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:53,656
I feel very attached to you.

732
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,952
So, how do you feel?

733
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:08,232
If I have to be away from Togawa-san,

734
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:12,824
to be honest, I'd be lonely.

735
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,448
But...

736
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,386
But, I've been thinking that continuing

737
00:56:19,393 --> 00:56:20,993
this kind of relationship is not good.

738
00:56:23,384 --> 00:56:25,656
It would be better to draw a clear line.

739
00:56:25,944 --> 00:56:26,760
What?

740
00:56:28,424 --> 00:56:29,704
I don't understand at all.

741
00:56:31,816 --> 00:56:34,120
Did you even hear what I said clearly?

742
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,568
I told you I want to be with you.

743
00:56:36,968 --> 00:56:38,264
What I'm trying to say is that...

744
00:56:40,136 --> 00:56:41,769
Our relationship isn't that close to be

745
00:56:41,776 --> 00:56:43,462
in a long distance relationship.

746
00:56:46,712 --> 00:56:47,368
Then...

747
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:52,216
You really want to end it like this?

748
00:56:54,056 --> 00:56:55,582
You can't say that we want to end it.

749
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,136
It wasn't like

750
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,446
we had anything from the beginning.

751
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:02,528
Except for the sex...

752
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:03,576
You...

753
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,777
It's true, from the start,

754
00:57:09,805 --> 00:57:11,211
I didn't really like you,

755
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,693
And then, I like you more and more

756
00:57:15,512 --> 00:57:18,744
- as I got to know you...
- Thank you.

757
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:21,704
I'm happy,

758
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:24,312
but...

759
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:28,856
If you're just in a relationship with me

760
00:57:28,876 --> 00:57:30,242
out of temporary confusion,

761
00:57:32,504 --> 00:57:33,564
then maybe you should

762
00:57:33,571 --> 00:57:34,657
just get a bride already.

763
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:35,896
Huh?

764
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,624
What are you talking about?

765
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:46,008
- If you long for a family...
- Huh?

766
00:57:49,368 --> 00:57:50,408
You have...

767
00:57:53,224 --> 00:57:54,680
been worried about that this whole time?

768
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,888
Aren't you serious about it?

769
00:57:58,552 --> 00:57:59,752
I'm a man,

770
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:04,568
so of course I can't have children.

771
00:58:05,704 --> 00:58:08,040
- It's a waste of time continuing this.
- Hey, listen first.

772
00:58:09,896 --> 00:58:11,592
Look this way.

773
00:58:15,016 --> 00:58:16,264
I also...

774
00:58:18,968 --> 00:58:21,592
- I'm hurt in my own way...
- Shima, look at me.

775
00:58:21,992 --> 00:58:24,456
Look at me properly! Look!

776
00:58:26,472 --> 00:58:27,384
Listen.

777
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:30,360
"That kind of thing,"

778
00:58:31,992 --> 00:58:34,312
even if I didn't meet you,

779
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:36,607
it's just a passing fancy that can
be easily thrown away.

780
00:58:36,632 --> 00:58:38,630
You certainly can't throw it away.

781
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:42,200
My past...

782
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:44,536
Your past...

783
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,432
They're parts of us, right?

784
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,264
With a past like yours,

785
00:58:53,304 --> 00:58:54,600
don't you think

786
00:58:56,344 --> 00:58:58,696
that I can never fulfill you.

787
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:00,552
Besides...

788
00:59:01,336 --> 00:59:02,782
I was expecting us to be together

789
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:03,902
until the end of our lives.

790
00:59:06,216 --> 00:59:06,936
So, if that's the case,

791
00:59:09,096 --> 00:59:10,242
it would have been better

792
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,582
if nothing had ever happened.

793
00:59:16,536 --> 00:59:17,400
Enough already.

794
00:59:21,896 --> 00:59:22,696
Shima.

795
00:59:27,176 --> 00:59:28,309
It's true, your feelings

796
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:29,522
are yours to have,

797
00:59:32,968 --> 00:59:34,388
but you don't have the right to

798
00:59:34,401 --> 00:59:36,054
trample on my feelings for you.

799
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,920
I get everything now. Let's end it.

800
01:00:05,704 --> 01:00:06,520
Ah...

801
01:00:09,758 --> 01:00:11,736
Consider it as the last time...

802
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,473
Apart from the sex,

803
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:21,753
there was nothing, you said.

804
01:00:27,432 --> 01:00:28,598
You came here today with

805
01:00:28,623 --> 01:00:29,591
that in mind, right?

806
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,664
To you, I was just that,

807
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:37,656
weren't I?

808
01:00:43,368 --> 01:00:44,456
Get up!

809
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,392
You're the most cruel.

810
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:14,536
Are you telling me to resent my past?

811
01:02:04,952 --> 01:02:06,760
Am I being resented?

812
01:02:11,384 --> 01:02:12,776
If so...

813
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,392
At least he won't forget me, right?

814
01:03:17,688 --> 01:03:18,488
Hey.

815
01:03:19,144 --> 01:03:20,712
Don't cry so much, guys.

816
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:23,560
No, no, none of us are crying.

817
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,888
Yeah, no one's crying.

818
01:03:25,032 --> 01:03:26,406
Liar! You voice was trembling

819
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,860
just a second ago.

820
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,856
Hey, why'd you have to say that?

821
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,032
Oh well.

822
01:03:36,168 --> 01:03:37,432
Take care, everyone.

823
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,126
I'll call you once in a while

824
01:03:39,151 --> 01:03:40,206
even after I go.

825
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:42,977
Togawa-san,

826
01:03:43,164 --> 01:03:44,517
thank you for your hard work.

827
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,192
Take care.

828
01:03:49,112 --> 01:03:50,376
I'll go to Kyoto.

829
01:03:51,048 --> 01:03:51,768
Mm.

830
01:03:52,088 --> 01:03:54,056
You mean that?

831
01:03:54,504 --> 01:03:55,624
Goodbye, Shima.

832
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:08,920
Thank you for everything.

833
01:05:53,832 --> 01:05:55,320
It's been a month, huh?

834
01:05:55,752 --> 01:05:57,464
- Since Togawa-san went there.
- Huh?

835
01:05:59,544 --> 01:06:00,737
Section Chief, you must be

836
01:06:00,744 --> 01:06:01,856
having a rough time.

837
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,983
Don't call that.
It sounds so old-fashioned.

838
01:06:04,008 --> 01:06:05,960
Togawa-san said the same thing.

839
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,776
Good morning.

840
01:06:09,592 --> 01:06:10,856
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

841
01:06:10,904 --> 01:06:11,640
Good morning.

842
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,032
You cut your hair.

843
01:06:14,728 --> 01:06:17,704
A bit. It was getting too long.

844
01:06:18,024 --> 01:06:18,936
Is that so?

845
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,170
By the way, Shima-kun, do you have

846
01:06:23,191 --> 01:06:24,703
a business card from Estec?

847
01:06:25,048 --> 01:06:27,528
Umm... Yes.

848
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,080
What a relief.

849
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,452
I need to go there,

850
01:06:30,472 --> 01:06:32,048
but I don't know the address.

851
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,384
- I'll get it for you.
- Mm.

852
01:06:43,176 --> 01:06:44,520
Mm. Thanks.

853
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,704
Shinagawa?

854
01:07:09,624 --> 01:07:10,552
Shima-kun.

855
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:25,160
Shima, are you okay?

856
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,272
Umm... It seems like he has a headache.

857
01:07:47,432 --> 01:07:48,312
I'm sorry.

858
01:07:49,384 --> 01:07:50,616
I'll get back to work now.

859
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,112
It's fine. You can leave for today.

860
01:07:57,336 --> 01:08:00,152
Before he left, Togawa-san told me

861
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:06,216
to not leave you alone

862
01:08:07,448 --> 01:08:09,008
he said

863
01:08:09,195 --> 01:08:10,921
"because he thinks he can be alone."

864
01:08:14,888 --> 01:08:15,640
But

865
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,269
I didn't need him to tell me that.

866
01:08:20,736 --> 01:08:21,769
I'll do it anyway.

867
01:08:24,584 --> 01:08:26,014
Even though it has a different meaning

868
01:08:26,021 --> 01:08:27,381
from Togawa-san,

869
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:28,600
but I

870
01:08:29,847 --> 01:08:31,672
like Shima-kun.

871
01:08:34,712 --> 01:08:36,920
Oh, I like you to the extent that

872
01:08:37,608 --> 01:08:39,352
if anyone badmouthed you,

873
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:42,280
I'd get mad.

874
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,672
Here.

875
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,910
It's cold.

876
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,816
I thought Kyoto would be warmer.

877
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,248
Oh.

878
01:11:48,856 --> 01:11:49,784
It's Shima.

879
01:11:56,632 --> 01:11:57,608
Long time no talk.

880
01:11:59,704 --> 01:12:00,728
It's been a while.

881
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,624
Sorry to call so late.

882
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:05,480
It's not that late,

883
01:12:06,888 --> 01:12:08,232
it's only nine.

884
01:12:10,904 --> 01:12:11,768
Right.

885
01:12:13,048 --> 01:12:14,120
Sorry.

886
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,952
Why are you so polite now?

887
01:12:21,096 --> 01:12:22,120
Is that so?

888
01:12:23,112 --> 01:12:24,232
Exactly.

889
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:28,408
What are you doing?

890
01:12:31,128 --> 01:12:32,152
I'm making a call.

891
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,512
Well, obviously,

892
01:12:36,776 --> 01:12:38,135
but couldn't you come up with

893
01:12:38,156 --> 01:12:39,362
a more creative answer?

894
01:12:41,352 --> 01:12:42,296
Then...

895
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:46,360
I'm doing that alone.

896
01:12:49,672 --> 01:12:51,480
Don't steal other people's lines.

897
01:12:54,248 --> 01:12:55,224
Sorry.

898
01:12:57,464 --> 01:12:58,408
You've been

899
01:12:59,672 --> 01:13:01,528
apologizing a lot, haven't you?

900
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:03,944
Sorry.

901
01:13:04,488 --> 01:13:05,544
Just as I said.

902
01:13:06,552 --> 01:13:07,592
Sorry.

903
01:13:08,936 --> 01:13:10,744
Why are you apologizing?

904
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,912
Sorry.

905
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:17,432
I'm asking why are you apologizing?

906
01:13:40,696 --> 01:13:41,576
Shima.

907
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:43,656
I'm going to hang up.

908
01:14:07,528 --> 01:14:08,824
In the end...

909
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,880
You're leaving so easily, huh?

910
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,592
I thought...

911
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:23,871
you were angry and hung up on me.

912
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,328
I'm not angry,

913
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,240
just a bit irritated.

914
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,980
Did you want to cut your hair

915
01:14:34,007 --> 01:14:35,207
and feel fresh?

916
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,175
Did you really want to forget about me

917
01:14:38,195 --> 01:14:39,195
so badly?

918
01:14:43,128 --> 01:14:44,024
I...

919
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,712
- I just wanted to apologize to you.
- Haa...

920
01:14:51,992 --> 01:14:54,328
That just made me even more irritated.

921
01:15:01,224 --> 01:15:03,320
Go ahead and say it, I'm listening.

922
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:08,280
I...

923
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,016
I'm no good.

924
01:15:15,784 --> 01:15:19,000
I used the past as an excuse.

925
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,580
Always thought I was

926
01:15:22,593 --> 01:15:23,593
the only one in pain.

927
01:15:26,296 --> 01:15:27,336
I'm scared...

928
01:15:30,584 --> 01:15:31,815
I was afraid you'll get bored

929
01:15:31,835 --> 01:15:32,928
and abandon me.

930
01:15:37,832 --> 01:15:40,760
And what about your family matters,

931
01:15:43,352 --> 01:15:45,278
I don't want to take that away from you.

932
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,472
But...

933
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,260
I only ask

934
01:15:55,336 --> 01:15:57,384
until you change your mind,

935
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:04,856
I want to be with you.

936
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:10,968
Even if my efforts

937
01:16:13,864 --> 01:16:16,120
might not change anything,

938
01:16:19,368 --> 01:16:20,408
I'll try my best

939
01:16:21,848 --> 01:16:24,856
- not to burden you...
- Shima.

940
01:16:52,424 --> 01:16:53,880
Do you like me?

941
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,360
Yes.

942
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:05,992
I like you.

943
01:17:29,768 --> 01:17:33,224
I thought it was absolutely hopeless.

944
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,424
That...

945
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,456
That should be me.

946
01:17:47,448 --> 01:17:48,488
You...

947
01:17:50,696 --> 01:17:51,660
Are you okay with

948
01:17:51,674 --> 01:17:52,987
a long-distance relationship?

949
01:17:54,952 --> 01:17:57,080
We could live together here, you know.

950
01:18:00,184 --> 01:18:01,032
I...

951
01:18:03,128 --> 01:18:04,984
already quit my previous job,

952
01:18:07,624 --> 01:18:09,064
and I don't want to quit

953
01:18:10,456 --> 01:18:11,656
for something like this again.

954
01:18:14,552 --> 01:18:15,624
Also,

955
01:18:17,624 --> 01:18:19,464
I like my current job.

956
01:18:22,168 --> 01:18:23,032
Mm.

957
01:18:27,608 --> 01:18:29,304
Onoda-san is a good person too.

958
01:18:30,488 --> 01:18:31,448
Huh?

959
01:18:33,544 --> 01:18:35,550
You mention another guy

960
01:18:35,575 --> 01:18:37,410
when I'm in a good mood?

961
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:41,848
You...

962
01:18:45,272 --> 01:18:46,792
You're a bit jealous.

963
01:18:53,336 --> 01:18:54,984
Ah, that hurts.

964
01:19:02,265 --> 01:19:03,176
Cigarettes...

965
01:19:07,512 --> 01:19:09,144
My mouth was lonely.

966
01:19:14,856 --> 01:19:15,912
Go ahead.

967
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:18,360
You can spoke.

968
01:19:28,392 --> 01:19:29,498
You'll make a good,

969
01:19:29,512 --> 01:19:30,818
understanding bride, Shima.

970
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:35,608
I guarantee it.

971
01:19:38,536 --> 01:19:39,544
Thanks.

972
01:20:58,552 --> 01:20:59,592
I...

973
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:09,224
Used to hate snow...

974
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,648
I never had good memories of it.

975
01:21:17,224 --> 01:21:18,040
Shima.

976
01:21:20,728 --> 01:21:21,752
Yes?

977
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,664
Thank you.
