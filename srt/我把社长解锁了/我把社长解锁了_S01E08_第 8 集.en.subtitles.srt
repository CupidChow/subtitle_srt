IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,914
1 YEAR AGO

4
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,590
Thank you so much

5
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,884
for trusting me
and joining hands with Bumyoung.

6
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,052
That's not true.

7
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,806
I chose Bumyoung because
it's Silver Lining's optimal partner.

8
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,229
You haven't changed.

9
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,773
You still don't mix
business with personal.

10
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,150
Then…

11
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,985
Okay, I'll treat you
professionally as well.

12
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,236
Sure.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,572
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes, Ms. Oh.

14
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,537
I truly am

15
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,664
looking forward to working with you.

16
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,249
It is my pleasure.

17
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,480
You were just being exploited too.

18
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,357
Just come clean…

19
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,114
You should've expected this much.

20
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,198
Now.

21
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,575
BASED ON WEBTOON UNLOCK THE BOSS
(UNLOCK MY BOSS) BY PARK SEONG-HYUN

22
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,871
He's pointing a gun. What now?

23
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,878
You're holding on to your phone
in this situation?

24
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,089
It must be very important to you.

25
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,134
I was wondering who was behind
the job seeker from the boonies.

26
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,511
I guess I'll find out soon.

27
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,431
Stop digging and pretend
you don't know anything

28
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,518
if you at least want to live.

29
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,577
You just let him go?

30
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,079
Yes.

31
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,499
How could you let him take the phone?
Mr. Kim has been abducted.

32
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,253
No.

33
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,214
It was our plan.

34
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,719
It's still too dangerous.

35
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,512
We have no other choice.

36
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,139
Even if we catch Mr. No,

37
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,850
he'll probably end up like
Mr. Nam and Mr. Kwak,

38
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,269
and it will only result in more victims.

39
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,898
I understand what you mean,

40
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,692
but I can't approve.

41
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,985
Act like yourself

42
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,404
and convince me with irrefutable logic.

43
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,990
There is no better option.

44
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,618
This way,
I can watch and listen to everything

45
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,077
that is done or said by the enemy.

46
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,706
What are you going to do if they harm you?

47
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,084
I am just a phone in their eyes.

48
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,129
-We should ask Se-yeon, and--
-Don't.

49
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,590
Ms. Jung will oppose it even more.

50
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,091
We have no time.

51
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,885
This plan

52
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,179
is between you and me.

53
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,681
Are you insane?

54
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,600
You should've stopped him no matter what.

55
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,602
I'm afraid I'm going to have to call--

56
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,312
Come on.

57
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,772
You saw it too.

58
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,983
Bumyoung can influence the police too.

59
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,445
Firm beliefs won't do. We need evidence.

60
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,047
Yes.

61
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,508
I'm moving to another motel.

62
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,428
We'll know who he talks to, where he goes,

63
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,681
and ultimately,

64
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,807
who is controlling him.

65
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,394
Starting now,

66
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,021
we're going to find out everything.

67
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,623
BUMYOUNG MOTOR GROUP

68
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,883
Quiet.

69
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,846
I can't hear.

70
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,223
Okay. I'll be more mindful.

71
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,535
What is it? Is something wrong?

72
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,414
I heard gunshots.

73
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,041
No way.

74
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,556
Is someone screaming?

75
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,312
I see.

76
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,397
What?

77
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,193
It's from a game.

78
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,569
What?

79
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,036
My gosh.

80
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,997
Talk about being brazen.

81
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,583
His identity was unveiled,
but he's just playing games.

82
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,629
He's different from Mr. Nam.

83
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,964
He's not fleeing.

84
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,842
It shows how perfect his crime was

85
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,052
and how confident he is.

86
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,972
Then we need conclusive evidence.

87
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,184
That means Mr. Kim was right.

88
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,144
Yes.

89
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,983
But what would happen
if the phone dies or Mr. No turns it off

90
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,277
before Mr. Kim can collect any evidence?

91
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,696
Then there's nothing we can do.
We can't even locate the phone.

92
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,865

Don't worry.

96
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,875
We made the necessary preparations.

THE PASSCODE IS INCORRECT

100
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,348
UNOFFICIAL BOSS

101
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,459
Mr. Park.

102
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,545
Mr. Park.

103
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,049
Mr. Park.

104
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,178
You startled me.

105
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,430
Aren't you going to work?

106
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,473
Right.

107
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,557
My alarm…

108
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,558
I forgot.

109
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,144
Right. Kim Seon-ju
isn't here starting today.

110
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,234
"Starting today"?

111
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,786
CEO PARK IN-SEONG

112
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,796
What?

113
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,180
Well…

114
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,099
I got a call from Mr. Kim in the morning,

115
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,478
and he said everything was going smoothly.

116
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,395
Isn't it a relief?

117
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,314
I'm so worried.

118
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,483
Don't worry.

119
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,109
Mr. Kim

120
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,737
is someone who would survive
in a tiger's den.

121
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,739
He's "smart," after all.

122
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,282
I'm not worried about Mr. Kim.

123
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,575
Then about whom?

124
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,954
-I'm worried about you.
-Sorry?

125
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,413
Mr. Park.

126
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,376
Yes, Mr. Kim. What is the matter?

127
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,505
Pardon?

128
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,466
Well, I'm here because…

129
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,427
You didn't give your approval yet.

130
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,056
What do you mean?

131
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,102
As you were appointed,

132
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,605
you said you would
sign everything electronically.

133
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:29,443
You haven't checked any emails since
yesterday. What do you want us to do?

134
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,362
I see.

135
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,657
I was about to check in my office now.

136
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,701
-Pardon?
-Follow me inside.

137
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,579
2022 FIRST-HALF BUSINESS REPORT

138
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,871
2022 SECOND-HALF REORGANIZATION PLAN

139
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,957
When am I going to read all of this?

140
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,500
Why are there so many?

141
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,260
This one about operating revenue…

142
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,263
is not what I'm looking for.

143
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,347
That's not it.

144
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,268
The overseas business next year…

145
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,859
The matter of abolishing
the AR glasses department.

146
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,653
The AR glasses?

147
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,406
They work like a charm though.

148
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,745
We agreed upon calculating the adequacy
of departments with low ROI.

149
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,207
RO…

150
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,881
We failed to secure Series B funding
from venture capital in Singapore.

151
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,301
You have to decide whether to abolish
the department or request Bumyoung…

152
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,930
for an increased budget, Mr. Park.

153
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,060
What is your decision?

154
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,939
I need some time to think.

155
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,900
Since it's an important matter.

156
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,155
You have to make a decision
before the corporate meeting.

157
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,198
Of course.

158
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,450
By the way,

159
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,202
when was that again?

160
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,411
Tomorrow.

161
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,080
Excuse me?

162
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,291
Tomorrow.

163
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,507
Tomorrow…

164
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,094
Tomorrow.

165
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,056
What? 400 people?

166
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:27,103
Silver Lining only has
the source technology for the AR glasses.

167
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,898
The product and content production
is carried out by a subcontractor.

168
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,359
So,

169
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,653
if I choose to terminate it,

170
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,363
the livelihood of about 400 people…

171
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,199
will become uncertain.

172
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,702
On the other hand,
if we sustain an unprofitable project,

173
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,205
it will put Silver Lining at a loss.

174
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,008
And I have to
make that decision by tomorrow?

175
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,679
-Yes.
-Gosh.

176
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,891
We're short on time.

177
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,017
I must call…

178
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,110
PARK IN-SEONG

179
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,245
PARK IN-SEONG

180
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,955
-What's the matter?
-Mr. Kim?

181
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,709
I told you to wait until I call you.

182
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,502
It was just so urgent.

183
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,547
Do I have to abolish
the AR glasses department?

184
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,506
About that…

185
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,549
Wait.

186
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,801
Someone's coming. Hang up.

187
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,094
Mr. Kim.

188
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,805
He hung up.

189
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,976
SMARTPHONES EXPERT

190
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,021
Welcome.

191
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,402
Salute!

192
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,155
I heard you were discharged.

193
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,365
Long time no see.

194
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,075
How have you been?

195
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,370
Well, as you can see,
I made use of my specialty.

196
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,789
Here.

197
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,334
You can unlock it, right?

198
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,045
This is a piece of cake.

199
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,258
I'll come back after work.

200
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:04,969
Goodbye.

201
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,185
Shall I get to work?

202
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,273
Why are you trying to unlock that?

203
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,734
Can you please be quiet?
I need to concentrate.

204
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,657
Gosh, it's not In-seong's birthday.

205
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,952
Why won't this unlock?

206
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,371
That's the whole point of a lock.

207
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,668
Can't you just put it under his pillow?

208
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,170
What do you mean?

209
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,215
In-seong's future depends on this.

210
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,467
The shaman told me

211
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,345
I have to put it
near something In-seong cherishes.

212
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,681
She seemed fake.

213
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,849
Why I ought to…

214
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,643
You must have money to burn.

215
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,228
You're going to bring bad luck.

216
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,689
Give it to me.

217
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,445
What are you doing?

218
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:08,198
You said it needs to be placed
near something he cherishes.

219
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,869
When he wanted to be an actor,
he always stared at this TV.

220
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,162
-Gosh!
-Gosh!

221
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,006
You must have money to burn.

222
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,176
That hurts.

223
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,233
Are you okay?

224
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,029
I used to envy CEOs.

225
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,785
I was always
in a position of having to be chosen.

226
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,748
When I auditioned for roles

227
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,500
and when I looked for jobs…

228
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,463
I wondered why I was never chosen.

229
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,055
I thought, "How nice would it be
if the choice was mine?"

230
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,979
But…

231
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,856
considering the fact

232
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,567
that my choices

233
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,529
can affect a person's life,

234
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,242
the happiness of a family,
and the fate of a company…

235
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,454
all I can do is worry.

236
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,214
It makes me…

237
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,927
respect Mr. Kim even more.

238
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,601
There is a phrase that I once saw
after following Mr. Kim to a golf meeting.

239
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,731
"Professionals direct their balls."

240
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,110
"Amateurs are led by their balls."

241
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,614
Worrying right now won't help you.

242
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,701
You need to come up with a plan.

243
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,832
I'll help you.

244
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,339
It won't unlock?

245
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,133
It must have some sort of protection.

246
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,217
It's impenetrable.

247
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,678
You could've tried entering every number.

248
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,638
I already tried that.

249
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,932
I tried multiple times,
but it just won't work.

250
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,270
How is that possible?

251
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,564
It's not. This has never happened
to me before.

252
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,150
Seriously. It just makes no sense

253
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:52,154
unless someone kept changing
the passcode between each attempt.

254
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,368
Hello?

255
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,913
I'll leave right now.

256
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,248
Se-yeon, hurry.

257
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,216
-He contacted you?
-Yes.

258
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,176
He said Mr. No is on the move.

259
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,385
Please go to BY Hotel.

260
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:42,162
Only those who have Mr. Oh's permission
can enter the BY Hotel lounge.

261
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,082
Then they'll probably discuss
something important today.

262
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,838
-Hello, Mr. Oh.
-Hello.

263
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,881
Great job with the new product.

264
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,424
-Yes, thank you.
-All right.

265
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,765
-Let's go golfing someday.
-It would be an honor.

266
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,517
-Sure.
-I will be waiting.

267
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,227
Hello.

268
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,817
He is running late.

269
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,819
I will contact him.

270
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,279
It's fine.

271
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,864
I can wait.

272
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,074
He is a busy man after all.

273
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,454
What about Baro Version 4.0?

274
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,080
I'm still looking into it.

275
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,959
Keep your eye on

276
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,503
both Ms. Oh and Mr. Park.

277
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,049
Actually, about Mr. Park's phone…

278
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,845
Hold on.

279
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,349
This isn't the time to discuss it.

280
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,603
Why did he stop him
in the middle of his sentence?

281
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,567
I clearly heard

282
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,445
a text tone before Mr. Oh stopped him.

283
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,159
I think I heard it too.

284
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,830
What the…

285
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,291
Who were you texting?

286
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,002
Don't tell me…

287
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,337
It's not true, is it?

288
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,882
Give it back.

289
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,760
The timing was just perfect.

290
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,721
I saw you touch your phone
after hearing about our destination.

291
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,266
Did you tell him
we were overhearing his conversation?

292
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,479
Cut it out. Give it to me.

293
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,274
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,567
This time,

295
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,528
you owe me an explanation.

296
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,540
KIDDO

297
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,708
What?

298
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,230
You're going to leave me too, right?

299
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,109
You can do whatever you want.

300
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,529
I'll always be alone anyway.

301
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,772
I grabbed him.

302
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,321
What now?

303
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:45,906
I'm scared.

304
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,117
-Damn it.
-Can you go home with me today?

305
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:52,913
Fortunately,

306
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,540
he didn't betray us.

307
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,586
Yes.

308
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,171
That is why

309
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,923
I now have something to do.

310
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,154
This is so delicious.

311
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,949
Aren't you hungry, Detective Ma?

312
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,785
Detective?

313
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,037
We staked out earlier.

314
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,997
Won't we

315
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,791
qualify as half-detectives?

316
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,005
Don't beat around the bush.

317
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,056
I'm sorry for doubting you.

318
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,190
By the way,

319
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,694
when did you exchange numbers with Min-a?

320
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,367
Does the kiddo not have a mom?

321
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,371
She passed away early on.

322
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,999
But she's grown to be a bright child.

323
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,667
That's amazing.

324
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,297
It's because she's well-off.

325
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,466
Her dad's the president of a big company.

326
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,353
What is this mess?

327
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,566
Goodness. What are you doing at this hour?

328
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,069
We didn't get to eat dinner
because of work.

329
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,322
You can go in and rest.

330
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,157
The dishes…

331
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,118
He'll wash everything.

332
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,457
This is my job.
It's what I get paid to do.

333
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,590
Gosh. How bland.
What should I do with this?

334
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,718
Should we add more salt?

335
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,513
Do you like spicy food?

336
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,515
Yes, I do.

337
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,101
What about you?

338
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,070
Thank you.

339
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:40,914
Oh, my gosh!

340
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,917
Try some. It's really good.

341
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,262
Here, have some water.

342
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,806
Are you okay?

343
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,349
You can't eat spicy food?

344
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,142
I asked you.

345
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,728
Your taste buds
contradict your appearance.

346
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,741
Is it just me or is mine smaller?

347
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,034
It's just you.

348
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,370
It's just…

349
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,289
Mine is definitely…

350
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,476
We're one family now.

351
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,398
Family in Korean means sik,
as in "eating," and gu, as in "the mouth."

352
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,943
People who eat together, just like us.

353
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,073
Screw family.

354
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,868
I see.

355
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,546
Where is the watch?

356
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,549
It looked expensive, so I sold it.

357
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,262
You're so consistent

358
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,223
when it comes to money.

359
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,976
Are you mocking me?

360
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,729
No. That is not it.

361
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:30,774
But

362
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,984
what's all that money for?

363
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,694
Is becoming a landlord your dream?

364
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,870
I haven't thought about it.

365
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,890
What's all that money for?

366
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,434
Is becoming a landlord your dream?

367
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,486
Harder.

368
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,495
-That's enough for today.
-Thank you, Coach.

369
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,207
-About your match tomorrow.
-Yes.

370
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,126
Don't push yourself.

371
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,254
During the national team tryouts?

372
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,381
Yes. You're only a junior.

373
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,800
You'll get a chance next year.

374
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,681
Manage your condition.

375
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,767
All right, Coach. Thank you.

376
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,113
Goodness. Let's go.

377
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,698
Gosh. Hold on.

378
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,492
It wasn't raining earlier.

379
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,702
Here.

380
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,663
Why are you giving me this?

381
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,707
I'm counting on you tomorrow.

382
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,209
-Goodness.
-Let's go.

383
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,796
You can probably compete in the match.

384
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,596
2000 SYDNEY OLYMPICS
NATIONAL BOXING TEAM TRYOUTS

385
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,723
-Nice.
-Good.

386
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,057
Good.

387
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,813
Move your feet.

388
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,398
Move.

389
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,944
-Move away.
-Punch back.

390
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,031
-Move away.
-Focus and move.

391
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,658
Snap out of it.

392
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,039
Don't hold him!

393
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,754
About your match tomorrow.
Don't push yourself.

394
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,195
Do you like money that much?

395
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,907
Hey, are you nuts? You bastard.

396
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,702
Do you even realize
how much I've done for you? You punk.

397
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,913
You know what?

398
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,082
You shouldn't have let me get so attached.

399
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,416
Am I wrong?

400
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,674
If this were your end game,

401
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,219
you shouldn't have reached out your hand
to someone in a bottomless pit.

402
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,014
Stop right there!

403
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,808
Hey!

404
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,146
22ND, FRIDAY
MEETING ON AR GLASSES

405
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,023
I have to attend the meeting tomorrow.

406
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,692
What do I do about AR glasses?

407
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,415
I should abolish it.

408
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,298
Can't I just sustain it?

409
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,395
Mr. Park, did you make a decision?

410
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,650
The meeting is in an hour.

411
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,734
Ms. Oh…

412
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,986
Are you going to
embarrass yourself in front of Ms. Oh?

413
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,573
He will let you know during the meeting.

414
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,408
I'm talking to him right now.

415
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,868
Please return to your office.

416
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,837
Should I say you're sick
and push back the meeting a few days?

417
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,674
If it were Mr. Kim,

418
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:51,344
he wouldn't have given up
on the AR glasses, right?

419
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,472
We saw how it can perform
with our own eyes.

420
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:59,018
The problem is we haven't been able
to come up with an idea that will

421
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,187
turn the AR glasses
into a profitable product.

422
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,106
That's why the deficit keeps increasing.

423
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,818
Is there really…

424
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,155
no way for both Silver Lining…

425
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,202
and the subcontractor
to benefit from them?

426
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,376
Did you hear from Mr. Kim?

427
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:24,877
No.

428
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,171
I guess he's facing difficulties.

429
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,425
He hasn't responded.

430
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,221
Mr. Kim.

431
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,685
Yes, Mom.

432
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,983
Can you buy us a TV?
I'll give you the money.

433
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,026
Why?

434
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,153
Your dad broke ours.

435
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,530
Don't worry about the money.

436
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,407
What size is it?

437
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,410
That's a good question.

438
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,494
I'm not sure.

439
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,496
It should be written.

440
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,082
Where?

441
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,461
I can't find it.

442
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,172
Then why don't you
go to the store yourself and check…

443
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,925
How? I don't know anything
about electronic goods.

444
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,011
This makes me so upset.

445
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,555
Mom,

446
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,515
I'll take care of it. Bye.

447
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,019
Let's go.

448
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,064
Hurry up.

449
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,231
Hey.

450
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,693
Gosh.

451
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,615
As I informed you in advance,

452
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,826
if the return on investment is low,

453
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,037
the AR glasses department
should be abolished.

454
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,371
You agree, right?

455
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,373
Mr. Park?

456
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,294
No.

457
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,881
I will expand the business.

458
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,725
Mr. Park.

459
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:07,188
Even now, we're facing a deficit,
but you want to expand the business?

460
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,858
Times have changed.

461
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,362
Taking a paternalistic approach
will cause the business to crumble.

462
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,073
That's right. Times have changed.

463
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,409
Private businesses, department stores,
and other offline stores

464
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,912
are seeing a decrease in sales,

465
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,414
while online sales are rapidly increasing.

466
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,794
The only reason
people visit stores in person

467
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,424
is to check the products
with their own eyes.

468
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,009
It's for my mother.

469
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,595
-Something she can wear to her reunion.
-Is it that one?

470
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,349
-Please come this way.
-I'll buy this then.

471
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,392
Come on, Mom.

472
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,396
Nobody shops in department stores
when shopping online is much cheaper.

473
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,814
Then why did you come here?

474
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:53,025
To see things for myself and try them on.

475
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,528
The last hurdle of online shopping,

476
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,824
the inconvenience of having to
see products in person

477
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,660
will be conquered
by Silver Lining's AR glasses.

478
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,329
What can a pair of glasses do?

479
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,875
Whether you're at home or at work,

480
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,253
as long as you have the AR glasses…

481
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,800
Let me see.

482
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,761
…you'll be able to see
the difference between a 65-inch

483
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,388
and a 75-inch Bumyoung TV.

484
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,223
This is just the right size.

485
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,479
You can also see the difference

486
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,941
between a Bumyoung SUV and a compact SUV.

487
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,028
If this technology becomes universalized,

488
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,155
The AR glasses,

489
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,532
much like the smartphones of today,

490
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,035
will become a necessity

491
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,370
that people can't live without.

492
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,210
Mr. Park, are you confident?

493
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,212
You're taking the risk of increasing

494
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,381
the investment costs
on a product that makes no profit.

495
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,552
Since times have changed,
so should the investors.

496
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,889
The tendency not to take risks.

497
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,017
And indifference to increasing value,
which then leads to

498
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,896
only investing in a business
that will guarantee profit.

499
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:12,813
Naturally,

500
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,483
considering the ROI,
that's the right call.

501
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,778
That is why investments are cut off

502
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,488
if things become slightly unstable.

503
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,409
However, we should not
be afraid of change.

504
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,372
The AR glasses will become

505
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,041
Silver Lining and Bumyoung's
win-win project.

506
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,543
I am certain

507
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,630
it will become
the product that fuels Industry 4.0.

508
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,645
Please share the product databases

509
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,022
of Bumyoung Distribution, Electronics,

510
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:59,277
and Motor Group with Silver Lining.

511
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,872
Mr. Park.

512
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,500
Yes?

513
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,175
You've done an amazing job.

514
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,810
What a relief.

515
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,563
Although it was in the nick of time,

516
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,190
Mr. Kim called right before the meeting.

517
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,942
What? That's not true.

518
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,901
He didn't call me.

519
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,236
What?

520
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,113
Then how did you…

521
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,329
ECONOMICS

522
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,914
POWER TRANSFER UNIT

523
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,530
MEDIUM-TERM BOND (1 YEAR TO 10 YEARS)

524
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,542
I got it to open.

525
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,670
Gosh.

526
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,843
Goodness.

527
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:48,761
What?

528
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,763
How did you do it?

529
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,848
You said you didn't know the code.

530
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,767
I know, right?

531
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,478
It was something I didn't even think of.

532
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:58,979
Why?

533
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,399
Was it something like "1234"?

534
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,693
-Goodness.
-No.

535
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,156
It was your birthday.

536
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,536
My birthday?

537
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,248
-It was my birthday?
-Yes.

538
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,758
I didn't know you two were that close.

539
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,718
My birthday.

540
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,683
-I'm dead tired.
-What?

541
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,105
Is he that happy?

542
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,109
Goodness.

543
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,699
PRONUNCIATION NOTES

544
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,751
In-seong worked hard.

545
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,759
Special…

546
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,266
Mr. Kim?

547
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,519
I called because Mr. No is washing up.

548
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,900
During the meeting today, I--

549
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,657
What do you mean by that?

550
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,096
Sure. That sounds great. Yes.

551
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,431
Go ahead with it.

552
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,351
All right, Mr. Oh.
You made the right decision.

553
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,810
You are absolutely right, sir.

554
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,314
You can't do this.

555
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,359
Let go.

556
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,822
It's all right.

557
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,115
You may leave.

558
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,577
Mr. Park!

559
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,579
What is this impertinence?

560
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,706
We're in the middle of a meeting.

561
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,210
I came here to attend the meeting.

562
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,963
The topic of today's meeting is,

563
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:36,011
"Who killed Mr. Kwak Sam-su?"

564
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,689
I understand you may be distraught
by your employee's death.

565
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,315
But…

566
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,153
hasn't it been concluded
that he committed suicide?

567
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,116
No.

568
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,535
It was concluded as a suicide

569
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,745
through someone's influence.

570
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,206
Someone murdered Mr. Kwak

571
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,249
and also…

572
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,377
tried to frame me as the suspect.

573
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,258
And I came to the conclusion
that the culprit is inside this room.

574
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,429
-Unbelievable.
-How did you come up with that nonsense?

575
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,681
This is ridiculous.

576
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,599
What?

577
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,516
The culprit?

578
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,853
What are the bodyguards doing?
He should be dragged out.

579
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,187
Call the bodyguards.

580
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,275
It's locked. Check that door.

581
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,403
This one is locked too.

582
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,781
None of you are allowed to take
even a single step out of this room.

583
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,285
It's an emergency!

584
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,662
Mr. Oh is locked
inside the conference room. Hurry.

585
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,679
Mr. Park.

586
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:05,059
If something like that
really happened to Mr. Kwak,

587
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,311
it should not be ignored.

588
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,855
Rather than this conference room,

589
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,775
you should go
to the police station and ask for help.

590
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,235
By the way,

591
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,948
in your supposed list of suspects…

592
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,327
Am I included?

593
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,084
Yes.

594
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,587
You're at the top of the list.

595
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,302
What are you all waiting for?
He needs to leave.

596
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,179
-Don't do this!
-What are you doing?

597
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,557
You shouldn't be here. Please leave!

598
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,894
-Please leave!
-Please leave!

599
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,896
-Please leave!
-Mr. Oh, we should go.

600
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,691
Hold on!

601
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,235
The thing is…

602
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,945
That seems to be the only exit.

603
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,616
As soon as everything settles down,
I will escort you.

604
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,227
Mr. Kim?

605
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,564
I called because Mr. No is washing up.

606
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,276
During the meeting today, I--

607
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,360
I found it.

608
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,573
I found the confidential
document envelope.

609
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,161
What do you mean by that?

610
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,329
You found the document envelope?

611
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,093
I'm sorry I'm late.

612
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,970
It's okay.

613
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,848
It can happen.

614
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,354
Mr. Oh has it.

615
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:19,485
That means he targeted you to obtain
the Baro Version 4.0 beta test results.

616
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,446
Mr. Kwak too.

617
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:26,492
If we can just get the envelope
in our hands, we can ask Mr. Oh.

618
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:30,579
We should check his office first.

619
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,208
How do we do that without anyone knowing?

620
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,376
You need to distract everyone.

621
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,004
In the meantime,
Ms. Jung and Mafi will look for it.

622
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,131
Fortunately,

623
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,383
the Vice Chairman's office has no cameras.

624
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,469
Because he has a lot to hide.

625
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,309
You just need to hold out for the others.

626
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,025
You can't leave anyway. Gosh.

627
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:04,446
I wasn't going to go
as far as locking the doors.

628
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,615
-My goodness.
-Goodness.

629
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:09,201
Please just sit down, everyone.

630
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,412
Everything depends on you, Mr. Park.

631
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,915
Buy as much time as you can.

632
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,333
-What?
-Come on.

633
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,553
I found it.

634
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,517
SILVER LINING REQUEST
FOR BUSINESS PROMOTION PROPOSAL

635
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:34,977
This isn't it.

636
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,020
-Grab him.
-Catch him.

637
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,313
Goodness.

638
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,290
This way, sir.

639
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,712
How outrageous.

640
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,853
-Yes?
-Did you find it?

641
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,771
Not yet.

642
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,440
He's heading up right now.

643
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,483
That's not good. Stall for a little more.

644
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,635
My goodness.

645
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,486
What's going on?

646
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:10,113
Mr. Oh, let's leave the building.

647
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,578
BUMYOUNG GROUP
VICE CHAIRMAN OH YOUNG-GEUN

648
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,891
Here.

649
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,396
We found it.

650
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,440
Why can't you
manage the building properly?

651
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,944
Bring me a new pair of clothes.

652
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:49,986
Yes, sir.

653
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,363
Goodness.

654
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:54,116
I can't even open my eyes.

655
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,660
Gosh.

656
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,961
-Your clothes will be prepared right away.
-Okay.

657
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,797
I can't believe this.

658
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,719
Mr. Oh, here are your clothes.

659
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,558
Did anyone come in here while I was away?

660
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,018
No, sir.

661
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,478
-What now?
-Call him in!

662
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,028
Are you okay, sir?

663
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,784
Mr. Park

664
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,580
was different from usual today.

665
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,124
Look into it.

666
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,626
Yes, sir.

667
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,305
Gosh.

668
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,525
I'm glad you're safe.

669
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,571
CONFIDENTIAL

670
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,114
Did you run into any problems?

671
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,119
-No.
-No.

672
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,542
All right, then.

673
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,502
Shall we go?

674
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:46,014
Did the sprinkler system malfunction?

675
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,308
It was all Mr. Park's doing.

676
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,644
OH BUM-GEUN

677
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,895
Mr. Park?

678
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,189
Apparently, he barged in
during the meeting

679
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:58,902
and proposed the topic of,
"Who killed Mr. Kwak Sam-su?"

680
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,208
Detective Choi gave this to Mr. Oh?

681
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,378
He probably found it
in Mr. Kwak's car, right?

682
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,588
Yes.

683
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,968
Mr. Kwak told me
that he had something to give me.

684
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,052
CONFIDENTIAL

685
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,724
BARO VERSION 4.0 BETA TEST REPORT

686
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:39,776
BETA TEST RESULTS FOUND FATAL FLAWS,
RAISING CONCERN FOR THE SELF-DRIVING CAR

687
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,278
He tried to give me this
and reveal the truth, but…

688
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,954
I'm leaving now.

689
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,249
I'll check and get back to you.

690
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,715
MR. KIM

691
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,971
He's finally moving.

692
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,475
I'll turn on location tracking,
so follow us.

693
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,732
You have to catch them on the hop.

694
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,802
PARKING LOT

695
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,434
It's Impyeong Mental Hospital.

696
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,640
Why did you ask for a meeting?

697
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,789
I think he's going to a ward.

698
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,384
How is he?

699
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,227
Mr. Nam?

700
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,236
Step on it.

701
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,037
Were we ever

702
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,248
on good enough terms
to enjoy eating dinner together?

703
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,085
Was it you?

704
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,465
What are you talking about?

705
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,842
Mr. Kwak.

706
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,261
Did you kill him?

707
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,184
Just like Kim Seon-ju?

708
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,565
No.

709
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,500
Kim Seon-ju…

710
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,087
is alive.

711
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,764
A soul that has experienced betrayal

712
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:02,849
is wandering around.

713
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,267
This is you, right?

714
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,685
Is it really possessed?

715
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,021
On top of that, the person who died
due to medical malpractice is…

716
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,772
My boss is here!

717
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,817
Why should we keep the law when facing
people who don't care about the law?

718
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,987
Was it you?
He had the report for Baro Version 4.0.

719
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,281
You abducted Mr. Kim.

720
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,160
-You don't seem surprised.
-It's true that I had false hopes.

721
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,870
I will make an offer you can't reject.

722
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:28,249
When you're left with no choices,
there's always one option left.

723
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,961
