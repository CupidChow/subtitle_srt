-Yes, sir.

00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,507
-There's a rock.
-Okay.

5
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,925
Look if he's there, you punk.

6
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,303
Where did this jerk go?

7
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,889
What? He's over there!

8
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,098
-Hey!
-Over there.

9
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,349

MONDAY, JUNE 10TH, 2022

00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,202
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RUN THE SYSTEM?
YES

13
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,257

How could this be true?

17
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,284
It's more realistic
that it was an AI than the idea

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,870
that his soul

19
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,499
was trapped inside the phone.

20
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,168
I really thought it was Kim Seon-ju.

21
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,797
That's why I trusted everything it said

22
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,009
and promised to find Mr. Kim's body back.

BASED ON WEBTOON UNLOCK THE BOSS

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,179
I wanted to

25
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,306
help Min-a…

26
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,314
meet her dad again.

27
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,527
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,698
What has already happened does not matter.
Focus on what you need to do.

29
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,826
Baro Version 4.0 is now in our hands.

30
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,329
Make the necessary arrangements
to launch the self-driving car.

31
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,539
Pardon?

32
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,374
It will be the walk-off home run

33
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,293
that will help the shareholders
make up their minds.

34
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,340
But Mr. Oh will not let that happen.

35
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,136
Captain No.

36
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,600
I think

37
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,603
it's time.

38

CHUNGBUK NURSING HOME

00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,413
Can we

40
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,415
catch Oh Mi-ran now?

41
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,752
I'm sorry, but not yet.

42
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,587
Why not? Kim Seon-ju…

43
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,344
Mr. Kim's body alone
can prove her to be guilty.

44
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,140
There is no connection
to prove her conspiracy to commit murder.

45
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,603
Before we find that connection,

46
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,189
keep Mr. Kim's current state a secret.

47
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,317
He's right.

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,903
Min-a will also be shocked
if she hears about this.

49
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:11,000
Since we're here, why don't we
go visit your mother as well?

50
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,210
-Okay.
-Yes.

51
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,007
Father. What…

52
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,135
Am I even your father?

53
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,929
What's wrong?

54
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,849
Everyone in the village keeps asking me

55
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,226
if you're okay.

56
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,812
But I, as your father,
couldn't even say a word.

57
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,689
Well…

58
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,482
I came here to tell you.

59
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,317
-Good thinking. Go ahead.
-Yes.

60
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,111
Don't leave out a single detail!

61
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,613
Okay. All right.

62
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,950
So the thing is…

63
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,499
So…

64
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,670
because the former CEO ended up like this,

65
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,840
you became the interim CEO?

66
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,803
It all happened so suddenly.

67
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:08,474
You could've at least given us a hint
if you knew we would be worried.

68
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,312
I was going to tell you
after sorting out everything.

69
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,938
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,481
Is that the truth?

71
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,943
You weren't conned
and certainly not vice versa, right?

72
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,363
Mom, I'm In-seong. Park In-seong.

73
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,408
-Goodness.
-Yes, I trust you.

74
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,451
Then…

75
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,954
what about her?

76
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,165
Her?

77
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,296
Let me introduce myself properly.

78
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,424
I am Jung Se-yeon,
Mr. Park's personal assistant.

79
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,385
Assistant?

80
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,557
-Go back home safely.
-Okay.

81
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,186
What's wrong with this?
Why isn't it working?

82
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,353
Will it not start?

83
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,731
No. Wait.

84
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,570
Didn't we ride this when we went to
the movie theater for the first time?

85
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,948
Gosh, then it's probably
around 20 years old.

86
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,116
Get a new car.

87
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,994
What are you saying? Why would I?

88
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,038
Harry Potter is completely fine.

89
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,749
-Harry Potter, what's wrong?
-Harry Potter?

90
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,375
What?

91
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,461
What's going on?

92
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,936
Harry Potter? Is he serious?

93
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,940
How many times do I have to tell him
that naming cars is so tacky?

94
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,861
It might be junk to you,

95
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,490
but to your dad, it's a truck
that's been with him for ages.

96
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,159
What?

97
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,248
Some people turn on classical music

98
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,582
for their plants,

99
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:01,170
and others polish rocks every day.

100
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,592
If you devote your affection
and time to something,

101
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,929
it becomes your friend or your family.

102
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,437
Look. It's working now.

103
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,190
No problem.

104
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,823
Mr. Kim can still talk,
though his body may have disappeared.

105
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,201
But even though…

106
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,164
I can see my mom in front of my eyes,

107
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,250
I can't talk to her.

108
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,046
Who could consider her to be alive?

109
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,994

Is this on now? Is it?

114
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,011
The Baro Version 4.0
server room caught on fire.

115
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,680
Everything's been restored now.

116
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,973
Okay. And?

117
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,518
Listen carefully.

118
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,397
You are not Kim Seon-ju.

119
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,984
You're an AI that's been programmed
to act like Kim Seon-ju.

120
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,488
What are you talking about? That's absurd.

121
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,616
Right before the accident,

122
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,995
Mr. Kim started the Baro 4.0 beta version.

123
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,498
If it's hard to believe,
go into the system and check.

124
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,376
SOFTWARE VERSION: 4.0 BETA

125
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,048
So…

126
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,886
you're saying I'm not Kim Seon-ju?

127
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,389
Why do you think

128
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,393
Mr. Kim ran Baro Version 4.0
before he was attacked?

129
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,103
He probably

130
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,314
wanted you to chase after
the truth in his stead.

131
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,318
Up until now,
we've been acting according to his wishes.

132
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,531
So until we're done
handling this whole situation,

133
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,908
I'm going to treat you like you're Mr. Kim

134
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,413
and act as the Mr. Park
that Mr. Kim hired me to be.

135
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,250
What about you?

136
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,503
That's some irrefutable logic.

137
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:53,843
Please help me until the end, Mr. Park.

138
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,388
I'm at your service,

139
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,766
Mr. Kim.

140
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,772
It's a ticket to America tomorrow.

141
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,321
Thank you for your concern.

142
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,242
But the thing is, I've gotten pretty busy.

143
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,786
Do you think I'll just sit back and watch?

144
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,414
Are you going to report me?

145
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,042
I thought you didn't want to sit
on a throne that's lost its honor.

146
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,503
That could be better

147
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,547
than letting you sit on the throne.

148
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,636
I didn't know your affection
for Bumyoung was this small.

149
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,722
If that's the case, I'm disappointed.

150
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,392
For a moment,
I thought you had some immense loyalty.

151
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,019
What did you say?

152
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,480
Breaking news.

153
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,649
Vice Chairman Oh Young-geun
of Bumyoung Group

154
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,151
has just been taken
to Seoul Nambu Police Station.

155
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,071
No, who was his accomplice
as well as the one who made the report,

156
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,115
claims Oh is guilty of breach of duty,
misappropriation, and proxy murder.

157
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,700
It's shocking news to the nation.

158
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,703
-Next, we have…
-Ms. Oh put all the blame

159
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,580
on Mr. Oh.

160
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,707
Why did Mr. No

161
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,751
choose to jump off the cliff

162
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,045
along with Mr. Oh?

163
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,801
So far, Ms. Oh gave people
a taste of sweetness

164
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,803
before luring them to her side.

165
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,263
To me, that was my mom.

166
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,057
And to Mr. Sim, it was his son.

167
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,726
But when we looked into it before,

168
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,312
Mr. No had no family.

169
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,731
That's it.

170
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,858
If it wasn't some sweet candy,

171
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,154
what did she use
to get No Wi-je to swear his loyalty?

172
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,908
If we can just figure that out,

173
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,829
we can fight back and create a fissure.

174
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,753
Bring that punk here this instant!

175
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,841
Let's see if he can babble
all he wants in front of me.

176
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,802
There's no need for that.

177
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,262
What?

178
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,391
Gosh. I know I can get stuff
out of you if I want.

179
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,602
But this time, it isn't you.

180
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,938
The methods are too sophisticated.

181
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,703
Okay.

182
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,040
What are you doing?

183
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,709
Well, it's nothing.

184
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:37,506
I was just wondering
how you first met No Wi-je.

185
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,050
Gosh.

186
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,887
Why should I tell you that?

187
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,100
Because I'm going to lock Oh Mi-ran up.

188
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,523
Wouldn't that be beneficial to you too?

189
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,868
No Wi-je was a professional soldier
before he became

190
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,369
Mr. Oh's driver.

191
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,206
He was known
to be an honorable and loyal soldier.

192
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:16,378
Everyone in this field knows
Mr. Oh prefers hiring former soldiers.

193
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,255
On top of that,

194
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,216
he's from Gangneung.

195
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,719
Why does that matter?

196
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,472
Mr. Oh was also born in Gangneung.

197
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,934
Bingo.

198
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,018
According to Mr. Oh,

199
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,938
his former driver suddenly quit,

200
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,607
so he received recommendations
from his secretarial staff.

201
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,735
In that case,

202
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,781
Mr. No probably caught his eye.

203
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,783
As if

204
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,369
someone set it up to be that way.

205
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,297
Great work today too.

206
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,885
Yes. See you in the morning.

207
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,222
Okay.

208
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,813
Good night.

209
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,953
-I'm disappointed.
-Min-a.

210
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,457
-In me?
-Yes.

211
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,543
Why won't you let me
talk to Dad these days?

212
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,128
Right.

213
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,588
Well…

214
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,217
He's been tired lately because of work.

215
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,053
Are you sure?

216
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,890
Yes.

217
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,558
I'm going to ask him myself.

218
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,035
Isn't this so cool?

219
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,078
In-seong taught me this.

220
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,835
What? Are you really that tired?

221
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,506
Fine. I'll let you go to bed.

222
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,301
Min-a.

223
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,345
To you…

224
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,351
do I look like your real dad?

225
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,477
Of course.

226
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,395
You don't play with me

227
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,856
and you keep saying you're busy.

228
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,109
Also, you love me and worry about me.

229
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,111
You're definitely my dad.

230
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,029
Right.

231
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,579
Ta-da.

232
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,289
What is that?

233
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,709
I saved my allowance to buy you a jacket.

234
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,216
I told you I'm going to become a designer
when I grow up. What do you think?

235
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,678
It's so pretty.

236
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,722
Thank you, my daughter, Kim Min-a.

237
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,435
-What's with the case?
-It's from Min-a.

238
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,107
You got a gift from your daughter.

239
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,150
I'm jealous.

240
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,949
DAD, MIN-A, IN-SEONG, UNCLE BUBBLE GUM

241
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,170
Next up is the trial run event

242
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,506
to commemorate the launch
of the self-driving car.

243
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,010
On October 3rd at 2 p.m., the car
will drive from the Bumyoung headquarters

244
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,803
to Gwanghwamun,

245
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:56,765
and cameras will be set up
for an international live stream.

246
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,519
All right. Please make sure
everything goes smoothly.

247
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,417
Were you taken aback the other day?

248
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,377
I apologize.

249
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,795
Don't mention it.

250
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,050
I should say I'm sorry
for coming back alive.

251
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,769
I was apologizing just now.

252
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,856
Thank you so much

253
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,068
for Baro Version 4.0.

254
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,528
I don't know how you did it,

255
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,907
but you got it done even without Seon-ju.

256
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,078
Shall we shake hands?

257
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,551
It's difficult enough
just retrieving Mr. Kim's body.

258
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,096
Will we be able to keep possession
of Baro Version 4.0?

259
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,890
They can have it if they want.

260
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,644
No, they need to take it.

261
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,104
What do you mean?

262
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,820
If they release a self-driving car
that hasn't been proven to be safe…

263
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,530
Do you know the Trojan Horse?

264
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,950
It's part of a Greek myth, right?

265
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,287
The Greeks gifted the horse out of wood
in order to enter the city of Troy.

266
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,705
Bingo.

267
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,835
The Greeks who were inside the horse
crept out and destroyed the fortress.

268
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,880
Are you saying
you're going to insert a malicious code?

269
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,175
I installed hacking software.

270
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,887
Baro Version 4.0

271
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,599
will become the Trojan horse
that destroys Oh Mi-ran.

272
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,162
PROTOCOL OF INTERROGATION OF A SUSPECT

273
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,172
As requested, here are his bank statements
and possessions of real estate.

274
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,850
-Move.
-Where are you headed?

275
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,101
Can I clock…

276
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,621
NAMBU POLICE STATION

277
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,747
REGARDING THE DEATH OF PARK YEONG-GWON…

278
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,165
ANALYSIS

279
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,167
This

280
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,502
will put No Wi-je in a quandary.

281
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,506
This is enough to create a fissure.

282
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,306
Gosh. You're willing to go
behind bars in her stead.

283
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,518
I thought this only happened
in the movies.

284
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,105
Your sense of loyalty is amazing.

285
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:35,984
Figures.

286
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,529
I guess that's why you almost

287
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,909
took all the blame for misappropriation
when you were in the military.

288
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,288
Seeing how you didn't receive
a dishonorable discharge,

289
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,375
Ms. Oh must've helped you out.

290
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,127
Do you think you're the only person,

291
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,214
Captain No,

292
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,509
to swear their loyalty to Oh Mi-ran?

293
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,017
Colonel Moon.

294
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,062
Wait.

295
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,148
I should be

296
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,736
calling him Assemblyman Moon Dong-sik now.

297
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,365
How did someone who's been in the military

298
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,450
all his life…

299
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,371
get the money or the connections

300
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,040
to run for office?

301
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,337
Cut to the chase.

302
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,977
This is Assemblyman Moon's
borrowed-name account.

303
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,645
On January 6th

304
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,439
of 2020,

305
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,816
500 million won was deposited.

306
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,611
And coincidentally,

307
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,865
that was the day you were discharged.

308
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,909
COLONEL MOON, WHO FOUND OUT…

309
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,079
Do you think Colonel Moon
was the one who came up

310
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,956
with the plan to discharge you?

311
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,877
Or do you think it was Oh Mi-ran,
who needed a suitable person

312
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,795
to plant near Mr. Oh?

313
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,051
Yes, congratulations, Mr. Moon.

314
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,600
There's no time. Please help.

315
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,726
I can't do it.

316
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,020
Yes, you can.

317
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,188
Why should I?

318
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,859
Because…

319
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,696
we were a part
of the 27th class of Evergreen Theater.

320
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,123
Close your eyes.

321
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,627
You are Lee Byung-hun.

322
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,505
You are

323
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,673
Yoo Ah-in.

324
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,427
Ready,

325
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:08,929
action!

326
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,859
This is ridiculous.

327
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:05,235
You were just being played by Oh Mi-ran

328
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,487
like a chess piece.

329
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,073
Confess everything

330
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,200
Oh Mi-ran made you do.

331
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,417
You're up against Bumyoung.

332
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,629
The best law firm in Korea has her back.

333
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,674
There's no evidence.

334
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,552
Do you think my confession
will be enough to arrest her?

335
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,890
Do you happen to have

336
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,642
any recorded phone conversations

337
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,103
-or any other--
-No.

338
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,524
Because I sincerely

339
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,402
devoted everything.

340
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,238
But…

341
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,325
Director Ha is different.

342
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,244
He was more focused
on his gains and losses.

343
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,793
That's interesting.

344
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,838
If you knew Director Ha had such evidence,

345
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,300
why did you do nothing about it?

346
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,805
Because we needed him

347
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,558
to keep Kim Seon-ju alive.

348
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,653
But

349
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,905
now that you have Kim Seon-ju,

350
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,282
there's no reason to keep him alive.

351
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,955
You should hurry.

352
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,332
Did…

353
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,876
she really send you?

354
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,759
-What?
-Your phone.

355
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,929
You should be used to it now.

356
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,640
Right.

357
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,358
It's for security. You understand, right?

358
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,528
Of course.

359
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,034
But I don't think I've seen you before.

360
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,706
Are you an amateur?
Didn't you watch the news?

361
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,293
Mr. No got arrested.

362
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,379
Right.

363
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,549
I am in charge from now on.

364
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,009
But…

365
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,177
why did you come find me?

366
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,721
I was told to stay low.

367
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,347
My predecessor informed me.

368
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,891
Hand over all the documents you have.

369
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,144
What documents?

370
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,356
I am aware of everything.

371
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,358
Wait,

372
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,319
what are you talking about?

373
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,533
Your lifeline.

374
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,704
Everything you gathered
in order to escape the blame.

375
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,374
Are you insane?

376
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,335
There's no such thing.

377
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,252
I see.

378
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,504
"There's no such thing."

379
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,216
Okay. I was going to handle
everything on my own,

380
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,719
but I guess
I have to inform the higher-up.

381
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,182
Goodness.

382
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,684
At such a young age…

383
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,228
Hold on.

384
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,569
He's such a great actor.

385
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,914
Is this everything?

386
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,499
It is.

387
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,461
Please forgive me this once.

388
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,970
I always keep my word.

389
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,053
Jung Hyeon-ho, you've still got it.

390
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,514
-Was my acting okay?
-Gosh, it was more than okay.

391
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,308
I thought I was watching a noir movie.

392
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,810
You're flattering me.

393
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,520
I was in the military.

394
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,021
Is that so?

395
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,982
Then shall we

396
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,860
have a drink of Maldives at mojito?

397
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,279
Before we go,

398
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,740
can't I smoke a cigarette?

399
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,534
Hey, we should've kept acting.

400
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,618
-Seriously.
-Should we?

401
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,120
That's enough.

402
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,872
Do you know who I am?

403
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,875
Se-yeon,

404
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,210
you insulted me.

405
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,677
Come to the airport with Ji-yeon.

406
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,180
We have to leave Korea right away!

407
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,884
Relax.

408
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,303
You're tiring me out.

409
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,846
Who are you?

410
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,599
You should be grateful.

411
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,561
You would've been on the road
to death if it wasn't for me.

412
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,189
I mean…

413
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,901
What's so complicated?
I can just go and arrest Ha Jong-baek.

414
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,239
Would he hand everything over
if you say you're a cop?

415
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,951
When it's evidence
that he was an accomplice?

416
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,455
You're right about your love
for crime shows.

417
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,998
You're quick-witted.

418
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,296
Let's approach him
like we're one of Ms. Oh's people

419
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,714
and secure evidence first.

420
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,342
All right.

421
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,845
After that, leave it to me.

422
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,560
Come on now.

423
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,280
Tomorrow is the day.

424
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,116
The launch of the self-driving car.

425
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,286
Ms. Oh's true colors

426
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,454
will be revealed to the world.

427
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,207
Yes.

428
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,501
Then

429
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,504
today will probably be the last day

430
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,590
we get to drink beer together.

431
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,177
It should be.

432
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,721
Sorry?

433
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,600
Did you hate drinking beer
with me that much?

434
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,604
No. I'm saying Ms. Oh
needs to get arrested.

435
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,567
Do you remember

436
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,820
how I told you

437
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,698
that I thought you were strange at first?

438
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,908
Of course I do.

439
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,953
I remember it so vividly.

440
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,997
But…

441
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,125
you were not a strange person.

442
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,460
You were a good person.

443
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,799
Don't get hurt tomorrow and be careful.

444
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,928
Are you worried about me?

445
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,642
Yes.

446
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,611
Thank you.

447
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,008
Thank you.

448
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:56,099
Thank you for joining us
for our self-driving car trial run.

449
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,478
When the smartphone was first released,

450
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:04,857
did you even imagine
that our lives would change this much?

451
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,944
The same goes for self-driving cars.

452
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,073
With our hands removed
from the steering wheel,

453
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,201
our cars will become a restaurant
for busy office workers,

454
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,453
a small movie theater for couples,

455
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:21,249
and a moving accommodation for travelers.

456
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,875
That's not all.

457
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,669
We will no longer have to

458
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,172
read heart-breaking articles
about a drunk driver

459
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,216
taking away the life of a family member.

460
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:34,595
Also, transportation equity
will be provided for vulnerable road users

461
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,889
such as children and the disabled.

462
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,854
Yes, that's right.

463
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,233
Today will be recorded as the day
in which Bumyoung

464
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,820
changed the paradigm of the entire world
with the level four self-driving car.

465
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,532
How long will it take
for the car to be commercialized?

466
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,410
How are you going to deal
with institutional and legal issues?

467
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,829
Please say a word
regarding competitive pricing.

468
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,749
-Is the self-driving car…
-Sure.

469
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,709
safe?

470
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,340
He's Bumyoung's partner.

471
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,636
Silver Lining's CEO, Park In-seong.

472
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,615
Self-driving car…

473
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,870
Shouldn't Ms. Oh,

474
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,748
who made generous investments
in the development

475
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,334
of this self-driving car,

476
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,338
be the first to ride it?

477
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:55,718
I would be grateful and honored.

478
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,846
Why don't you get in?

479
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,443
Ms. Oh got in the car.

480
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,154
We passed the first step.

481
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,368
What are you plotting?

482
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,915
Don't even think of
trying any funny business.

483
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,251
What do you mean?

484
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,754
I'm here as the CEO of Silver Lining.

485
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,850
Okay.

486
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,561
Everything's ready now, Ms. Oh.

487
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,437
We'll start moving then.

488
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,252
FIRST TRIAL RUN
OF LEVEL 4 SELF-DRIVING CAR

489
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,674
The Bumyoung self-driving car
has reached the center of the city.

490
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,969
It is impressive to see
the car driving in the middle of Seoul.

491
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,431
The interest of reporters,
as well as the public, is spiking.

492
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,669
Let's move on to the next step.

493
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,587
Okay.

494
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,685
What the…

495
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,563
Hey, this is a scoop.

496
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,440
Follow the car.

497
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,404
The car is headed in the opposite
direction of its original destination.

498
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,448
We don't know where the car,
which has gone off course, is headed.

499
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,582
There was a problem
with the original course,

500
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,626
so the car is searching for a new route.

501
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,051
Again,

502
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,178
the self-driving car has gone off course.

503
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,680
This is an emergency.

504
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,641
Any citizens near the site
need to move to a safer place.

505
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,065
This is why Mr. Kim disapproved.

506
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,233
Didn't he tell you?

507
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,612
If Baro Version 4.0,
through deep learning,

508
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,450
were to find a more efficient way
to reach its destination,

509
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,285
it will act of its own volition.

510
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,120
What are you saying, Mr. Park?

511
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,080
AI that starts to act of its own volition

512
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,833
is dangerous
as it could go out of control.

513
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,169
That is why Mr. Kim
wanted to delay the release.

514
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,880
However,

515
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,299
wanting to become the chairwoman,

516
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,052
you ignored his words

517
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,972
and even tried to kill him.

518
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,518
The alert is ready.

519
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,312
Then go ahead and send it out.

520
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,147
Okay.

521
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,455
I got it. I'll get moving now.

522
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,542
INTERROGATION ROOM

523
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,215
What is this? Is it a spam text?

524
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,386
It's hard not to click on clickbait.

525
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,018
Look.

526
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:58,854
What is this?

527
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,821
Isn't that Kim Seon-ju?

528
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,697
-Right?
-What in the world?

529
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,533
He was given emergency treatment,
so he is fine.

530
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:14,370
Until further notice,
you need to keep him alive.

531
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,337
Until further notice,
you need to keep him alive.

532
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,985
This was it?

533
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,946
Will this make him regain consciousness?

534
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,323
What will change?

535
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,993
We don't know
if he'll regain consciousness or not.

536
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,122
But at least it can prevent you
from creating additional victims.

537
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,416
Who is making you do all of this?

538
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,584
Is it Oh Young-geun?

539
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,710
Silver Lining's CEO…

540
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,755
Kim Seon-ju.

541
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,508
What a load of crap.

542
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,178
That's…

543
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,556
That's not possible.

544
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,752
It's over for you.

545
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,754
Get out.

546
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,438
Searching for heliports
within a 1km radius.

547
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,278
Starting route.

548
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,827
Damn it.

549
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,340
Yes.

550
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,302
Thank you, Detective Choi.

551
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,224
Once the video gets sent out,

552
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,601
Detective Choi is going to arrest Ms. Oh.

553
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,061
What if she runs away?

554
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,981
In that case,
we'll need to go with Plan B.

555
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,364
I will make it so that she goes
to the police station on her own.

556
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,622
Moving to a nearby heliport.

557
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,293
It's me.

558
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,128
Meet me there.

559
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,504
Get there this instant!

560
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:15,843
Gosh.

561
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,844
You are near your destination.

562
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,157
You have arrived at the heliport.

563
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,421
I've arrived. I'll get out now.

564
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,220
-Do you admit the charges?
-Did you abet a murder?

565
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,471
Admit to your crimes!

566
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,099
Just think of it
as a round of a racing game.

567
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,142
A realistic one at that.

568
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,812
Didn't you let me know

569
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:55,401
that any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic?

570
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,580
Come out.

571
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,251
Get out.

572
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,964
Let go!

573
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,135
Isn't that Kim Seon-ju?

574
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,679
-It is.
-It's Kim Seon-ju.

575
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,931
-He's really unconscious.
-It's real.

576
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,018
-Do you admit the charges?
-Do you?

577
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,563
It's all a lie. I've been framed.

578
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,400
I didn't do that.

579
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,694
This is all a setup. I'm being framed.

580
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,611
No.

581
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,660
I'm one of the people

582
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,204
who's been given orders by Ms. Oh.

583
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,000
I'll turn myself in.

584
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,545
He's lying.

585
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,965
He's framing me!

586
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,145
I don't know anything!

587
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,772
I'm being set up!

588
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,442
I didn't do it!

589
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:19,818
I didn't.

590
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:29,328
Ms. Oh was involved
in the attempted murder of Kim Seon-ju,

591
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,247
and the murders
of her brother Oh Seung-won,

592
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,874
as well as Nam Sang-won, Kwak Sam-su,

593
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,709
and…

594
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,130
Jang Ju-seong.

595
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,634
If it was to become the chairwoman,

596
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,678
she didn't hesitate to commit murder.

597
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,181
All the evidence…

598
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,184
is in here.

599
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,603
Goodness.

600
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,940
I can't believe a day like this has come.

601
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,400
Oh Mi-ran.

602
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,072
You are under arrest for inciting murders.

603
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,498
Take her.

604
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,834
-Why did you run away?
-Please say a word.

605
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,586
-Please look over here.
-Do you admit the charges?

606
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,047
-Please say something.
-Did you incite murders?

607
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,173
Please explain.

608
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,034
All right. Let's do this.

609
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,371
Get started.

610
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,255
A day has passed since Silver Lining's
Park In-seong shockingly exposed

611
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,631
the truth behind Oh Mi-ran.

612
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,260
The prosecution investigating
Oh Mi-ran's incitement of murder

613
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:11,221
performed a large-scale
search and seizure of around ten places

614
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,640
including the Bumyoung headquarters
and Bumyoung Motor Group.

615
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,019
The prosecution was able to perform
a quick search and seizure

616
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,353
as Park In-seong

617
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,440
and Inspector Choi Seong-jun
of Seoul Nambu Police Station

618
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:25,652
collected evidence
that proves Oh Mi-ran's crimes.

619
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,822
The prosecution released a statement

620
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:31,950
that they will use this opportunity
to find evidence for other cases

621
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,119
that Oh Mi-ran has been hiding.

622
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,415
The unprecedented incitement
of murder from a member

623
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:41,168
of an owner's family is making headlines
in foreign news as well.

624
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,378
People all around
the world are boycotting.

625
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,922
Bumyoung started off
by selling instant noodles

626
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,883
and has now collapsed like a sand castle.

627
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,178
It's over for Bumyoung.

628
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,931
The stock prices
are halving day after day.

629
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:55,849
I'm thinking,

630
00:48:55,932 --> 00:49:02,606
Bumyoung will slowly dissolve
or management authority

631
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:06,360
will be handed over
to professional managers.

632
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:10,322
It'll only be a matter of time
before the company seeks receivership.

633
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,324
Frankly, this controversy is too big

634
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:15,786
for the company to recover from.

635
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:19,164
Murder, disposal of corpses,

636
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,668
blackmail, attempt
at concealment, and abduction…

637
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,337
It's over for Bumyoung.

638
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,229
Good work.

639
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,150
I didn't do it on my own.
We did it together.

640
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,569
My work is now finished.

641
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,489
This is what Mr. Kim
wanted me to do, right?

642
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,120
Why did you have to say it like that?

643
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,955
Just as you've been doing,

644
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,749
you can continue
to watch over Silver Lining

645
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,961
and be a father for Min-a.

646
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,380
It's for Min-a's sake.

647
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,923
For me?

648
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,717
Yes.

649
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,304
At first, I thought it would be better
for you not to know

650
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,725
because I was worried you would get hurt.

651
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,853
But…

652
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,940
the more I thought about it,
I realized this wasn't right.

653
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,068
The longer we drag it out,

654
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,071
the more it could end up hurting you.

655
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,953
I'm sorry for lying to you.

656
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:41,621
What did you lie about?

657
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,500
To be honest…

658
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,798
the dad that's living inside the phone…

659
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,011
is not your dad.

660
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:57,929
What?

661
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,265
AI…

662
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,393
It's called artificial intelligence.

663
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,731
What's that?

664
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:13,528
It's like a computer that thinks and talks

665
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,906
like your dad.

666
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,455
Then isn't that my dad?

667
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,666
Se-yeon, where is my dad?

668
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,627
An unconscious dad.

669
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,505
A dad inside a phone.

670
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,133
It might be okay now,

671
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,678
but once Min-a grows older,
it'll be confusing for her.

672
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,389
One day,

673
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,727
she'll feel a sense of betrayal
after realizing that I was fake.

674
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,897
Kim Seon-ju was right.

675
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:53,568
An AI that starts to form emotions
is nothing but a mistake

676
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,155
and a critical bug.

677
00:51:58,824 --> 00:51:59,950
And such a bug

678
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,161
is something that must disappear.

679
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,498
Thank you

680
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,001
for everything you've done, Mr. Park.

681
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,546
DELETING

682
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,006
Mr. Kim.

683
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,443
In-seong, the phone.

684
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,404
Where is the phone?

685
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,364
Well…

686
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,290
"Deleting"?

687
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,293
What does that mean?

688
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,462
Min-a.

689
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,340
Deleting means…

690
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,052
being erased.

691
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,727
DELETING

692
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,687
Don't go.

693
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:36,713
DELETING

694
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,173
Dad.

695
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,767
Bumyoung Dragons' shortstop,
Jung Hyeon-jae, is on the verge

696
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,770
of becoming the home run champion
just two years after his debut.

697
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,480
During the draft two years ago,

698
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,483
when the Bumyoung Dragons
chose Jung Hyeon-jae,

699
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,736
many were shocked
and criticized their pick.

700
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:03,448
However, Jung Hyeon-jae silenced
the public opinion with his skills.

701
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,452
In the previous season,
Jung Hyeon-jae hit 28 home runs

702
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,329
and ranked fourth.

703
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,999
But this year, he hit over 30 home runs
and revealed his ambitions to become…

704
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,585
Inmate 2134.

705
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,048
Here,

706
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,884
it doesn't matter what we want to see.

707
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,763
What matters is what is played.

708
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,561
That was just a senior's
piece of advice for a newbie.

709
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,365
The food here is great.

710
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,283
-I agree.
-Did the picture come out well?

711
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,827
He sings so well.

712
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,374
-What?
-My goodness. Oh my gosh!

713
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:58,044
Isn't this the legendary
Cho Yong-pil? My gosh.

714
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,507
Gosh. I kept saying it was okay.

715
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,593
-Yes.
-But my son arranged a meeting for us.

716
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,472
-Your son is amazing.
-Yes.

717
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,142
That's not true.

718
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,978
This man. He's so silly. Gosh.

719
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,661
You seem pretty old

720
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,081
for an entry-level position.

721
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,375
Yes, I've been selling insurance,

722
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,462
serving a consigliere,
and shifting souls, so…

723
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,756
-Sorry?
-Pardon? What?

724
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,050
Anyway, I did the best I could

725
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,760
and ended up here.

726
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,056
But still, your age is…

727
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,808
But if you give me a chance,

728
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:54,976
I'll try my best…

729
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,229
I would also like to give you a chance,

730
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,315
but if you were born in 1984--

731
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,525
Age is just a number.

732
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,235
But that number

733
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,780
is 39.

734
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,491
Damn it.

735
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,495
I don't want this job either!

736
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,206
Why do you keep talking about my age?

737
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,999
Cut! Okay.

738
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,542
-That was great.
-Gosh.

739
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,419
-Good work.
-Thank you.

740
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,004
-Thank you.
-Great work.

741
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,549
-Good work.
-Thank you.

742
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,636
-Sir, thank you.
-Yes, good work.

743
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:34,099
Wasn't your previous show
Something Happened in Villa?

744
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,101
Yes, thank you for remembering!

745
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,977
Your emotions were great earlier.

746
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,271
I got goosebumps when you got angry.

747
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,609
All right. Yes, work hard.

748
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,486
-Thank you.
-Yes.

749
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,614
Great work. Thank you.

750
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,617
Sir, have a nice day.

751
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,327
-What?
-I'm a big fan.

752
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,125
-I told you to hurry.
-Why?

753
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,211
What do you mean? Your next schedule
is in Sangam. We have 30 minutes left.

754
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,754
-Okay.
-Hello?

755
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,840
Yes, we're in the car. We're on our way.

756
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,967
-Yes. Thank you.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

757
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,224
-For a long time…
-Isn't that In-seong?

758
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,601
Oh my gosh!

759
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,979
From the moment I first saw you…

760
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,983
Sorry, you can't take pictures. Sorry.

761
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,111
-Here you go, In-seong.
-Yes.

762
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,821
Are you okay? Do you need anything?

763
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,158
No, it's okay.
Will I be able to do a good job?

764
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,951
Of course. You'll do amazing.

765
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,120
Hey, I think they're ready.

766
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,251
Why is he acting so cool?

767
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,550
I am cool. I am charming.

768
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,260
I am courageous.

769
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,930
Ready, action.

770
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:34,969
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

771
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,695
Ms. Jung, later…

772
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,160
Sorry, Se-yeon. It's become a habit.

773
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,578
It's okay.

774
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,790
If it's awkward for you,
just call me whatever you'd like.

775
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,042
I'll keep calling you Mr. Park.

776
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,961
-It's a great way to distance ourselves.
-Wait.

777
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,171
Say you're sorry, Mr. Park.

778
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,549
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

779
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,801
Peekaboo!

780
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,138
Ms. Jung was being sarcastic just now.

781
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,807
I'm not that dense.

782
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,183
Really?

783
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,019
Why did you have to

784
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,438
follow us on our date?

785
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:31,401
Didn't we promise to have
gambas al ajillo and wine together?

786
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,989
-Mr. Park.
-You can just

787
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,283
take a sand bath.

788
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,828
Mr. Park, if you put me upside down,
I can't see anything.

789
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,123
It's so nice being here again.

790
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,293
I agree.

791
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:53,172
You were like a robot,
but this is where you laughed

792
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,925
for the first time.

793
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,094
Really?

794
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,972
"Really?"

795
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,100
What? I'm the only one who remembers?
Did you forget everything?

796
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,561
Of course I remember. How could I forget?

797
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,150
You're so lucky.

798
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,236
Your dream was to be an actor.

799
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,281
And you achieved your dream

800
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,035
in such a cool way.

801
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,332
That's not true.

802
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,500
I have another dream.

803
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,044
What?

804
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,887
Hold on. Why don't I hear talking?

805
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,807
Let's roll the closing credits.

806
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:00,907
Here it is.

807
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,492
You're going to be late.

808
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,745
Uncle Mafi will probably like this, right?

809
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:06,954
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

810
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,498
He'll love it.

811
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,750
I almost forgot.

812
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,393
I'll be back.

813
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:15,022
