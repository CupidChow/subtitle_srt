1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,283
ALL NAMES, GROUPS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND EVENTS

2
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,160
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,039
When AlphaGo was first introduced,

4
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:43,042
speculations arose
that AI might replace some jobs.

5
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,087
The age of AI judges may be drawing near.

6
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,549
The Supreme Court is considering
the introduction of AI judges

7
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,384
to civil cases such as damages…

8
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,888
Here is your beef bone soup.

9
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,014
-Here.
-Thank you.

10
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,229
-Hello.
-Welcome.

11
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,689
-How many?
-Three people.

12
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,733
-Are there any tables left?
-Take your pick over there.

13
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,277
There are so many people here.

14
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:10,987
Let's sit over there.

15
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,117
Excuse me.

16
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,412
Aren't all news broadcasts live?

17
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,955
Yes.

18
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,458
But that man…

19
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,507
You don't know about the AI news anchor?

20
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,012
The anchor's face and voice
are replicated using a computer.

21
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,138
Replicated?

22
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:42,143
Oh, my. What a strange world
we're living in.

23
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,063
-Jeez. Enjoy your food.
-Thank you.

24
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,153
Goodness, what should I eat?

25
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,199
What?

26
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,077
Are you eating alone?

27
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,458
I came to update the software today.

28
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,669
I see.

29
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,089
Thanks to you,
I get to eat at noon during the news.

30
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,301
You could end up on the streets.

31
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,344
Sorry?

32
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,681
If you can't prove
that you're better than the AI,

33
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,559
it could happen.

34
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,102
You're full of confidence.

35
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,728
If you're that confident,

36
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,690
why don't you make an appearance
on Nine O'Clock News

37
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,775
and explain Silver Lining's blueprint?

38
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,990
-Why should I?
-It's a special invite.

39
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,950
I have that much power.

40
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,495
Do you know how many followers
Silver Lining has on social media?

41
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,916
The account's influence
is greater than your program.

42
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,002
So why should I?

43
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,631
You chose to respond
to my goodwill with rudeness.

44
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,468
You must enjoy making a lot of enemies.

45
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,095
I enjoy stating the facts.

46
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,631
So…

47
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,760
not only was Mr. Kim Seon-ju attacked,

48
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,595
but his soul is also trapped
inside a phone?

49
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,972
And you picked up that phone.

50
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,351
How are you seeing and talking right now?

51
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,647
The camera is my eyes,
and the speaker is my mouth.

52
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,362
Is that so?

53
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,615
Technology these days is so great.

54
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,162
Then explain this.

55
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,123
Can you see this?

56
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,961
Someone as famous as you were attacked.

57
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,712
But there isn't a single article about it.

58
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,091
If they were able to attack me,
they would also be able to cover it up.

59
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,427
Gosh. You seem like a trickster.

60
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,012
If you think it's fake, bail out.

61
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,223
You're not the only one
who needs a billion won.

62
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,352
Is the 100 million won real money?

63
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,771
You can check for yourself.

64
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,357
Jeez. Do you think I won't be able to?

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,858
It's so easy to spend money.

66
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,071
Okay. I'm going to hop on
the wireless earbuds trend.

67
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,990
SALE PRICE: 350,000 WON
BUY NOW

68
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,867
It better not be fake money.

69
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,287
ORDER COMPLETE

70
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,331
What? It went through?

71
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,374
TRANSACTION APPROVED

72
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,256
Goodness.

73
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,384
What do I do now?

74
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,685
It's hot.

75
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,439
It's so hot.

76
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:15,773
This…

77
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,404
How is this happening to me?

78
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,282
Don't tell me…

79
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,993
Could this be…

80
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,954
The Truman Show?

81
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,418
THE PARK IN-SEONG SHOW

82
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,212
A person trapped inside a phone?
He believed that?

83
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,090
Is he stupid or what?

84
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,803
-Wouldn't you fall for a billion won too?
-I would.

85
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,722
This is hilarious.

86
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,454
Goodness.

87
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,290
-Mr. Park. Congratulations.
-Hyeon-ho.

88
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,710
This is strange.

89
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,130
Don't you think it's weird
that I became a CEO?

90
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,340
What do you mean?

91
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,135
Who says you can't become
the CEO of Silver Lining,

92
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,472
a subsidiary of Bumyoung, the largest
Korean company by market capitalization?

93
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,556
What the…

94
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,769
What is with this bib?

95
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,854
What's with your hair? Are you Superman?

96
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,527
A congratulatory gift.

97
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,197
MIRACULOUS LIGHT! LED

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,492
This LED mask meets the safety regulations
of the Korean government.

99
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,037
The light from 220 LED chips
will penetrate the skin

100
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,957
and make it supple and clear.

101
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,172
What are you doing?

102
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,341
Hyeon-ho, what are you doing?

103
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,801
Hyeon-ho.

104
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,469
Darn it!

105
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,058
Stay cool and just think about the facts.

106
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,893
Park In-seong.

107
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,565
Think rationally.

108
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,404
This is a dream.

109
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,865
This is reality.

110
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,701
A dream.

111
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,411
Reality.

112
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,164
A dream.

113
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,373
Reality.

114
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,375
A dream.

115
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,794
Reality.

116
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,797
A dream.

117
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,841
In-seong, come and eat.

118
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,092
Reality.

119
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,811
All right.

120
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,647
I've just been cast for the role of a CEO.

121
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,900
Park In-seong.

122
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,819
Show off your acting skills!

123
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,322
I think I've given you enough time.

124
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,240
I made up my mind.

125
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,743
To sign the contract,
register your fingerprint on the screen.

126
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,330
I will send the signed contract
to your email.

127
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,957
In-seong, let's eat.

128
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,135
There's one last thing I'd like to ask.

129
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,262
This will be your last question.

130
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,975
Because from now on,
you just have to do what I tell you to do.

131
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,356
I thought long and hard about this,
but I still don't understand.

132
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,317
If you're really Kim Seon-ju…

133
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,695
What I'm saying is,
if you're really the CEO of Silver Lining,

134
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,988
why did you choose…

135
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:57,245
Why did you choose me of all people?

136
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,581
I never wanted our relationship

137
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,709
-To last this short
-There he goes again.

138
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,338
I thought our son was here to lend a hand.

139
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,424
It's my fault for getting my hopes up.

140
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,634
That's not it.

141
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,346
I was practicing for the talent show.

142
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,473
What?

143
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,019
I got a job…

144
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,189
at Silver Lining.

145
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,232
What?

146
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,693
-Silver… What's that?
-Silver…

147
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,488
I've never heard of that company.

148
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,408
Are you sure it's a company?

149
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,911
Silver Lining is an IT corporation
and a pioneer of future technology.

150
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,582
For four consecutive years, job seekers
rated it as the most attractive company.

151
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,542
Even if you're a yokel,

152
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,961
you should take note
of this global enterprise.

153
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,629
"Yokel"?

154
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,717
Your phone sounds like it's agitated.

155
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,515
Then…

156
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,269
did you get a job at a conglomerate?

157
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,896
In-seong.

158
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,025
You worked so hard. Thank you.

159
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,737
Thank you, In-seong. I feel so proud.

160
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,363
Thank you.

161
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,602
I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.
PULL OUT.

162
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,322
I heard magpies crying at dawn.

163
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,616
Something good must be
waiting for you in Seoul.

164
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,284
Indeed.

165
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,872
He'll wear his phone out
at the rate he's fondling it.

166
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,376
I'm so proud of you.

167
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,295
All right.

168
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,465
PARK IN-SEONG
AMOUNT SENT: 50 MILLION WON

169
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,551
What? Fifty million?

170
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,513
I was just sending you money.

171
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,105
Where did you get this money?

172
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,523
I decided to end my lease.

173
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,566
She returned it this quickly?

174
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,529
Your landlady is as quick as lightning.

175
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,489
Where are you going to stay?

176
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,408
My company is providing housing.

177
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,160
It is a conglomerate after all.

178
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,792
I'm not sure if we can take it.

179
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,379
I'm sorry I haven't been a good son.

180
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,549
Use the money to cover
any urgent stuff first.

181
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,472
And build a huge greenhouse
for your Shine Muscats as well.

182
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,560
Jeez.

183
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,770
What is he saying?

184
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,692
Will he be okay? Should I follow him?

185
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,863
Leave him be. He's going
to the village head to brag.

186
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,076
Goodness.

187
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,245
I'm so proud of you.

188
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,012
Right. You can do practically
everything with a phone.

189
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,764
What is to stop a person
from being trapped in one?

190
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,956
Are you sleeping?

191
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,667
I never take naps.

192
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,295
I don't live my life half-heartedly.

193
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,467
Anyway…

194
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,387
Even if

195
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,265
you sent out an email,

196
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,602
will the employees believe I'm their boss?

197
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,854
They won't believe you.

198
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,565
But if it's my orders,
they will follow them.

199
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,944
I have the authority and their trust.

200
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,071
You don't need to do anything.

201
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,365
I'll make you the CEO.

202
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,627
We need to make a stop before that.

203
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,096
How can a pair of pants cost 530,000 won?

204
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,266
Sir, that is the price of the belt.

205
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,602
The jacket and pants
will cost 5.3 million won.

206
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,603
Pardon?

207
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,778
Where are you going?

208
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,530
It's too expensive.

209
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,574
-I'll just find something--
-Buy it.

210
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,575
Sorry?

211
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,038
Pay with this.

212
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,673
It looks good on you.

213
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,886
You look amazing.

214
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,429
Very nice.

215
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,182
Buy that too.

216
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,228
Get oversized sunglasses
because they're more stylish.

217
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,440
Mr. Park.

218
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,442
Mr. Park.

219
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,570
Mr. Park, you can stop now.

220
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,905
Stop.

221
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,973
No social media.

222
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,268
Check the contract.

223
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,812
NO SOCIAL MEDIA

224
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,230
What's over here?

225
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,578
This is so nice.

226
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,041
But do the bubbles always

227
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,002
disappear this quickly?

228
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,674
It's different from the movies.

229
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,844
Gosh, I should've brought
an exfoliating towel.

230
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,640
"I WISH I COULD UNSEE THAT"

231
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,309
Gosh, this is great.

232
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,486
I'll pay with this.

233
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,740
Room service orders
are paid upon checkout.

234
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,411
Oh, right.

235
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,620
I remember.

236
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,581
That's how it worked in Las Vegas too.

237
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,929
I had all this delicious food by myself.

238
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,348
Are you not hungry?

239
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,143
Will you feel full if I charge you?

240
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,187
-Where is the--
-I have never felt hungry inside here.

241
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,940
I see. Then…

242
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,902
What about sleep? Can you sleep?

243
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,656
I don't have time for sleep.
There's a lot of work to do.

244
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,241
What?

245
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,952
I need to find out
what happened in the mountains that day.

246
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,330
But I can't remember anything
that happened a week before the accident.

247
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,043
Is it memory loss

248
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,629
associated with
post-traumatic stress disorder?

249
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,549
That is why I had Baro check my schedule.

250
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,929
That day, I had a golf meeting
with the Bumyoung family,

251
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,016
and I was on my way
to a campsite to see my daughter.

252
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,977
I'm sorry I'm late, my little princess.

253
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,440
The GPS data of my phone
matches my schedule.

254
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,608
Then how did you--

255
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,110
This is where it starts getting strange.

256
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,866
It's a mountain route.

257
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,286
In order to end up on the spot
where you picked up the phone,

258
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,247
I should've hiked up from this point.

259
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,791
It's not even a hiking trail.

260
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,920
What happened to your car?

261
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,423
I've been searching for the same model
and color, but I found none.

262
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,800
They probably scrapped it.

263
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,511
I am looking for more clues,

264
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,513
but I can't do much inside a phone.

265
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,732
So this is what I need to help you with.

266
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,740
Was I even at the golf course that day?

267
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,831
Why did I suddenly get out of my car?

268
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,212
And why did I have to go up the mountain?

269
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,797
I need to find out the truth

270
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,633
to know how I ended up like this.

271
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,593
That is how

272
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,472
I'll return to my position
as a CEO and dad.

273
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,895
All right.

274
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,488
Everything's okay.

275
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,200
Is this your head?

276
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,981
Mr. Sim.

277
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,483
What happened to Mr. Kim?

278
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,612
You still can't reach him?

279
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,951
Haven't you known him since he was a baby?

280
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,830
-Is there no one you can contact?
-He has a lot of irons in the fire.

281
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,582
He could be on an overseas business trip.

282
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,042
Or…

283
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,628
he could be on a vacation.

284
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,673
He's not the type
to go on a spontaneous trip.

285
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,467
We never get to rest because of that.

286
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,783
What are you doing?

287
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,410
What do you mean?

288
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,955
Why are you leaving the phone here?

289
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,794
Doesn't everyone leave their phone
next to them when they go to bed?

290
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,507
So you're saying two men
should lie on the same bed?

291
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,430
Why would you say it like that?

292
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,849
Gosh.

293
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,534
Should I turn the phone off
so you can rest?

294
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,618
Just leave it on.

295
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,455
I don't know what'll happen to me
once you turn the device off.

296
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,502
Before I go to work,
I want a definitive answer.

297
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,838
Why me?

298
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,340
You said Silver Lining
rejected you, right?

299
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,303
That proves that you have no connections

300
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,971
within my company.

301
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,934
I had no connections…

302
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,147
but now I do.

303
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,984
And it's the CEO.

304
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,904
Get some rest.
Things won't be easy starting tomorrow.

305
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
Hold on.

306
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,417
-Yes?
-Take off the case.

307
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,964
If you have my phone,
people will suspect you.

308
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,179
There are some things you need
to know before your first day.

309
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,769
Hello.

310
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,896
Executive Director Oh Mi-ran of Bumyoung.

311
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,318
Her father, Chairman Oh Bum-geun,

312
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,779
the founder of the group,
suddenly fainted last year,

313
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,822
making her the de-facto chairwoman.

314
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,450
The international development
of the self-driving car…

315
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,452
She's the largest shareholder
of Bumyoung Motor Group

316
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,830
and plans to use its success
with self-driving cars as the foothold

317
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,166
to beat her uncle
and become the chairwoman officially.

318
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,086
That is our goal. Thank you.

319
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,755
Then she needs all the help
she can get from Silver Lining

320
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,882
for the critical technologies.

321
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,511
Mr. Oh is not going to
just stand by and watch.

322
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,972
He even lived behind bars
in his brother's place.

323
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,390
His determination knows no bounds

324
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,351
and neither does his loyalty to Bumyoung.

325
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,854
He won't be satisfied
with his position as Vice Chairman.

326
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,859
So a shrimp got caught
in a fight between whales.

327
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,528
SIGNING CEREMONY

328
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,530
Silver Lining is not a shrimp.

329
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,825
It's a kingmaker
that can get on top of either whale.

330
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,247
Mr. Kwak will be waiting for you.

331
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,540
He is a typical bully

332
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,375
who turns weak in front of the strong.

333
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,919
He's one of Mr. Oh's people,
a recruit from Bumyoung Electronics,

334
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,295
and a plant to keep me in check.

335
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,382
Today is the first day
of our newly appointed CEO.

336
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,969
Let us greet him respectfully
and sincerely. All right?

337
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,096
-Yes, sir!
-Okay. Stay calm.

338
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,765
Button your suits.

339
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,817
Is it always like this?

340
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,152
They never did it for me.

341
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,612
With a new boss,
they chose the old-fashioned way.

342
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,703
-Mr. Park. Hello.
-Hello.

343
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,289
Just act casual.

344
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,756
What are you doing? Hurry!

345
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,050
That's right. Don't get intimidated.

346
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,387
I was in the 27th class,
the best of Evergreen Theater.

347
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,972
There's no role I haven't played.

348
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,225
I did my best in every role.

349
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,895
This is my stage

350
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,315
and from this point on, I am the CEO.

351
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,570
Three, two, one.

352
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,086
What are you doing right now?

353
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,214
Aren't you supposed to be working?

354
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,718
I detest formalities such as this.

355
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,305
Don't ever do this again.

356
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,223
I see.

357
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,766
Yes, sir.

358
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,060
Get back to work.

359
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,777
Did you have a pleasant drive
on your way here?

360
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,280
The Pyeongyang cold noodles guy?

361
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,866
Hello, I am Jung Se-yeon,
your personal assistant.

362
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,911
-What?
-I only have good things ahead--

363
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,123
You're the shirt lady.

364
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,584
Right this way, sir.

365
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,923
Okay.

366
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,053
Do you know Ms. Jung?

367
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,394
I bumped into her once.

368
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,947
-The other day--
-There's no need to explain

369
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,409
how a job seeker became a CEO

370
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,661
overnight.

371
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,797
-This way, sir.
-Okay.

372
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,860
CEO PARK IN-SEONG

373
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,802
I did the best I could
in a short amount of time.

374
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,596
Is there anything else you need?

375
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,725
This is enough.

376
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,978
It is interesting
seeing you again like this.

377
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:27,979
Indeed.

378
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,231
It turns out I wasn't the interviewer.

379
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,901
You were there to interview me.

380
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:39,324
No wonder I got the inkling
that you were an extraordinary applicant.

381
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,242
Did you?

382
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,412
It is amazing how you made
a thorough inspection in advance.

383
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,587
I apologize if I was too insolent.

384
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,264
Mr. Kim's email explained
the circumstances to me.

385
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,394
Yes, I see.

386
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,190
Do you mind if I ask
what your relationship is with Mr. Kim?

387
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,775
Neither your age, educational background,

388
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:18,321
hometown, nor face…

389
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,241
seem to overlap with those of Mr. Kim.

390
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,537
We're close. I'll just leave it at that.

391
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,124
If you don't mind my asking,
what do you mean by "close"?

392
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,627
Well…

393
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,922
Everything's okay.

394
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,843
I touch, and…

395
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,219
Sorry?

396
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,473
We're…

397
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:50,478
touchy-feely, very open, and honest about
giving each other pointers and such.

398
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,396
Got it?

399
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,445
But the thing is,

400
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,573
I don't have experience as a CEO.

401
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:05,618
Goodness. No one is born a CEO.

402
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,328
You learn as you go.

403
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:12,876
Even so, I just don't have
any experience whatsoever.

404
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,836
So you should be given the chance

405
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,964
to display your abilities

406
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,383
and prove your real worth.

407
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,512
You're very different
from when I first met you.

408
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,058
You see, I may not have much hair up here,

409
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,895
but I promise
I won't ever get in your hair.

410
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,987
What are you going to do
about your personal assistant?

411
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,032
-Sorry?
-Ms. Jung.

412
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,243
When CEOs move around,

413
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,247
they bring in their personal assistants

414
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,999
as a general rule.

415
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,255
What should I do about the assistant?

416
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,258
Ms. Jung has worked for me
for a long time.

417
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,470
She knows how to keep a secret
and hide her feelings.

418
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,722
Then she can stay.

419
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,975
If you think about it differently,
she's hard to read.

420
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,728
And because she knows me well,

421
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,522
she is likely to find out about us.

422
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,023
Then I'll find someone else.

423
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,400
She knows my official
and personal schedules

424
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,194
like the back of her hand.

425
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,614
She probably accompanied me
on my last golf meeting.

426
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,578
Se-yeon might be able
to lead us to some clues.

427
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,876
Ms. Jung can be your most reliable friend…

428
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,131
as well as your worst enemy.

429
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,729
What should I do now?

430
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,817
Go to my office
and connect my phone to the computer.

431
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,904
Why do you want me--

432
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,742
Darn it.

433
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,869
Lady!

434
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,662
-I'm sorry.
-Are you insane?

435
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,206
I told you not to leave your supplies
in front of the bathroom.

436
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,834
-Look.
-I was mopping the floor.

437
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,043
Someone tripped.

438
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,795
-I'm sorry.
-How many times do I have to tell you?

439
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,088
Do you want to get fired?

440
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,882
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me, it's my fault.

441
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,174
I was staring at my phone.

442
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,679
-Clean up the mess.
-Just leave.

443
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,180
Clean it up!

444
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,184
I wasn't going to say this,

445
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,521
but that's why
you're cleaning bathrooms at your age.

446
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,568
I wasn't going to say this,

447
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,196
but that’s why you’re still
working part-time at your age!

448
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,868
This is my stage.

449
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,995
And I'm the boss.

450
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,545
Don't do anything that attracts attention.

451
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:06,007
-Clean it up!
-Are you the only one who works here?

452
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,884
You're pissing me off.

453
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,303
Do you want to get fired?

454
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,888
Who are you?

455
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,559
I wasn't going to say this,

456
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,021
but that's why you're on a power trip
at your age.

457
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,817
How does that

458
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,071
make you feel?

459
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,199
How dare you?
Do you know who you're talking to?

460
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,533
Hey!

461
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,078
I'm a team leader in the sales department.

462
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,454
Which department are you in?

463
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,498
CEO PARK IN-SEONG

464
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,334
He is the newly appointed CEO,
Mr. Park In-seong.

465
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,921
Shall we, sir?

466
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,889
Thank you.

467
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,230
What you did just now
is a breach of contract.

468
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,525
Three strikes and you're out.
You currently have one.

469
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,694
I'm sorry.

470
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,363
I've always wanted to

471
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,739
go on a power trip.

472
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,662
It's already so hectic.

473
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:21,374
Right. You want me to
connect your phone to the computer?

474
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,333
Yes.

475
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,753
I need to check if anyone attempted
to hack Baro Version 4.0.

476
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,132
It's a beta version.

477
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,633
Is it still being developed?

478
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,301
It needs to go through more tests.

479
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,474
There's Son Heung-min.

480
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,394
He's the model for Silver Lining.

481
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,815
Your voice can also be reproduced
after an hour-long recording session.

482
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,735
It's like listening
to the late Kim Kwang-seok

483
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,154
singing the songs of today.

484
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,951
I just took the technology a step further.

485
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,246
Baro, what should I wear today?

486
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,081
The temperature outside is 18 degrees.

487
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,959
I recommend wearing a dress
that suits the spring breeze.

488
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,670
A dress.

489
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,676
Baro, what should I wear today?

490
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,720
The temperature outside is 18 degrees.

491
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,598
I recommend wearing a dress
that suits the spring breeze.

492
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,891
Darn it, you fool.

493
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,520
The current design has AI assistants
respond uniformly to a given question.

494
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,358
However, Silver Lining is developing
a personalized AI assistant

495
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,819
that uses deep learning
to tailor to each individual.

496
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:37,200
Our AI assistant won't be a humdrum one
glorified by words such as versatility.

497
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:40,912
It will be an AI assistant
that thinks, decides, and talks

498
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,039
like Son Heung-min, your mom, or me.

499
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,250
That is what Version 4.0 will become.

500
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,339
Is that why you became a model as well?

501
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,632
No more questions.

502
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:59,806
-But I'm the CEO. I should at least know--
-The reason why I can trust you

503
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,307
is because you know nothing.

504
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,975
The more you know,

505
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,269
the more difficult it'll be
for me to trust you.

506
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,742
This is Kim Seon-ju,
the CEO of Silver Lining.

507
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,952
OH BUM-GEUN

508
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,288
Due to personal health reasons,
I would like to take some time to rest.

509
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:28,459
I am sending this email to request
approval for my replacement.

510
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,087
-You can't do this, sir.
-Move!

511
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,213
Please step away.

512
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,840
-Get out of my way!
-Please step away.

513
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,884
Move!

514
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,095
Mr. Oh, sir!

515
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,223
-Sir, please.
-Move out of the way!

516
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,022
What game are you playing?

517
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,608
Compose yourself, Mr. Oh.

518
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,319
This is the office of the chairman
of Bumyoung Group.

519
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:01,617
That's right. Such principles were kept
when my brother held office.

520
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,496
But a sabbatical
at an important time like this?

521
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,582
Perhaps something unavoidable
happened to him

522
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,210
at an important time like this.

523
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:16,799
On top of that,
the new CEO is wet behind the ears.

524
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,094
The board of directors
will not tolerate this.

525
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,891
I, the largest shareholder
of Bumyoung, allowed it.

526
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,893
Who isn't going to tolerate what?

527
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,146
Let's see how he fares.

528
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,149
If he's gold, he'll shine.

529
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,276
If he's iron, he'll rust.

530
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,199
Bumyoung…

531
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,119
Electronics…

532
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,164
has Young-geun.

533
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,124
And…

534
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,587
Bumyoung Motor Group…

535
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,423
has Mi-ran.

536
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,304
So the bigger the spike
in Silver Lining's share price,

537
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,390
the greater the decrease
in value for Bumyoung Electronics?

538
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,684
You're picking things up quicker
than I thought.

539
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,313
By nature, Silver Lining and Mr. Oh
can never be on good terms.

540
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,527
Who is it?

541
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,622
This is a list of assistants
picked out by Mr. Kwak.

542
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,126
All four of them can start working
as soon as tomorrow.

543
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,505
There must be a misunderstanding.
I have yet to request…

544
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:57,066
CEO PARK IN-SEONG

545
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,734
Are you acting out again?

546
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,447
Mr. Park, I warned you.

547
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:07,910
Our deal was to make me CEO,
not for you to control my every move.

548
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,161
Mr. Park.

549
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,079
Mr. Park In-seong.

550
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,377
What a good hair day.

551
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,589
Let me do this side too.

552
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,638
Goodness. What brings you
to such a lowly place?

553
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,473
You should've just called for me.

554
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,058
This.

555
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,272
Did you already finish
looking over the candidates?

556
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,776
Would you like to see your replacements

557
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,195
for yourself?

558
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,322
Pardon?

559
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,242
Why did you hand the list
of candidates to Ms. Jung?

560
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,328
Because it's her job.

561
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,581
Was it necessary
to make her deliver the list herself?

562
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,207
That's how we've been doing--

563
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,752
Then make the necessary changes
starting now.

564
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,921
At least for the duration of my tenure,

565
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:05,259
I'm not going to allow anyone,
regardless of their position,

566
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,013
to be stabbed in the back
or under their nose.

567
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,060
JUNIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR KWAK SAM-SU

568
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,738
Someone is causing a scene.

569
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,035
-What are you doing?
-Let me go.

570
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,912
Let go!

571
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,082
Jeez. What's wrong with you?

572
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,837
Hey.

573
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,881
I told you I know her.

574
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,531
I told you not to come to my workplace.

575
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,284
And I told you I only trust money.

576
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,384
Are we good now?

577
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,014
Where's this money from?

578
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,810
Why does it matter? I paid you.

579
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,312
You won't take it if it's dirty?

580
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,525
Write me a receipt.

581
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,696
For payment in full.

582
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,323
Give me a receipt before you go.

583
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,535
What are you saying?
You have 50 million left.

584
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,706
Do you think I'm running a charity?
You need to pay interest.

585
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,000
You should've paid it sooner,
don't you think?

586
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,044
See you again.

587
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,261
Se-yeon is a good person,

588
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,721
so I'm going to work with her.

589
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,808
You only saw her
for 6 hours and 48 minutes.

590
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,268
How do you know for sure?

591
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,814
I think Se-yeon
will become a reliable friend.

592
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,732
Why?

593
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,650
Do you have anything to back it up?

594
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,534
My shirt.

595
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,997
What?

596
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,792
This is a woman's size.

597
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,963
Gosh.

598
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,924
My stocks won't rise,

599
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,634
but you're making my hackles rise.

600
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,968
It's always the quiet ones.

601
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,555
It's not what you think it is.

602
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,350
What am I thinking? Tell me.

603
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,602
Is she pretty?

604
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,065
She has a kind heart.

605
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,360
She offered to help
even when she didn't need to.

606
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,737
Is it the lady who gave you her shirt?

607
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,114
-Yes.
-I see.

608
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,157
She's a good person.

609
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,412
"A good person."

610
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,416
Why is your face turning red?

611
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,793
Listen here.

612
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,255
We should get one of her friends
to join us on a double date.

613
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,966
I can act as a social lubricant.

614
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,551
You don't have to do anything.

615
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,344
I bet she's pretty.

616
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,637
Your shirt?

617
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,432
Cut it out and show me the exact numbers

618
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,269
or convince me with irrefutable logic.

619
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,771
This is a matter of life and death to me.

620
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,817
Is it even possible

621
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,361
to describe a person with numbers?

622
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,030
Humans are not AI machines.

623
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,448
You're wrong.

624
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,743
The reliability of anyone
that Mr. Kwak recommends is zero.

625
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,038
On the other hand,
Ms. Jung is fifty-fifty.

626
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,541
Ms. Jung is the better option.

627
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,668
This is how you should convince me.

628
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,799
So you agree with me.

629
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,094
Nevertheless, you stormed into
Mr. Kwak's office.

630
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,387
You have one strike left.

631
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,515
He is a novice.

632
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,227
He's a greenhorn
who can't control his emotions.

633
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,813
You may rest assured.

634
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:29,815
Yes, sir.

635
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,366
Well, of course.

636
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,828
Where did he find such a lowly punk?

637
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,249
I'll have the board discuss his dismissal.

638
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,502
What's the point of removing a cub?

639
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,755
Pardon?

640
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,882
Just wait.

641
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,926
Let's wait for him to mess up on his own.

642
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:03,265
That way we can get rid of Silver Lining
and my niece all at once.

643
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,142
Yes, sir.

644
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,980
Right. How is that going, by the way?

645
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,857
I'm looking into it.

646
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,694
All right. Keep looking into it.

647
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,963
I can't believe
I get to live in a place like this.

648
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,675
I didn't expect
to live inside my phone either.

649
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,970
Figures.

650
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:45,557
You should be living
in a 67-pyeong house in Pyeongchang-dong.

651
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,810
But you're living
in a 6.7-inch display instead.

652
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,480
-What?
-What is it? Is something wrong?

653
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,731
It's already 6 p.m.

654
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,610
If I'm the boss, that means
I can leave work on the dot, right?

655
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,280
You don't seem that self-conscious anyway.

656
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,074
I just got goosebumps.

657
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,742
I hear that often.

658
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,790
We must have gotten pretty close.

659
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:30,102
Ms. Jung, aren't you clocking out?

660
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,359
It's already 5 minutes past 6 p.m.

661
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,991
Here's the handover document.

662
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,203
Throw it away.

663
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,081
Ms. Jung.

664
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,960
See you tomorrow.

665
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,109
Is this it?

666
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,321
That two-storied house is mine.

667
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,241
-With the billion won, I should--
-You can't.

668
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,744
Sorry?

669
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,622
That would only cover the master bedroom.

670
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,626
I'll forever be stuck in a studio.

671
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,508
Is she even coming though?

672
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,969
Min-a loves buying chocolate snacks
from the grocery store.

673
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,890
This is around the time
she usually gets back home.

674
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,893
I guess she knows.

675
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,269
What?

676
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:59,066
Spending brings happiness.

677
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,152
Your kid is capitalistic.

678
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,531
She's coming.

679
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,369
Right. She doesn't know who I am.

680
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,170
Is that her?

681
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,089
She's so cute.

682
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,784
Are you okay?

683
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,830
You waited so long
just to see her for a minute.

684
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:55,914
Let's leave now.

685
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:00,919
What?

686
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,797
He's coming back out.

687
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,465
Is he going home?

688
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,342
No. They're both live-in employees.

689
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,012
I see.

690
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,892
He's a rough driver.

691
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:18,937
Tail him.

692
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,565
-What?
-Chase after him!

693
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,817
Why? We came all the way over here--

694
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,110
Chase after him!

695
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,155
Jeez.

696
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,054
I'm still technically alive,

697
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,806
which means things didn't go
exactly as they had planned.

698
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,947
They will likely try to
get a grasp on my situation.

699
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,246
That would make Mr. Sim
their number one target.

700
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,751
I HAVE ARRIVED

701
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:23,835
Or…

702
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,338
he may already be on their side.

703
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,476
Check who he is meeting.

704
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,652
Welcome.

705
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,627
Who is it?

706
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,019
What?

707
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,439
Why is Se-yeon there?

708
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,483
Take a look at this.

709
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,152
Head straight to my house.

710
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,945
-Sorry?
-Now!

711
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,740
Hurry!

712
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,254
Bring out a document envelope
from my study.

713
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,089
I'll unlock the door.

714
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,260
You can go in now.

715
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,974
Ms. Jung should be
in her room cross-stitching

716
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,143
after putting Min-a to bed.

717
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,812
You should have about an hour.

718
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,955
What do I do now?

719
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,958
I don't think I can go in
through the main entrance.

720
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,417
Head to the right.

721
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,588
Now to the left.

722
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,299
No, not yet.

723
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,431
Turn left here.

724
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,103
Your house is huge.

725
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,230
Go in through the pool entrance.

726
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,069
Don't worry about the security cameras.
I'll handle it.

727
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,577
You said you'd make me a CEO,

728
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,786
not a thief.

729
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,622
Did you think it'd be easy
to earn a billion won?

730
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,047
Take off your shoes.

731
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,425
I can't erase your shoeprints for you.

732
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,518
The study is located
at the very end of the second floor.

733
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,416
Gosh, there's a person.

734
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,377
It's a suit of armor.

735
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,630
There's nothing inside.

736
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,805
There's no time. Hurry.

737
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,806
Ms. Jung went downstairs.

738
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,160
There's a car.

739
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,706
It's expensive. Be careful.

740
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,835
So where's the document envelope?

741
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,712
Up the stairs, in the safe by the desk.

742
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,049
Go up those stairs.

743
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,472
It's too dark to see.

744
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,142
Why don't we come back
when there's no one home?

745
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,685
You saw what was happening.

746
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,271
They're starting to move.
We have to hurry.

747
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,234
This isn't a study.

748
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,486
It's bigger than my house.

749
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,113
There's a safe next to the desk.

750
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,955
There's a passcode.

751
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,624
It's 0630.

752
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,807
There's nothing here.

753
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,268
Are you sure?
There's no document envelope?

754
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,562
There's nothing.

755
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,647
Let me see.

756
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,234
There's no way.

757
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,653
Are you sure you left it here?

758
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,238
You could've been mistaken.

759
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,032
No, I always left it there.

760
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,288
What's inside the envelope anyway?

761
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,957
I need to know what I'm looking for.

762
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,802
Hold on. The hallway lights came on.

763
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,484
Stay calm and hide yourself.

764
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,362
What now?

765
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,446
Don't panic.

766
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,869
Just to be safe, why don't we--

767
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,731
Ms. Jung is headed in this direction.

768
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,191
Hurry!

769
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,520
What now, Mr. Kim?

770
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,190
If she--

771
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,525
-My goodness!
-What's the matter?

772
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,653
I heard a sound coming from this room.

773
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,696
That's absurd.

774
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,781
Mr. Kim isn't even here.

775
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,842
UNKNOWN

776
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,636
Did you hear that?

777
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,557
I did. It sounds like a phone.

778
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,950
Oh, my. It was my phone.

779
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,537
It's Mr. Kim.

780
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,330
What?

781
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,832
What did he say?

782
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,501
He's giving me a raise.

783
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,879
Goodness. It was my phone.

784
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,873
That was close.

785
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,922
You really are from Silicon Valley.

786
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,425
How did you think of sending her a text?

787
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,218
You can count on me from now on.

788
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,262
You're amazing.

789
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:00,805
UNKNOWN

790
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,265
What?

791
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,559
"Unknown"?

792
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:07,770
WHY WON'T YOU PICK UP?
I'M THE OWNER OF THAT PHONE

793
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,232
What is this person saying?
This is Kim Seon-ju's phone.

794
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,621
GIVE ME BACK MY PHONE!

795
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,788
Kim Seon-ju.

796
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,416
Who are you?

797
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,755
Are you really Kim Seon-ju?

798
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,174
Do you know what's really unfair?

799
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:21,302
Daring to take that seat.

800
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:24,389
You want me to live in your house?

801
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,850
Se-yeon is probably confused too.

802
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,728
Looking back,
I went through endless days of pain.

803
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,855
You can get in touch with Mr. Kim?

804
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,025
The CEO of Silver Lining

805
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,653
put his money where his mouth is.

806
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,572
Watch out!

807
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:42,865
There's no road!

808
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:47,036
