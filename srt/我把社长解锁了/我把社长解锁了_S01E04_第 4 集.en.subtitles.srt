1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,283
ALL NAMES, GROUPS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND EVENTS

2
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,160
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,629
What happens

4
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,425
if Se-yeon chooses to go another way?

5
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,509
That won't happen.

6
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,969
Sorry?

7
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,390
Poverty leaves you with fewer options.

8
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,739
By the way,

9
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,993
there's something
I've been wanting to know.

10
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:21,164
Why did you name
your company Silver Lining?

11
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,584
There were no interviews about it.

12
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,799
The silver edge lining of clouds.

13
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,302
A gleam of hope in the darkness.

14
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,055
It doesn't suit the image

15
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,933
of an IT company.

16
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,811
Have you watched The Terminator?

17
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,357
The Terminator.

18
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,084
Okay. Keep the questions coming.

19
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,753
It is predicted

20
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,298
that 47 percent of jobs
could be lost due to AI.

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,302
Furthermore, there is a fear that one day,

22
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,888
AI will go out of control
and threaten humans.

23
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,142
What are your opinions
about these problems?

24
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,399
BASED ON WEBTOON UNLOCK THE BOSS
(UNLOCK MY BOSS) BY PARK SEONG-HYUN

25
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,164
You're probably worried that we'll face
a future like we see in The Terminator.

26
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,332
The advent

27
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,336
of superintelligent and autonomous AI

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,339
will pose a threat to

29
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,467
not just certain individuals,
but to all Homo sapiens.

30
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,306
They will become smarter
and stronger than humans.

31
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,978
In that case,
regardless of our permission,

32
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,025
AI will end up
changing the world however they want.

33
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,444
Because…

34
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,989
that's what humans
have been doing as well.

35
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,576
At the prospect
of this dark and murky future,

36
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,830
thinking that we'd need a silver lining,

37
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,001
CEO Kim Seon-ju chose Silver Lining

38
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,003
as the name of his company.

39
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,883
And as the new CEO,
who has been entrusted with his mission,

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,470
I promise

41
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,473
that Silver Lining's technology

42
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,560
will always put humans first.

43
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,016
Mr. Oh.

44
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,110
Great work today.

45
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,903
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,071
Take care

47
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,740
and send my regards to Director Park.

48
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,913
I was worried you would get an earful.

49
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,081
What a relief.

50
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,625
What are you saying?

51
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,044
Bumyoung Electronics
could pull all their advertisements.

52
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,004
Are you serious?

53
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,641
Though rather abrupt,
it was a meaningful event.

54
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,728
Family is "sikgu."

55
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,063
Sik, as in "eating,"
and gu, as in "the mouth."

56
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,566
People who eat together.

57
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,446
Now, I feel like I'm a part
of the Bumyoung family.

58
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,490
Thanks to you,

59
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,994
I left a good first impression
as the CEO of Silver Lining.

60
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,623
I will make sure
to repay you for your kindness.

61
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,876
Are you threatening me right now?

62
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,128
-Mr. Oh.
-A lot of people are watching.

63
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,733
Why did Mr. Kim meet Mr. Kwak privately?

64
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,489
What was he thinking?

65
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,623
I know I shouldn't,

66
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,417
but I can't help doubting.

67
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,893
Hello?

68
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,945
Someone would mistake you for a real CEO.

69
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,155
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,117
I just added a few things
on top of what you told me.

71
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,034
Mr. Park.

72
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,453
If you give me a strike
for this, it's unfair.

73
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,541
Mr. Oh plunged my earbud,
so I had no choice.

74
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,876
Why do you keep making excuses?

75
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,588
Only Kim Gun-mo was able to succeed
with his song, "Excuses."

76
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,549
Sorry?

77
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,468
You don't have to
make excuses. You did great.

78
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,846
You looked like the real CEO.

79
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,768
Was that a compliment?

80
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,938
You know how to compliment others?

81
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,487
Hello?

82
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,739
Who?

83
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,252
You and I have something in common.

84
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,964
I heard you collected everyone's phones
during the meeting.

85
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:46,966
Yes, I did.

86
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,345
That's right. Phones these days
are basically wiretapping devices.

87
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,599
You can understand, right?

88
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,790
Kim Seon-ju's pick.

89
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,376
I was wondering

90
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,254
what kind of person you were.

91
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,256
I could tell
after watching the press conference.

92
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,636
I couldn't have done anything without--

93
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,598
You must communicate a lot with Mr. Kim.

94
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,892
Well, yes.

95
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,480
So that's why you said everything,
exactly like Kim Seon-ju told me.

96
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,734
As if he wrote you a script or something.

97
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,279
What's wrong?

98
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,158
Did he not tell you
that I would say something like this?

99
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,078
What do you mean?

100
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,457
I mean, you said
you communicate a lot with Mr. Kim, so…

101
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,174
I don't know what he promised you

102
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,512
before making you the interim CEO,

103
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,306
but don't trust him too much.

104
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,227
Why do you say that?

105
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,024
Kim Seon-ju only cares about himself.

106
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,152
He didn't even keep the promise
he made to me.

107
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,989
That was just

108
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:38,119
a piece of advice for a new CEO,
from a senior in the industry.

109
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,261
Did she leave?

110
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,638
Yes, just now.

111
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,889
What did she say?

112
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,641
Just…

113
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,853
A piece of advice
as a senior in the industry.

114
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,731
That's it?

115
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,568
Yes.

116
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,865
Mr. Oh plotted such a scheme?

117
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,036
Ms. Jung, did you find anything
in Mr. Kwak's car?

118
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,539
Mr. Kwak

119
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,751
met someone near the golf course that day.

120
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,002
Who is it?

121
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,712
You.

122
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,922
-Me?
-Me?

123
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,675
Mr. Kim Seon-ju.

124
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,510
He met me?

125
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,721
I don't remember at all,
and we're not that close.

126
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,767
I cloned the SD card.

127
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,159
I really did meet Mr. Kwak.

128
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,496
Did you find anything else?

129
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,122
No, I didn't.

130
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,797
RECENT DESTINATIONS

131
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,007
SILVER LINING
BUMYOUNG HEADQUARTERS PARKING LOT

132
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,595
Chungbuk?

133
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,434
His destination after the golf course
was the third Chungbuk redevelopment site.

134
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,938
That means Mr. Kwak

135
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,192
went there after meeting Mr. Kim.

136
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:44,745
3RD CHUNGBUK REDEVELOPMENT SITE

137
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,014
Don't trust him too much.

138
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,335
What?

139
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,920
Gosh, that's hot!

140
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,923
Did you watch this all night?

141
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,842
You're going to make the phone burst.

142
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,510
You can end up killing yourself.

143
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,389
Also, staring at the same footage

144
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,433
won't make something
pop up out of nowhere.

145
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,894
Hard work may betray you,

146
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,646
but laziness will never betray you.

147
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,983
That is why "lazy"
is not in my vocabulary.

148
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,654
Are you an electronic dictionary?

149
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,698
You're always talking
about your vocabulary.

150
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,283
That scared me.

151
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,037
Min-a, you should knock before entering.

152
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,330
-Sorry?
-Yes.

153
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,708
I thought I heard Dad's voice.

154
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,545
Well, I was just

155
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,506
calling a friend.

156
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,882
You must have misheard.

157
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,677
Did you not go to kindergarten today?

158
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,471
Today's Sunday.

159
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,934
I'll knock from now on.

160
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,353
Min-a, wait.

161
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:33,896
Min-a.

162
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,525
I'll retie your hair for you.

163
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,109
Turn around.

164
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,079
Hey, Min-a.

165
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,249
Do you want me to show you something cool?

166
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,708
What is it?

167
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,504
To be honest,

168
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,632
I'm a magician.

169
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,802
I'm telling the truth. Here.

170
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:12,059
Abracadabra.

171
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,060
Ta-da!

172
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,230
How did you do that?

173
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,775
Do you want to play with me today?

174
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,902
Let's go.

175
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,820
Come on.

176
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,489
What should we do?

177
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,998
Min-a, go bring me another book.

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,710
One, two, three.

179
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,507
-We did it!
-We did it!

180
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,093
It's done, Min-a. Good job.

181
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,846
I think it's even taller than me.

182
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,056
Which finger?

183
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,726
-This one.
-Wrong.

184
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,769
Again.

185
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,273
Which finger?

186
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,067
This one.

187
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,152
Good job.

188
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,361
Enjoy.

189
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,614
It looks delicious.

190
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,210
Min-a, look at this.

191
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,962
What is it?

192
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,089
Do you want to see something fun?

193
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,635
It's a caterpillar. I want to try.

194
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,677
You want to try it?

195
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,305
Here.

196
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,769
Who taught you how to do all of this?

197
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,153
What do you think? Isn't it incredible?

198
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,907
Baro, do you know how to do magic?

199
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,911
If there is a spell
that can make you happy,

200
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,538
I would like to learn.

201
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,166
Why are you so sweet?

202
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,795
Baro.

203
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,382
Goodness.

204
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,843
Goodness.

205
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,642
That's not enough
to dislocate my shoulder.

206
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,852
Aren't you going out to weed?

207
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,688
I said I would.

208
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,279
Do you want to go together?

209
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,824
The show's about to start.

210
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,742
Right. You should watch it.

211
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,412
Even though it aired yesterday
and it'll air tomorrow.

212
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,629
Harry Potter.

213
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,383
You're the only one I have.

214
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,719
My Harry Potter.

215
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,600
I've never seen that car before.

216
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,689
Did the village head get a new car?

217
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,822
What the…

218
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,034
I ran for no reason.

219
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,838
Third Chungbuk redevelopment site.

220
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,132
You've arrived at your destination.

221
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,092
Ending route guidance.

222
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,573
3RD CHUNGBUK REDEVELOPMENT SITE

223
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,910
Mr. Kwak came here after meeting Mr. Kim.

224
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,913
But why…

225
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,002
What?

226
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,055
Oh Mi-ran?

227
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,606
I'm contemplating whether I should

228
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,317
build an apartment complex
or a domed stadium.

229
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,654
Building a domed stadium is my dream.

230
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,533
But the majority opinion
is for an apartment complex,

231
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,284
so I'm on the fence.

232
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,413
What would you build?

233
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,422
I doubt Mr. Park sent his assistant
to find land for sale.

234
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,467
You came to find me on your own, right?

235
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,012
Mr. Park…

236
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,766
is staying at Mr. Kim's house.

237
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,937
That's the reason you're here?

238
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,647
To tell me that?

239
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,440
Pardon?

240
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,196
"Mr. Park has Kim Seon-ju's phone."

241
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,365
That's the least you could do.

242
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,038
You must be on the fence like me.

243
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,173
Some say this is the perfect spot
for an art museum.

244
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,636
Because there's nothing better than
colorful paintings to hide black money.

245
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,598
An art museum is so random though.

246
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,725
Don't you think?

247
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,319
Who was…

248
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,198
the person Mr. Kwak was here to see?

249
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,588
On top of a no man's land like this,

250
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,589
my brother and I

251
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,009
founded Bumyoung Construction,

252
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,762
established Bumyoung Electronics,

253
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,848
and set up Bumyoung Motor Group.

254
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,061
That is why I'm always grateful
to my father.

255
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,607
Bumyoung was named
after the "Bum" in Oh Bum-geun

256
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,444
and the "Young" in my name, Oh Young-geun.

257
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,490
You're just talking about the past again.

258
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,827
If you only have the past
to brag about, that's a bit sad.

259
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,207
Then what did you do
to deserve that position?

260
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,042
Rather than what I've done,

261
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,003
try to look at what I'm capable of doing.

262
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,257
This is my modest advice.

263
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,717
What can someone like you do?

264
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,679
Okay. Let's say you become the Chairwoman.

265
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,014
Once you get married,

266
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,476
the descendants of Bumyoung
will no longer carry the surname Oh.

267
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,939
I am going to protect Bumyoung.

268
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,691
Your antiquated way of thinking

269
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,652
is what makes you underqualified
for the Vice Chairman position.

270
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,653
What?

271
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,906
So long as I live,
until dirt gets in my eyes--

272
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,992
Gosh. What?

273
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,370
I told you to look at
what I'm capable of doing, didn't I?

274
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,206
That little…

275
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,505
It was stifling, wasn't it?

276
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,182
She's seven, but her stamina is just…

277
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,684
She should become an athlete.

278
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,271
Kim Yuna, Kim Yeon-koung, and Kim Min-a?

279
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,775
Good work.

280
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,820
I will give you overtime pay
for playing with Min-a today.

281
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:02,946
Don't mention it.

282
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,992
I had a lot on my mind today.

283
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,160
It was fun.

284
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,494
Also,

285
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,456
is that your way of expressing gratitude?

286
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,541
"Good work"?

287
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,129
Thank you.

288
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,844
Complimenting me and expressing gratitude?

289
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:30,057
You know they say a sudden change
of attitude foreshadows one's death.

290
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,607
Oh, no! Mr. Kim…

291
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,735
Mr. Kim?

292
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,820
Darn it.

293
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,280
Mr. Kim?

294
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,077
Will that fix it?

295
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,536
Why don't you just visit

296
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,747
Bumyoung Electronics'
service center tomorrow?

297
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,083
What if I miss the golden time?

298
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,334
The golden time?

299
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,711
It's not like the phone is a person.

300
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,297
If it's broken,
you can just buy a new one.

301
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,174
You're the CEO.

302
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,467
But there's…

303
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,387
There's…

304
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,683
something that lives inside.

305
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,811
-Your game character?
-Something…

306
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,191
I need to have with me.

307
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,693
There must be pictures of his ex.

308
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,070
How loving.

309
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,119
In-seong, what's wrong?

310
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,169
I'm sorry, Min-a.

311
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,297
I'm so sorry.

312
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,884
I'm sorry.

313
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,138
CUSTOMER WAITING ROOM

314
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,223
-Welcome.
-Hello.

315
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,559
I'm here to repair my phone.

316
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,102
You may head inside for phones.

317
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,145
Okay.

318
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,730
BUMYOUNG ELECTRONICS SERVICE

319
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,444
Move out of the way!

320
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,699
I am in charge of TVs.

321
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,415
Phone!

322
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,708
Yes, this way.

323
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,793
Phone!

324
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,378
Yes, Doctor.

325
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,215
Please save my phone.

326
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,009
Yes, sir. I'll try my best.

327
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,386
Please help me out.

328
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,513
Excuse me.

329
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,433
If you're conscious,
please turn on your flashlight.

330
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,392
My gosh.

331
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,395
Hold on.

332
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,063
That's the butt.

333
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,440
I see.

334
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,441
What did you say?

335
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,651
You dropped Mr. Kim in the…

336
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,781
You dropped his phone into that bowl?

337
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,826
It wasn't a number two though.

338
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,329
What did the service center say?

339
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,999
It'll take some time to repair.
They'll get back to me tomorrow.

340
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:06,338
Do you think the breakdown
would've affected Mr. Kim in some way?

341
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,006
Taking the phone apart for repair

342
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,258
wouldn't harm him, would it?

343
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,468
It wouldn't.

344
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,178
-Please say it wouldn't!
-Will you--

345
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,315
Are you okay?

346
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,950
Did you think I wouldn't find you
if you moved the living corpse?

347
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,744
I deal with people like you all the time.

348
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,120
You're mistaken.

349
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,289
If that were my plan,
I would've quit my job.

350
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,999
Excuse me, who…

351
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,627
Who are you?

352
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,254
Se-yeon and I…

353
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,297
We're colleagues.

354
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,928
Is he your boyfriend?

355
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,682
Where did you find such a bum?

356
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,017
Hey.

357
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,937
You should've snagged a rich old guy.

358
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,814
Who are you to speak so rudely…

359
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,694
I'm a creditor who needs
to receive 50 million won from her.

360
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,071
Are you going to pay off her debt?

361
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,948
You should stick to dealing with me.

362
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,491
Don't drag a stranger into this.

363
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,494
It's because
you have difficulty understanding.

364
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:23,498
I get that this is part of your job,
but you should at least let me breathe.

365
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,835
If I die, you'll suffer the greatest loss.

366
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,212
Have you gone mad?

367
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,881
-Hey.
-Hey.

368
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,094
I'll pay you back.

369
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,270
So he's a soft touch.

370
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,690
But the thing is, I don't trust people.

371
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,233
I trust money.

372
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,407
DAY LOAN

373
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,619
Here's the account number.

374
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,127
Two days.

375
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,422
If I don't receive the money,

376
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,132
I'll turn up again.

377
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,678
And I won't leave in peace like this.

378
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,305
Got that?

379
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,107
The car's fine.

380
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,069
I'm charging you for my medical bills.

381
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,521
Come on.

382
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,908
Why would you pay that off for me?

383
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,411
Just because you're acting as the CEO

384
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,247
doesn't mean you're actually Kim Seon-ju.

385
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,748
Mr. Kim told me

386
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,751
that you became
the youngest assistant of a CEO

387
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,295
because you're competent and tight-lipped.

388
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,715
We need someone like you.

389
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,801
I'm not tight-lipped.

390
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,097
My life is already tiring enough,

391
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,517
so I just can't afford
to pay attention to others.

392
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,313
Such a person

393
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,357
wouldn't help a job seeker.

394
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:59,362
You are a good person with a warm heart.

395
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:15,920
Mom.

396
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,174
Please.

397
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,943
I learned some shocking news
while looking at my stocks today.

398
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,196
What?

399
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,243
Apparently, the CEO of Silver Lining

400
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,663
is Park In-seong.

401
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,589
I'm disappointed.

402
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,549
Hyeon-ho.

403
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,968
Was our friendship this superficial?

404
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,846
It's a long story, but…

405
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,559
-Only my--
-A puppet boss?

406
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,313
Yes, it's similar.

407
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,733
Who cares if you're a puppet?

408
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,153
All that's needed
is some inside information.

409
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,034
Just let me know
when new products are released.

410
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,036
I'll take out all the loans I can
and go all in.

411
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,621
-Don't.
-Why not?

412
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,331
-Don't go all in.
-Why not?

413
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,707
Owner's risk.

414
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,211
You're the owner.

415
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,463
You became the boss
without even telling me!

416
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,632
Excuse me.

417
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,178
You have to fix the table.
It keeps moving.

418
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,940
Hey.

419
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,653
You looked into everything, right?

420
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:10,785
You're not going to go to jail
in place of the real CEO, are you?

421
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,453
It's nothing like that.

422
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,084
I guess that's not too bad either.

423
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,211
Your life is already doomed.

424
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:25,174
If a criminal record
can turn my hopeless life upside down,

425
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,635
I can become a puppet.

426
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,929
Excuse me, you have to fix the pool table.

427
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,973
-You have to level it.
-Right.

428
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:36,352
You can't tell my parents about this.

429
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,730
Hey, Mr. Boss.

430
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,108
Just worry about yourself.

431
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,445
You know what?

432
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,450
My friend mortgaged his house
to buy Silver Lining stocks.

433
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,868
Retail investors

434
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,914
are swarming in.

435
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,630
My head hurts.

436
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,805
Lord, please help all of us.

437
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,849
We need it to go back up to live.

438
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,311
Lord, please help us.

439
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,021
What floor did you come down from?

440
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,316
The 88th floor.

441
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,569
It halved, then.

442
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,698
Why doom such an innocent child?

443
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,075
Let's go.

444
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,914
Dad, I want to go home.

445
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,499
That house…

446
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,126
is not ours anymore.

447
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,307
You need to get ready, sir.

448
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,771
There he is!

449
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,030
Why did you take up the position
when you're incompetent?

450
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,907
-Please say a word.
-Please say something.

451
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,995
In-seong.

452
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,331
Goodness. Honey!

453
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,794
In-seong!

454
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,047
Are you okay?

455
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,887
I wish…

456
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,641
I could stop time for a moment.

THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
THE PARK IN-SEONG SHOW

461
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,122
It was a dream.

462
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,510
My friend mortgaged his house
to buy Silver Lining stocks.

463
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,430
Even now, they worry about the impact

464
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,224
their decisions will have
on the lives of their employees.

GLOSSARY OF ECONOMIC TERMS
EXECUTIVE COACHING

467
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,676
For the duration of my tenure,

468
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,137
I need to become a real CEO.

469
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,619
I found a phone under Kim Seon-ju's name.

470
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,080
Did you?

471
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,416
Mr. Park took it in for repair
along with a power of attorney.

472
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,546
As expected.

473
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,465
Is your most reliable man tailing him?

474
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,135
Yes, sir.

Your phone has been repaired.
Here you go, sir.

480
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,396
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

481
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,608
Hey, Kim Seon-ju!

482
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,279
Kim Seon-ju, please answer.

483
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,448
Did you really die
after falling in the toilet?

484
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,704
Do people still use pit toilets?

485
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,830
Did he get a stool rash?

486
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,710
Mr. Park.

487
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,503
What?

488
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,673
If you make the same mistake again--

489
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,050
It's working!

490
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,552
-Hello? Are you listening?
-My phone is working.

491
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,970
-Hello?
-Excuse me.

492
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,889
-Who am I talking to?
-It's working.

493
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,018
Yesterday, I was presumptuous in--

494
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,436
So it's fixed now?

495
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,314
Yes.

496
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,402
It works fine.

497
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:21,781
That's a relief.

498
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,367
We don't have much time.

499
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,619
We already wasted a lot of it
thanks to someone.

500
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,041
I found something strange
in the dashcam footage.

501
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,971
What's wrong with that?

502
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,474
I rewatched it multiple times too,
and there was nothing that seemed off.

503
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,643
Take a closer look.

504
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,402
When I get out of my car,
another car drives past me.

505
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,200
This is where it starts getting strange.

506
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,248
The oncoming car.

507
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,752
Is it the same car?

508
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,212
Yes.

509
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,550
The car that drove past me
when I met Mr. Kwak made a U-turn.

510
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,264
If their destination was Seoul,

511
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,974
they should've been on their way.

512
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,475
A tail?

513
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,065
They could've just gotten lost on the road

514
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,401
or had a poor sense of direction.

515
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,111
That is why I'm going to check.

516
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,827
First, we need to trace
the vehicle number.

517
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,120
01 E4885

518
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,415
I'll do it.

519
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,876
You will?

520
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,003
Do you know someone in the police?

521
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,466
In-seong, I heard
you started working at a big company.

522
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,384
I am so proud of you.

523
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,094
How did you know that?

524
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,388
Your father told me, of course.

525
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,932
If you don't know that here,
you practically live under a rock.

526
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,729
What was it called again? Silver Town?

527
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,567
It's called Silver Lining.

528
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,070
That's right. Lining.

529
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:29,116
Anyway, you are our source of pride.

530
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,160
If there's anything you need,
just tell me.

531
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,080
-The thing is,
-Yes?

532
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,749
I was actually going to ask--

533
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,459
-Inspector.
-Yes?

534
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,668
I have bad news.

535
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,171
What is it?

536
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,591
Did the village head's dog
leave the house or something?

537
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,635
No, not his dog.

538
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,805
His wife ran away.

539
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:52,640
What?

540
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,558
Shouldn't we track the location of her--

541
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,769
We'll get in trouble if we do!

542
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,730
We can't go about
disregarding the code of conduct.

543
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,652
You shouldn't let your personal feelings
dictate your service to the country!

544
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,612
-Gosh.
-Will In-seong be okay on his own?

545
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,075
Taking advantage of your connections
doesn't work these days.

546
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,370
You're right.

547
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,581
But will we be okay?

548
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,291
It all depends on your performance.

549
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,587
You have to be assertive.

550
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,424
-Assertive.
-Assertive.

551
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,725
What can I help you with, ma'am?

552
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,604
A person who has an annual membership here

553
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,274
is my boss.

554
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,444
Is that so?

555
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,405
Charge my phone for me, please.

556
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,157
Yes, ma'am.

557
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,743
-Wait!
-Pardon?

558
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,127
Charge it with the computer, please.

559
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,004
Okay.

560
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,049
PROFESSIONALS DIRECT THEIR BALLS
AMATEURS ARE LED BY THEIR BALLS

561
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,610
It's been a while since you visited.
You should stay a little longer.

562
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,863
It's okay. You're probably busy.

563
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,531
Thank you for the coffee.

564
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,574
All right, then.

565
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,744
What? Is that your car?

566
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,579
It's a company car.

567
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,457
Goodness. What a nice car.

568
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,587
Will I see you in a helicopter
the next time you get hired?

569
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:49,965
What?

570
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,136
Gosh, you should've been more careful.

571
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,014
You already got a dent.

572
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,226
It looks pretty recent.

573
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,816
It was a hit-and-run.

574
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,984
What?

575
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,194
Who in the world…

576
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,279
Did you file a report?

577
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,407
I'm a new hire, and I didn't want
things to get out of hand.

578
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,369
So I just let it slide.

579
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,997
Are you serious right now?

580
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:27,253
If something like that happened,
you should've told me!

581
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,922
If I just knew the plate number, I would--

582
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,131
I know it.

583
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,716
You do?

584
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,680
I'm not too sure, but I think
my dashcam picked up the number.

585
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,309
What are you doing?

586
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,853
Are you going to keep it to yourself?

587
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,938
Give it to me.

588
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,026
You see, that car…

589
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,945
A burner car?

590
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:54,905
Yes.

591
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,284
When I looked up the vehicle number,
there was no registered information.

592
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,369
A burner car…

593
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,289
As expected, they're a hard nut to crack.

594
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,003
By the way,
was there really a tail on you?

595
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,630
I entered the golf course server

596
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,592
to check the security camera footage
and the main gate logs on the 10th.

597
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,927
My car came in first,

598
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,888
and a minute later, 4885 followed me in.

599
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:24,143
When I left the golf course,
4885 followed me right away.

600
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,314
So it's true that they tailed you,
but it's a burner car.

601
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,443
We've run out of clues.

602
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,280
Since we're in the area,
let's go to the scene of the incident.

603
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,575
All right.

604
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,208
It's this mountain.

605
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,599
No way.

606
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,225
You hiked up this mountain?

607
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,812
No way. You want us to go up there?

608
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,569
Right? There would've been no reason
for me to go up there

609
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,321
unless I was being attacked.

610
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:18,656
All right.

611
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,324
Let's get going.

612
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,463
It was around here

613
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,841
that I picked up his phone.

614
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,260
Here?

615
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,013
They probably got rid of
any traces of evidence.

616
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,018
Now that we've come up here,

617
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,396
one thing is certain.

618
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,107
How out of shape you are?

619
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,611
If someone really

620
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,282
tried to harm you here,

621
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,200
it was probably not done by one person.

622
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,702
Why?

623
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,412
It is impossible

624
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,164
to carry

625
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,166
your body

626
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,543
alone…

627
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,504
down the path we just came up.

628
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,798
That was a compelling analysis.

629
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,634
My height
is in the 97th percentile in Korea.

630
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,265
-What?
-Hide.

631
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:12,436
The criminal will always

632
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,857
return to the scene of the crime.

633
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,374
What?

634
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,417
Mom.

635
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,335
Father.

636
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,712
What?

637
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,560
Why does he always use the landline
when he has a cell phone?

638
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,188
Oh, this?

639
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,316
It's In-seong as a kid
when he filmed a movie.

640
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,903
But the frame cracked.
I need to replace it.

641
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,365
So…

642
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,410
you stopped by during a business trip?

643
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,411
-Yes.
-Yes.

644
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,122
Then are you two

645
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,083
colleagues?

646
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,043
Yes, she's my supervisor.

647
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,049
She's your immediate superior? Goodness.

648
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,595
In-seong is still lacking.

649
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,305
Yes.

650
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,391
Everything's ready.

651
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,810
But he's kind-hearted
if you get to know him.

652
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,146
The food is ready. Come and eat.

653
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,106
All right.

654
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,649
Let's go.

655
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,827
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

656
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:56,164
You may already know,
but cassia seed tea is good for your eyes.

657
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:03,171
Goodness. We have a guest over,
and we don't have any meat dishes?

658
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,632
All the stores were closed.

659
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,675
Really?

660
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,429
You should've given us a call
before coming.

661
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,058
I wasn't planning on coming though.

662
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,730
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were coming.

663
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:24,234
We usually just mix
everything we have with rice.

664
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,153
-Is that okay with you?
-Yes.

665
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,488
Here.

666
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,868
It's no use sending In-seong
some side dishes.

667
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,161
He never touches them.

668
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:35,829
Seriously.

669
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:37,873
-He never does.
-Don't take care of him so much.

670
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:42,085
But still,
he's working hard in a different city.

671
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,179
Se-yeon, I'm here.

672
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,722
-You're here?
-Yes.

673
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:03,190
Why didn't you eat any of my side dishes?

674
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,027
Let's just mix everything together
before they go bad.

675
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,612
Bibimbap?

676
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,865
-This looks tasty.
-These are all organic.

677
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,450
-Eat it all.
-Okay.

678
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,831
It's so good.

679
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,418
Mom, you'd still make kimchi for me
even if I get married, right?

680
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,504
You always said you'd live with me.

681
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,630
Will you get married?

682
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,090
Why wouldn't I?

683
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,717
So many guys in my major chase me around.

684
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,095
-Goodness. Is that so?
-Yes.

685
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:37,974
I'm going to see with my own eyes
who you bring on your wedding day.

686
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,101
Yes, Mother.

687
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,772
This is tasty.

688
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,440
But Mom…

689
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,404
All right.

690
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,988
-It looks tasty.
-Thank you for the food.

691
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,164
Is everything…

692
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:15,095
This looks delicious.
The sesame oil is so pungent.

693
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,734
-I'm always amazed by your good looks.
-Jeez.

694
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,528
I'll get going then.

695
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,948
I cleaned all the rooms,
and you're leaving?

696
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,994
We have no choice. We have work tomorrow.

697
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,248
He's just saying that
because he's sad to see you go.

698
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,877
Get home safely, all right?

699
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,003
Thank you.

700
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:53,675
Thank you.

701
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,177
All right.

702
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,931
Bye. Go back inside.

703
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,771
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

704
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,897
Get home safe.

705
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,690
Drive safely.

706
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,325
She's so pretty.

707
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,252
Isn't this the first time
he brought a girl home?

708
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,799
I need her time of birth
to find out their marital compatibility.

709
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,313
Hey, Se-yeon.

710
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,734
The bibimbap was good.

711
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,403
Wasn't it?

712
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,489
I don't like bibimbap.

713
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:01,243
I hate mixing foods
and mixing rice with soup.

714
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:02,994
I see.

715
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,123
I like gambas al ajillo.

716
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,042
Let's have some together next time.

717
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,461
Okay.

718
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,549
If we want that to happen,
we need to catch 4885 first.

719
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,677
We came all the way here…

720
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,681
but we're back to square one.

721
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,808
It's not square one.

722
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,602
We know for certain that the burner car

723
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,563
was tailing me.

724
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,356
Wait.

725
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,609
They were tailing you?

726
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,573
If they were tailing Mr. Kim,

727
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,285
doesn't that mean
they could be tailing us now too?

728
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,587
01 E4885

729
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,557
I'll lead them to the parking lot.

730
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,559
Will they follow us in?

731
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,237
It's that car.

732
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,448
I'll go and check.

733
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,158
What can you do on your own?

734
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,702
-Let's just go back today--
-No.

735
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,040
What if they change their car
after realizing we found out

736
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,375
and stop tailing us?

737
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,422
This is our only chance.

738
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,842
Then I'll go with you.

739
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,427
Wait. Hold on.

740
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,805
Let's go.

741
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,600
01 E4885

742
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,209
There's no one inside.

743
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:21,508
What?

744
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,054
How have you been…

745
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:28,765
Mr. Park?

746
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,484
Kim Seon-ju just arrived.

747
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,448
I'm a team leader in the sales department.
Which department are you in?

748
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,494
He is the newly appointed CEO,
Mr. Park In-seong.

749
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,834
This way, sir.

750
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,933
You were the owner of 4885?

751
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:16,146
What should I do? You found out
something you shouldn't have.

752
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,285
You have the keys
and Mr. Kim's phone, right?

753
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,286
So?

754
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:35,123
I'll do what I can to distract them.
Run as fast as you can to the car.

755
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,916
-What if--
-We have no other choice.

756
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,210
Do as I say.

757
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,673
I'm Fedor Emelianenko.

758
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:44,966
I'm Bruce Lee.

759
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,104
-Catch him.
-Stop them!

760
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,522
Hurry!

761
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,196
Come on.

762
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,281
Let go of me!

763
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,450
Get him.

764
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,247
-No! Let go!
-Come over here.

765
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,540
Damn it.

766
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,167
-Let go of me! No!
-Come over here.

767
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,300
Let go!

768
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,306
I said let go!

769
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,891
Damn it!

770
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,686
-Damn it!
-Let go!

771
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,443
Help!

772
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,365
Please help.

773
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,910
Gosh, you idiot.

774
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,537
Hey.

775
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,623
I didn't get the money yet.
What are you going to do?

776
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,751
I'll give you this. This is expensive.

777
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,463
-Please help.
-What's with the whispered conversation?

778
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,341
Did you not hear me?

779
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,552
What are you doing?

780
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,222
Hey.

781
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,156
Hey.

782
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,324
What are you going to do about this?

783
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,618
Will you cover it?

784
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,745
How will you pay for this?

785
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:44,002
-You're laughing?
-What's with this lunatic?

786
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,758
Hey, move out of the way.

787
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,347
Who sent you?

788
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,141
That's my line.

789
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,058
What?

790
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:00,977
Who are you?

791
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,188
-Who are you?
-I asked you first.

792
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,233
I'm her creditor.

793
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,323
-Just leave.
-I need my money before I leave.

794
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,577
If you take her away,
who will pay me back?

795
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,996
If you give me the money, I'll leave.

796
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,000
You must have a death wish.

797
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:26,753
Do I?

798
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,341
Anyone has a fancy plan for themselves…

799
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,719
until they get beaten up.

800
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,471
What should we do?

801
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,098
What else is there to do? Get rid of them.

802
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,558
Hey!

803
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,571
Hold on.

804
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,128
Damn it.

805
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:08,813
Hey!

806
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,579
She's a total psycho.

807
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:29,834
I have bad news.

808
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,262
Can we really do this?

809
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,598
As long as I can find out the truth,

810
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,309
I can do far worse things.

811
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,063
Who sent you?

812
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:58,905
I'll tell you.

813
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,663
Who sent you?

814
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,007
I want to know.

815
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,641
Kim…

816
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,894
Kim Seon-ju.

817
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,654
-Bum-geun!
-Breaking news.

818
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,281
Chairman Oh Bum-geun of Bumyoung

819
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,867
has passed away at the age of 75.

820
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,911
The fight for shares
between Oh Mi-ran and Oh Young-geun…

821
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,455
Mr. Kim sent you?

822
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,749
-That doesn't make sense.
-Why did he tell you to tail me?

823
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,668
I have never regretted
any of my decisions.

824
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,380
His address, phone number,
and academic background are all fake.

825
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,632
-How is that possible?
-Don't you think so?

826
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:45,428
I knew you were a good person
the moment I first met you.

827
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:54,103
