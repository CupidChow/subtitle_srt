00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,160
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,205
In and after the year 2000, computers
may not be able to recognize dates

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,207
and could start malfunctioning.

5
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,335
This is called the millennium bug or Y2K.

6
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,046
It has become a problem
for people all over the world.

7
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,800
Meanwhile, some consider it
a money-making opportunity.

8
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,970
This year being
Nam's fifth year of service,

9
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,556
he receives 90,000 won
as a monthly seniority allowance.

10
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,809
However, as the clock
strikes the year 2000,

11
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,228
his years of service
become negative 95 years

12
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,273
and his seniority allowance
changes to negative 1,710,000 won.

13
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,942
This is because the final two digits
of the year…

14
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,820
You’re not supposed to
trim your nails at night.

15
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,239
…and the computer interpreted
the year 2000 as 1900.

16
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,784
What? Why not?

17
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,124
If a vole eats your nail,

18
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,003
it will reappear looking exactly like you.

19
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,255
Really?

20
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,924
Isn't it scary?

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:36,262
So make sure not to
throw away your clippings anywhere.

22
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,806
Throw them in the trash can.

23
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,192
In-seong. Goodness.

24
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,193
In-seong.

25
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,366
In-seong.

26
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,911
What?

27
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,422
In-seong, what are you doing?

28
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,009
I’m scattering my nail clippings
so the voles can come and eat them.

29
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,887
What?

30
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,598
One of my look-alikes
can go to school instead of me,

31
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,433
and another can do my homework.

32
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,648
I’ll tell them to help
with the dishes and laundry too

33
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,526
since your back hurts.

34
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,537
Stay there. I'll go up.

35
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,208
Look over there.
There's a star that's as beautiful as you.

36
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,168
Is that so?

37
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,882
Where's your star?

38
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,801
Right there.

39
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,847
That star that's shining so brightly?

40
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,348
So that's your star.

41
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,143
You need to shine brightly too, Mom.

YEAR 2022

44
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,172
Would you like to try
this delicious apple?

45
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,927
Thank you.

46
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,401
Baro, turn it off.

47
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,154
Thank you.

48
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,324
This has been the demonstration
of Silver Lining's VR lens.

49
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,418
Nice work, Baro.

50
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,936
The days of reading storybooks

51
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,230
and watching animations are over.

52
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,775
We can now become the characters ourselves

53
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,529
to talk, feel, and experience a new world.

54
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,157
Even when you’re at home,

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,034
IU will sing in front of your eyes,

56
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,161
and Son Heung-min will pass you the ball.

57
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,205
The boundaries between fantasy
and reality have been broken.

58
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,542
This is Silver Lining's technology.

59
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,639
Why did you reject an offer
from Silicon Valley

60
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,974
and join hands with Bumyoung?

61
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,894
Is your merger with Bumyoung
the groundwork for a self-driving car?

62
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,897
A word regarding your scandal
with Oh Mi-ran of Bumyoung, please.

63
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,905
The star of today's event should be
the virtual reality experience for kids.

64
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,157
Please focus on that.

65
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,534
Princess.

66
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,872
Do you want to see the dwarfs now?

67
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,707
Yes.

68
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,218
It’s Snow White!

69
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,192
Mom, I want to take a picture
with Snow White.

70
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,360
Okay, let's go.

71
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,284
Mom, Snow White smells like Dad.

72
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,869
She does?

73
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,459
Gosh, did you drink?

74
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,346
You drank alcohol?

75
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,723
I was at a wine blind-tasting job,

76
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,892
so I had a couple of glasses.

77
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,810
I’m sorry.

78
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,770
I told you not to drink
the day before the job.

79
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,982
Do I look like a joke to you
because I’m dressed as a frog?

80
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:21,983
No, sir.

81
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,319
I wasn’t going to say this,

82
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,865
but that's why you’re still
working part-time at your age!

83
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,411
What's wrong with my age?

84
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,538
I can play any role but a child!

85
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,582
Is that so?

86
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,543
Then what are you doing here
instead of in Hollywood?

87
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,461
Well…

88
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,963
-That's because--
-Forget it.

89
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,175
Why is your friend still not here?

90
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,638
I can't reach him.

91
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,768
There need to be seven dwarfs, not six!

92
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,604
Don't you know
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?

93
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,316
My gosh. You’re so unprofessional.

94
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,193
Today's your last day.

95
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,278
Don't even think about coming back.

96
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,782
So unprofessional.

97
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,537
Ribbit.

98
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,375
Ribbit.

99
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,503
What a loud frog.

100
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,512
He's coming!

101
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,355
Contact Son Heung-min’s management

102
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,524
to arrange an additional
motion capture session

103
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,526
during the national team call-up.

104
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,445
Send a bouquet to IU’s label
congratulating her smash hit.

105
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,532
Attach a card that says
her high notes were amazing.

106
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,242
Make it sound like I care.

107
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,337
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

108
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,798
-It's okay. You can continue.
-Okay.

109
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,635
I have to attend a video conference
with Research and Development,

110
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,930
so push back the meeting at 4 p.m.
with the bank manager by 15 minutes.

111
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,635
You are connected to the main system.

112
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,140
Baro, give me a recap of my schedule.

113
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,852
Contact Son Heung-min
for his additional motion capture session.

114
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,730
Gift IU a bouquet.
A greeting card is essential.

115
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,982
A video conference
with Research and Development at 4 p.m.

116
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,651
A meeting
with the bank manager at 4:15 p.m.

117
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,194
Jeez.

118
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,531
At this rate, a personal assistant
would soon become a relic.

119
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,535
Why don’t you look for another job
before it’s too late?

120
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,539
I will look into the regulations
regarding transfer and resignation.

121
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,751
Gosh, I was just joking.

122
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,755
-Was it not funny?
-No, sir.

123
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,927
You’re more robotic than the AI machine.

124
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,266
The days of reading storybooks

125
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,852
and watching animations are over.

126
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,103
DIRECTING AND ACTING

127
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,398
We can now become the characters ourselves

128
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,027
to talk, feel, and experience a new world.

129
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,945
Even when you’re at home,

130
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,198
IU will sing in front of your eyes,

131
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,159
and Son Heung-min will pass you the ball.

132
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,953
The boundaries between fantasy
and reality have been broken.

133
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,080
Did it start yet?

134
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,457
-This is Silver Lining's technology.
-Not yet.

135
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,000
There's bean sprout soup.

136
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,756
But can you believe
that Lee Geon-uk's playing the lead?

137
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,926
You know.

138
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,014
He used to follow us around
and learn acting from us back in the day.

139
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,100
I guess he never gave up.

140
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,061
What happened to your motorcycle?

141
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,771
It broke down again.

142
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,939
Just buy a new one.

143
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,857
A delivery man needs a motorcycle.

144
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,278
If I had the money to buy a motorcycle,
I would buy motorcycle companies' stocks.

145
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,738
That's how you make money.

146
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,534
I could teach you about investment.

147
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,493
What?

148
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,372
After the Bitcoin fiasco,
you even borrowed from loan sharks.

149
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,960
I don't even look in the direction
where it says "coin" now.

150
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,795
Also,

151
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,590
tomorrow is my final interview
with Silver Lining.

152
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,344
I've got an express ticket to employment.

153
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,762
So watch what you say.

154
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,892
Hey, don’t count your chickens
before they hatch.

155
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,060
You little…

156
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,603
Hey.

157
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,481
He looks so intimidating.

158
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:13,899
Who is he?

159
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,487
The CEO of Silver Lining, Kim Seon-ju.
You don't know him?

160
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,530
Not at all.

161
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,533
Even when I eat,
I’m trying to think and act like him.

162
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,077
Such dedication
and small preparations will--

163
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,329
This looks like a memorial service to me.

164
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,834
Geon-uk's show will air soon.

165
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,335
Let's get ready.

166
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,554
It's too bright. Turn off the lights.

167
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,725
Baro, turn on the lights.

168
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,603
Okay. You made it through another day.

169
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,690
The current temperature inside
is 24 degrees

170
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,442
and the humidity is 43 percent.

171
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,943
-The air quality…
-Of course.

172
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,489
My boss is here. I'm hanging up now.

173
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,124
After analyzing
your eating habits this month,

174
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,169
I encourage you
to increase your protein intake.

175
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,299
I ordered a crate of pasture-raised eggs.

176
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,051
Good job.

177
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,807
When did you come in? Did you eat yet?

178
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,059
What about Min-a?

179
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,394
Dad!

180
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,272
Goodness, my little princess.

181
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,982
Did I wake you up?

182
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,026
More like I waited for you.

183
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,569
Read me, Snow White.

184
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,614
Oh, no. I still have some work to do.

185
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,992
Ms. Jung, can you get her
the VR headset in the living room?

186
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:47,910
Yes, sir.

187
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,372
But I like it better
when Dad reads it for me.

188
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,698
CONFIDENTIAL

189
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,708
Sir.

190
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,751
I put it in the trunk.

191
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,170
All right.

192
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,589
Should I ask for some snacks?

193
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,884
I’m fine. You may leave.

194
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,509
DAD

195
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,084
You shouldn’t do this.

196
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,378
Sir…

197
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,091
If you died, who's to pay me back?

198
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,094
You can’t die without my permission.

199
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:18,978
Here.

200
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,065
Tomorrow, at 9 a.m.

201
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,110
I collected the money,
so you better board the vessel.

202
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,365
Sir…

203
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,118
Sir, no!

204
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,246
RECRUITING SAILORS

205
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,634
INTERVIEW ROOM

206
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,512
SECOND HALF OF 2022
RECRUITMENT OF NEW EMPLOYEES

207
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,688
MS. CHOI SU-JIN

208
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,406
Yes, Mom.

209
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,492
In-seong, did you eat breakfast?

210
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,911
Yes, I had a lot.

211
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,788
You didn’t have seaweed soup, did you?

212
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,957
You don’t want to slip up.

213
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,500
You still believe in that stuff?

214
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,421
Don't worry.
I have a good feeling this time.

215
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,174
I only have good things ahead--

216
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,636
What's wrong? Did something happen?

217
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,847
In-seong!

218
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,931
I’ll call you later.

219
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,433
Okay.

220
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,768
What?

221
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,563
Hey.

222
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,540
What are you going to do about this?

223
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,632
I was just walking.
You are the one who bumped into me.

224
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,551
I have less than 30 minutes
until my interview.

225
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,095
What are you going to do?

226
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,309
Follow me to the bathroom.

227
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,436
Who do you think you are?
This is ridiculous.

228
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,771
Back in the day, I was--

229
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,653
What is it? What are you trying to do?

230
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,446
-Take it off.
-Sorry?

231
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,657
Take off your shirt.

232
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,079
Are we really doing this right now?

233
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,291
Take off your shirt and give it to me.

234
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,961
But…

235
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,256
I did nothing wrong.

236
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,176
I’m just helping a job seeker out of pity.

237
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,480
Excuse me?

238
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,443
You just left?

239
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,029
How do I return this?

240
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,493
Hey!

241
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,713
Your strength is your diligence?

242
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,299
Yes. I was awarded
for perfect attendance for 12 years

243
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,925
and I have not once been late.

244
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,177
Goodness.

245
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,929
You’re emphasizing a virtue
from the agrarian society

246
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,807
when we’re living
in an information-oriented society.

247
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,060
Your father owns an orchard?

248
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:47,978
Yes.

249
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,314
According to my father,

250
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,657
this apple is our family’s hope.

251
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,075
However, my hope…

252
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,078
He’s not going to bite it, is he?

253
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,792
…is this.

254
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,296
Then you should have
traveled to the States

255
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:18,342
and applied to that company.

256
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,430
I believe

257
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,642
Silver Lining is their equal in Korea.

258
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,019
Why are you sweating so much?

259
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,855
Befitting its status
as the leading company,

260
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,566
the pressure of the interview is rather…

261
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,529
I don't think we're the ones pressing you.

262
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,616
Your shirt is.

263
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,784
Right.

264
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,828
-I understand your reason for applying.
-So…

265
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,538
what happened was…

266
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,751
Looking over your resume,

267
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,129
I can't deny that you are different.

268
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,342
You are like Pyeongyang cold noodles.

269
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,678
Pyeongyang cold noodles?

270
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,014
Neither your educational background,
skills, nor experience

271
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,767
is exceptional.

272
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,560
Goodness.

273
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,188
You're so bland.

274
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,150
That's why I came here.

275
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,531
I am certain that Silver Lining will be

276
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,325
the vinegar that enhances my flavor.

277
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,914
Even so, don't you agree
that you don't have enough experience?

278
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,085
I need employment to acquire experience.

279
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,962
Then find employment.

280
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:40,757
That's why

281
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,343
I'm here right now.

282
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,847
You have no internship experience,

283
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,765
let alone any other experience.

284
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,350
Why would we employ you?

285
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,645
You need to give me the chance
for me to gain experience.

286
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,023
That's why you should find employment!

287
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,108
So give me one!

288
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,443
-What?
-What?

289
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,283
-Are you okay?
-What is going on?

290
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,663
Why would Kim Seon-ju,
one of the most watched men,

291
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,584
want to meet an old has-been like me?

292
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,169
Vice Chairman Oh.

293
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,130
I need Bumyoung Electronics'
active cooperation.

294
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,595
I wasn't able to pay much attention to
what my subordinates have been up to.

295
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,889
My hands were full.

296
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,434
What Bumyoung Electronics
should focus on the most is this.

297
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,936
Do you know

298
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,524
how Bumyoung Group started?

299
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,570
We came this far
by selling instant noodles.

300
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,655
I am well aware.

301
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,242
The group started off
as Bumyoung Foods in a poor country.

302
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,410
As the economy expanded

303
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,829
and construction boomed,
there was Bumyoung Construction.

304
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,749
When the economy became stable,
then came Bumyoung Electronics.

305
00:22:55,832 --> 00:23:00,170
Bumyoung has never failed
to keep up with generational trends.

306
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:06,802
Every little choice determined
the decades to come.

307
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,055
Nonetheless,

308
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,392
if Bumyoung Electronics
doesn't actively adopt AI technology,

309
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,228
it would be going against the trends.

310
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,356
Do you wish to see
the products of Bumyoung

311
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:24,361
become defunct like cassette players,
pagers, and videotapes?

312
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,949
Are you lecturing me?

313
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,452
Bumyoung Electronics lucked out

314
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,832
to find a partner in Silver Lining,
the leading company in the world.

315
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,961
On the other hand,
Silver Lining is out of luck

316
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,965
to have such an inflexible partner
as Bumyoung Electronics.

317
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,765
How old is Mr. Kim again?

318
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,018
He's 43 years old.

319
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,692
He's younger than my child. How dare he.

320
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,779
How dare this nobody

321
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,323
try to shake our company?

322
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,211
An express ticket to employment, my foot.

323
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,798
More like a southbound train to home.

324
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,145
I put up with ten years of unemployment.

325
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,148
Was it that hard to hold back
for ten minutes?

326
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,903
Gosh, you folded a lot.

327
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,197
Hold on a second.

328
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,119
Yes, landlady. I mean…

329
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,537
Hello, ma'am.

330
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,705
Yes, hello.

331
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,209
You know that your lease
expires soon, right?

332
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,961
-I've been meaning to give you a call.
-I see.

333
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,005
I'd like to extend the lease by two years.

334
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,466
What do we do?

335
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,427
I want you to move out.

336
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,849
What do you mean by that?

337
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,186
With the new law, a tenant can stay
for another two years if they want.

338
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,939
I see. Well, the law did change.

339
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,567
If an immediate family wants to move in,
the tenant has to vacate the property.

340
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,528
-An immediate family?
-Yes.

341
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,364
It's settled then.

342
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,788
-Mom, I'm back from school.
-You're here.

343
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,124
You mean him?
He's going to live here alone?

344
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,126
That's right. My son will take the room.

345
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,797
He's at the age
to crave independence, you know.

346
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,216
Independence? Am I An Jung-geun?

347
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,717
Come in! You have academy lessons.

348
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,844
Hold on.

349
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,355
You're lucky your parents live in Seoul.

350
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,902
Ju-won, hurry up!

351
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,028
Yes, Mom.

352
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,328
Goodness.

353
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,783
HOUSES FOR RENT

354
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,122
HIGH-PAYING PART-TIME JOBS

355
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,822
Why are you so late today?

356
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,741
You need to give me time to go home.

357
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,121
To my knowledge, you frequently
come and go while I'm at work.

358
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,458
When have I ever done that?

359
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,420
I pay you even for the time
that you're not present.

360
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,590
I need to go to the convenience store.

361
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,243
What's the point of keeping her alive?

362
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,621
-She's just working her girl to the bone.
-Be quiet. She'll hear you.

363
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,206
I'm saying it for her to hear.

364
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,251
I feel so bad for her.

365
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,922
She has her whole life ahead of her,
but she's here taking care of her mom.

366
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:25,054
I need experience to get a job.

367
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,932
But guess what?

368
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,563
I also need to get a job
to gain experience.

369
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,440
Same here.

370
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,234
I need to invest in stocks to make money.

371
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,569
But guess what?

372
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,488
I also need money to invest in stocks.

373
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,823
So basically all job seekers

374
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,034
who were born poor should just die.

375
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,830
Hey, Silver Lining
is not the only company in Korea.

376
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,416
It's okay. There's always a next time.

377
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,377
There probably is, but…

378
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,297
Since…

379
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,969
I know how painful it'll be
until that next time comes…

380
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,930
Why are you extra sulky today?

381
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,557
This isn't your first time
getting rejected.

382
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,935
Would today's beating

383
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,521
lessen the pain of tomorrow's beating?

384
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,814
It wouldn't.

385
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,239
So did you find a place?
What did the real estate agent say?

386
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,037
Fifty million won?

387
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,665
Yes. You need 50 million more.

388
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,999
You're talking fifty, not five--

389
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,502
That's the going price
for a place like yours.

390
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,461
How am I supposed to--

391
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,297
I get your circumstances,
but you better hurry.

392
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,801
You know that house prices in Seoul
are the lowest today, right?

393
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:45,802
Get in touch soon.

394
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,136
CHUNGNAM REAL ESTATE

395
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,681
I worked my butt off to survive.

396
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,977
Just in 2 years, my debt increased
by an extra 50 million won.

397
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,439
What did I do so wrong to be in debt?

398
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,112
You'd be lucky to be in debt.

399
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,574
What bank offers a loan to a job seeker?

400
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,956
Why don't you just move in with me?

401
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,002
It's already cramped enough by yourself.

402
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,253
But thank you.

403
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,671
What's your plan then?

404
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,007
Are you giving everything up
and moving back home?

405
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,218
I want to go back home too,

406
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,015
but almost all the companies are in Seoul.

407
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,474
What am I supposed to do?

408
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:41,733
For people like us to stay in Seoul,
our only remaining option

409
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,110
is the Seoul Detention Center.

410
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,780
Excuse me.

411
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,825
Even the Seoul Detention Center

412
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,746
is in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province.

413
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,301
That person is going to work.

414
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,470
I mean, going home.

415
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,818
What a dutiful daughter.

416
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,785
The interest rate is rising even now.

417
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,162
I've been paying it off.

418
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,206
You'll never pay it all at that rate.

419
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,041
It's 50 million won.

420
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,712
If I were you,
I'd sell an organ from the living corpse.

421
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,265
If not…

422
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,812
sell something else.

423
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,614
Can you give me a good price?

424
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,538
Just consider it your job, okay?

425
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,581
Hello, Brother.

426
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,710
Why am I your brother?

427
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,796
Where's Madam Jung?

428
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,881
Right this way, sir.

429
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,636
-Hello.
-Pour me a drink.

430
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,888
-Hello!
-Hello.

431
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,766
I like her face.
She looks like a college student.

432
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,271
I'll pay her in advance
since she has 50 million won in debt.

433
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,940
If she gets some procedures done,

434
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,943
she could probably earn
30 million a month.

435
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,739
Eight million for breast implants

436
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,116
and a million a month for skin care.

437
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,161
If I have to buy designer bags,
heels, and outfits

438
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,912
and get my hair and makeup done…

439
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,958
how much will I have left?

440
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,293
I can't work with her.

441
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,587
You said you liked her face.

442
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,089
-She doesn't have the mindset.
-Don't give me that.

443
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,424
She works as an assistant.

444
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,302
Put her to work, and she'd cause a scene.

445
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,262
Sorry.

446
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,186
Am I to work here or keep my job as is?

447
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,523
Keep your job. I'll see you again.

448
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,359
I'm not going to run away.

449
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,362
So don't come looking for me at work.

450
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,120
I don't trust people.

451
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,914
I trust money.

452
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,166
See you again.

453
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,927
I mean, isn't there a campsite
that's nearer?

454
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,060
Min-a said no.

455
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:08,356
I wonder who she takes after to prefer
such an outdated notion to a hotel suite.

456
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,478
What am I supposed to tell them?

457
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,403
Right.

458
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,114
It's been a while since I visited them.

459
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,159
I can't go empty-handed.

460
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,119
FAN, AIR BOOTS

461
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,453
SUMMER DRESS, CRYSTAL CUPS

462
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,413
BLUETOOTH EARPHONES

463
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,831
What?

464
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,749
This is pretty cheap.

465
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,626
HAM GIFT SET

466
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,627
Ta-da!

467
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,297
CHUSEOK, TWO YEARS AGO

468
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,214
What is that?

469
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:21,012
A set of canned ham
with a meat percentage of 92.44.

470
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,764
My goodness. You didn't have to.

471
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,019
The eldest son of the village head

472
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,229
took him to Hoengseong
to treat him to beef.

473
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,773
Ta-da!

474
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,442
CHUSEOK, LAST YEAR

475
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,902
What is this?

476
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:41,574
A 100 percent wild tuna set
that contains 79 percent skipjack tuna.

477
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:45,119
Oh, my. You didn't have to.

478
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,920
The youngest son of the village head

479
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:58,132
flew him to Japan for tuna.

480
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,508
Darn it.

481
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,932
I can't beat them with food.

482
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,862
Why did he come?

483
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,657
Oh, my. In-seong.

484
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,451
Why did you come? You must be busy.

485
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:30,498
What's the point of visiting
if you're just going to stand there?

486
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,459
BARO

487
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,798
What is it this time? A cooking oil set?

488
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,968
It's an AI speaker.

489
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,805
Hey, by AI, do you mean

490
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,016
the Alpha-whatever that beat Lee Se-dol?

491
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,477
It's similar.

492
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,530
You didn't have to.

493
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,575
It looks super expensive.

494
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,744
You must have money to burn.

495
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,330
You don't even know what it is.

496
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,458
As long as you have this,

497
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,920
you can control the lights and the TV
without moving an inch.

498
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:22,258
Is it that hard for you to move around
when you're young and healthy?

499
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,429
It's my fault for raising you like that.

500
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,139
Goodness!

501
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,766
It's a gift from our son!

502
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,643
You don't know the value of sweat!

503
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,730
Return it immediately, whatever Baro is.

504
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,273
Did you call me?

505
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,566
Gosh.

506
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,112
I was not able to find
the song you requested.

507
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,532
Goodness me.

508
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,079
You moron.

509
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,832
Right. "Mona Lisa."

510
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,043
I will play Cho Yong-pil's song.

511
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,723
-That is his song.
-It is.

512
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,018
Goodness.

513
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,811
My body…

514
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,065
Sir.

515
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,194
I am Park Jae-chun, the president
of Chungbuk chapter of your fan club.

516
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,482
There it is.

517
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,154
Put it in the cart.

518
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,204
Two.

519
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,667
-It's this, right?
-Yes.

520
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,962
Baked sweet potatoes, a campfire,

521
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,380
and shooting stars.

522
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,799
How romantic.

523
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,718
-You must be so happy.
-I am.

524
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,222
Above all, I'm glad
I get to go camping with Dad.

525
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,142
I can't wait.

526
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,606
Nice shot, Ms. Oh.

527
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,778
You should go professional.

528
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,656
Almost every man would go home
with his tail between his legs

529
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,824
after a game with you.

530
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,742
She's still just a woman.

531
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,121
Do you know who Sörenstam is?

532
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,707
Of course I do.

533
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,042
She is a legendary female golfer.

534
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:06,046
Even a legendary golfer like her
placed 96th in a men's tournament.

535
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,258
She embarrassed herself
by missing the cut.

536
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,348
Nice shot, Vice Chairman!

537
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,358
I'm a fan of Sörenstam as well.

538
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,238
She suddenly retired
when she was in her prime.

539
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,116
Her reputation was not tarnished

540
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,826
because she knew when to step down.

541
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,913
People call that
following the laws of nature.

542
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,831
What do you think, Mr. Kim?

543
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,082
Such laws would dictate

544
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,959
that discussion be held
in a conference room,

545
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,419
and not on a golf course.

546
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,922
All right, then.

547
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,591
Let's hurry. Min-a's waiting.

548
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,055
Would it be okay if I returned to Seoul?

549
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,350
All of a sudden?

550
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,394
If you wish.

551
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,687
The business trip is over.

552
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,481
But you won't receive overtime pay.

553
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,879
-Dad!
-Yes, No-el. Come over here.

554
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,594
Gosh, I told you I'd do it.

555
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,806
No. I'm going to tell Dad
that I did it myself.

556
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,183
So you can rest.

557
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,351
Can I?

558
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,147
SKY, WIND, STAR, AND POETRY

559
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,283
What? It's Mr. Kim.

560
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,037
Why aren't you coming?

561
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,331
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm almost there.

562
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,674
You're not late. We just came early.

563
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,384
You can eat first if you're hungry.

564
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,470
No. I'm going to eat the meat
you barbeque for me.

565
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,348
Jeez.

566
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,269
-…set up a campfire.
-What's with their driving?

567
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,270
As soon as…

568
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,064
We also bought garlic and…

569
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,276
-Hello?
-What's the name…

570
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,361
-It's not hot.
-Min-a.

571
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,530
-We also bought…
-The sound keeps cutting out.

572
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,074
Why is there no signal?

573
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,118
Dad?

574
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,538
Is something wrong?

575
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,167
I can't hear him all of a sudden.

576
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,837
I didn't get to tell him
that we bought sweet potatoes.

577
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,108
Why aren't they moving?

578
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,865
I have no service at all.

579
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,476
This is so good.

580
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,354
Of course.

581
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,607
Eat up.

582
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,947
Do a better job, will you?

583
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,534
-Goodness.
-Our son might lack skills.

584
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,036
But he's kind-hearted.

585
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,625
That's why we named him In-seong,
as in "good character."

586
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,502
One's character is important.

587
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,586
That's right.

588
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,466
Father, I have something to tell you.

589
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,302
My lump sum deposit increased.

590
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,262
Can't you move out

591
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,390
and come live with us?

592
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,852
Don't say that.

593
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,688
Why?

594
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,940
Did something happen?

595
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,699
The thing is…

596
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,079
the last typhoon hit us pretty hard.

597
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,124
I'm thinking of using this opportunity

598
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,625
to grow shine…

599
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,002
Was it Shine Muscat?

600
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,754
You know, those green grapes.

601
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,047
They say it pays.

602
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,718
You want to use my deposit for that?

603
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,930
You did as much as you can,
and I've waited long enough.

604
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,182
But still.

605
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,310
You should give up now
if you didn't make it after that long.

606
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,769
You're almost 30 now.

607
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,982
You don't even have a proper job.

608
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,318
You want me to give up again?

609
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,445
In-seong.

610
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:26,116
You told me to give up on my foolish dream
and live like everybody else.

611
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,993
That's why I quit acting.

612
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,828
-What did you say?
-Goodness.

613
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,707
That's because you were wasting
your youth doing nothing!

614
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,667
What are you saying?

615
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,879
-My gosh!
-Honey.

616
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,423
Why won't this open?

617
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,258
My goodness.

618
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,435
How many years did I even waste?

619
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,729
Two years in the military,
four years in college…

620
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:58,190
I even took two years off
to earn money for tuition.

621
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,275
I'm trying my best to do something!

622
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,487
Why do you keep saying I can't?

623
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,573
In-seong.

624
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,450
Hey, In-seong.

625
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,557
You should've finished your food
before leaving.

626
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,856
How's Father doing?

627
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,234
He's drinking soju.

628
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,112
Should we drink something expensive?

629
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,655
Something expensive?

630
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,699
Ta-da.

631
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,998
I know you're probably upset,
but imagine how your dad must feel.

632
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,340
Your dad was not like that before.

633
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:07,801
That's not true.

634
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,387
He was always like that.

635
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,681
You're wrong.

636
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:16,393
You've only seen him after he got old.

637
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:20,981
Hey.

638
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,734
Do you think you're the only one
who had a dream?

639
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,654
Your dad also had a dream,
and he was very passionate.

640
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,864
But now,

641
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,992
he's grown old

642
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,453
and only has hostility left.

643
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,256
Dreaming…

644
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:48,967
is great.

645
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,888
But what if you fail?

646
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:59,478
Your dad is just scared

647
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:04,191
that you might not be able
to get back up after falling.

648
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,320
He wants to help you get back up,

649
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,697
but he's afraid

650
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,409
he won't be able to.

651
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,132
-Correct!
-What?

652
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,887
-You try.
-Me?

653
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,973
-Yes.
-Well, a noise you make with your mouth.

654
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,226
-What?
-With your mouth.

655
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,603
Your call could not be reached.

656
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,398
-Please leave a message after the tone.
-I know! The palate.

657
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,565
Additional charges will be incurred.

658
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,109
You're right.

659
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,402
Okay, then.

660
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:54,866
What should we do?

661
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,369
Something urgent must've come up at work.

662
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,373
Are you really not going to eat?

663
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,333
You'll end up getting sick.

664
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,044
-No-el, do you want some meat?
-Dad!

665
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,547
Open up.

666
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,257
That's it.

667
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,551
Have some of this.

668
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,683
Dad is going to come.

669
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,618
DRAW YOUR UNLOCK PATTERN

671

INTERNET FORUM

672
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,752
PLEASE HELP.

673
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,713
I think I have become a smartphone.

674
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:55,844
My battery is at 15 percent right now.

675
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:01,433
I am somewhere
in the deep mountains of Chungbuk.

676
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,189
I will leave the exact coordinates below.

677
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,692
POST

678
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,069
If you see this post,
please come to where I am

679
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,071
and charge the phone.

680
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,870
WHAT A FUNNY CONCEPT

681
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,211
WHAT AN EXTREME CHARACTER

682
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,213
I will reward you.

683
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,173
I will reward you.

684
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,258
RECOMMENDATION FOR SNACKS PLEASE

685
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,760
I will reward you.

686
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,470
I will reward you.

687
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,768
Are you awake?

688
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,523
Did you have a nightmare?

689
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,276
No.

690
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,570
Was it a sad dream?

691
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,823
No.

692
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,826
It was a sweet dream.

693
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,164
Then why are you crying?

694
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,332
Because…

695
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,169
it cannot come true.

696
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,674
What was it about?

697
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,218
I…

698
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,637
became a CEO.

699
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,848
A CEO? That's a good dream.

700
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,601
You slept until this hour
because of that stupid dream?

701
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,436
Oh, dear! Honey.

702
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,397
You should be grateful to even get a job.

703
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,315
What? A CEO?

704
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,442
You're out of your mind. Let go!

705
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,653
-Goodness.
-You punk!

706
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,405
You little…

707
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,867
Where did he run off to?

708
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,493
That area has a ton of snakes.

709
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,454
Catch some while you're out there!

710
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,707
For snake wine.

711
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,558
They're announcing the results today.
Why didn't I hear back yet?

712
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,684
BEWARE OF SNAKES

713
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:16,651
What do I expect after causing a scene
during the interview?

714
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,498
What?

715
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,552
We're here again?
I wanted to go to an amusement park.

716
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,805
We can go on your birthday.

717
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,848
Really?

718
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,558
Yes, why not?

719
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,144
We'll just have the cows harvest.

720
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,022
I'll have you guys live in comfort.

721
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,566
How?

722
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,318
I'm going to become an actor.

723
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,988
Then I'll be able to make a fortune
so just wait.

724
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,158
I don't need money.

725
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,663
Just get me Mr. Cho Yong-pil's autograph.

726
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,999
Please. I'll have you
take a picture with him.

727
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,418
-You promised.
-Gosh. Don't egg him on.

728
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,088
Why are you giving him false hopes?

729
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:21,049
What's wrong with you?
You're discouraging him.

730
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,718
I'm going to help you
with whatever you need.

731
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,721
Do you want to
take acting lessons in Seoul?

732
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,766
-Are you serious?
-Of course!

733
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,936
Since we're in the mood,
do you want to dance?

734
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,021
Here.

735
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,108
Yes!

736
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,100
A snake…

737
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:19,357
I'm only…

738
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,735
twenty-nine years old.

739
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:27,198
Neither your educational background,
skills, nor experience

740
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,284
is exceptional.

741
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,410
I want you to move out.

742
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:34,539
That’s why you're still
working part-time at your age!

743
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:39,836
Well…

744
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,213
This might be for the better.

745
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,177
Mother.

746
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:48,636
Father.

747
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,389
I'll be leaving first.

748
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:57,729
All I did was borrow…

749
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,024
Did you call me?

750
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,026
All I did was borrow…

751
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,153
money from you.

752
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,321
I'm sorry.

753
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,159
-Hey. Over here.
-What?

754
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,912
I'm right here!

755
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:15,997
That's not mine.

756
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,374
Mine is over there.

757
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,044
You've been bit by a snake.
We're both dying.

758
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,422
Baro, can you save me?

759
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,050
Save me first.
I only have three percent left. Hurry.

760
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,555
-Hurry.
-I've heard this voice before.

761
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,601
There's only two percent left,
no, one percent.

762
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,436
Stop the nonsense. Call 112.

763
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,064
Not the police.
They might be involved in this.

764
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,066
-This contract--
-Call them now!

765
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,484
Charge me this instant!

766
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,219
Excuse me?

767
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,222
-Yes?
-What happened to me?

768
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,307
Vasovagal syncope.

769
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,851
Was it a poisonous snake?

770
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,228
No, it wasn't.

771
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:24,357
The shock from the bite
caused your body to overreact and faint.

772
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,818
Fortunately, the paramedics
were quick to arrive,

773
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,445
so everything worked out fine.

774
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,822
You may leave once the IV runs out.

775
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:33,908
Okay.

776
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,131
So it was mine.

777
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,300
What kind of a dream was that?

778
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,304
It's flowing in fine.

779
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:55,763
All right.

780
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,224
Right.

781
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,644
Is this your phone?

782
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,064
It was found near you.
The paramedic asked me to give it to you.

783
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,734
Don't get up.

784
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,569
Okay.

785
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,367
It's mine?

786
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:21,956
Doctor, this…

787
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,000
This thing talks.

788
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,295
Don't you…

789
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:34,594
Are you sure
you don't have to treat me again?

790
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,640
It's almost dinnertime.
Where could he have gone?

791
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,028
HIGH-PAYING PART-TIME JOBS

792
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,504
It's locked.

793
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,384
You charged me.

794
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:15,969
Hello.

795
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:19,305
I am Kim Seon-ju,
the CEO of Silver Lining.

796
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,183
Mr. Kim Seon-ju. It's nice to meet you.

797
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,352
Is that what you expected me to say?

798
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,938
Hey, if you're Kim Seon-ju,

799
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,566
then I'm Steve Jobs.

800
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,984
What complete nonsense.

801
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,612
I know it's hard to believe.
I feel the same way.

802
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,910
Is someone…

803
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,913
controlling this?

804
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,457
Or is it a voice changer?

805
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,586
I have something to show you.

806
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,094
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

807
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,680
eight, nine… One billion won?

808
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,182
As a reward,
I will give you 100 million won first.

809
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,642
Give me your account number.

810
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:05,935
ENTER ACCOUNT NUMBER

811
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,062
Is this a new type of voice phishing?

812
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,733
If it were, I'd ask you to send the money.

813
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,276
Not the other way around.

814
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,903
All right.

815
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:20,450
I only have 20,000 won anyway.
What's the worst that could happen?

816
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,503
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

817
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,464
What are you?

818
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,009
I am Kim Seon-ju,
the CEO of Silver Lining.

819
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,470
Are you really Kim Seon-ju?

820
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,929
I mean,

821
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,057
are you really Mr. Kim Seon-ju?

822
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:49,228
If you grant my request, I will give you
the remaining 900 million won.

823
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,612
If you're really Mr. Kim Seon-ju,

824
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,072
give me the rest of the money…

825
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,242
and a job at Silver Lining.

826
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,370
Very well. Go to work.

827
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:07,955
This is ridiculous.

828
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,167
In my place, work at Silver Lining

829
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,628
as the CEO.

830
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:18,424
As the CEO?

831
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,676
FOOLISH DREAMS ARE TOXIC

832
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,553
HELLO, THIS IS THE HIRING MANAGER
AT SILVER LINING

833
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:27,350
I REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU WERE NOT SELECTED

834
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:11,102
All right. I've just been cast
for the role of a CEO.

835
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,938
Show off your acting skills!

836
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,231
What game are you playing?

837
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,024
The new CEO is wet behind the ears.

838
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:20,361
Why did I suddenly get out of my car
and go up the mountain?

839
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,989
So this is what I need to help you with.

840
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,824
-Do you know who you're talking to?
-Do you want to get fired?

841
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,160
Ms. Jung can be your most reliable friend,

842
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,537
as well as your worst enemy.

843
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,914
That way we can get rid of Silver Lining

844
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,083
and my niece all at once.

845
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,377
Let's wait for him to mess up on his own.

846
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:42,091
