ALL NAMES, GROUPS, CHARACTERS,

00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,160
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:02,979
In-seong.

4
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,106
I think I know what you like.

5
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,067
No, you don't.

6
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,611
Come on.

7
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,279
I can tell.

8
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,655
What are you saying?

9
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,783
I know everything.

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,994
Se-yeon.

11
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,663
In-seong…

12
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,627
likes pink, right?

13
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,214
What?

14
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,883
How am I supposed to know that?

15
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,720
Look. He put pink paper
all over this side.

16
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,974
-I heard boys can like pink too.
-I see.

17
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,935
I like blue too.

18
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,728
You don't have to be embarrassed.

19
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,397
Yes, you're right.

20
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,734
Min-a,

21
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,945
what other homework do you have?

22
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,364
Let's see.

23
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,783
What is there?

24
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,844
Hello?

25
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,804
This is Kwak Sam-su.

26
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,140
Let's meet.

27
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,517
I have something to give you.

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,810
Me?

29
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,103
I will tell you the truth…

30
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,354
BASED ON WEBTOON UNLOCK THE BOSS
(UNLOCK MY BOSS) BY PARK SEONG-HYUN

31
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,647
…about that night.

32
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,482
Come out alone.

33
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,873
YOU ARE IN AN AREA WITH NO SERVICE

34
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,196
Mr. Kwak, stay with me.

35
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,330
Help!

36
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,123
Can you call an ambulance?

37
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,174
Anything you say from now on

38
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,260
can be used against you in a court of law.

39
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,848
What are you doing?

40
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,352
If they know you were with me,
it'll make things worse.

41
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,942
Ms. Jung, go to the office and wait.

42
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,778
He might need help
outside of the police station.

43
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,032
Darn it.

44
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,227
Mr. Park In-seong?

45
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,655
We received a report

46
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,908
that fumes were coming out
of a parked car.

47
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,247
So we went,

48
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,583
and the busy Mr. Park

49
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,294
was already there.

50
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,713
This…

51
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,716
is not suicide.

52
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,344
It's not suicide?

53
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,847
No.

54
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,021
Why do you think that?

55
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,489
If he had burned charcoal
in a closed space,

56
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,950
he probably would've wriggled around
to catch his breath.

57
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,745
But his posture was so straight.

58
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,916
The headliner on the passenger's side
was only slightly blackened.

59
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,210
So was the area around the charcoal.

60
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,587
Don't you think

61
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,632
someone could've made it look

62
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,760
like he committed suicide?

63
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,226
You saw a lot in a short amount of time.

64
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,852
Normally,

65
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,898
people panic after witnessing a death.

66
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,403
I wanted to be an actor.

67
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,781
I loved crime shows.

68
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,325
The charcoal would've been
burning for hours.

69
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,119
It's too clean.

70
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,121
Can you blacken this area a bit more?

71
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,956
Suicide is not a painless process.

72
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,875
Your posture should show
that you were struggling.

73
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,961
Create some foam coming out of his mouth.

74
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,130
-Right there, and we'll be good.
-Okay.

75
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,092
Can you make your posture
look more uncomfortable?

76
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,885
Give me some foam.

77
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,470
Please.

78
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,473
Do you understand
what situation you're in?

79
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,308
This is serious.

80
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,935
Because…

81
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,814
we also believe it wasn't suicide.

82
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,316
Right?

83
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,777
You should hurry and check…

84
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,243
That is why we arrested you as a suspect.

85
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,624
Sorry?

86
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,877
I mean, what are the chances?

87
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,088
A director of a company
commits a questionable suicide,

88
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,174
while a team leader from the same company

89
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,341
goes missing.

90
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,801
That's…

91
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,927
Right.

92
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,262
There's one more person.

93
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,305
The former president,

94
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,056
Kim Seon-ju.

95
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,559
He also disappeared overnight.

96
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,145
Then you became the CEO
out of nowhere, right?

97
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,023
Hold on a second.

98
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,733
A suicide…

99
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,110
and a missing person.

100
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,280
Then is Mr. Kim Seon-ju
really on sick leave?

101
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,698
No, before that,

102
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,408
what is your relationship with him?

103
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,952
Yes?

104
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,301
NAMBU POLICE STATION

105
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,199
Since the Bumyoung legal team
has taken action,

106
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,327
there won't be any problems.

107
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,287
Why…

108
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,998
did you help me?

109
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,794
Don't get the wrong idea.

110
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,255
It was not to help you.

111
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,007
It was to protect Bumyoung.

112
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,512
I couldn't let the CEO of our subsidiary
be the center of such a horrific rumor.

113
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,805
"Such a horrific rumor"?

114
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,809
It's Mr. Kwak who died.
A person who served you.

115
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,144
Exactly.

116
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,064
At that hour

117
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,858
and such a place,

118
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,778
the two of you planned to meet?

119
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,283
Was it something
that couldn't be discussed at work?

120
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,954
Mr. Kwak

121
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,957
was diligent and ambitious.

122
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,753
But he was easily influenced by others.

123
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,882
It's not surprising
that he ended up like that.

124
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,136
Did I not tell you?

125
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,346
If you don't stand by my side,

126
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,558
I can't guarantee your safety.

127
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:04,979
You are

128
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,522
so brazen.

129
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,567
Is there a reason for me not to be?

130
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,909
Call the person
who gave you that position.

131
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,705
Tell them to stop.

132
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,084
Then I will stop as well.

133
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,557
Think wisely

134
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,476
about whose side you'll stand by.

135
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,291
Are you okay?

136
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,710
Yes.

137
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,420
I was going to go with a lawyer,

138
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,089
but I heard you were released.

139
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,050
It must have shocked you.

140
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,597
It was my first time seeing a dead person.

141
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,728
The timing is so terrifying.

142
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,526
It happened as soon as he told us
he would come clean.

143
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,403
What's more,

144
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,780
he was found dead

145
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,199
when he was supposed to meet Mr. Park.

146
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,328
They tried to frame Mr. Park on purpose?

147
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,913
If not,

148
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,374
they wouldn't have moved his body
to that location.

149
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,753
So Mr. Kwak didn't commit suicide.

150
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,548
He was murdered.

151
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,008
But…

152
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,678
the police have reached
a different conclusion.

153
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,599
At around 5:40 a.m. today,
Kwak was found dead

154
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,395
in his car that was parked
near a hill in Seoul.

155
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,566
The police found a large amount
of charcoal inside the car

156
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,443
and closed the case as a suicide.

157
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,319
-Suicide? That's not possible.
-Next…

158
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,529
Earlier

159
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,364
the officer said it was a homicide.

160
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,282
That is why

161
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,742
we can't trust the police either.

162
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,419
Mr. Oh warned me
that my safety can't be guaranteed.

163
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,714
If I had stopped then, would Mr. Kwak--

164
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,966
Why are you blaming yourself

165
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,885
when others are at fault?

166
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,927
Who's next?

167
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,180
Who is their next target?

168
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,140
Me? No.

169
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,184
It could be my family.

170
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,811
Two billion won.

171
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,731
I will give you double the amount

172
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,400
I promised at first.

173
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,708
KWAK

174
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,347
CERTIFICATE OF APPRECIATION
KWAK SAM-SU

175
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,322
He's running.

176
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,533
He is tagged out on second base.

177
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,410
He is out.

178
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,831
Park Chang-ho hangs his head.

179
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,293
Why do you think that player was put out?

180
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,836
That was a nice move.

181
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,422
-He did a good job cutting him off.
-Yes.

182
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,050
I don't know.

183
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,934
It's because he hesitated
before running to the next base.

184
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,480
If he was going to hesitate,
he should've just stayed on the base.

185
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,024
He left the base,

186
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,153
so he should've run with all his might.

187
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,824
Bring me

188
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,994
the next base in here.

189
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,788
Right.

190
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,875
Your mother will continue to stay here.

191
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,670
What if he didn't hesitate?

192
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,007
If he ran without hesitating,

193
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,093
would things have changed?

194
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,015
We'll never know until he actually does.

195
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,780
Are you sure you don't need to go to work?

196
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,699
I told you, I quit.

197
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,826
Why would you leave
that wonderful company?

198
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,038
I wasn't cut out for the job.

199
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,831
Goodness, how pathetic.

200
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,542
You quit when it gets a little hard.

201
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,380
-That's not true.
-What do you mean?

202
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,134
You're a man, but you have no grit.

203
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,802
You're old enough,

204
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,722
but you still only think about yourself.

205
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,307
What are you talking about?

206
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,808
Do you think I quit for myself?

207
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,728
You don't even know anything.

208
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,521
-What?
-In-seong.

209
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,649
-Why that little…
-Honey, don't.

210
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,738
-Stay still.
-Am I a stock? Why should I stay still?

211
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,871
Ms. Jung!

212
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,456
Ms. Jung!

213
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,129
Hey, Ms. Jung.

214
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,424
When will Mr. Park be back?

215
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,384
Well…

216
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,135
With what happened to Mr. Kwak,

217
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,137
he's taken leave to pull himself together.

218
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,222
But still!

219
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,184
Did he not tell you when he'll be back?

220
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,229
I will check with him again.

221
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,522
My goodness!

222
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,775
Gosh.

223
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,820
I don't want to be here either.

224
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,072
This is what happens when you bring in
a nobody to take control.

225
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,123
Did you hear

226
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,666
from Mr. Park?

227
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,211
No.

228
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,717
I think he went to his hometown.

229
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,010
Should I pay him a visit?

230
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,761
There's no point.

231
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,638
He even rejected the money.

232
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,182
Our visit won't change anything.

233
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,644
Unless he becomes resolute,

234
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,688
he won't return.

235
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:07,026
But we can't just leave
the CEO position vacant.

236
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,820
The announcement
of the self-driving car's release

237
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,697
has attracted people's attention.

238
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,657
I am aware.

239
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,535
Write out a job posting for a new CEO.

240
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,704
Pardon?

241
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,331
So you can post it right away when needed.

242
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,419
Yes, sir.

243
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,431
Why beef?

244
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,226
You should've just cooked pork belly.

245
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,562
I saved some of the beef you bought us

246
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,564
so we can eat it together.

247
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,235
I guess you don't know.

248
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,653
What?

249
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,696
I guess she knows.

250
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,948
What?

251
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,283
Spending brings happiness.

252
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,121
Sharing beef brings happiness.

253
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,730
This looks delicious.

254
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,200
Look, "In-seong."

255
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,662
-My son, In-seong.
-Jeez.

256
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,123
-My son.
-Here.

257
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,130
All right. Where did it go?

258
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,557
Gosh.

259
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,018
You went through a lot.

260
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,521
It was probably tough being alone,
so far from home.

261
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,357
Mom.

262
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,447
You can lead a horse to the water,
but you can't make it drink.

263
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,490
You should do what you want.

264
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,746
It's not that.

265
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,872
What?

266
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,082
It's not?

267
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,960
Then

268
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,754
what is it?

269
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,968
-Well…
-Yes.

270
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,889
-To be honest…
-Yes.

271
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,353
Goodness. Never mind.

272
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,605
Come on.

273
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,983
Tell me.

274
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,819
Spit it out, okay?

275
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,363
Don't you know

276
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,822
I'm always

277
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,325
on your side?

278
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,993
-Right?
-Yes.

279
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,411
-Mom.
-Yes.

280
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,540
You might think I'm crazy,

281
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,044
-but the thing is…
-Yes.

282
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,801
Forget it.

283
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,765
Seriously. Tell me already!

284
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,267
So the thing is,

285
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,602
I picked up a phone in the mountains,

286
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,479
and a CEO was inside the phone.

287
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,814
What?

288
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,775
He told me his soul was trapped
inside the phone,

289
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,986
so I should become the CEO in his place.

290
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,487
-I wasn't--
-He was trapped?

291
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,657
Yes, he's trapped,
so I did a bunch of stuff,

292
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,075
and in the midst of all that,

293
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,452
I met a girl.

294
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,079
Goodness.

295
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,917
You're all grown up. You met a girl?

296
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,503
-It's so strange.
-What?

297
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,021
He must not be coming today either.

298
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,440
I'll meet you at our usual spot.

299
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,233
Bye.

300
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,459
This is so luxurious.

301
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,691
So the thing is,

302
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,194
I picked up a phone in the mountains,

303
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,071
and a CEO was inside the phone.

304
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,740
Mom!

305
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,786
-Mom.
-You're up?

306
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,828
Yes.

307
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,039
You know what,

308
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,249
about what I told you yesterday…

309
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,252
What did you tell me?

310
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,213
Goodness.

311
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,799
I drank like a fish yesterday.
I don't remember a thing.

312
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,887
My head.

313
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,555
What a mess.

314
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,934
Like mother, like son.

315
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,727
You two got completely wasted.

316
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,064
Gosh.

317
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,359
Goodness.

318
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,194
That makes me feel so much better.

319
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,737
Do you want some honey water?

320
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,948
Well…

321
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,616
Do you really not remember?

322
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,910
I don't.

323
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,955
If it was something important,
tell me again.

324
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,378
It's nothing.

325
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,421
Here, let me have that.

326
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,923
You can continue applying that.

327
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,883
You need to get prettier.

328
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,732
He has lost his mind.

329
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,153
Working in the office
must've been hard for him.

330
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,571
He's blabbering nonsense.

331
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,198
"A person inside a phone"?

332
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,410
Do we need to take him to a hospital?

333
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,455
I'll make an appointment.

334
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,543
Do you know a doctor?

335
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,422
-Trust me.
-What?

336
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,515
I beg you, gods of heaven and earth.

337
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,394
Please free the poor soul.

338
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,734
He is possessed.

339
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:47,986
Please.

340
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,042
A spirit caught in the three calamities

341
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,586
is on your son's shoulder.

342
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,673
Do spirits

343
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,425
go through the three calamities too?

344
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,512
The spirit will likely
have a chip on his shoulder

345
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,348
if he was successful in his lifetime.

346
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,143
He is a spiteful spirit.

347
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,478
Gosh!

348
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,814
Then what should I do?

349
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,233
He's my only son.

350
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,932
Catch.

351
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,577
It's been a while.

352
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,122
These days…

353
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,544
you seemed as lively
as you were back when you acted.

354
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,715
What's the matter?

355
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,926
Were you in a similar situation?

356
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,846
A similar situation?

357
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,060
Were you not able
to hold your temper again?

358
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,188
-I said stop!
-I should write what I want?

359
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,440
Sure.

360
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,067
To you, I probably look stupid
for not doing what I want.

361
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:54,279
Could you say that
even if you were from a poor family?

362
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,281
You have too much money
and time on your hands!

363
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,284
-That's why you can say that!
-Then what about you?

364
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,912
Why are you so relaxed
when you don't even have anything?

365
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,248
You want to write drama scripts?

366
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,210
You came all the way to Seoul
to write scripts but look at you.

367
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,172
All you do is sleep all day
after staring at a screen all night!

368
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,300
When things don't work out,

369
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,135
all you do is drink.

370
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,222
Your father is protesting in Seoul
so he could support you,

371
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,599
and you just talk back.

372
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,059
Mind your own business.

373
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,561
That man's acting is fantastic.

374
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,778
We're busy. Where did you go?

375
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,614
Someone in Mr. Kim's family passed away.

376
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,532
I should offer my condolences.

377
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,035
-Which Mr. Kim?
-What?

378
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,373
Well, that is…

379
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,875
Let's go.

380
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:56,966
Why are you so inquisitive
about my whereabouts?

381
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,096
From olden times,
men are the sky, and women are the land.

382
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,307
You know land
is more expensive these days, right?

383
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,144
If you don't want to die,
get back home this instant.

384
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,277
That is not the point!

385
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,615
Just say you didn't see anything.

386
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,993
I saw it with my own eyes.

387
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,622
I saw Mr. Han touch Ji-yeon
during the team dinner for Burning Flames.

388
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,916
I get it.

389
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,835
But as long as you turn a blind eye,

390
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,420
it'll pass like nothing happened.

391
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,839
We need to keep acting, right?

392
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,843
How can you say that?

393
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,512
In-seong, calm down for now.

394
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,139
My goodness.

395
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,058
What do you want me to do then?

396
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,352
If you try to hit a rock with an egg,

397
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,312
only the egg will crack.

398
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,941
Mr. Han is acting that way
because the eggs are playing it safe!

399
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,069
This punk is making me look--

400
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,904
Please, compose yourself.

401
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,156
I won't hit him.

402
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,325
Hey,

403
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,368
Mr. Han

404
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,956
is connected to every industry
including theater, shows, and movies.

405
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,208
I'm saying this for your sake.

406
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,419
Yes, of course. In-seong is aware of that.

407
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,296
If you get on his bad side,

408
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,047
your career's over.

409
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,174
Are you okay with that?

410
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,134
Are you?

411
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:23,845
Gosh! Hey.

412
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,057
If I have to get kicked out
for pointing out faults,

413
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,392
I'd rather quit.

414
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,894
Hey.

415
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,563
-How dare he?
-In-seong.

416
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,815
-Hold on.
-What?

417
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,359
I don't think

418
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,069
this is right either.

419
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,745
Why did you quit your acting career
all of a sudden?

420
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,498
Just because.

421
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,082
I wasn't cut out for the job.

422
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,417
Jeez.

423
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,836
You said I would get to see you
in soap operas.

424
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,968
Did something happen?

425
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,720
No.

426
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,307
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings and arrows

427
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,308
of outrageous fortune,

428
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,561
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

429
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,522
and by opposing end them."

430
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,193
"To die,

431
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,110
to sleep,

432
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,698
no more,

433
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,993
and by a sleep,

434
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,996
to say we end."

435
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,332
AUDITIONS

436
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,583
I am finished.

437
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,501
JUDGE

438
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,836
I see you're well-prepared.

439
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,003
Nice job.

440
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,380
You'll be notified of the results.

441
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,881
Thank you.

442
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,468
He's perfect.

443
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,303
I know,

444
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,097
but we can't cast him.

445
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,723
Why not?

446
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,934
He's the guy. "Mr. Han."

447
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,227
What? "Han"?

448
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,273
So just forget about him.

449
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,566
Next.

450
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,405
I just realized
that I'm not talented enough.

451
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,240
Gosh.

452
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,825
What are you planning on doing

453
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,743
if you quit now?

454
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,163
I'll give it time and figure things out.

455
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,126
I'm still young.

456
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,051
You knew it all along?

457
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,305
If you want to make it through life,

458
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,308
sometimes you have to turn a blind eye

459
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,268
and pretend you didn't hear stuff.

460
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,063
If you keep thinking
you're the only righteous one

461
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,316
it'll be your loss.

462
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,698
But…

463
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,286
you did the right thing.

464
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,666
You were right…

465
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,087
and I felt proud to call you my son.

466
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,427
Though I made a poor living,
I realized I raised my child well.

467
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,555
My heart was filled with pride.

468
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,363
I'm sorry for being an incompetent father

469
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,532
that couldn't help his only child…

470
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,497
get back on his feet when he fell.

471
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,572
It's past your bedtime.

472
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,367
Is In-seong not coming today either?

473
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,371
He will once you go to sleep.

474
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,081
That's a lie.

475
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,098
You were right

476
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,726
and I felt proud to call you my son.

477
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,748
In-seong, I think I know what you like.

478
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,374
Min-a,

479
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,835
what other homework do you have?

480
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,296
JULY EVENTS

481
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,715
"July 16th, Family Field Day"?

482
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,196
The CEO is gone.

483
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,447
That means I have no job.

484
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,201
Get here by 7:40 a.m. tomorrow.

485
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,038
He got locked up.

486
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,122
I get why he ran away.

487
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,501
Do you think everyone's like you?

488
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,960
He's not here again.

489
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,962
Where is In-seong these days?

490
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,339
Well,

491
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,049
there's a lot going on at work.

492
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:54,926
You're all lying.

493
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,177
He's the same as Dad.

494
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,929
He left me too.

495
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,902
Just let her be.

496
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,613
Even seven-year-olds need some alone time.

497
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,697
But still…

498
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,657
She's right though.

499
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,492
If he was going to up and leave,

500
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,494
he shouldn't have let her get so attached.

501
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,412
Gosh.

502
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,999
Hey, are you nuts?

503
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,918
Yes, I am.

504
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,378
You know what?

505
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,631
You shouldn't have let me get so attached.

506
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,966
If this were your end game,

507
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,553
you shouldn't have reached out your hand
to someone in a bottomless pit.

508
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:40,847
Hey.

509
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,814
You're really not going?

510
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,983
I said I'm not!

511
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,609
Just tell them I'm sick!

512
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,238
If you keep lying, your nose will grow.

513
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,824
That's also a lie.

514
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,576
My goodness.

515
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,077
I'm not going!

516
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,666
I told you not to come inside.

517
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,376
I'm not going!

518
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,672
When did you come, In-seong?

519
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,466
CHERRY TREE KINDERGARTEN
EXCITING FAMILY FIELD DAY

520
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,513
How did you know today was field day?

521
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,308
Your dad told me.

522
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,310
-He did?
-Yes.

523
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,728
Really?

524
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,897
He asked me to go in his stead

525
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,441
over and over again.

526
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,985
-He did?
-Yes.

527
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,029
Right, Se-yeon?

528
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:39,947
That's right.

529
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,575
He told us to win first place.

530
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,203
-We can do it.
-We can do it.

531
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,287
Pull!

532
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,332
CHERRY TREE KINDERGARTEN
EXCITING FAMILY FIELD DAY

533
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,584
-One, two.
-One, two.

534
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,835
All right!

535
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,265
Get ready. Look forward.

536
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,308
One…

537
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,436
I am Usain Bolt. I am Quicksilver.

538
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,567
Let's go!

539
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,843
Are you back for good?

540
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,304
You have to go with us until the end.

541
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,598
I will.

542
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,560
I am well aware

543
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,021
that nothing will change
even if I run away.

544
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,440
The evil-doers

545
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,858
will continue to prosper,

546
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,152
and I will hide

547
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,488
while living with anxiety

548
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,073
and full of regret.

549
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,783
The closer we get

550
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,411
to the truth and the culprit,

551
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,163
the more dangerous it will get.

552
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,084
Catching those jerks…

553
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,713
will protect me…

554
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,967
and my family.

555
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,429
If you made up your mind,

556
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,347
sign the contract.

557
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,058
SILVER LINING CEO AGREEMENT
(SPECIAL CONTRACT)

558
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,353
It's for the two billion won

559
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,396
that was offered verbally.

560
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,694
I didn't come back because of that.

561
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,824
The reason I started all of this

562
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:29,784
was money.

563
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,745
But now,

564
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,705
that's not the only reason.

565
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,625
I know.

566
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,003
Money can influence you
because you're human.

567
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,632
But because of the same reason,
money alone can't move you.

568
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,884
Our encounter

569
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,260
has taught me that.

570
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,806
Thank you

571
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,100
for coming back, Mr. Park.

572
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,614
This here

573
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,199
is yours.

574
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,832
FAMILY OF KIM MIN-A

575
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,625
You didn't go home?

576
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,170
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

577
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,631
Why did you come back?

578
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,134
Your parents are in the countryside.

579
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,511
And I understood how you felt.

580
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,935
There was a time…

581
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,357
when I wanted to become like Batman
and fight against injustice.

582
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,986
But the thing is,

583
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,571
back then,

584
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,115
I didn't have a supercar, wealth,

585
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,242
or a butler.

586
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,121
I failed at being one
because I only had bravado.

587
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,290
But now, things are different.

588
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,042
Sorry?

589
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,463
I have a supercar, wealth,

590
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,842
and a partner
who can travel around the nation

591
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,552
on a 5G network with a speed of 2.8GHz.

592
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,262
I also have a partner

593
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,264
who is as sharp

594
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,141
as one can be.

595
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,478
What's more,

596
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,980
I have someone who is worth ten butlers.

597
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,691
You.

598
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,195
How about you?

599
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,281
Aren't you in danger as well?

600
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,117
How do you remain so loyal?

601
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,952
Don't you remember?

602
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,623
Mr. Kim promised me something.

603
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,180
Mom.

604
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,099
Mom, where are you?

605
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,685
MOM COMPLETE

606
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,978
Hyeon-jeong.

607
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,439
NAME: KIM GEUN-YEONG
AGE: 62

608
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,609
Mom.

609
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,077
Have you been well?

610
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,539
I missed you.

611
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,809
Mom,

612
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,018
goodbye.

613
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,771
The Silver Lining
VR experience is now over.

614
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:03,998
Mom.

615
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,377
Ms. Jung.

616
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,546
Ms. Jung.

617
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,215
-Let's go.
-Right. I'm sorry.

618
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,725
Mr. Kim.

619
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:28,772
Can VR

620
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,150
simulate anyone?

621
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,236
It's possible as long as we have the data.

622
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,413
Bring me files
that contain your mother's voice.

623
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,539
Videos and photos too.

624
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,666
The more, the better.

625
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,418
Let me know when you're ready.

626
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,004
It sounds foolish, right?

627
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,006
It's fake anyway.

628
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,053
No.

629
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,055
I totally understand

630
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,474
where you're coming from.

631
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,602
I guess…

632
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,314
I just wanted to hear her say

633
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,233
her last goodbye.

634
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,154
A thought came to my mind.

635
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:22,493
Mr. Kim can still talk,
though his body may have disappeared.

636
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,829
But even though…

637
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,792
I can see my mom in front of my eyes,

638
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,711
I can't talk to her.

639
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:39,802
Se-yeon.

640
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,638
Who could consider her to be alive?

641
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,864
When…

642
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,703
do you think people die?

643
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,332
Sorry?

644
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,253
I read it in a comic book.

645
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,214
People die…

646
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,467
once they're forgotten.

647
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,265
Just like you remember your mother,

648
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,392
your mother still remembers

649
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,644
everything about you.

650
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,188
She probably desperately

651
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,440
wants to talk to you.

652
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,067
"I am so proud

653
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,820
to call you my daughter."

654
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,906
Wouldn't she say that?

655
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,287
Yes.

656
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,542
Mr. Park returned.

657
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,215
There's a proverb that goes, "Who keeps
company with the wolf will learn to howl."

658
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,552
He who touches the pitch

659
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,847
will be defiled.

660
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:12,019
He must've enjoyed playing CEO.

661
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,646
What should we do?

662
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,861
If ink gets on your shirt, it won't erase.

663
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,199
Then what else can you do?

664
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,495
You must throw it away.

665
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,965
We need to trace back to the moment

666
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,509
Mr. Kwak called us.

667
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,094
Our opponents

668
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,889
knew I was going to meet Mr. Kwak.

669
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,017
Since they planned to frame me.

670
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,269
That means the information was leaked

671
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,188
either from us or Mr. Kwak's side.

672
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,815
A tail, wiretapping, or betrayal.

673
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,985
There are so many possibilities.

674
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,112
Since it's complicated,
let's think simply.

675
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,788
Mr. Park,

676
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,207
after hanging up that day,

677
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,625
Mr. Kwak called again.

678
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,544
Let's meet.

679
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,712
I have something to give you.

680
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,465
Me?

681
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,467
I will tell you the truth

682
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,553
about that night.

683
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,429
Come out alone.

684
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,935
Mr. Kim, he said he'll come clean.

685
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,354
Did you hear me?

686
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,817
Hello? Mr. Kwak?

687
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,951
He hung up without saying a word,

688
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,371
so I just thought
it was because he felt uneasy.

689
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,374
What if it wasn't Mr. Kwak?

690
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,333
What?

691
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,127
It could've been a redial.

692
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,129
After Mr. Kwak hung up,

693
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:06,049
someone could've come and redialed
to check who he was calling.

694
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,676
Tracing that number

695
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,760
is our priority.

696
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,646
Here.

697
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,320
When did you…

698
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,323
Is there no kimchi?

699
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,331
Or some soy sauce at least.

700
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,874
It's better with soy sauce.

701
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,212
Go straight and make a left.

702
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,298
Go straight

703
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,215
then turn left?

704
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,508
Yes, you're almost there.

705
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,804
How far do we go?

706
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,139
-Until the stairs.
-Stairs?

707
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,143
I see. It's right here.

708
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,403
I traced the number,

709
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,656
and its location is around Yeongbo Park.

710
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,158
There should be a pay phone there.

711
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,662
I think it's that.

712
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,461
Let's see.

713
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,673
There are no clues here.

714
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,217
What about crime prevention cameras?

715
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,469
CCTV OPERATION MANAGEMENT

716
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,808
There are only cameras
directed toward the inside of the park.

717
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,102
None of them are directed
toward the pay phone.

718
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,696
Where are you going?

719
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,120
Welcome.

720
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,080
Let me see the camera footage.

721
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,500
-Why?
-Because I said so.

722
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:09,381
Could we check the footage
of the security camera out front?

723
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,303
That camera is a dummy
to prevent violent crimes.

724
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,223
I swear it's fake.

725
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,108
This is the only shop nearby.

726
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,277
What should we do?

727
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,245
What?

728
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,205
Music.

729
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,375
I heard music.

730
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,012
YEONGBO PARK BUSKING

731
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:04,770
Gosh.

732
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,522
It's already been three hours.

733
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,275
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

734
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,069
What was that just now?

735
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,196
You sounded like my mom.

736
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,081
I found the needle!

737
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,129
YEONGBO PARK BUSKING

738
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,964
The date and time match.

739
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,842
It's Mr. Kwak.

740
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,266
I knew it.

741
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,227
Someone else called me back.

742
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,068
We can sort of make him out.

743
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,028
Who is that?

744
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,196
He looks familiar.

745
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,162
-What is it?
-He's Mr. No.

746
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:05,997
Who's that?

747
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,959
He's a driver

748
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,210
for Mr. Oh.

749
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,004
-The live stream is ready.
-Okay. Good work.

750
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,346
NAM ****-WON, MALE

751
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,851
What happened?

752
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,978
What do you mean?

753
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,356
Why didn't you tell me

754
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,151
about Mr. Nam?

755
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,241
I have no obligation

756
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,036
to update you about everything.

757
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:28,914
Do they know?

758
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,751
I don't move without orders.

759
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,256
Then…

760
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,509
if you're given the order…

761
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,555
you could do the same to me.

762
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,652
I hope you act accordingly

763
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,196
so that I don't have to
do that to you too.

764
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,326
Hello? Mr. Kwak?

765
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,761
I think you need to buy a new flowerpot.

766
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:10,932
Okay.

767
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:12,976
I will proceed.

768
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,118
We have arrived.

769
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,418
How is

770
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,045
Mr. Park doing?

771
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,382
There were no signs of him
coming in contact with Ms. Oh.

772
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,178
Keep your eye

773
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,429
on him.

774
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,977
Right.

775
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,064
At the press conference,
I remember Mr. Park

776
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,650
being fixated on his wireless earbuds.

777
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,153
It was as if

778
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,364
someone was feeding him lines.

779
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,658
I will look into that as well.

780
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,044
If it's Mr. No,

781
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,796
is Mr. Oh behind everything?

782
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,050
I know he feels bitter about Mr. Kim,

783
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,218
but he went too far.

784
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,054
It's not just bitter feelings.

785
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,598
Once the self-driving car is launched,

786
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,476
Bumyoung could end up falling
into the hands of his niece.

787
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,146
But still, he went too far.

788
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,649
He worked with Mr. Kwak for over 20 years.

789
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,734
How could he do that
to someone like family?

790
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,611
We'll make him pay.

791
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,132
Hello.

792
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,967
Your house is so nice.

793
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,517
B MART

794
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,112
Be careful.

795
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:32,532
He was in the special forces
before becoming Mr. Oh's driver last year.

796
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,575
The special forces?

797
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:37,162
Mr. Oh prefers hiring former soldiers.

798
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,793
It's surprising to see you here.

799
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,589
It's because I followed you.

800
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,840
Me?

801
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,886
Do you need me
to relay a message to Mr. Oh?

802
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,180
Let us

803
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,140
not drag it out.

804
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,535
You tailed Mr. Kwak,

805
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,622
and he just happened to
"commit suicide" the next day.

806
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,417
I'm going to take this to the police.

807
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,379
This is your last chance

808
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,839
to come clean.

809
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,342
If you go to the police,

810
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,136
do you think they will listen to you?

811
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,848
Don't get ahead of yourself.

812
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,560
You're up against Bumyoung.

813
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,529
Over here!

814
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,299
You were just being exploited too.

815
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,259
Just come clean…

816
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,234
You should've expected this much.

817
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,404
He's pointing a gun.

818
01:00:58,946 --> 01:00:59,781
What now?

819
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,493
At the press conference,
I remember Mr. Park

820
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,912
being fixated on his wireless earbuds.

821
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,752
You're holding on to your phone
in this situation?

822
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,380
It must be very important to you.

823
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,466
I was wondering who was behind
the job seeker from the boonies.

824
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,843
I guess I'll find out soon.

825
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:27,392
Stop digging and pretend
you don't know anything

826
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,019
if you at least want to live.

827
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,373
How could you let him take the phone?

828
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,749
Mr. Kim has been abducted.

829
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,128
No.

830
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,172
It was our plan.

831
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,267
Take me to a nearby motel.

832
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,163
YOU DREW THE WRONG PATTERN

833
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,350
Yes.

834
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,812
I'm moving to another motel.

835
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,940
We'll know who he talks to, where he goes,

836
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,360
and ultimately, who is controlling him.

837
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,445
MOTEL GO

838
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,071
Starting now,

839
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,492
we're going to find out everything.

840
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,917
You saw it too. What if they harm you?

841
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,835
Mr. Kim.

842
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,838
If it were Mr. Kim,
he wouldn't have given up, right?

843
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:05,967
The topic of today's meeting is,
"Who killed Mr. Kwak Sam-su?"

844
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,885
Am I included?

845
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,262
-Yes.
-About Mr. Park's phone…

846
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,346
You can unlock it, right?

847
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,849
-We'll know who's controlling him.
-Is something wrong?

848
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:13,850
Please go to BY Hotel.

849
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:14,976
We have no time.

850
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,352
It's still too dangerous.

851
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,478
There's nothing we can do.

852
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:18,896
Here.

853
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,898
-We found it.
-Firm beliefs won't do. We need evidence.

854
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,733
We need conclusive evidence.

855
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:30,199
