1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,283
ALL NAMES, GROUPS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND EVENTS

2
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,160
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,133
Leave it there.

4
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,934
Gosh, look at all of this.

5
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,688
The chief mourner must be a big shot.

6
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,519
Thank you.

7
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,312
Isn't that Executive Director Oh?

8
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,313
Go ahead.

9
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,233
What is the heiress
of Bumyoung doing here?

10
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:52,278
You didn't know? I heard they had a thing
while studying abroad in the US.

11
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,949
Gosh. What are they doing
at his wife's funeral?

12
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,920
You haven't eaten anything.

13
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,173
I'll stay here, sir.

14
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,093
It's okay.

15
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,929
How's Min-a doing?

16
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,390
HYEON JU-HUI

17
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,601
CHIEF MOURNER: KIM SEON-JU
DAUGHTER: KIM MIN-A

18
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,602
Are you really Kim Seon-ju?

19
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,896
Are we starting this conversation
all over again?

20
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,898
I am Kim Seon-ju.

21
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,775
Then why is this person saying
this phone is theirs?

22
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,028
If there was another Kim Seon-ju,

23
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,738
would they do nothing

24
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,240
when a stranger
is taking over the company?

25
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,703
Then who sent me that text?

26
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,373
Both the call and the texts
were from an unknown number.

27
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,084
They are fishing for information,
hiding behind anonymity.

28
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,671
I told you, didn't I?

29
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,466
They didn't expect me
to end up like this either.

30
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,510
As both parties are flying blind,

31
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,678
they're nervous.

32
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,809
Then what should I do now?

33
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,852
Don't do anything.

34
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,355
We can't give them any clues.

35
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,858
This could be a chance to strike back.

36
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,060
Is that even possible?

37
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,814
Tracing an unknown number?

38
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,150
It's normally impossible.

39
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,194
But it's possible for me.

40
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,406
Because you're a phone?

41
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,367
No, because I'm Kim Seon-ju.

42
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,828
But I can't do it here.

43
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,913
Why not?

44
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:53,084
Your laptop is outdated,
and there's no tracking software.

45
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,131
-Then tomorrow, at work--
-I can't use those either.

46
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,843
Due to safety reasons,
only certified software is allowed.

47
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,886
What? You said it was possible.

48
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,723
Is there no other way?

49
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,516
The computer in my study.

50
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,517
Goodness.

51
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,769
Over my dead body.

52
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,480
It was terrifying enough once.
You want me to do it again?

53
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,400
I can't. I won't.

54
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,071
Mr. Park, stay at my house from now on.

55
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,197
Sorry?

56
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,782
The hotel is too open to unwanted visitors

57
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,118
and has the possibility
of getting wiretapped.

58
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,078
Also…

59
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,874
your place is unlivable.

60
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,717
So…

61
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,013
You want me to live in your house?

62
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,058
In that palace-like…

63
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,935
mansion?

64
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,361
Buy yourself some rice cakes.

65
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,155
Thank you, sir.

66
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,283
This is it.

67
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,538
What a beautiful night.

68
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,543
This is amazing.

69
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,628
Look at that tepee.

70
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,800
You little punk.

71
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,345
You made us lose so much sleep
when you were unemployed.

72
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,765
I see you've had a plan all along.

73
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,058
I knew it.

74
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:49,909
Who is it?

75
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,287
Hey, tell everyone to come.

76
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,217
Can you open the door?

77
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,427
What?

78
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,321
Hey.

79
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,116
You should've offered to treat me first.

80
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,326
Did I have to beg you?

81
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,419
Why are you so quiet?

82
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,920
Is there something wrong?

83
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,006
Sorry.

84
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,801
Hyeon-ho.

85
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,888
If…

86
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,433
Let's say…

87
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,980
a person got trapped inside a phone--

88
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,857
Hey.

89
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,443
Get your head straight.

90
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,072
For chicken stir-fry,
it's udon noodles, not instant noodles.

91
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,407
-Ma'am!
-Yes?

92
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,950
Can you give us udon noodles?

93
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,911
Okay. An order of udon noodles!

94
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,914
Don't mix it.
I'm going to add udon noodles.

95
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,790
Go on.

96
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,709
What about a phone?

97
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,213
So…

98
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,216
a person got into an accident…

99
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,764
and his soul got trapped inside a phone.

100
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,349
Is that a new TV series?

101
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,601
It sounds fun. Where can I watch it?

102
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,228
I should buy the company's stocks.

103
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,522
Can't you take this seriously?

104
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,648
What do you mean?

105
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,441
Is it possible to radio
someone from the past

106
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,944
or for a goblin and a grim reaper
to live together?

107
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,655
Tell me something I can believe.

108
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,701
Right? It's impossible, isn't it?

109
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,748
A person is trapped inside a phone?

110
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,839
I feel like someone is inside
my phone right now.

111
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,258
Are you there?

112
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,759
Are you trapped?

113
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,735
The last time I saw him
was before he left for the campsite.

114
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,323
He never arrived at the campsite.

115
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,535
I suddenly couldn't reach him.

116
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,205
The next day, he sent a text
about a new project at work

117
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,165
and went off-grid.

118
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,544
I can't reach him either.

119
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,924
He left Min-a alone.

120
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,845
He's not someone who'd do that.

121
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,187
Do you not have…

122
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,232
the faintest idea?

123
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,117
I don't.

124
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,864
You're late.

125
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,452
He kept begging me to stay
for another drink.

126
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,412
It was a hassle trying to get him off me.

127
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,248
That's another reason
for you to live in my house.

128
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,252
No more personal engagements
during our contract period.

129
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,796
I can't trust you to make any mistakes.

130
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,547
That's a power trip.

131
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,845
While you were out,
I gave Mr. Sim and Ms. Jung a heads-up.

132
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,931
Already?

133
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,599
The problem is Min-a.

134
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,601
Your daughter?

135
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,562
You probably don't know
because you've never raised a child,

136
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,898
but it's not easy to get close to kids.

137
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,861
Min-a has an especially hard time
opening up to others.

138
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,867
Min-a is chasing after me.

139
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,285
Let's run away.

140
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,079
-I'm going to get you.
-Save Snow White.

141
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,664
Frog Prince.

142
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,582
Prince, please help me.

143
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,460
Frog Prince.

144
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,841
I got you.

145
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,718
That was so much fun. Can we do it again?

146
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,096
Was it fun?

147
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,139
Shall we do it again?

148
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,225
-You're interesting.
-What do you mean?

149
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,853
Dad's friends usually just give me money.

150
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,147
And if they're low-ranking,
they compliment me.

151
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,482
You're the first person
who played with me.

152
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,989
Min-a, just to let you know,

153
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,949
you shouldn't call someone "low-ranking."

154
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,617
Why not?

155
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,455
No person is above another.

156
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,457
Then what should I call them?

157
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,585
Colleagues?

158
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,713
Then are you two colleagues too?

159
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,021
Thank you for helping me.

160
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,732
Mr. Kim told me that if you joined,

161
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,526
Min-a would open up more easily.

162
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,157
You can get in touch with Mr. Kim?

163
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:05,910
Sorry?

164
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,580
Do you know where he is?

165
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,377
Everything's ready.

166
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,547
You will be using Mr. Kim's study.

167
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,632
All right.

168
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,930
I shouldn't forget about my shoes.

169
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,975
How do you know the study is that way?

170
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,061
Sorry?

171
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,854
Right.

172
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,692
I thought I saw you coming down
from the second floor.

173
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,279
Am I wrong?

174
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,615
I'll escort you. Follow me.

175
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,658
Okay.

176
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,206
Isn't it a bit strange?

177
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,667
Introducing someone new to Min-a?

178
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,086
It's not like Mr. Kim.

179
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,297
You received a call from Mr. Kim?

180
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,133
Yes.

181
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,637
-Was anything--
-I've worked for him for decades.

182
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,057
It was definitely his voice
and his way of speaking.

183
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,642
Including his narcissism?

184
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,564
Then there's no room for doubt.

185
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,241
Some might freak out at the sight of this,

186
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,118
but I have nerves of steel.

187
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,161
-It's the room at the end.
-Okay.

188
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,788
This looks so cute like a rabbit.

189
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,166
You can rest up here.

190
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,962
I replaced the bedding.

191
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,631
Excuse my intrusion, ma'am.

192
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,550
Goodness, you're so polite.

193
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,261
Let me know
if you have any favorite dishes.

194
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,680
Okay. Thank you. Go ahead.

195
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,265
-Get some rest.
-I will.

196
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,892
Once you leave, I will.

197
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,852
You're so well-mannered.

198
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,061
I'll close the door.

199
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,321
Vroom.

200
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,782
You guys are holding up well.

201
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,006
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,466
I couldn't contact you sooner.

203
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,177
Shall we get started now?

204
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,059
Can we trace the unknown number now?

205
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,101
Of course.

206
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,853
How long will it take?

207
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,271
It's a matter of time.

208
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,485
Get started then.

209
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,742
Is everything busy at work?

210
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,287
Yes.

211
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,706
He left without even saying bye this time.

212
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,083
Dad is so mean.

213
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,251
He's busy.

214
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,172
If you meet him at work,
make sure to tell him I'm upset. Okay?

215
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,091
Okay.

216
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,134
Let's go back inside.

217
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,994
The Bumyoung Dragons
will make their first choice.

218
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,163
Why don't you pick someone?

219
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,504
I know nothing about baseball.

220
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,880
It's okay.

221
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,843
It doesn't matter who gets chosen.

222
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,637
What matters is the person who chose them.

223
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,770
Choose someone
when you're given the chance.

224
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,608
CHO YUN-HYEONG

225
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,526
PARK SEUNG-HYEON

226
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,947
Him.

227
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:36,346
2023 KBO ROOKIE DRAFT
1ST ROUND

228
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,560
The Bumyoung Dragons select

229
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,229
an infielder from Gilcheon High School,

230
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,523
Jung Hyeon-jae, as our first pick.

231
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,442
JUNG HYEON-JAE

232
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,445
The Bumyoung Dragons
made a surprising choice.

233
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,948
I'm wondering the same thing
as you, Ms. Jung.

234
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,951
Why did Kim Seon-ju…

235
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,205
choose Park In-seong?

236
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,253
Keep a close eye on Mr. Park for me.

237
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,436
What?

238
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,986
Excuse me, where is my…

239
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,905
Where did Lee Jeong-yeon go?

240
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,990
Right. You're her daughter.

241
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,868
Were you not aware?

242
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,336
I can watch every single channel.

243
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,760
Goodness.

244
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,721
I didn't know you had such deep pockets.

245
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,725
Goodness.

246
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,602
How nice.

247
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,770
BUMYOUNG HOSPITAL
DIRECTOR OH CHANG-MUK

248
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:11,275
Your mother is a long-stay patient
at Bumyoung Hospital, right?

249
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,363
I understand your sorrow

250
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,158
better than anyone else.

251
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,216
Keep a close eye on Mr. Park for me.

252
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,272
Mr. Park, wake up.

253
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,358
Mr. Park, wake up.

254
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,236
Mr. Park, wake…

255
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,404
Get up!

256
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,531
Why?

257
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,909
Am I late?

258
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,162
I found a way.

259
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,831
The number?

260
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,959
Who was it? An acquaintance?

261
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,086
Mr. Sim? Mr. Kwak?

262
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,213
Well…

263
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,178
If we find the culprit,
I get a billion won, right?

264
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,389
Looking back,

265
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,601
I went through endless days of pain.

266
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,187
Honey, how is it? Is it good?

267
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,773
Honey, it's so good.

268
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,237
Aren't you Park In-seong?

269
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,864
No, I'm not.

270
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,950
I did the best I could,

271
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,244
Yes?

272
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,623
No way.

273
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,416
In-seong?

274
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,465
Please leave a review.

275
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:02,427
-Everyone else seemed to be doing great.
-That's it.

276
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,137
Look at the camera.

277
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,139
Now, look into each other's eyes.

278
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,224
Exchange glances.

279
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,183
Good.

280
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,813
Hey, reflector! Aim it toward her face.

281
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,899
Don't worry. The pictures look amazing.

282
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,069
It felt like I was the only one
going around in circles.

283
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,030
But now, I don't have to be ashamed.

284
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,620
I'll buy an apartment in Seoul
with the billion won, and then--

285
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,538
You can't.

286
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,834
You can't buy a new apartment in Seoul
with a billion won these days.

287
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,214
But if you want the money,
mark what I say.

288
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,342
I wasn't able to find the number,

289
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,053
but we can still backtrack
and call the number.

290
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,016
What's the point if they don't pick up?

291
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,602
If we call the number
when everyone is gathered,

292
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,271
the culprit's phone will ring.

293
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,733
You know there's a director's meeting
at the headquarters today, right?

294
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,610
The enemies within
and the potential ones outside

295
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,862
will all be there.

296
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,697
We can't miss this chance.

297
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,791
Gosh. He doesn't
even trust the executives.

298
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,293
Aren't you taking it too far?

299
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,922
It's not like we're elementary students.

300
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,090
Jeez.

301
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,554
You think you're all that?

302
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,436
I collected all of them.

303
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,563
All right.

304
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,153
Phones these days

305
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,323
can turn into recording
or wiretapping devices.

306
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,659
Since you're executives
of Bumyoung Electronics,

307
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,704
I trust that you'll cooperate
with our safety measures.

308
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,666
In order to meet the criteria of CAF21,

309
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,002
a better memory manufacturing environment
has been created.

310
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,296
We are the first in the industry
to use UV light

311
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,298
in order to optimize energy efficiency.

312
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,593
Processes like CIS and EDI,
as well as integrated design…

313
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,261
I did everything as you asked.

314
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,682
Will the culprit's phone
really be in there?

315
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,726
We can check now.

316
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,076
If one of those phones starts ringing…

317
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,787
Its owner is the culprit?

318
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,667
We can ask the owner of the phone.

319
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,794
UNKNOWN

320
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,006
A phone's ringing.

321
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,175
The post-it. Check their name.

322
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:57,310
UNKNOWN

323
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,074
Vice Chairman Oh is here.

324
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,962
Are you the interim CEO?

325
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,755
It's nice to meet you.

326
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,799
I'm Park In-seong,
the CEO of Silver Lining.

327
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,051
I'm Oh Young-geun.

328
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,679
Yes.

329
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,227
You have a good grip.

330
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,688
Is that so?

331
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:46,276
I guess my efforts of trying not to
become an old has-been paid off.

332
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,112
If the meeting's over,
let's have some tea.

333
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,037
Wait. You can't.

334
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,123
You can't just take your phones.

335
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,933
-They're gone?
-Yes.

336
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,518
They took back their phones

337
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,230
while Mr. Oh came by.

338
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,149
There was no post-it to begin with?

339
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,026
Is it a coincidence?

340
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,403
Mr. Oh happened to enter at that moment?

341
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:36,034
So Mr. Oh purposely came
to someone's rescue?

342
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,203
That's how it worked out in the end.

343
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,624
If that's true, he is a scary person.

344
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,753
Will I be able to stand tall
in front of him?

345
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,755
I can't even receive your help

346
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,548
without my earbuds.

347
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,467
I now know why

348
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,262
you failed Silver Lining's interview.

349
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,347
Sorry?

350
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,558
Who would trust you
when you can't even trust yourself?

351
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,561
Mr. Oh is asking for you.

352
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,232
All right.

353
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,039
JUNG SE-YEON

354
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,181
This way, please.

355
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,766
Okay.

356
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,158
I can do it.

357
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,166
I was curious to see who Kim Seon-ju chose

358
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,126
as his replacement.

359
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,046
I also wanted to meet you.

360
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:13,715
So,

361
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,676
what is your father's name?

362
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:21,556
I basically know everyone in this field.

363
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:26,061
His name is Park Jae-chun,
and he owns an orchard.

364
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,479
An orchard?

365
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,820
Where did you work
before you joined Silver Lining?

366
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,240
I looked for employment
while working part-time.

367
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,118
I see.

368
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,121
I hear such people are called
job seekers these days.

369
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,627
Young people these days
have no dreams or ambitions.

370
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,421
They just want to do what's easy.

371
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,051
Back in my day, it wasn't like that.

372
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,429
Didn't the people your age
create the world we live in today?

373
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:06,351
You taught us early on
that the world is an unfair place.

374
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,773
Do you know what's really unfair?

375
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,860
A nobody without experience
of even running a small store

376
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:20,907
daring to take on the role of
the president of Bumyoung Group.

377
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,369
My son and his friends

378
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,704
grew up taking business classes

379
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,207
just so they could take such a position.

380
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,793
They led a lonely life, studying abroad.

381
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,379
Even now, they worry about the impact

382
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,465
their decisions will have
on the lives of their employees.

383
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,301
Just because

384
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,138
a father was an Olympic gold medalist,

385
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,348
his son wouldn't get a free pass
to compete in the Olympics.

386
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,891
What?

387
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,394
If being the son
of a successful businessman

388
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,354
grants him control of a company,

389
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,732
that would be really unfair.

390
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,570
I have neither received early education
nor enjoyed any other privileges.

391
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,197
I use a vacuum myself
without the help of a housekeeper.

392
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,616
I travel by bus
without the assistance of a driver.

393
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,035
The lives of ordinary citizens
such as myself,

394
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,495
what inconveniences them,

395
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,205
and what technologies would benefit them.

396
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,833
These are the things I know
better than anyone.

397
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,421
I'll show you

398
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,090
technology with good character.

399
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,430
You guys are similar.

400
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,310
Perhaps it's because
you were chosen by Mr. Kim.

401
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,687
You're full of confidence.

402
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,939
But…

403
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:40,862
Mr. Kim at least put his money
where his mouth is.

404
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,659
Is he always so supercilious?

405
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,453
Who? You?

406
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,955
You heard everything
through the phone, didn't you?

407
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,749
Why does he care what my dad does?

408
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,251
Mr. Oh is a business partner
of Silver Lining.

409
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,588
That means you'll have to keep seeing him.

410
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,217
I'm sorry. I should've held back.

411
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,637
He does make it hard to hold back.

412
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,307
Right? It's not three strikes yet,
so our contract is still valid.

413
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,645
Once you get back to the office,
check Ms. Jung and Mr. Kwak's phones.

414
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,814
Se-yeon too?
I thought we were trusting her.

415
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,192
They were the two people
who were the closest to the phones.

416
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,778
How long were you here?

417
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,446
Is your meeting over?

418
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,614
Sorry?

419
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,327
Yes.

420
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,091
Do you think
Se-yeon heard our conversation?

421
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,013
Should I try to find out?

422
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,683
Don't do anything unnecessary.

423
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,697
Oh, it's my phone.

424
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,545
Did he just decline my call?

425
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,047
No news is good news.

426
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,716
He's probably busy.

427
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,760
He'll call when he can.

428
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,680
Well, he didn't.
That's why I called him first.

429
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,850
He's the only son I have,

430
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,436
but he's no better than this little guy.

431
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,812
Baro.

432
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,772
Yes, did you call me?

433
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,611
Can you play "I Hate You"
by Mr. Cho Yong-pil?

434
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,573
Okay. I will play "I Hate You."

435
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,909
You have two phones?

436
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,496
One is a work phone.

437
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,373
One is a personal phone.

438
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,875
But…

439
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,420
if the phone in your inside pocket
is "your phone,"

440
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,048
whose phone are you holding?

441
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,427
This is my phone as well.

442
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,597
You always have wireless earbuds on.

443
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,683
In situations where that's not possible,

444
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,685
you hold onto your phone.

445
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,773
As if you need to
brief someone at all times.

446
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,359
That's…

447
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,569
What are you doing?

448
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,287
Se-yeon, what are you doing?

449
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,800
There's no road!

450
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,734
What are you doing?

451
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,697
Level with me.

452
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,614
What?

453
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,369
-Hey.
-You…

454
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,830
You kidnapped Kim Seon-ju, right?

455
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:19,747
Or…

456
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,791
did you murder him?

457
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,710
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

458
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,711
A misunderstanding?

459
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,213
What did you do to Mr. Kim?

460
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,426
Why do you have this?

461
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,981
When did you…

462
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,109
You've been using that phone
to report to someone, right?

463
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,235
Who is behind you?

464
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,739
DRAW YOUR UNLOCK PATTERN

465
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,327
Mr. Park, I think I've found
the owner of the unknown number.

466
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,747
I'll call them right now.

467
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,748
UNKNOWN

468
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,167
MR. KIM

469
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,128
Mr. Kim.

470
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,424
It was definitely Mr. Kim.

471
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,508
Darn it.

472
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,095
My guess was right.

473
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,223
Repeat everything that I say.

474
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,017
The phone

475
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,685
-in the meeting room was yours?
-The phone

476
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,854
in the meeting room was yours?

477
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,399
What?

478
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,860
Ms. Jung? It was Se-yeon's?

479
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,279
Why did you use a hidden number
to make a call

480
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,823
and what information were you after
to send such texts?

481
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,702
Repeat everything I said, quickly!

482
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,834
It's not Se-yeon.

483
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,379
She risked her life
because she was worried about you.

484
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,257
She couldn't have harmed you.

485
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,051
What are you saying right now?

486
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,928
Who are you talking--

487
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,355
Just as you said, he was quite immature.

488
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,524
I found out that he's only 29 years old.

489
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,277
That's right. He is still just a child.

490
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,405
He's not at the level
for you to be concerned.

491
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,910
Kim Seon-ju is not
a shrewd judge of character.

492
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,079
If things become shaky for Silver Lining,

493
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,290
Bumyoung Motor Group
and Ms. Oh won't be safe either.

494
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,334
-In that case--
-What about you?

495
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,421
-Pardon?
-I'm talking about Silver Lining.

496
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,342
Have you been working for me
for about 20 years or so?

497
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:40,555
Yes. It's been 22 years and 3 months,
including my time at Bumyoung Electronics.

498
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:45,226
It's about time for you
to advance to a higher position.

499
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,190
I want you to make

500
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,569
a luncheon appointment
with Mr. Park this Saturday.

501
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,195
Sorry?

502
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,990
He's now a part of the Bumyoung family.

503
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,701
I should give him a warm welcome.

504
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,505
That's absurd.

505
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,718
Mr. Kim got attacked,

506
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,803
and he's trapped inside a phone?

507
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,767
Se-yeon is finding it hard to believe.

508
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:32,273
Maybe if you send a hundred million won
to my account like last time--

509
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,983
What Mr. Park said is true.

510
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,781
This voice…

511
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,618
Yes, it's me, Kim Seon-ju.

512
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,205
Where are you right now?

513
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,082
Somewhere in between
the CPU and GPU chips.

514
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,713
Mr. Kim told me

515
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,675
anyone's voice can be replicated using AI.

516
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,010
What about promises?

517
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,681
Do you remember
when you made your first request?

518
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,100
I made you a promise.

519
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,855
How do you…

520
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,398
I want to

521
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,150
keep that promise.

522
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,617
When did you take this?

523
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,287
If you told me in advance,
I would've given you a better angle.

524
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,082
Why don't you try calling her?

525
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,292
She's probably waiting.

526
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,879
What am I supposed to say

527
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,423
about my current situation?

528
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,266
I can't even tell her when I'll be back.

529
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,393
False hopes

530
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,145
result in bigger scars.

531
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,482
This is difficult.

532
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,777
I bet

533
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,405
Se-yeon is probably confused too.

534
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,829
By the way,

535
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,456
what did you promise Se-yeon?

536
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,661
Ms. Jung.

537
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,122
Let's go.

538
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,166
Right. I'm sorry.

539
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,424
Mr. Kim.

540
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,841
Who are you?

541
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,388
Where did the living corpse go?

542
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,058
Who are you talking about?

543
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,020
Damn it.

544
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,402
Will she come?

545
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:06,821
She will, right?

546
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,824
Come on. Be patient, will you?

547
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,745
She's here!

548
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,628
Se-yeon!

549
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,880
Welcome.

550
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,925
You have a weekly report meeting

551
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,802
with the development team
at 9:10 a.m. today.

552
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,054
Is that so? Then hop in,

553
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,098
Frog Prince.

554
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,355
I almost forgot.

555
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:42,898
Here you go.

556
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,402
-What is this?
-Wireless earbuds.

557
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,196
We're one team now.

558
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,328
That's the wrong side.

559
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,205
Right.

560
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,476
What are you doing?

561
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,769
Sorry?

562
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,023
You should sit in the back.

563
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,651
You're still the CEO at work.

564
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,695
All right, Se-yeon.

565
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,031
I mean, Ms. Jung.

566
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,797
Should we turn on the radio?

567
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,468
Which station do you prefer?

568
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,846
It's not that. It's just so quiet.

569
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,224
Was it like this with Mr. Kim?

570
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,683
It's important to stay focused

571
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,560
-while driving.
-Yes. It's important to stay focused

572
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,728
-while--
-What?

573
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,481
Have you two
worked together for a long time?

574
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,650
Yes.

575
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,826
When someone asks that,

576
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,789
don't people usually respond
with more details?

577
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,793
What about you?

578
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,253
Sorry?

579
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,968
Are you asking about me and Mr. Kim?

580
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,427
Well…

581
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,806
I'll give you a simple explanation.

582
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:44,562
In shows, you know how there's a commoner
who gets involved with a conglomerate?

583
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,314
I'm that commoner.

584
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,608
So you're strangers.

585
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,695
How did he even trust you?

586
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,657
I couldn't trust you either, Ms. Jung.

587
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,159
I don't have any memories
from before and after the accident.

588
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,038
Since you were with me
around the time of the accident,

589
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,290
you were a prime suspect.

590
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,709
No, I wasn't with you.

591
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,422
Let's hurry. Min-a's waiting.

592
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,891
I got a text from the hospital

593
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,352
that my mother was in critical condition.

594
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,022
Would it be okay if I returned to Seoul?

595
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,695
You're here.

596
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,826
Fortunately, when I arrived, she was fine.

597
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,389
Her texts, call history, and GPS data

598
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,725
match everything she said.

599
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,855
The opposite of doubt is not blind trust.
It's finding out the truth.

600
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,607
That is why--

601
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,442
All you have to do is apologize.

602
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,695
Sorry for doubting you.

603
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:20,908
No.

604
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,410
Don't.

605
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,081
I doubted you too.

606
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,958
That's why I contacted you
with a hidden number.

607
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,752
You don't have to explain.

608
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,462
I totally understand.

609
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:38,008
So far, my last confirmed location
is the golf course.

610
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,679
Did anything peculiar happen?
It doesn't matter however small.

611
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,806
Was anything out of the ordinary?

612
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,892
Not really.

613
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,354
What do you think, Mr. Kim?

614
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,523
Such laws would dictate
that discussion be held

615
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,025
in a conference room,
and not on a golf course.

616
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,528
All right, then.

617
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,699
Isn't it a bummer
that you have to follow them around

618
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,495
as they enjoy their leisure time
on such a nice day?

619
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,373
It's fine. This is my job.

620
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,874
What are you doing after this?

621
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,710
It's Friday, after all.

622
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,463
I thought he was just being courteous.

623
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,966
He didn't seem to have an ulterior motive.

624
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:23,804
However, if someone was really
planning on killing me that night…

625
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,849
They would've tried to
separate you from Ms. Jung.

626
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,603
Mr. Kwak may not have much hair,
but he is very ambitious.

627
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,487
He is also skilled
at hiding his ambitions.

628
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,745
We have to find out
where Mr. Kwak went after golfing

629
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,831
and what he did with whom,

630
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,666
without missing any details.

631
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,393
Give me the money first.

632
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,486
Is this your phone?

633
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,578
CALLER: UNKNOWN

634
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,996
CALLER'S PHONE NUMBER

635
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,122
It's 7036.

636
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:38,629
KIM SEON-JU

637
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,922
Kim Seon-ju.

638
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,653
Whether it be Mr. Kwak's phone,
computer, or dashcam,

639
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,863
do whatever it takes to find any clues.

640
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,157
-Mr. Kwak. Come over here.
-Yes?

641
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,201
This will help you get thicker hair.

642
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,911
Did you say "thicker hair"?

643
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:11,995
Look at this.

644
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,958
-Proper sleep is important.
-I have to sleep well?

645
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,043
It says to massage your scalp.

646
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,795
I don't get enough… Massage?

647
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:23,549
If I sleep well and massage my scalp, my…

648
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,717
Mr. Kwak, you got a call.

649
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,970
Goodness. Thank you, Ms. Jung.

650
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,055
Thank you.

651
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,266
It's a scam call.

652
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,982
-Are you new here?
-Sorry?

653
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,191
I've never seen you before.

654
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,111
Right. Starting today, I am--

655
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,153
Mr. Park.

656
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,201
I have mysophobia.

657
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,453
I'm leading by example.

658
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,039
-Go on.
-I'll do it.

659
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,749
No, this is mine.

660
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,386
Se-yeon.

661
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,562
Gosh. Se-yeon, you should…

662
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,238
As expected, Mr. Kwak is meticulous.

663
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,367
He's the type to look before he leaps.

664
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,412
His dashcam…

665
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,165
If we had just acquired
his dashcam footage,

666
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,334
we would know where he went that day.

667
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,004
His dashcam footage
can get overwritten any day now.

668
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,422
We don't have much time.

669
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,098
Isn't Mr. Kwak
attending the luncheon today?

670
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,559
Yes. So?

671
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,244
Goodness. What?

672
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:24,836
Darn it.

673
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,511
Excuse me!

674
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:34,846
Get out.

675
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,683
You should watch where you're…

676
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,561
Gosh.

677
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,815
Mr. Park.

678
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,858
What should we do about this?

679
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,572
I'm perfectly fine.

680
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,993
Ms. Jung, you should've been more careful.

681
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,496
Mr. Park must have been startled.

682
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,206
I'm sorry.

683
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,042
We should call insurance.

684
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,253
No, it's okay.

685
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,839
It's not like we're strangers.
This is no big deal.

686
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,260
-It's completely fine.
-Come on.

687
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,386
That's not true.

688
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,305
The closer we are,
the more thorough we need to be.

689
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,434
We don't have to
since we're acquainted with each other.

690
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,853
Why would you put me
in such an awkward position?

691
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,689
-It'll be awkward for me too.
-If you do that…

692
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,278
I am unscathed, and so is the car.

693
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:32,779
Yes. Don't worry.

694
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,781
Move out of the way.

695
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,533
I said move.

696
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,701
Darn it.

697
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,835
One, two, three.

698
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,757
Watch out!

699
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,432
Hey, what is…

700
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,142
What was that?

701
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,227
Goodness.

702
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,813
What's wrong with your driving?

703
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,899
I'm sorry. I was trying to move forward.

704
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:09,941
I'm sorry, sir.

705
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,318
My gosh.

706
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,072
Hello? Bumyoung Insurance?

707
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,492
I got into an accident.

708
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,076
Yes, the location is…

709
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,791
Gosh.

710
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,298
Goodness.

711
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,008
This is not good.

712
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,052
We'll arrive later
than Mr. Oh at this rate.

713
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,762
Pardon?

714
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,639
Let's ride a taxi there.

715
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,766
What do we do about the cars?

716
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,269
Ms. Jung, you take care of everything.

717
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,479
Yes, sir.

718
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,111
Let's go.

719
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,782
I'm sorry.

720
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,041
Come on.

721
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:12,546
This way, sir.

722
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,889
This way, please.

723
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:23,890
WE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTING
CUSTOMERS TODAY

724
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,109
-I don't think this is the right place.
-Hold on.

725
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,699
It is, sir.

726
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,119
Excuse me.

727
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:45,745
Coming through.

728
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,207
-Excuse me.
-Who is he?

729
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,417
Excuse me.

730
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,127
Mr. Oh.

731
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,505
Goodness. Welcome, Mr. Park.

732
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:04,931
So many people were curious
about the new CEO of Silver Lining,

733
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,808
so I hastily arranged an event.

734
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,059
I hope you don't mind.

735
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,062
Not at all.

736
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,189
-Mr. Oh.
-Yes?

737
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,566
The live stream is ready.

738
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,109
Okay. Good work.

739
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,529
I hear Silver Lining's social media

740
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,532
is more influential
than Nine O'Clock News these days.

741
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,536
So how could an old man like me
possibly avoid stepping down?

742
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,626
What are you waiting for? Take your seat.

743
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,877
Everyone's waiting.

744
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,213
Goodness. The whole nation is waiting.

745
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,596
Mr. Oh is behind all of this.

746
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,014
I let my guard down…

747
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,604
when we're up against

748
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,565
Oh Young-geun.

749
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,530
Reporter Ko Yeong-jae of Naeil Business.

750
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,409
Reporter Oh Yu-jin of Daehan Daily.

751
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,245
They're all on Bumyoung's side.

752
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,540
They're going to ask trick questions.

753
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,627
Your moments of struggle
will be streamed live.

754
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,338
I know that much.

755
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,424
But don't worry.

756
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,929
I will not let the CEO of Silver Lining
be put to shame.

757
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,609
USB STORAGE

758
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,434
Even though Silver Lining
is an innovative company,

759
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,977
it is still quite shocking.

760
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,813
A mere college graduate becoming a CEO

761
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,149
when he's not even 30 yet?

762
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,278
Mr. Park, just repeat after me.

763
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,032
I am Kim Seon-ju.

764
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,783
I am Kim Seon-ju.

765
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,712
It's the beautiful tradition of Bumyoung.

766
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,549
It's the beautiful tradition of Bumyoung.

767
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:50,555
"Beautiful tradition"?
What do you mean by that?

768
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,849
-The founder of Bumyoung,
-The founder of Bumyoung,

769
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,351
-Chairman Oh Bum-geun

770
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,853
-and Vice Chairman Oh Young-geun
-and Vice Chairman Oh Young-geun

771
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:00,523
-secretly sold their cows
-secretly sold their cows

772
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,942
-and blindly came to Seoul…
-and came to Seoul…

773
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,235
to found Bumyoung Foods.

774
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,029
-It is a well-known success story.
-…to found Bumyoung Foods.

775
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,448
It is a well-known success story.

776
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,951
But is there anyone in the nation

777
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,912
who looks down on them

778
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,747
-because they didn't graduate
-Is there anyone who looks down on them

779
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,415
-high school?
-because they didn't graduate high school?

780
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,377
-I don't think I've seen one.
-I don't think I've seen one.

781
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,338
Thanks to Mr. Oh, I learned that

782
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,340
-as long as you are competent
-Thanks to Mr. Oh, I learned that

783
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,509
-it is possible to lead a company,
-as long as you are competent,

784
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,761
-regardless of your education or age.
-it is possible to lead a company,

785
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,930
regardless of your education or age.

786
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,139
Therefore,

787
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,974
-I am grateful for this opportunity.
-Therefore,

788
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,435
I am grateful for this opportunity.

789
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,270
-Isn't that right,
-Isn't that right,

790
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,022
-Mr. Oh?
-Mr. Oh?

791
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,737
HE'S 29 AND HE'S THE CEO

792
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,072
HE'S SO ELOQUENT

793
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,325
June 10th.

794
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,841
What? Why did he stop?

795
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,470
Is he waiting for someone?

796
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,938
There have been numerous reports

797
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,774
of crashes related to self-driving cars
all around the world.

798
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:29,028
As the CEO of Silver Lining,
that is developing a self-driving car,

799
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,905
can you share your thoughts?

800
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,699
She's beating a dead horse.

801
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:37,162
-You're beating--
-Don't repeat that.

802
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,713
-Self-driving cars?
-Self-driving cars?

803
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,716
-Yes, they can get into accidents.
-Yes, they can get into accidents.

804
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,594
-But the same applies
-But the same applies

805
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,845
-for human-driven cars.
-for human-driven cars.

806
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,222
-Are you aware that the accident rate
-Are you aware that the accident rate…

807
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,807
of human-driven cars is far greater

808
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,893
-than that of self-driving cars?
-of human-driven cars

809
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,687
is far greater
than that of self-driving cars?

810
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:03,730
At the very least,

811
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,899
-self-driving cars don't drink
-At the very least, self-driving cars

812
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,609
-or fall asleep while driving.
-don't drink

813
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,444
or fall asleep while driving.

814
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,330
The accident rate may be low
because we're in the early days,

815
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,207
-but once more cars are supplied--
-Right.

816
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,124
-Right.
-So you're acknowledging

817
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,919
-So you're acknowledging
-that self-driving cars are the future.

818
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,337
that self-driving cars are the future.

819
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,800
-Then…
-Then…

820
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:36,179
-why don't we turn back the clock
-why don't we turn back the clock

821
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,639
to the days when we traveled by wagon?

822
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,350
to the days when we traveled by wagon?

823
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,394
-The first car was invented.
-The first car was invented.

824
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,188

827
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,738

828
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,156

829
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,701
-"A car? That's too dangerous!"
-"A car? That's too dangerous!"

830
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,286
"Let's just travel by wagon!"

831
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,540
He talks just like Kim Seon-ju.

832
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,625
I know, right? They're so similar.

833
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,259
-What if we continued to travel by wagon?
-What if we continued to travel by wagon?

834
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,762
-What would our society have become?

835

-If we can't go against the trend,

836
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,521
-rather than worrying,

837
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,398

00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,275

840
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,989
Mr. Park.

841
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,074
Mr. Park…

842
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,466
Mr. Kim?

843
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,195
How could the CEO of Silver Lining…

844
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:21,284
use a product of your rival company?

845
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:24,621
The whole nation is watching.

846
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,091
Okay. Keep the questions coming.

847
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,146
I will repay you.

848
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,857
-Are you threatening me right now?
-Mr. Oh.

849
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,192
I'll turn up again.

850
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,985
And I won't leave in peace like this.

851
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,738
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to judge me?

852
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,033
I thought I heard Dad's voice.

853
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,535
Well…

854
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,453
Mr. Kim?

855
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,621
It wouldn't harm him, would it?

856
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,248
Don't trust Kim Seon-ju too much.

857
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:51,999
We have no other choice.

858
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,835
Let's catch the one
who made Mr. Kim like this.

859
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:54,794
I'll go and check.

860
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,462
I've never seen that car before.

861
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,965
Is your most reliable man tailing him?

862
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:04,053
