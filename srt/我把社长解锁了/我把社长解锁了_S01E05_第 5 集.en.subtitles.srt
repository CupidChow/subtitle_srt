00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,160
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:41,249
I'm sorry, but we have classes going on.
Please compose yourselves.

4
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,334
How could we?

5
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,545
We entrusted them
to your care. What is this?

6
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,463
That's enough.

7
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,258
Sir, you need to manage
your students better.

8
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,760
I apologize.

9
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,595
Goodness. Sir!

10
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,513
What will you do about my child's face?

11
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,640
No, there's no reaching a settlement.

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,225
Expel him immediately!

13
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,686
Is he a thug or what?

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,771
Let's go.

15
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,940
You can tell he grew up without parents.

16
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,151
-Mom.
-All right.

17
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,749
You're a hard puncher.

18
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,171
What grade are you in?

19
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,716
I'm in ninth grade.

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,759
I see.

21
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,386
You know the gym in front of the school?

22
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,348
Go there after school
every day from now on.

23
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,685
Goodness.

24
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,097
Excuse me.

25
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,224
BASED ON WEBTOON UNLOCK THE BOSS
(UNLOCK MY BOSS) BY PARK SEONG-HYUN

26
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,102
Thank you for helping us.

27
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,480
Thank me with money, not with your words.

28
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,650
Send me

29
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,821
the costs for my hospital bill
and my damaged car by next week.

30
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,364
How did you know where we were?

31
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,870
Your sort resorts to
either of these two when cornered.

32
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,872
Fleeing or dying.

33
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,834
I couldn't just let that happen.

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,879
Two days.

35
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,257
If I don't receive the money,

36
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,884
I'll turn up again.

37
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,221
The car's fine.

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,810
You put a tracker on our car?

39
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,021
Isn't that illegal?

40
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,647
You piece of trash.

41
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,401
Go slow at least over speed bumps.

42
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,070
The real piece of trash is in the trunk.

43
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,072
Go slow over speed bumps, please!

44
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,157
Will he be okay?

45
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,534
Should we go to the hospital?

46
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,161
You really are an idiot.

47
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,455
Sorry?

48
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,458
My guess is

49
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,044
that you have a lot to ask him.

50
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,004
You're right.

51
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,590
Just pay me.

52
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,718
I'll lead you to a perfect place
for hearing his confession.

53
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,763
There's such a place?

54
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,141
PARK IN-SEONG
AMOUNT SENT: 50 MILLION WON

55
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,441
Shall I get to work?

56
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,241
Who sent you?

57
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,379
I want to know.

58
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,591
Kim…

59
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,469
Seon-ju.

60
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,602
Mr. Kim sent you?

61
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,522
He's lying. It's a--

62
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,442
Why did he tell you to tail me?

63
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,321
You know how he's overly suspicious.

64
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,616
He probably wanted to be prepared
in case things went awry.

65
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,536
That proves that you have no connections

66
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,371
within my company.

67
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,539
Don't…

68
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,125
trust him too much.

69
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,419
That doesn't make sense.

70
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,423
That would mean Kim Seon-ju
tailed himself from the golf course.

71
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,093
I was following Mr. Kwak.

72
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,096
Let me go.

73
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,182
I'll take you to Kim Seon-ju.

74
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,436
It's a trap.
I am in your pocket right now.

75
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,822
This is the police.

76
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,284
We received a noise complaint
of people fighting.

77
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,139
MOST RESPECTED HOSPITAL IN KOREA
FOR TEN CONSECUTIVE YEARS

78
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,102
No, wait.

79
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,773
No!

80
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:00,985
Bum-geun!

81
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,769
Goodness, what is the world coming to?

82
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,188
He threatened you with a knife
because you pointed out his power trip?

83
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,859
It's my fault as his boss.

84
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,488
I wonder how long he'll use
his right to remain silent.

85
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,989
You two may leave for now.

86
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,200
-We'll call you for the witness interview.
-All right.

87
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,410
But…

88
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,079
what about him?

89
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,958
Call me a doctor. I'm bleeding.

90
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,169
What a mess.

91
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,463
Can you believe this situation?

92
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,923
Can you?

93
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,967
This is insane.

94
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,264
Gosh. How did a crazy punk like him

95
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,600
and a nobody like you get involved?

96
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,396
Don't you think so?

97
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,610
Now I've seen everything. Don't you agree?

98
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,867
Breaking news.
Chairman Oh Bum-geun of Bumyoung

99
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,286
has passed away at the age of 75.

100
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,706
It had been a year
and three months since he fainted

101
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,499
from a heart attack.

102
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,420
His funeral home will be prepared
by Bumyoung Hospital in Dogok-dong.

103
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,340
Mr. Oh Bum-geun, who launched
his career with Bumyoung Construction,

104
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,925
was an icon of Korea's modern history.

105
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,137
Prominent figures in politics
and business offered condolences.

106
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,224
Bumyoung Group is preparing
for his funeral under a heavy atmosphere.

107
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,979
Ms. Jung, head to the office
and look for Mr. Nam's personnel record.

108
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,523
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,234
Mr. Park, you have to go to the funeral.

110
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,906
But the problem is,
Mr. Nam could get away.

111
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,287
Are you saying the police will let him go?

112
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,165
I don't know who has Mr. Nam's back,

113
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,169
but they'll probably be able to
apply pressure on the police.

114
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,132
I'll stay here
while he goes to the funeral.

115
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,551
No. There's no point in you staking out.

116
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,011
They already know your face.

117
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,513
The same goes for Mr. Park.

118
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,516
As such, neither of you will do.

119
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,608
I know someone.

120
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,610
Someone who will do.

121
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,322
Hey, you.

122
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,242
What…

123
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,118
What's with your face? What happened?

124
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,912
Why did you send me that photo?

125
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,455
Hyeon-ho, I have to go to a funeral.

126
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,959
But an industrial spy
is being investigated right now.

127
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,336
He could be released any second,

128
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,921
so can you be on the watch?

129
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,050
How am I supposed to do that?

130
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,844
You are a stockholder of my company.

131
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,264
A stockholder?

132
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,392
What you're about to do
is going to save your stocks.

133
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,811
Have a sense of ownership.

134
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,941
All right. I'll do my best.
You can go to the funeral.

135
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,402
-All right. Hyeon-ho.
-Sure. Yes?

136
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,406
He's a menace,
so be on guard at all times.

137
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,243
Yes, don't worry.
I was in the military, you punk.

138
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,870
That won't help. He's really dangerous.

139
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,832
-Can I borrow your bike?
-Sure.

140
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,501
Hold on.

141
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,212
Hey, there's something I'd like to know.

142
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,464
Should I buy or sell Bumyoung stocks?

143
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,882
I'm really curious…

144
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,261
Are you serious? Someone just died.

145
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,263
Seriously.

146
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,892
By the way,

147
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,604
how much condolence money should I give?

148
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,356
It's 30, 50, or 100 thousand won.
Don't you know?

149
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,984
I know that,

150
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,068
but I'm…

151
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,530
supposed to be a rich guy.
Shouldn't it be different?

152
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,576
Well, I'm not sure about that.

153
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,162
Here in the funeral hall
of Bumyoung Hospital,

154
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:25,207
the late Oh Bum-geun's funeral home
was set up about 30 minutes ago.

155
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,668
A simple funeral will be held

156
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,254
in accordance with the wishes
of the deceased and the bereaved.

157
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,513
Following the passing of Oh Bum-geun,
the chairman of the number one business,

158
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,059
many people are curious
to see who will become the next chair.

159
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,977
WE ARE SAD TO HEAR THE MOURNFUL NEWS
OF THE LATE CHAIRMAN OH BUM-GEUN

160
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,395
REST IN PEACE
FROM EXECUTIVES AND STAFF OF BUMYOUNG

since Oh Bum-geun's collapse last year,

165
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,128
and Oh Young-geun,
who helped build up Bumyoung,

166
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,798
is expected to happen in full swing.

167
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,300
Chairman Yang Jun-cheol
came to offer his condolences.

168
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,468
Also…

169
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,970
I was keeping an eye out
for a Silver Lining employee,

170
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,806
and things aren't looking good.

171
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,434
Hey, I'm the victim.
Why are you keeping me here?

172
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,560
Call the chief.

173
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,854
Tell the chief to come here. Right now!

174
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,440
Where's the chief? Tell me.

175
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,776
I guess I haven't seen everything.

176
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,087
Thank you for coming.

177
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,006
Inside,

178
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,427
there are a lot of people

179
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,972
who see what they want to see
and talk however they like.

180
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,517
I see. Yes.

181
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,855
Did Mr. Kim tell you…

182
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,443
about Baro Version 4.0?

183
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,946
Right.

184
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,783
It's undergoing beta testing.

185
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,328
That's not what the CEO
of Silver Lining should say.

186
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,629
Are you keeping it a secret from me too?

187
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,465
Or…

188
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,219
Did Mr. Kim not tell you anything?

189
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,304
I'll check and--

190
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,305
Check?

191
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,933
I thought that putting on the same uniform

192
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,811
would have you looking
in the same direction.

193
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,314
I was being naive.

194
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,779
Move.

195
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,200
What are you two plotting?

196
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,247
It hasn't been long
since my brother passed.

197
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,083
It's a misunderstanding. The thing is--

198
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,504
You're sorry that Mr. Kim
couldn't be here himself?

199
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,256
Yes.

200
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,593
He asked me to pass the word.

201
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,930
It is still the passing
of the group's leader.

202
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,434
This is why lowly punks…

203
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,201
Tell me.

204
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,040
What in the world is Baro Version 4.0

205
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,376
for Ms. Oh to call me separately about it?

206
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,046
It's best for you not to know.

207
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,980
These past few days,

208
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,192
the media has been noisy.

209
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,155
If Bum-geun had not died
before choosing his successor--

210
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,825
Are you upset about his death

211
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,120
or the fact that a successor wasn't named?

212
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,414
It's a shame.

213
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,959
If only Seung-won were alive,

214
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,336
we wouldn't have had to worry about this.

215
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,088
I've buried him inside my heart.

216
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:44,842
Why…

217
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,094
Why would you bring him up again?

218
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:53,183
Do you feel uncomfortable
because I brought up your dead brother,

219
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:58,564
or are you nervous because there's a truth
that you want to hide?

220
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,400
"A truth"?

221
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,655
First your younger brother
and now Bum-geun.

222
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,284
The people who should be leading Bumyoung

223
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,453
have passed away one after another.

224
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,497
In that case,

225
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,167
am I the next one in line,

226
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,085
Uncle?

227
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,130
I mulled over your piece of advice.

228
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,841
What I'm capable of doing…

229
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,845
A shareholder meeting will be held

230
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,432
at the end of the year
to pick the next chairman.

231
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,854
So you want to get things settled
before the self-driving car is released.

232
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,983
Will that even be possible?

233
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,319
I am the largest shareholder,

234
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,863
after all.

235
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,327
That only held true
when Bum-geun was still alive.

236
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,498
I already talked everything through
with the board of directors.

237
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,888
Yes, In-seong.

238
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,474
Did you eat?

239
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,685
We're about to.

240
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,520
What about you?

241
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,397
I already ate.

242
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,609
What is it? Is something wrong?

243
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,568
No.

244
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,696
I was just wondering

245
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,489
how you were doing.

246
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,159
You were here a few days ago.

247
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,706
What's the matter? Tell me.

248
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,382
It's nothing.

249
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,635
Come on.

250
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,304
Wouldn't I be able to tell
when I raised you for 30 years?

251
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,561
What is it? Are things tough at work?

252
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,729
You know…

253
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,649
there are just times…

254
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,778
when you walk down a road,

255
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,280
and suddenly

256
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,533
you wonder, "Is this the right way?"

257
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,830
Life is a series of crossroads.

258
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,126
No matter where you go, you'll always
be curious about a path you left behind.

259
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,464
That's why you'll have regrets,
whether you take that path or not.

260
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,717
But In-seong,

261
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,636
if you're going to regret it either way,

262
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,098
wouldn't it be better
to take the path that you want?

263
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,393
Okay. I'll hang up now.

264
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,341
Why would you pour the sauce?

265
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,928
What's the problem?

266
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,347
Isn't that what you just said?

267
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,559
"If you're going to regret it either way,
just do what you want."

268
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,312
Goodness. We lived together for 30 years.

269
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,356
Can't you get it right?

270
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,942
Don't you agree, Baro?

271
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,739
Why is it crying?

272
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,658
My goodness!

273
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,665
It looks so good.

274
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,960
-Have a bite.
-I don't want any!

275
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,475
There you go again.

276
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,518
Mr. Park,

277
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,478
leave if you're not up for it.

278
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,522
There are many others who need the money.

279
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,943
Mr. Kim.

280
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,032
You said the more I know,

281
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,618
the harder it is to trust me, right?

282
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,704
It's the opposite for me.

283
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,207
The more secrets you have,

284
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,918
the harder it is for me to trust you.

285
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,296
But the thing is, I want to trust you.

286
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,516
-Hello?
-He just got released.

287
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,393
Okay.

288
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,105
Mr. Nam just got released.

289
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,834
I'm about to get on the subway.

290
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,169
Okay.

291
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,755
All right.

292
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,257
It's okay. I'm a stockholder.

293
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,844
Of course. I have to
protect them at all costs.

294
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,137
Because I'm a stockholder.

295
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,556
Hold on. I need to hurry.

296
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,477
Please take caution
as the subway is currently in motion.

297
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,243
The doors are opening.

298
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,330
Please board after all the passengers
have left the vehicle.

299
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,336
Coming through.

300
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,463
Yes, I arrived.

301
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,465
Yes.

302
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,344
What?

303
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,391
I'll chase him in my car. Which station?

304
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,517
Hold on.

305
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,062
What is it? We need to--

306
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,106
Hyeon-ho got on the subway?

307
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,778
That's not good.

308
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,866
What do you mean?

309
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,374
Nam Sang-won's phone.

310
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,918
-I can detect it inside the station.
-What?

311
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,726
Damn it!

312
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,499
Darn it.

313
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,761
Hey, Nam Sang-won!

314
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,515
I'm at the entrance.

315
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,268
Yes. I'll just wait here.

316
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,402
-Hey.
-Get off me.

317
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,608
Did you catch him?

318
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,318
He got away.

319
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,987
Isn't that a big problem?

320
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,823
Hyeon-ho, I'll explain later. Sorry.

321
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,958
What should we do now?

322
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,043
It was your choice.

323
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,673
You know I had no other choice.

324
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,426
You knew we couldn't afford to meddle!

325
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,472
You are a pain in the neck.

326
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,350
That's right. This is who I am.

327
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,228
Thanks to my meddling,
you were able to receive my help.

328
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,106
Even if I were to pick up your phone again

329
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,109
and face the same situation as earlier,
I would act the same way.

330
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,986
So you should decide

331
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,780
if you want to
keep working with me or not.

332
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,619
Baro Version 4.0

333
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,954
is the key to the self-driving car.

334
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,082
I have never

335
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,793
regretted any of my decisions.

336
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,463
I hope you don't become
the first choice that I regret.

337
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,959
ASTON APARTMENTS

338
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,757
Nam Sang-won. Unit 202.

339
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,259
OUTSTANDING INVOICE

340
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,386
What?

341
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,346
"Kim Yeong-min"?

342
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,028
Did that startle you? Sorry.

343
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,405
Oh, my gosh.

344
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,573
SILVER LINING

345
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,534
You want to hire a bodyguard?

346
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,661
He shouldn't just be a good fighter.

347
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,206
He should know how to tail someone.

348
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,000
and do whatever it takes

349
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,710
for us.

350
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,212
How do you suppose
we find someone like that?

351
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,881
I will post a job opening.

352
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,226
Get out of here.

353
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,731
Hey.

354
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,898
You two bailed on me?

355
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,027
I was locked up because of you guys.

356
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,382
Are you insane?

357
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,052
Do you even know who he is?

358
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,136
Yes, I do.

359
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,600
He can protect us even if we were
to be attacked by a mob of people.

360
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,729
He can also commit illegal acts
like location tracking without hesitation.

361
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,230
He's just a lunatic. A crazy…

362
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,150
He's a dog,
and we don't know who he'll bite.

363
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,402
At least there's one thing for sure.

364
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,448
Seeing how he fought Mr. Nam,

365
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,325
he is not on our opponent's side.

366
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,703
That is our number one priority.

367
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,456
-Mr. Kim.
-But

368
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,376
will he accept our offer?

369
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,920
Don't worry about that.

370
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,509
BODYGUARD SERVICES AGREEMENT

371
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,636
Why should I?

372
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,516
The former president…

373
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,145
went missing and we're looking for him.

374
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,439
It might be a kidnap

375
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,651
or something even worse.

376
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,694
What does that have to do with me?

377
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,030
-You probably saw that night--
-What?

378
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,617
You don't know when you'll get attacked?

379
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,166
No.

380
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,669
You probably saw that night,

381
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,672
but we have a lot of money.

382
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,884
You said you trust money
and not people, right?

383
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,179
Trust money this time as well.

384
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,498
One big one won't do.

385
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,208
Make it four.

386
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,253
Four big ones?

387
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,839
That's too much.

388
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,133
Two, I'll double it.

389
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,134
Four.

390
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,180
-Three.
-Four.

391
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,515
Excuse me, sir.

392
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,436
You already tripled the amount.
That's just insane.

393
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,479
Quadruple it!

394
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,358
All right.

395
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,235
On one condition.

396
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,988
I can't pay you in advance.

397
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,366
I'll pay you weekly.

398
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,835
Four times the amount.

399
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,432
Is anyone home?

400
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,976
No one's responding.
Let's come back tomorrow.

401
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,064
No. I think I can hear the TV.

402
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,625
Where are you going during working hours?

403
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,519
Wait, you shouldn't go up there.

404
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,698
-Nothing is going on.
-Do you know him?

405
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,241
Yes, everything's okay.

406
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,753
What is going on?

407
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,171
-It's nothing.
-Look at him.

408
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,382
ASTON APARTMENTS

409
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,843
What the hell?

410
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,680
Hey, glasses. I got you.

411
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,474
-Open the door!
-Who is that punk?

412
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,434
Hey!

413
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,603
Glasses!

414
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,980
Open the door, you punk!

415
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,649
-What is he doing?
-Hey.

416
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,401
Glasses!

417
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,741
Who are you?

418
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,369
Were you taken aback? I'm sorry.

419
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,079
Did Kim Eun-hee send you?

420
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,082
Our records say
that one of our employees lives here.

421
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,501
That's not true. This is my place.

422
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,253
I've been living here for ten years.

423
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,589
What? This place doesn't belong to you?

424
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,341
No, this is my apartment.

425
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,301
Then who's Kim Eun-hee?

426
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,178
Kim Eun-hee?

427
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,640
She was the class president
when I was in fourth grade.

428
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,516
Could I have your name, please?

429
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,559
My name?

430
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,020
It's Park Hang-jun.

431
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,563
What? Nam…

432
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:24,275
Hey, what are you saying?
Your last name is Jang.

433
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,444
Well, the thing is,

434
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,655
I changed my name in middle school.

435
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,282
-To be honest…
-Sorry.

436
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,707
I heard this is the place
to go for burner phones.

437
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,462
How much are you thinking?

438
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,424
We don't need one.
We're just looking for a number.

439
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,767
Hey.

440
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,435
Get lost.

441
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,813
I said get lost.

442
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,484
Hello, sir.

443
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,988
Sir, you came totally unannounced.

444
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,323
What brings you here?

445
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:16,411
If you gave me a heads-up,
I would've prepared everything in advance.

446
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,126
Should I get you some pickled radish?

447
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,878
-Get me kimchi.
-Kimchi.

448
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,522
I looked through everything,

449
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,316
and I don't think we opened the account.

450
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,235
Are you sure?

451
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,363
Gosh, you know me. Of course I am.

452
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,784
Can you check if there's a 2012 graduate
by the name of Nam Sang-won, please?

453
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,037
We can't disclose personal information.

454
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,180
Excuse me.

455
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,517
She only has three months left.

456
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,439
My wife

457
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,068
wants to see her first love again
before she breathes her last.

458
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,654
What happened at such a young age?

459
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,120
Can you please provide us
with his emergency contacts

460
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,040
or the department representative's number?

461
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,875
I can't without his consent.

462
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,383
-Please.
-No.

463
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,344
You're so obstinate.

464
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,180
KONA UNIVERSITY YEAR 2012

465
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,434
How should I put it?

466
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,394
Please help me out.

467
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,731
I told you, I can't.

468
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,443
I'm really sick.

469
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,196
Can you please help us?

470
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,661
I knew I had a discerning eye.

471
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,499
STUDENT UNION

472
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,294
All right. Thank you.

473
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,259
There was no one by the name
of Nam Sang-won in the class of 2012.

474
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:42,640
His address, phone number,
and academic background are all fake.

475
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,351
How is that possible?

476
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,315
Where could Nam Sang-won be right now?

477
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,511
Yes, I just arrived.

478
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,389
What did his colleagues say?

479
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,476
No one was close to him
or contacted him personally.

480
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,397
He usually worked outside of the office,
and people called him an outsider.

481
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,402
How did a bogus like him
start working at Silver Lining

482
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,904
and become a team leader?

483
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,783
I got rejected in an instant.

484
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,786
Someone who needed Nam Sang-won
probably gave him a high score.

485
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,039
Who could that be?

486
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,375
We need to check.
I'll look through the records.

487
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,381
Mr. Park, you have a guest.

488
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,177
-A guest?
-A guest?

489
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,721
He seemed to be in low spirits.

490
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,556
I know something is up.

491
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,267
-What are you doing? Hurry.
-Okay.

492
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,647
But why did the lady in the front
tell us to go to the CEO's office?

493
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,945
Do you think In-seong…

494
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,948
What about him?

495
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,617
Is he being chewed out by his boss?

496
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,953
Is that why he sounded so down?

497
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,581
-In-seong.
-I'm sure that's what it is.

498
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,166
Wait for me!

499
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,585
-Hurry up.
-Goodness.

500
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,968
What should I do? What now?

501
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,552
What's the matter?

502
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,429
My parents don't know I'm the CEO.

503
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,057
Then you can just tell them
while they're here.

504
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,437
So I should tell them
that I picked up a phone in the mountain,

505
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,606
and a CEO
who was locked up inside that phone

506
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,234
handed over his company to me?

507
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,115
It's because you don't know my parents,

508
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,451
but my father would hospitalize me
saying I'm mad.

509
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,452
And my mother…

510
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,832
She would hold an exorcism.

511
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,292
Then what should we do?

512
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,671
We should hide for now.

513
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,216
Not the stairs.

514
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,806
-What?
-Oh, my.

515
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,224
My goodness. In-seong.

516
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,392
-Mom.
-In-seong.

517
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,061
-In-seong.
-Father.

518
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,151
Is she the supervisor from then?

519
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,696
-Hello.
-Hello.

520
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,822
By the way,

521
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,326
why did the CEO call for you?

522
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,368
Why?

523
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,914
-The thing is…
-Yes.

524
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,792
-Listen carefully.
-Okay.

525
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,961
-Don't freak out, okay?
-Okay.

526
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,880
The thing is…

527
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,966
Hurry up and tell us, you punk!

528
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,761
-Are you hiding something?
-Assistant Park.

529
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,014
Good work.

530
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,361
-Then is she…
-Deliver it without a hitch.

531
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,528
By "supervisor," he meant…

532
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,113
-the CEO?
-Right.

533
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,204
My apologies.

534
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,041
How did a young person like you…

535
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,626
I mean…

536
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,087
You are so young yet competent.

537
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,630
He is kind-hearted.

538
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,259
Does that mean

539
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,554
you work in the office of the CEO?

540
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,889
Where is the office?

541
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,432
APPLE

542
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,185
Goodness, we get to see the CEO's office

543
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,436
thanks to our son.

544
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,397
CEO PARK IN-SEONG

545
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,401
What the…

546
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,277
What are you doing?

547
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,530
Gosh, where are my manners?

548
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,407
Would you like some tea?

549
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,787
Why would the CEO brew us tea?

550
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,123
You should. Have you gone mad?

551
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,834
You're not in your right mind.

552
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,420
Ms. Jung, I'll prepare the tea.

553
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,879
That little punk.

554
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,257
Go ahead, Assistant Park.

555
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,051
He's a bit dense.

556
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,803
But he's kind-hearted.

557
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,098
Goodness. The office
of the CEO is splendid.

558
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,813
I hope we're not wasting your time
when you're busy.

559
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,316
We were just going to
drop some apples off.

560
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,028
Apples may be common in Seoul.

561
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,824
But we didn't spray
any pesticides on our apples

562
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,661
and grew them like we raised In-seong.

563
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,204
President.

564
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,539
-Yes?
-Yes?

565
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,129
Goodness. I didn't know you had company.

566
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,882
Hello, I am Director Kwak Sam-su.

567
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,717
Goodness, a director.

568
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,261
-It's nice to meet you.
-Please.

569
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,932
-Ms. Jung, what are you doing here?
-Mr. Kwak.

570
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,059
-Follow me for a second.
-What is it?

571
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,604
Why is the poster slanted?

572
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,105
Don't mind it.

573
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,317
Were you surprised?

574
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,694
You see, our company is like a family.

575
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,655
Why isn't Ms. Jung keeping her--

576
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,285
Fine. But what's this?

577
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,790
Take this home right now
and share it with your family.

578
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,585
I've been living apart
from them for eight years.

579
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,756
Then pass it on to Mr. Oh.

580
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,509
Right now? We can use express delivery--

581
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,468
What do you mean?

582
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,514
Take it to Mr. Oh yourself, this instant.

583
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:02,102
You came all the way here.
We should have a meal together.

584
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,187
It's okay.

585
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,440
We weren't being mindful
and took so much out of your time.

586
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,650
Go back in and work.

587
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,444
Then I'll drive you to the bus station.

588
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,905
You shouldn't step out
when you're a new hire.

589
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,615
You'll get on her bad side.

590
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,659
-He's right.
-Okay.

591
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,994
Let me grab you a taxi then.

592
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,039
-It's okay. The bus is here.
-The bus is here.

593
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,374
-Honey.
-Bye.

594
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,586
In-seong.

595
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,811
What should we do?

596
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,272
It seems like In-seong
has taken a liking to her.

597
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,567
I hope he doesn't get hurt.

598
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,365
But seeing how she came to our house,

599
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,826
it's not like he has no…

600
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,372
What's wrong?

601
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,500
It's nothing.

602
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,672
Earlier…

603
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,300
Did you see In-seong's desk?

604
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,635
Wait a second.

605
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,346
Where's the restroom?

606
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,765
The location is a bit awkward.

607
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,185
But we should understand.

608
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,937
He always needs to be on standby.

609
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,274
That's not what I meant.

610
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,406
It looked like there was
air conditioning and heating.

611
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,411
For us, whether it rained or snowed…

612
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,917
we couldn't escape the scorching sun.

613
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,798
It looks like our son
will live a decent life.

614
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,010
What a relief.

615
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,231
Honey.

616
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:08,038
I was able to ride out
the situation thanks to you.

617
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,125
Since you're the CEO of Silver Lining,

618
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,001
your parents could see you in the news.

619
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,671
You'll need a fundamental solution.

620
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,882
I'll tell them when the time comes.

621
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,218
All right.

622
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,680
What?

623
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,434
-What's the matter?
-It's just…

624
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,394
Look.

625
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,707
Mr. Park sent this?

626
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,792
Yes, sir.

627
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:58,672
He asked me to deliver it
to you in person as soon as possible.

628
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,636
Why did he send me a box of apples?
I wonder what's inside.

629
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,145
I doubt that he just sent a box of apples

630
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,690
to the Vice Chairman of Bumyoung Group.

631
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,575
What happened to
all of his sanctimonious talk

632
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,660
about "technology with good character"?

633
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,704
This tactic is so old-fashioned.

634
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,791
People still do this?

635
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,547
APPLE

636
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,269
What?

637
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,773
These are…

638
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,902
I only see apples.

639
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,695
Why is the box of apples

640
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,782
filled with apples?

641
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,705
Don't get the wrong idea, sir.

642
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:17,292
All I did was deliver the box.
I didn't touch anything. Do you not--

643
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,643
Park In-seong, you punk.

644
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,689
How dare you mess with me?

645
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:43,527
Did you find anything
on the company's server?

646
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,154
I checked Nam Sang-won's employment record

647
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,073
and the results of his promotional exam,

648
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,285
but nothing seemed odd.

649
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,960
That makes things more clear.

650
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,548
Someone inside was helping him out.

651
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,757
What are you doing?

652
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,599
I was checking if they needed snacks.

653
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:14,766
I see.

654
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,228
I'm going to knock.

655
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,649
Hey, Min-a.

656
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,485
Are you busy?

657
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,821
-No.
-Yes.

658
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,074
-Yes.
-No.

659
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,746
No. Why do you ask?

660
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,956
I want to play hide-and-seek.

661
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,835
Hide-and-seek should be played
in a wide area like a playground.

662
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,338
My house is bigger than the playground.

663
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,424
I'll be "it."

664
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:54,014
You better hide or I'll catch you

665
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,809
You better hide or I'll catch you

666
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:01,438
You better hide or I'll catch you

667
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,025
You better hide or I'll catch you

668
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,951
Here I come.

669
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,873
I'm going to find you.

670
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,206
I found you!

671
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,417
Let's look for In-seong together.

672
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,459
Okay.

673
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:07,629
Hurry. Come on.

674
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,042
MIN-A'S BIRTHDAY

675
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,004
June 30th.

676
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,303
The passcode was her birthday.

677
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,934
How could you not do anything
for your only daughter's birthday?

678
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,896
SKY, WIND, STAR, AND POETRY

679
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,616
Why are we going camping all of a sudden?

680
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,994
It's your birthday.

681
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,832
Your dad asked us to spend time with you

682
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,459
because he's busy with work.

683
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:30,253
He told us to hold
the best birthday party ever.

684
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,588
He did?

685
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,507
Yes. Right, Se-yeon?

686
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,133
Sorry?

687
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,929
Right. That's why I'm joining too.

688
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,685
Why is that man going with us?

689
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,815
He's a bodyguard.

690
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,484
What's that?

691
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:57,030
Someone who protects us from the bad guys.

692
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,782
That's so cool.

693
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:03,203
He looks the most villainous.
Who's going to protect who?

694
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,080
You shouldn't say that.

695
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:08,625
If you judge a book by its cover,
you're a mean person.

696
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,837
He could be a kind-hearted person.

697
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:16,174
In Beauty and the Beast,
the beast was a prince at first.

698
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,685
You're the beast.

699
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,773
Okay. We've arrived.

700
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,984
Grab your stuff.

701
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,445
Min-a, wait. We need to go together!

702
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,489
Look, it's the beach!

703
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,534
Min-a, be careful!

704
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,249
I'll do it.

705
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,046
What?

706
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,923
Be careful.

707
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,638
I'll do it.

708
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:17,110
I'll do it.

709
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,707
It looks tasty.

710
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,629
Min-a.

711
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,554
This is so much fun.

712
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:45,972
Is it?

713
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,858
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

714
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,659
-Happy birthday!
-Here.

715
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,245
Here, have some while they're hot.

716
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,748
-Mr. Sim, please eat.
-Thank you.

717
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,958
I'll cook the rest.

718
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,596
He should eat with us.

719
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,185
He prefers instant noodles.

720
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:33,603
Have your fill, Min-a.

721
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,021
-Really?
-Yes.

722
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:41,403
Ms. Jung, should we
at least give him some kimchi?

723
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,074
Gosh, he's so high-maintenance.

724
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,292
If you glare at me with those big eyes,
did you think I'd fall in--

725
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,046
I mean, get frightened?

726
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,717
What?

727
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,845
Gosh. My poetry book.

728
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,432
What's wrong with you?

729
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,227
The car keys.

730
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,772
Why? We're going back tomorrow, so--

731
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,690
So I can sleep.

732
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,821
But…

733
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,204
He's like a wolf
that brings solitude to himself.

734
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,748
He's not a wolf.

735
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,333
He's incapable of living in a pack.

736
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,547
You shouldn't take in a beast
that can't live with others.

737
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,301
For it cannot be tamed.

738
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,151
What Mr. Oh said is true.

739
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,780
After the chairman passed away,
a portion of the directors

740
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,406
changed their loyalty to Mr. Oh.

741
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,699
OH BUM-GEUN

742
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:13,036
At this rate,
you will be at a disadvantage.

743
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,706
The shareholder meeting
must be canceled no matter what.

744
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,043
No.

745
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,712
Have everything go as arranged.

746
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,629
Is my mom okay?

747
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:09,134
She's all right.
It's just that a nurse came by.

748
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,803
We have to move out
of the VIP room by next month.

749
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,389
What happened?

750
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,018
I'll find out.

751
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,099
You don't seem to be a chatterbox.

752
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,612
When I first met you…

753
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,575
I thought you were a strange person.

754
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,125
That's it?

755
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,963
You thought I was strange at first.

756
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,466
Do you have anything
to add about what I'm like now?

757
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,344
No.

758
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,806
I knew you were a good person

759
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,601
the moment I first met you.

760
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,019
I only have good things ahead--

761
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,107
Take off your shirt and give it to me.

762
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,110
I’m just helping a job seeker out of pity.

763
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,195
I'm not a good person.

764
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,199
Even now, I'm in a quandary.

765
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,705
Everyone goes through
moments of ambivalence.

766
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:47,458
But you're trying your best
not to be swayed.

767
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,544
That's why you're a good person.

768
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,424
Maybe I'm just pretending

769
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,509
to be one.

770
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,013
You've been acting all along?

771
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,058
You should be the actress.

772
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,609
My dream was to be an actor.

773
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,446
You've been to my village, right?

774
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:18,865
One day,

775
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,076
a film crew came
to that village in the boonies.

776
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:40,261
Everyone in the village,
from the kids to the elderly,

777
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,180
came out of their houses to watch.

778
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,725
All of a sudden, the atmosphere changed.

779
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,146
A child actor couldn't make it.

780
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,316
-Look at their clothes.
-Hello.

781
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,401
-I'm the assistant director.
-Yes.

782
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,362
Do you want to try acting?

783
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,197
-Who?
-Your son.

784
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,451
Roll 7, scene 43, take 2.

785
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:10,958
And just like that,

786
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,797
I stood in front of the camera.

787
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,800
It looks like
he's actually crying. Oh, no.

788
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:21,135
-He is--
-Be quiet.

789
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,388
Mom, help me!

790
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,348
Mom!

791
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,392
I'm scared.

792
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,481
-In-seong!
-Stop!

793
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,983
If you keep yelling, "Mom,"
it'll be no good.

794
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,736
I like his emotions.

795
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,575
We're good!

796
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:45,493
That was

797
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:50,581
the first time
I heard the words, "Ready, action."

798
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,833
Those words

799
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,335
made my heart flutter.

800
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,338
Then…

801
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,550
is the photo that was at your house…

802
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,431
The movie was released.

803
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,143
But there was no theater in our village.

804
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,398
My father drove two hours

805
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,526
to watch me for two seconds.

806
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:21,863
But still,

807
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:24,282
your parents were probably so proud.

808
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,326
There was a banner in our village.

809
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,037
What about you?

810
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,790
Sorry?

811
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:35,626
What's your dream?

812
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,380
My dream?

813
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,054
I haven't heard that word in a while.

814
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,934
A dream when I'm 29 years old?

815
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,145
What's wrong with being 29?

816
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,732
You can be anything but a child actor.

817
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,486
What? You laughed.

818
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,404
No, I didn't.

819
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,615
You even know how to laugh. You just did.

820
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:06,949
No, I didn't.

821
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,035
Yes, you did.

822
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,873
-You did.
-I didn't.

823
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,750
You just did. It was hysterical.

824
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,876
No, I didn't.

825
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,586
-Where are you going?
-The bathroom.

826
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,297
We should drink another can
after you come--

827
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,507
No. You're drunk.

828
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,759
I'm totally fine. Hey…

829
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,597
I want to drink one more can.

830
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,726
Who should I drink with?

831
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:57,041
Where did Se-yeon go?

832
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,511
All right.

833
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:12,890
There we go.

834
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:21,315
What are you doing right now?

835
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,401
Don't you remember?

836
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,822
You said we should have
gambas al ajillo together.

837
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,574
Let's have a drink.

838
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:33,870
-Cheers.
-If you dip shrimp chips

839
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,664
into olive oil,
does that make it gambas al ajillo?

840
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:38,374
We're camping.

841
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,751
Think of it in a romantic way.

842
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:44,714
This isn't being romantic.
It's just shabby.

843
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:47,884
Also, how do you call this
drinking together?

844
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,761
It's more like a memorial service.

845
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,806
You're so fastidious.

846
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,475
"Fastidious"?

847
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,686
Mr. Park, do you have any drinking habits?

848
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,771
"Mr. Park."

849
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:04,567
How long are you going to call me that?

850
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,610
Here.

851
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,989
Try saying, "In-seong."

852
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:16,787
I will add "no drinking" to our contract.

853
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,498
Come on.

854
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,834
Seon-ju.

855
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,586
"Seon-ju"?

856
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:25,379
What's wrong?

857
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,716
Your name is Seon-ju,

858
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,469
-so that's what I called you.
-But, that's…

859
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:34,430
-Seon-ju.
-That's enough, Mr. Park.

860
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,098
-Seon-ju.
-I said stop!

861
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,975
-Seon-ju.
-Hey!

862
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,186
In-seong.

863
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,567
Seon-ju.

864
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,611
Seon-ju.

865
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,196
Do you want some?

866
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:51,989
"Seon-ju"?

867
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:54,825
That's enough.

868
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,044
At times, I'm caught off-guard
by your recklessness.

869
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:11,926
All right. I'm sorry.

870
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:17,223
You help others out
when you don't need to,

871
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,600
and you take risks
even when the odds are low.

872
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:24,939
It's like the pattern of your behavior
is an uncharted territory for AI.

873
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,695
Of course. I'm a human.

874
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,240
Even today.

875
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:40,037
I didn't expect you
to prepare this much for Min-a's birthday.

876
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:45,126
Thanks to you,
Min-a's day was filled with laughter.

877
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:47,920
Thank you.

878
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:55,886
I don't remember
ever having an amazing birthday party.

879
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,932
But at the very least,

880
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:03,394
I always had my mom's seaweed soup…

881
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:07,106
on the morning of my birthday.

882
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:11,652
Actually, except for when I was a senior
because she didn't want me

883
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,029
to fail the college exams.

884
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,784
I'm craving a glass of wine.

885
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,079
If Min-a's mom were alive,

886
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,082
Min-a would've had more happy memories.

887
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:31,047
Don't feel small.
It's really not like you.

888
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,007
We can just catch the culprit.

889
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:38,929
And then you'll be able to
create more memories for Min-a.

890
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,890
Will catching the culprit

891
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:43,851
bring me back to Min-a?

892
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,278
Dad?

893
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,196
Dad?

894
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,741
What?

895
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,511
We need something irrefutable.

896
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:01,512
Irrefutable?

897
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,014
Conclusive evidence that can't be denied.

898
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,100
Just looking at this, it's hard to tell.

899
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:07,059
Are you guys detectives?

900
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,561
All right, cheers!

901
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,855
You're lucky you're so kind-hearted.

902
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:11,981
I'm sorry, but I'm not like you.

903
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,732
I can't trust you guys.

904
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,526
I'm going to go myself.

905
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,069
If you don't stand by my side,

906
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,030
I can't guarantee your safety.

907
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,657
I know you're aware of one thing.

908
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,783
Who has your back?

909
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,786
I will tell you
the truth about that night.

910
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,538
Let's meet.

911
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:32,501
