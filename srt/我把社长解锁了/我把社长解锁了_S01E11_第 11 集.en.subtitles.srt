IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,749
That'll be 3,500 won.

4
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,250
Can I choose one more thing?

5
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,793
Of course.

6
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,421
Should we pick something for Mom?

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,217
What will she like?

8
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,387
All right.

9
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,975
-That's 4,000 won.
-Keep choosing.

10
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,560
-This one.
-Anything for me?

11
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,003
Hey…

12
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,265
BASED ON WEBTOON UNLOCK THE BOSS
(UNLOCK MY BOSS) BY PARK SEONG-HYUN

CHOCO PIE

14
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,894
No.

15
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:15,969
JANG JU-SEONG

16
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,266
His name

17
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,226
was Jang Ju-seong.

18
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,104
I only found out

19
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,730
after his death.

20
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,526
Ju-seong…

21
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,911
I never got to call him by his name.

22
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,236
Read it all you want, where you're at.

23
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,323
You left without saying goodbye.

24
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,325
JANG JU-SEONG
SKY, WIND, STAR, AND POETRY

25
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,534
How could you?

26
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,619
You're back.

27
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,998
Where did everyone go without me?

28
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,343
Here.

29
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,553
Did you buy this for me?

30
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,138
No.

31
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,725
It's from Uncle Mafia.

32
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,771
Why did he make you give it to me?

33
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,235
I know. Is it because he's shy?

34
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,404
Gosh, he's just like my friend, Ha-seung.

35
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,249
He seems to have been

36
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,168
a good person to someone.

37
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,215
Here.

38
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,720
Before he died, Jang Ju-seong

39
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,930
scouted around hospitals.

40
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,267
I think he was looking for someone.

41
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,774
There, there.

42
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,570
He was looking for Kim Seon-ju, right?

43
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,286
I thought Bumyoung ordered you

44
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,164
to get rid of Kim Seon-ju.

45
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,749
The CEO position was your reward.

46
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,464
What are you trying to say?

47
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,884
But seeing how you got dismissed…

48
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,430
I realized you were either

49
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,931
cast aside,

50
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,559
or never on their side to begin with.

51
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,062
He could be feigning ignorance
for information.

52
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,480
Be careful.

53
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,900
I don't know what's going on,

54
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,029
but shouldn't you tell me something
at this point?

55
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,160
Why should I share anything…

56
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,747
with the pawn of Bumyoung?

57
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,208
Me?

58
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,211
I'm not their pawn.

59
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,175
You closed

60
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,427
Mr. Kwak's case as suicide

61
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,346
and gave the Baro Version 4.0 report

62
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,973
to Mr. Oh.

63
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,809
I see.

64
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,104
I don't know how you knew about that,

65
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,065
but you're mistaken.

66
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,376
Goodness, I'm sorry I'm late.

67
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,086
It's okay.

68
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,839
It can happen.

69
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,216
Right, tell me about it.

70
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,677
There are so many people
interfering with my work.

71
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,682
We found this in Mr. Kwak's car.

72
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,642
It was deeply hidden.

73
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,520
You're telling me Mr. Kwak hid this?

74
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,401
The rules demand
I return a confidential document.

75
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,155
But could this be the reason
why you killed Mr. Kwak?

76
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,953
You shouldn't be making things up
when you manage the affairs of the nation.

77
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,955
Didn't the police conclude

78
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,708
that his death was a suicide?

79
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,210
To me, it's still a cold case.

80
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,421
Here.

81
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,216
Let's wait and see.

82
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,138
Right.

83
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,474
When you return to the station,

84
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,393
send my regards to Chief Hwang.

85
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,771
Let him know that I'm always grateful.

86
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:15,203
So you're not Bumyoung's pawn,

87
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,705
but a sniper targeting them?

88
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,082
How can I trust you?

89
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,377
Kwak Sam-su, Jang Ju-seong…

90
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,048
Did you think they were the only victims?

91
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,094
I've been watching Bumyoung for far longer

92
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,263
than you can imagine.

93
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,351
Here.

94
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,477
You'll find everything

95
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,646
in here.

96
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,272
Take a look at it.

97
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,233
If you change your mind,

98
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,276
give me a call.

99
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,072
BUMYOUNG'S ILLEGAL POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS

100
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,824
"Mr. Park of Bumyoung Electronics
committed suicide."

101
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,453
"Bumyoung's illegal
political contributions."

102
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,841
What did Detective Choi say?

103
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,386
He asked me to cooperate
if I knew anything.

104
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,513
Mafi…

105
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,142
Did he find the culprit
who killed Jang Ju-seong?

106
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,937
They're still investigating.

107
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,984
I don't think they found a suspect yet.

108
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,237
Then why don't we tell them about Mr. No?

109
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,447
If they look through his phone or car,

110
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,157
they'll find something.

111
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,158
No.

112
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,995
Putting only Mr. No behind bars…

113
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,207
would make Mafi's death be in vain.

114
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,627
Especially at a time like this,

115
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,546
we need to stay cool.

116
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,840
Mr. Park.

117
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,300
Mafi…

118
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,263
texted me that the information was leaked.

119
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,640
MAFI: THE INFORMATION LEAKED

120
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,353
Only one other person knew
that we planned to meet

121
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,856
at the gym.

122
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,363
You better hide or I'll catch you

123
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,032
Are you done hiding?

124
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,086
I told you not to call me first.

125
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,008
I'll call you when no one's around.

126
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,076
For now, let's cast the bait and wait.

127
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,833
We'll be back.

128
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,335
By the way,

129
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,629
what will you do for dinner?

130
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,050
We'll both be away on business.

131
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,718
You can have dinner with Min-a.

132
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,970
Is that so?

133
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,025
CEO PARK IN-SEONG

134
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,700
I'm sorry. I'm all done.

135
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,578
You're okay. Today's my first day back,

136
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,415
so I came earlier than usual.

137
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,417
-I see.
-Yes.

138
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,252
Ma'am.

139
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,338
May I ask you what your name is?

140
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,551
You even care to know my name.

141
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,263
I want to remember the names
of people I appreciate.

142
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:07,977
Yeong-sil.

143
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,438
Ko Yeong-sil.

144
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,775
Thank you, Ms. Ko Yeong-sil.

145
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,696
I wanted to thank you too,

146
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,990
Mr. Park.

147
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,326
-Yes.
-I should get going.

148
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,504
I'm not sure

149
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,215
if it suits the situation,

150
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,509
but congratulations.

151
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,303
Sorry?

152
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,433
Before, you became the CEO
because I named you as my replacement,

153
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:52,438
but this time,
you reclaimed the position on your own.

154
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,651
Mr. Park.

155
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,195
What's the matter, Ms. Jung?

156
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,157
Hello.

157
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,591
Why would you come here?

158
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,762
What do you mean?
The CEO of a subsidiary returned.

159
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,180
I should at least greet you.

160
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,432
"Greet"?

161
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,351
How brazen.

162
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,353
You killed him.

163
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,901
I have no idea what you're talking about.

164
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,074
How could you kill an innocent person?

165
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,832
To be honest,
I've been curious since the beginning.

166
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,461
I know Mr. Kim pretty well,

167
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,840
and a man named Park In-seong
was never around him.

168
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,641
What is your relationship with Seon-ju?

169
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,395
I mean, think about it.

170
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:18,816
You could become
the next "innocent person."

171
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,401
Or…

172
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,070
perhaps your family?

173
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,321
What?

174
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,284
Ms. Oh, you know me well?

175
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,286
Sure.

176
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,581
You may know me well,
but I don't think I knew you well enough.

177
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,124
That's why I ended up like this!

178
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,251
Who are you?

179
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,003
You're probably terrified

180
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,629
because of what you did.

181
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,464
What? What is this?

182
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,757
Damn it.

183
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,927
I spent too much time here.
I have a meeting to attend.

184
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,717
What brings you here all of a sudden?

185
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,554
I'm sorry to have worried you.

186
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,809
Fortunately, I got a call,
so we were able to react quickly.

187
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,686
He is Seon-ju.

188
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,646
Pardon?

189
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,815
Are you sure he's been unconscious?

190
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,984
Yes.

191
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,278
Ever since that day,
he's been in this state.

192
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,999
Is this the real document?

193
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,544
How could I dare to make things up?

194
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,965
Mr. Kim asked me

195
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,634
to deliver this to Mr. Oh.

196
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,277
The leaves have gotten too big.
Repot the plant.

197
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,279
I will prepare a new flowerpot.

198
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,582
Why aren't you coming?

199
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,043
I'm sorry I'm late, my little princess.

200
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,461
I'm almost there.

201
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,728
What's with their driving?

202
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,775
NOTIFICATION

203
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,402
We also bought garlic and…

204
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,404
Hello?

205
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,613
What's the name…

206
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,741
-It's not hot.
-Min-a.

207
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,951
-We also bought…
-The sound keeps cutting out.

208
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,652
What are they doing?

209
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,904
What? Did it break down?

210
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,451
What's…

211
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,629
Goodness.

212
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,553
There's somewhere you need to be.

213
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,269
Where is he going?

214
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,397
Damn it. Go after him!

215
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,442
Gosh.

216
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,985
-Hurry!
-Run!

217
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,238
Chase him!

218
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,573
Go faster!

219
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,367
Darn it.

220
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,370
-Damn it.
-Hey.

221
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,914
We have to catch him! Got it?

222
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,692
What? He's over there!

223
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,027
-Over there.
-Gosh.

224
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,620
MONDAY, JUNE 10TH, 2022

225
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:34,965
Damn it.

226
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,734
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

227
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,444
Does it hurt?

228
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,321
Get up.

229
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,085
Let's go now.

230
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,796
-No…
-Come on.

231
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,604
Go and check.

232
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,689
Damn it.

233
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,742
He suffered a diffuse axonal injury,
so I took emergency measures,

234
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,369
but he is still unconscious.

235
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,579
So?

236
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,833
It is uncertain
whether he'll regain consciousness,

237
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,504
but the longer it takes, the likelihood
of it happening will decrease.

238
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,839
So?

239
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,766
I'm sorry. It was my mistake.

240
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,476
"Mistake"?

241
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,729
Can you afford to make mistakes?

242
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,692
I didn't think so.

243
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,405
I will take full responsibility.

244
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,511
Hold on a second.

245
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,598
PLEASE TRUST MR. PARK IN-SEONG
AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE

246
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,392
IF HE'S GOLD, HE'LL SHINE.
IF HE'S IRON, HE'LL RUST.

247
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,603
Okay, I'll treat you
professionally as well.

248
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,148
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes, Ms. Oh.

249
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:06,033
I truly am looking forward
to working with you.

250
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,577
It is my pleasure.

251
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,707
Do you think

252
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,251
I made the right choice?

253
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,087
Why don't you wait and see?

254
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,382
If it's gold, it'll shine,
and if it's iron, it'll rust.

255
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,427
There you go again.

256
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,973
Seon-ju was lying down unconscious
in front of me,

257
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,642
but I received an email from him.

258
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,812
Someone else could've sent it
through his email.

259
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,149
No. "If it's gold, it'll shine.
If it's iron, it'll rust."

260
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,692
Seon-ju taught me that phrase.

261
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,031
I was anxious.

262
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,117
Someone appeared, acting like him.

263
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,163
It was hard to tell
how much he had planned ahead.

264
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,543
So until I knew for sure…

265
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,464
I didn't want to act hastily.

266
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,600
If they have not made a move
even after being cornered,

267
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,728
it means they have no cards,
or their cards are useless.

268
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,983
That could be true.

269
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,069
A long tail is bound to be stepped on.

270
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,742
Since it has come to this,
we should remove--

271
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,910
What do you think

272
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,455
they want the most?

273
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,084
Sorry?

274
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,515
Seon-ju will become the Joker for me.

275
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,065
Why did you act up? It was so unlike you.

276
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,984
What would Ms. Oh have thought?

277
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,821
She's probably more confused than anyone.

278
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,824
Since the unconscious
Kim Seon-ju talked to her.

279
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,035
Yes, so why did you overplay your hand?

280
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,955
-It was for our sake.
-Sorry?

281
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,417
Why do you think Ms. Oh
is keeping both me and you alive?

282
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:25,088
She's anxious because she doesn't know
what's in our hands.

283
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,467
So you lied on purpose?

284
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:35,056
It needs to look like
you still have someone behind you.

285
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,474
Fear

286
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,312
of the unknown grows the strongest.

287
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,909
Se-yeon?

288
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,832
She's leaving the house right now.
I'll send the address.

289
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,637
Who could she be waiting for?

290
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,475
I think they're here.

291
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,117
What are you doing?

292
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,828
My goodness. Mr. Park.

293
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,749
Goodness. What a terrible thought.

294
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,335
I was just…

295
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,213
Just what?

296
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,632
I was selling used items.

297
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,927
Sorry?

298
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,053
The thing is,

299
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,098
I thought it a pity to discard
the clothes that Min-a outgrew

300
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,600
and the toys she no longer plays with.

301
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,978
It's such a waste
when they're from nice brands.

302
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,982
She's telling the truth.

303
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,234
Right? Do you want to see this?

304
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,281
You've been doing this for quite a while.

305
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,532
Of course.

306
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,910
My boss is here. I'm hanging up now.

307
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,291
I'm sorry. I couldn't contact you sooner.

308
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,543
He must not be coming today either.

309
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,878
I'll meet you at our usual spot.

310
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,214
Her manner temperature is 45 degrees.

311
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,425
To be exact, it's 45.8 degrees.

312
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,680
And 98% said they'd buy from me again.

313
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,391
Then

314
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,852
how do you explain the leaked information?

315
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,229
Did you tell anyone other than us?

316
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,733
No, I didn't tell anyone
other than Ms. Jung.

317
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,152
I'm being serious. Trust me.

318
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,738
Then was there anyone else at home?

319
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,073
Well, there was Min-a and…

320
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,928
UNCLE MAFIA

321
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,513
WHEN ARE YOU COMING?

322
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,058
THANK YOU FOR THE CHOCOLATE SNACK.
I BOUGHT BUBBLE GUM FOR YOU.

323
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,693
3 MONTHS AGO

324
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,784
I have a lot of interest in the new CEO

325
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,744
of Silver Lining.

326
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,914
I heard he even moved in.

327
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,918
Can you just

328
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,589
keep your eye on him
and see how he's doing for me?

329
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,106
You approached the wrong person.

330
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,764
-Hey.
-Dad, I got a job.

331
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,015
What?

332
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,060
It's a subcontractor that supplies seats
for Bumyoung Motor Group.

333
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,813
They called me
and told me to start working next week.

334
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,607
Did you submit my résumé?

335
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,279
Yes. Congratulations.

336
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,550
Hello?

337
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,053
It's me. Tell Park In-seong
that I found Kim Seon-ju.

338
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,472
What do you mean by that?

339
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,515
You found Mr. Kim?

340
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,434
I'll see him at the gym.

341
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,562
What do you mean
about Mr. Kim and the gym?

342
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,105
He'll know if you say "the gym"!

343
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,607
Hello?

344
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,705
EMPLOYEE PERSONNEL RECORD
SIM YUN-CHAN

345
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,249
As expected, Mr. Sim's son got hired
by a subcontractor

346
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,834
of Bumyoung Motor Group.

347
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,836
What should we do?

348
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,089
I think Mr. Sim could open up
if we talk to him.

349
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,007
No.

350
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,177
We need to draw a big picture.

351
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,429
What do you mean by that?

352
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,767
We need to make a deal.

353
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,811
I am a CEO, after all.

354
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,357
Mr. Park's bodyguard died?

355
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,236
Yes. The police
are investigating the case.

356
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,030
I see.

357
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:28,201
My niece is plotting something again.

358
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,496
I thought I told her
to live a normal life.

359
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,331
BUMYOUNG GROUP
VICE CHAIRMAN OH YOUNG-GEUN

360
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,457
What should I do?

361
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,795
This is why weeds
should be pulled up by their roots.

362
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,589
To prevent any hopes from sprouting.

363
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,930
What's with your forehead?

364
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:51,766
I tripped and fell.

365
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,284
-Hello. I'm here for the 13,000-won meal.
-Yes.

366
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,245
RUMORS OF KIM SEON-JU'S
DISAPPEARANCE AND DEATH

367
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,130
You returned late yesterday.

368
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,884
We had a lot of work.

369
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,820
Hey, turn on the TV.

370
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,281
Just turn it on.

371
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,456
Silver Lining's former CEO, Kim Seon-ju,
who disappeared without a trace,

372
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,833
is rumored to have gone missing.

373
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:03,046
Further, in the financial district,
there are even rumors of his death.

374
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,764
Yes, sir.

375
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,766
No, that's not…

376
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,769
Is it true? Is my dad dead?

377
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,063
Is that why he's not coming back?

378
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,942
That's not true, Min-a.

379
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,698
Rumors of the disappearance of Kim Seon-ju

380
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,118
have also raised pessimistic speculations
about the success of Baro Version 4.0.

381
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,705
It looks like Executive Director Oh Mi-ran
needs to release a statement

382
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,541
on the release of self-driving cars
scheduled on October 3rd.

383
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,542
This is…

384
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,882
What on earth did you do?

385
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,469
Didn't you inform me?

386
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,473
We are living
in a personal media generation.

387
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,185
All I did was quietly give away
some information.

388
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,646
It was the dogs and pigs

389
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:05,692
who spread the rumors
of his disappearance and death.

390
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,444
-Uncle--
-I thought

391
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,533
you needed a wake-up call
from your pipe dreams.

392
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,661
What's the matter?

393
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,289
Do you still not want to wake up?

394
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,669
This time,

395
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,881
should I let them in on who was behind

396
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,467
his disappearance?

397
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,973
Please wait until we make
an official announcement.

398
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,141
I'm sorry.

399
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,521
-Assistant to the Silver Lining's CEO.
-Jeez.

400
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,859
The reporters, affiliates,
and competitors are in commotion.

401
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,194
Is Mr. Kim…

402
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,405
really on sick leave?

403
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,450
He is.

404
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,285
I know that's not the truth!

405
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,705
There's more to it, right?

406
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,292
You need to tell the truth
for us to come up with a plan.

407
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,298
Mr. Park, the fate
of the company is on the line.

408
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,976
Mr. Oh found a smart way to dismiss Ms. Oh

409
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,687
and protect Bumyoung at the same time.

410
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,816
But it also put Silver Lining
in a dangerous situation.

411
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,528
The moment I regained consciousness
inside this phone,

412
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,531
I knew something like this
would happen one day.

413
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,244
-Mr. Kim.
-It's just a bit earlier than expected.

414
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,081
But it is time to show the world.

415
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,000
Get ready for a showcase.

416
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,340
If you made up your mind,

417
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,802
there's someone
who should be the first to know.

418
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,309
Am I allowed to be here this late?

419
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,729
Today is a special day, so it's okay.

420
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,899
I'm going to tell you a secret.

421
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,776
A secret?

422
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,819
Yes.

423
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,366
But you have to promise me something.

424
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,702
What is it? Did my dad really die?

425
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,412
No.

426
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,832
Why would he die?

427
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,503
You can't tell anyone

428
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,505
what I'm about to say.

429
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,967
You can't tell your friends
at kindergarten,

430
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,178
Mr. Sim, or Ms. Jung.

431
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,221
Absolutely no one.

432
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,848
Can you promise me that?

433
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,393
Pinky promise.

434
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,355
Well…

435
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,107
Min-a.

436
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,567
Your dad

437
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,277
is safe.

438
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,947
Really? Where is he?

439
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,659
In here.

440
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,412
Mr. Kim Seon-ju…

441
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,665
I mean, your dad

442
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,793
is living inside this phone.

443
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,628
Stop lying.

444
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,922
I'm serious. Look.

445
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,760
Min-a.

446
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,846
What? It's really Dad.

447
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,432
Dad, where are you? Why aren't you coming?

448
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,143
I can't go right now.

449
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,687
But when you're by yourself,

450
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,273
if you just unlock this phone,

451
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,983
we can meet whenever.

452
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,611
Why can't you come home?

453
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,614
I…

454
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,034
don't know how to get out of here.

455
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,245
I'll find a way to get back to you
as soon as possible.

456
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,872
Really?

457
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:48,956
Yes.

458
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,835
Before then, we're going to meet secretly.

459
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,795
A secret operation.

460
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,090
-Promise.
-Promise.

461
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,355
Why do you want to go
to Seoul at this hour?

462
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,732
To see my distinguished son's face.

463
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,777
You can continue with what you were doing.

464
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,657
He said he was going to tell us later,
after tying up loose ends.

465
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,617
Later?

466
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,118
What?

467
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,455
Is he going to tell us
after we're buried in our graves?

468
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:33,960
Since he made us worry
by having his name all over the papers,

469
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:39,257
he should make all haste to visit us
and explain the whole story.

470
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,092
Do you not trust him?

471
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,678
Try trusting him half as much
as you trust Cho Yong-pil.

472
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,930
Gosh, why are you bringing up Mr. Cho

473
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,348
all of a sudden?

474
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,394
Mr. Cho? Is he your teacher?

475
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:55,231
Let's be real.
Did Mr. Cho teach you how to farm

476
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,774
or how to work with numbers?

477
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,444
I knew it.

478
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,323
There was always something fishy.

479
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,201
I want you… to be honest.

480
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,953
Are you not

481
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,205
a fan of Mr. Cho?

482
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,207
No,

483
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,959
I'm not.

484
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,964
Then…

485
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,590
whose fan are you?

486
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:26,012
Don't tell me you like the singer
who only shines in October.

487
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,722
Is it Lee Yong?

488
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,814
LIM YOUNG-WOONG FAN CLUB

It is now Generation Young-woong.

490
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,819
It'll always be Generation Young-woong.

491
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,945
Stay healthy and happy!

492
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,160
I'm Lim Young-woong's fan.

493
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,165
Baro,

494
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,710
can you play Lim Young-woong's
"Trust In Me"?

495
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,175
Okay. It is now Generation Young-woong.

496
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:08,721
BETA TEST RESULTS FOUND FATAL FLAWS,

497
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,396
What about Mr. Kim?

498
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,524
Right. He's sleeping with Min-a today.

499
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,026
I see.

500
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,238
It's a relief
that Min-a believed everything.

501
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,785
Had I known she'd take it well,
I would've let them meet sooner.

502
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,244
I almost regret it.

503
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,330
It couldn't be helped.

504
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,832
Honestly, it is dangerous.

505
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,293
It's not something
a seven-year-old can handle.

506
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,011
Are you serious?
Baro Version 4.0 is complete?

507
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,599
Lower your voice. Someone could hear you.

508
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,267
I'm sorry.

509
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,354
Then have you been
developing it in secret?

510
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:02,358
Of course! I just did what was necessary
as the CEO of Silver Lining.

511
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,360
All right.

512
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,055
Baro Version 4.0

513
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,850
is complete?

514
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,714
Give us your phone.

515
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,140
Hand me your phone too, Ms. Oh.

516
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,394
Right.

517
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,237
You want to make a deal?

518
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,157
I possess a lot.

519
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,910
What about you, Mr. Park?

520
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,787
Baro Version 4.0…

521
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,040
is complete.

522
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,003
I'll give it to you, Ms. Oh.

523
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,254
So…

524
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,423
return Kim Seon-ju.

525
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,426
They say a person's position changes them.

526
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,431
You finally seem like

527
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,558
a real CEO.

528
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,145
But before that,

529
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,941
there's something we need to
sort out first.

530
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,504
SILVER LINING

531
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,229
Ready, action.

532
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,776
There have been groundless rumors

533
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,947
surrounding Silver Lining
and Mr. Kim Seon-ju,

534
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,032
which was unfortunate.

535
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,701
Can you say they're groundless

536
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,829
when Mr. Kim did disappear
overnight without a trace?

537
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,505
Mr. Kim is not missing.

538
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,553
He's been developing
Baro Version 4.0 in strict confidence.

539
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,305
And I asked all of you here today

540
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,307
as it is now complete.

541
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,475
How can we trust you?

542
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,408
It's been a while, everyone.

543
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,619
This is Kim Seon-ju of Silver Lining.

544
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,123
Are you really Kim Seon-ju?

545
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,916
Where are you?

546
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,836
Due to security reasons,

547
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,756
I cannot disclose my current location.

548
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,341
Hope you'll understand.

549
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,552
Silver Lining is a global IT company.

550
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:02,640
Couldn't the video be a deepfake
or another form of synthetic media?

551
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,101
Then… goodness!

552
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,687
Are you saying I'm fake too?

553
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,774
You all are so imaginative.

554
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,818
Baro Version 4.0

555
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,363
is a core project
for not only Silver Lining

556
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,323
but also Bumyoung Motor Group.

557
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:24,244
There is also severe technological
competition and the possibility of leaks

558
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,121
among major companies
in the autonomous car market

559
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,540
that are trying to gain
the first-mover advantage.

560
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,544
In order to become the first movers
of the self-driving car,

561
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:36,799
Ms. Oh and I had no other choice
but to go with this method

562
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,259
until we could develop
a perfect version of Baro 4.0.

563
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,680
Has a level four self-driving car
been developed with domestic technology?

564
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,431
Will it be launched next month?

565
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,724
When would it be deployed?

566
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,519
-When will you return as the CEO?
-Please give us an answer.

567
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,116
Hello?

568
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,868
She has arrived.

569
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:21,593
The world-renowned science-fiction writer,
Arthur C. Clarke said something like this.

570
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,681
"Any sufficiently advanced technology

571
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,475
is indistinguishable from magic."

572
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,897
Just earlier,

573
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,608
it actually felt like
I was next to Seon-ju.

574
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,779
In order to become the first movers
of the self-driving car,

575
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,573
Ms. Oh and I had no choice…

576
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,701
You're still so brazen.

577
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,163
Why?

578
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,834
You're the one who approached me first.

579
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,213
"Will the people

580
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,592
believe what they see?"

581
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,136
I was honestly worried.

582
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,181
But then I remembered

583
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,476
how I was fooled right here.

584
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:15,105
Considering that, I became certain
that our plan would succeed.

585
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,237
Good work.

586
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,576
The showcase was just the appetizer.

587
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,329
Let's talk about the main course.

588
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,000
Sure.

589
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,421
There's this villa.

590
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,174
I'll send you the address.

591
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,219
Saturday at 4 p.m.

592
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:49,598
We'll complete our exchange there.

593
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:52,976
Okay?

594
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,612
Let go!

595
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,281
Call Oh Mi-ran!

596
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,788
You insolent punk.

597
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,833
How dare you grab me?

598
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,252
I'm sorry, sir.

599
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,935
We're at a disadvantage

600
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:39,231
because we have to enter that place
with very little information about it.

601
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,694
That's why I'm not sure
if we should proceed with this plan.

602
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,947
Will they meekly comply
and give us your body?

603
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,908
What if they just take Baro Version 4.0?

604
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,786
The worst-case scenario comes after that.

605
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,330
Having Baro Version 4.0 be taken away

606
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,793
and our safety also being put at risk.

607
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,382
All the more reason

608
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:06,967
to prepare ourselves.

609
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,277
Please.

610
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,947
You looked great standing
beside the next chairwoman of Bumyoung.

611
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,366
Why did you call me

612
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,453
to treat me to mere rice soup?

613
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,506
Thank you for the files.
I looked through them.

614
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,342
I was a crazy fool.

615
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,927
I gave fish to a cat.

616
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,805
If you want to attach a bell
to a cat's collar,

617
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,309
you should at least
give the cat some fish.

618
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,520
I see.

619
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,358
So?

620
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,029
Did you really

621
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,657
attach a bell on Ms. Oh's neck?

622
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,789
This Saturday at four,
a villa in Namyangju.

623
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,959
You will find conclusive evidence
to arrest Oh Mi-ran.

624
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,259
Are you confident?

625
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,223
Why don't you come and see for yourself

626
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,767
if she looks good in a mug shot…

627
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,645
or not?

628
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,777
What's my uncle up to?

629
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,947
He is figuring out
whether Baro Version 4.0 is real.

630
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,325
He must have a headache.

631
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,829
But ma'am,

632
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,456
without Kim Seon-ju,
Baro Version 4.0 couldn't have--

633
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,083
As their business partner,

634
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,253
I'm just wishing it succeeded.

635
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,171
Also,

636
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:12,968
even if they were bluffing,
would that even matter?

637
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,177
Sorry?

638
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,641
The news of the launch
of the self-driving car alone

639
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,852
will make Bumyoung Motor Group's
stock prices rise

640
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,563
and the board will make me chairwoman.

641
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:30,360
But what happens
if we really lose Mr. Kim?

642
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,657
Sorry.

643
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,828
Captain No,

644
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,957
it looks like you still don't know me yet.

645
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,045
My entire life,

646
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,673
I have never allowed anything

647
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,509
that belonged to me to be taken away.

648
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,140
It will be the same this time as well.

649
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:28,043
Dad, do you know
who my favorite princess is?

650
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,337
Princess? I forget.

651
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,590
Snow White?

652
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,635
I'm disappointed.

653
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,221
Did you have a fun time?

654
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:43,934
Yes, but Dad forgot
that my favorite princess is Ariel.

655
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:44,935
Really?

656
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:46,978
How could he?

657
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,064
The best princess is Ariel, right?

658
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,941
Sorry, I got confused for a second.

659
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:55,445
Let's go to bed now
and play again tomorrow.

660
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,363
Okay.

661
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,531
Right.

662
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,367
A gift.

663
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,577
What is this?

664
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,329
I drew it during art class.

665
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:23,890
DAD, MIN-A, IN-SEONG, UNCLE BUBBLE GUM

666
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,570
This day has finally come.

667
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,030
They're probably on full alert too.

668
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,283
Make sure to stay safe, both of you.

669
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,414
Get the notebook.

670
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,675
Hey, fan out!

671
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,344
Yes, sir.

672
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,638
Where is it?

673
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,515
What is that?

674
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:51,019
Open it. Come on.

675
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,522
Look at this.

676
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,191
Go down.

677
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:15,919
Go in.

678
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,013
Something's strange.

679
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,395
Stay still.

680
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,438
Check each and every room!

681
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:46,950
Jeez.

682
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,327
What in the world?

683
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,619
The person you are…

684
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,249
The patient you mentioned
is nowhere to be seen.

685
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:43,131
SILVER LINING

686
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,430
Are you okay?

687
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:51,973
Okay.

688
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,019
This is…

689
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,646
Silver Lining's
outsourcing server building.

690
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,983
Where Baro Version 4.0's
database is accumulated.

691
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,527
You're here.

692
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,078
You called the police.

693
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,750
We have so little trust in each other,

694
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,293
so I changed the location.

695
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,296
Where's Kim Seon-ju?

696
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,717
In there.

697
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,768
What about Baro Version 4.0?

698
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,130
Mr. Kim.

699
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:12,929
It's a relief

700
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,015
that I'm alive.

701
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,603
Se-yeon, start up the engine.

702
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,646
Okay.

703
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,344
It is Baro Version 4.0.

704
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,740
Why aren't you…

705
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,628
-Get out.
-Don't.

706
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,645
Just go.

707
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,814
-Hurry up and go!
-Shut it!

708
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,818
If you don't get out, Mr. Park will die.

709
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,071
If you get out,

710
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,616
we'll just be dying together.

711
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,579
What now? What am I supposed to do?

712
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,248
If we consider the odds,

713
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,958
what Mr. Park said is right.

714
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,794
If you get out,
you'll probably get killed too.

715
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,387
You have to hurry.

716
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,016
Hurry.

717
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,275
Leave.

718
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,735
Ms. Jung, step on it!

719
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,822
Don't move.

720
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,244
Go, Ms. Jung!

721
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:42,745
Go!

722
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,216
Make sure they don't run away! Catch them!

723
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,760
Stop the truck! The truck!

724
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:00,888
Let's go.

725
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,390
Okay.

726
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,518
Stop the truck! Hurry!

727
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,970
You saved us all.

728
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,934
I'll drive in reverse.

729
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,020
In reverse?

730
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:52,940
Watch out!

731
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,778
Earlier, I saw some space under the truck.

732
01:00:56,861 --> 01:01:00,448
If you can just let him know
when to get down, it's possible.

733
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,077
Okay. Let's give it a try.

734
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,213
Don't move.

735
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,090
Go, Ms. Jung! Go!

736
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,132
Get down!

737
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,179
How did you think of that

738
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,682
in such a short amount of time?

739
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,935
I just thought of
what you would do in that situation.

740
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,563
I knew you wouldn't leave me behind.

741
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,692
It was perfect teamwork.

742
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,987
The problem is that the server room
for Baro Version 4.0 blew up.

743
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,408
To restore it,

744
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,910
it will take…

745
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:49,288
quite a long time…

746
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,792
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

747
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,504
Mr. Kim?

748
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,340
Mr. Kim.

749
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:03,886
What's wrong?

750
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,900
Se-yeon, stop the car.

751
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,237
Okay.

752
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:44,135
What is it? What's the problem?

753
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,900
His soul got trapped inside a phone.

754
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,193
Is that a new TV series?

755
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,069
Tell me something I can believe.

756
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,112
Is that why

757
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,199
you became a model as well?

758
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,910
To make deep learning work,

759
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,913
there needs to be a large amount
of personal information.

760
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,957
So it's favorable to use
the data of the developer.

761
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,920
BARO VERSION 4.0 BETA TEST REPORT

762
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,214
"Updates every Monday."

763
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,509
"A week's worth of data is input."

764
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:28,721
But I can't remember anything
that happened a week before the accident.

765
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:34,268
"Data that has not been input
cannot be learned by AI."

766
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,771
But Dad forgot that my favorite princess

767
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,440
is Ariel.

768
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,984
If the AI machine
found a more efficient way,

769
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,570
it acted of its own volition.

770
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:48,032
Does that mean

771
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,993
the AI had emotion?

772
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:55,623
It will be an AI assistant
that thinks, decides, and talks like me.

773
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:58,042
That is what Version 4.0 will become.

774
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:07,969
SOFTWARE VERSION: 4.0 BETA

775
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,805
Baro Version 4.0
was installed on June 10th.

776
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,975
It's the day Mr. Kim was attacked.

777
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,309
DATE AND TIME OF INSTALLATION

778
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,978
What are you doing right now?

779
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,105
They're chasing--

780
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,565
THE SYSTEM IS TURNING OFF

781
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,320
No way.

782
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:29,824
The phone…

783
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,535
was not Mr. Kim's soul.

784
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:35,788
It was Baro Version 4.0.

785
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,084
How could this be true?

786
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,462
It's more realistic
than the idea that his soul

787
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,255
was trapped inside the phone.

788
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,467
Today will probably be the last day
we get to drink beer together.

789
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,427
Baro Version 4.0 is now in our hands.

790
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,347
-Shall we shake hands?
-If they release a self-driving car

791
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,890
that hasn't been proven to be safe…

792
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,768
Make the necessary arrangements
to launch the self-driving car.

793
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:41,687
-What are you doing?
-Because I'm going to lock Oh Mi-ran up.

794
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,107
Mr. Kim probably wanted you
to chase after the truth in his stead.

795
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:48,277
So I'm going to treat you
like you're Mr. Kim.

796
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,029
I'm at your service.

797
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:54,283
