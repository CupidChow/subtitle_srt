00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,160
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:49,382
1 YEAR AGO

4
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,597
You didn't go to bed yet?

5
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,685
Mr. Kim will be home late.

6
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,729
Let's go upstairs and sleep.

7
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,814
Dad might come in late,

8
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,734
but he always makes time for my birthday.

9
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,364
All right then.

10
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,305
Min-a!

11
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,518
It's not midnight yet, right?

12
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,811
You almost didn't make it.

13
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,857
Goodness. I tried to come early,

14
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,318
but a software bug suddenly showed up.

15
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,739
I know you have to update
Baro Version 4.0 every Monday.

16
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,074
There we go.

17
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,454
Are you forgiving me, Min-a?

18
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,878
There's no time, so let's skip the song
and blow out the candles.

19
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,921
Okay.

20
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,392
-What was your wish?
-It's a secret.

21
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,854
You're not even going to tell me?

22
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,275
I wished you'd come home early
for my birthday next year.

23
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,280
Here.

24
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,283
This is the doll you wanted.

25
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,076
Give me Mom's gift first.

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,870
That's what I thought. Mom's gift.

27
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,539
Here.

28
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,040
Here you go.

29
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,585
HAPPY SIXTH BIRTHDAY

30
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,253
ON YOUR FIRST DAY OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

31
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,171
HAVE FUN ON YOUR FIELD TRIP

32
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,049
WHEN YOU GET A JOB

33
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,387
YOUR 13TH BIRTHDAY

34
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,764
HAPPY SIXTH BIRTHDAY

35
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,663
In-seong.

36
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,435
If Min-a's mom were alive,

37
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,938
Min-a would've had more happy memories.

38
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,481
BASED ON WEBTOON UNLOCK THE BOSS
(UNLOCK MY BOSS) BY PARK SEONG-HYUN

39
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,483
Don't feel small.

40
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,485
It's really not like you.

41
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,569
We can just

42
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,988
catch the culprit.

43
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,700
And then you'll be able to
create more memories for Min-a.

44
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,745
Will catching the culprit

45
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,331
bring me back to Min-a?

46
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,591
Dad?

47
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,550
Dad?

48
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,804
What?

49
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,816
It's you, right?

50
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,610
Dad, where are you?

51
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,949
Why aren't you here? It's my birthday.

52
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,619
Min-a.

53
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,247
When you go on a business trip,

54
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,375
you usually tell me

55
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,545
when you'll be back.

56
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,550
But this time, you told me nothing
and have not come back.

57
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,762
Do you know how scared I was?

58
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,265
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,475
I was going to call you, but…

60
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,145
I thought you abandoned me

61
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,815
because I kept nagging you to read for me.

62
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,569
-That's not it.
-I thought you left me.

63
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:26,284
I would never leave you alone, Min-a.

64
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,288
You promised.

65
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,166
Yes, I promise.

66
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,626
Don't hang up.

67
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,587
Dad!

68
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,672
Don't cry, Min-a.

69
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,799
-Min-a.
-Dad…

70
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,135
-Min-a, don't cry.
-Dad…

71
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,847
-Don't cry. It's okay.
-Dad…

72
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,348
It's okay.

73
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,395
Dad…

74
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,818
I just found…

75
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,075
another reason
why we must catch the culprit.

76
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,373
Thank you for your time.

77
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,583
Even though I sent you an email,

78
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,420
I didn't expect you to agree
to do an interview for a school newspaper.

79
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:24,217
Gosh, college students chose me
as the most respected entrepreneur.

80
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,511
This is the least I can do.

81
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,015
What do you think made you
number one for three consecutive years?

82
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,771
To be honest,

83
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,026
whenever I see such articles,
I can't help but feel sorry.

84
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,155
You all have to
hit a three-base hit yourselves,

85
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,282
while I was born on the third base.

86
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,998
So in order to feel less ashamed,

87
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,128
I ran for all I was worth to home plate.

88
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,714
I heard you were
put in charge of a subsidiary

89
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,925
as soon as you graduated college.

90
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:06,884
That's right.

91
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,554
Back then,

92
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,515
I had a lot of courage like you guys.

93
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,017
After I returned to Korea,

94
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,523
I told my father
that I wanted to lead the company.

95
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,400
And what did he say?

96
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,573
He handed me a business card.

97
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,032
A business card?

98
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,617
Yes.

99
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,124
My first ever business card.

100
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,502
CEO OH MI-RAN

101
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,006
Manage the baseball team.

102
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,635
Next up is an update on Bumyoung Group.

103
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,096
Bumyoung has decided
how they will be using

104
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,808
the third Chungbuk redevelopment site
which is 280,000 pyeong.

105
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,479
Figuring out the purpose of
the redevelopment site was a long process.

106
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,025
Mr. Nam's corporate card
transaction records aren't of much help.

107
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,235
What about his social media?

108
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,239
I'm looking through
the employees' accounts,

109
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,782
but there are so many.

110
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,326
Plus, if his account is private,

111
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,494
we're at a dead end.

112
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,330
Looking at the security camera footage,
he was usually alone

113
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,165
whether it be in the lounge or cafeteria.

114
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,503
By the way,

115
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,465
Silver Lining has a lot of clubs.

116
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,676
It's in my management philosophy.
Every employee is part of a club.

117
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,512
I even take care of their welfare.

118
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,139
Isn't it a bit strange?

119
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,390
What is?

120
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,060
A voluntary loner
is part of the alpine club?

121
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,394
It's just for form's sake.

122
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,313
It doesn't mean anything.

123
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,523
Is that so?

124
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,691
Then did you also

125
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,527
join a club?

126
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,611
Sorry?

127
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,239
Yes.

128
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,698
Which club?

129
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,493
Start-up? English?

130
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:56,911
Or…

131
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,663
a movie club?

132
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,249
Comedy.

133
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,003
That is…

134
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,422
The comedy club provided the most funds.

135
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,094
Then do you have any skills
you can show off?

136
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,679
No.

137
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,973
-Show me.
-I don't have any.

138
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,683
Show us. Mr. Kim.

139
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,936
-Show us!
-Show us!

140
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,437
-Show us!
-Show us!

141
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,775
"All right. Bamboo helicopter."

142
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,570
It was just…

143
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,697
to put my name in the records.

144
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,533
Yes. That's what I was thinking.

145
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,745
Hold on.

146
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,081
Mr. Nam didn't join the club
as a formality.

147
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,541
What?

148
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,841
SILVER LINING ALPINE CLUB, TURTLE SHIP

149
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,514
This is the sole footprint
that the ghost left.

150
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,516
Who is the president of the club?

151
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,031
It's time for you to leave, sir.

152
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,366
Yes, just a minute.

153
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,121
We should hurry
if we want to make it in time.

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,460
There he is.

155
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,306
I've never seen him before.

156
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,141
Right.

157
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,477
I forgot to introduce you two.

158
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,772
I hired him as my bodyguard and driver.

159
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,399
-Is that so?
-Yes.

160
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,781
If you had let me know, I would've hired

161
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,949
a more suitable person!

162
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,957
Hey, you bastard. Are you in a rush?

163
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,168
Do you want to die that much?

164
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,843
Where did Ms. Jung go?

165
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,347
I sent her on an errand.

166
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,973
-Hold on tight.
-Okay.

167
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,936
Yes, I know Mr. Nam
from the sales department.

168
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,313
He came out every once in a while.

169
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,650
SILVER LINING ALPINE CLUB, TURTLE SHIP

170
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,276
Did he ever talk to anyone or--

171
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,653
Never.

172
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,488
He always kept silent

173
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,240
and never joined our get-togethers.

174
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,992
I thought, "He must love the mountains."

175
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,869
I see.

176
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,663
Why do you ask?

177
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,624
Did something happen to Mr. Nam?

178
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,668
I heard he doesn't come to work either.

179
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,795
That's not true.

180
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,180
The sun is so bright here.

181
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,807
I guess Korea is a large country.

182
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,476
You look pleased.

183
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,312
I know, right?

184
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,817
It was always so depressing
getting older each year.

185
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,571
For the first time, I'm desperate
for the next year to come.

186
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,408
Are you talking about
the end-of-year shareholder meeting?

187
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,951
Congratulations in advance.

188
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,870
Please.

189
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,843
Today, I proclaim

190
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,180
that the largest domed stadium
in Korea will be built here.

191
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,349
I am not seeking profit.

192
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,605
I am seeking to provide a better life
for Korea, just like Bumyoung's values.

193
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,985
These are the teachings left by my father.

194
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,320
I mean…

195
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,114
An enterprise should make money.

196
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,991
Does a domed stadium make sense?

197
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,326
Let her be.

198
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,454
This will be the mistake
that will lead to her fall.

199
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,585
Today, I would like to reveal
another one of my father's teachings.

200
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,588
Mr. Park.

201
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,799
Please step up for a moment.

202
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,273
The level four self-driving car
that Bumyoung Motor Group

203
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,025
and Silver Lining collaborated on

204
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,360
will be launched

205
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,487
on National Foundation Day, October 3rd.

206
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,622
I couldn't tell you in advance
due to security reasons.

207
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,623
My apologies.

208
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,959
It's not ready--

209
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,294
Just have it launched by October 3rd.

210
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,838
I'll take care of the rest.

211
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,597
This time it was a two-month gap.

212
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,564
And sometimes he appeared
after three months.

213
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,440
Just looking at this,

214
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,694
it's hard to tell
why Mr. Nam joined the alpine club.

215
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,946
No.

216
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,824
There's something about those dates.

217
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,704
It looks like Ms. Oh is trying to
launch the self-driving car

218
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,331
before the shareholder meeting,

219
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,208
so she can have the upper--

220
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,710
Do you think I don't know that?

221
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,587
I'm sorry, sir.

222
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,882
They can prepare Baro Version 4.0

223
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,094
even without the presence of Kim Seon-ju?

224
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,723
I don't think so.

225
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,144
SILVER LINING ALPINE CLUB DIRECTORY

226
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,312
So what is it?

227
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,024
He was only present during the weeks
when the beta test results

228
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,567
of Baro Version 4.0 were released.

229
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,444
Feigning hiking,

230
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,447
he delivered the results to someone?

231
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,781
It's just a hypothesis,

232
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,242
but the club must have been
a cover story for them.

233
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,620
Mountains don't have cameras after all.

234
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,876
Who could he have been meeting?

235
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,338
Thank you for coming.

236
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,762
Whether it was someone
longing for Baro Version 4.0

237
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,223
or someone who wanted to
stop Baro Version 4.0,

238
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,727
everyone would've coveted the data.

239
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:43,067
Thank you for setting up
the shareholder meeting.

240
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,277
It looks like I'll become the chairwoman.

241
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,125
Mr. Kim.

242
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,710
Look at this.

243
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,045
Did you find something?

244
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,839
Whenever Mr. Nam was present,

245
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,800
Mr. Kwak was always there too.

246
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,612
Mr. Kwak.

247
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,990
Do you want cold noodles?

248
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,749
I just realized I didn't ask
what you wanted to eat.

249
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,212
It's all right.
I like Pyeongyang cold noodles too.

250
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,467
Doesn't it taste too bland?

251
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,511
Do you want some vinegar?

252
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,263
No, I'm okay.

253
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,764
-Come on.
-It's okay.

254
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,561
I should've had a meal with you sooner.

255
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,312
I was being dense

256
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,900
when you work day and night
to pick great people of talent.

257
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,903
That is my job.

258
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,365
So…

259
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,325
do you know where Mr. Nam is right now?

260
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,330
Who?

261
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,836
Mr. Nam from the sales department.

262
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,090
He's been absent without notice
for the past few days.

263
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,024
Is this all you have?

264
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,152
You need to earn your keep!

265
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,198
It's not like Silver Lining
is a small business.

266
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,867
I have no way of knowing
where every employee is.

267
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,536
No, you must have a way of knowing it.

268
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,998
You were in the alpine club together.

269
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,086
Didn't I tell you
that I live apart from my family?

270
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,131
I only attended a few times
whenever I got lonely during the weekends.

271
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,968
But you see,

272
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:19,389
is it a coincidence
that Mr. Nam was only present

273
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,517
whenever you were?

274
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,685
I'm not sure.

275
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,899
I don't even remember
the times that I showed up.

276
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,401
Try to remember.

277
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,739
I did hear something from Mr. Nam.

278
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,911
I don't know who told you what,

279
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,705
but it is a bit unpleasant
to see you accusing me

280
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,125
without any evidence.

281
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,052
All right. Enjoy your food.

282
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,236
Min-ju,

283
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,530
are you out on a date with your mom?

284
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,074
Yes, we're shopping. It's Dad.

285
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,911
I told you to cook your meals
even if it's troublesome.

286
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,998
I usually do. Today was an exception.

287
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,041
Why are you calling at this hour?

288
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,837
What do you mean?
I just called because I missed you.

289
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,007
Dad, can I buy tickets to the BTS concert?

290
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,260
They're coming to New York,
but the tickets are a bit pricey.

291
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,721
Of course you can. Don't you worry.

292
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,681
I'm a board member of Bumyoung.

293
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,562
You can do everything you want
and see everything you--

294
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,939
Dad, I'm sorry.
I'm getting a call from my friend.

295
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,524
-I'll call you again.
-Min-ju…

296
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,444
My goodness.

297
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,239
Gosh, I'm always put on the back burner.

298
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,247
When will they move back to Korea?

299
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,223
Mr. Kwak acted like
he didn't know anything about it.

300
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,600
We need something irrefutable.

301
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,187
Are you guys detectives?
Why are you trying to look for evidence?

302
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,563
We can just hang him.

303
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,982
I'll get him to confess.

304
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,943
That's your way of doing things.

305
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,778
How do you call yourself human?

306
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,156
What did you say?

307
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,743
If we make a rash move,
we'll just end up in jail.

308
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,413
Watch out!

309
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,046
Gosh, I've been so out of it.

310
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,007
There's something I forgot.

311
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,678
We're a team now,
so we should have a team dinner.

312
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,268
Here.

313
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,189
-The food will be out soon.
-Okay. Thank you.

314
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,608
Cheers.

315
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,664
If you're a bodyguard,
you should abstain from drinking.

316
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,874
Shouldn't you know that?

317
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,723
Come on.

318
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,185
-We're not working right now, so--
-We're not?

319
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,729
Then I guess I can leave.

320
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,816
-Se-yeon.
-That was nice.

321
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,151
Se-yeon.

322
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,279
Se-yeon.

323
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,118
You're lucky you're so kind-hearted.

324
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,329
You easily forgive and make peace.

325
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,831
I'm sorry, but I'm not like you.

326
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,008
Hey.

327
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,226
Mr. Kim, I can't do this anymore.

328
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,145
You should've prepared yourself

329
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,690
when you decided to hire a man like him.

330
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,694
You know, the most difficult aspect
of life is people.

331
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,738
You're right.

332
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,658
But the person who can resolve
such a difficult matter is not me.

333
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,868
It's you.

334
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,498
That is true.

335
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,181
Could I…

336
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,141
take these to-go?

337
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,269
They'll get soggy.

338
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,438
Right? I thought so.

339
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,232
This is quite the feast.

340
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,317
Thank you.

341
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,155
All of a sudden?

342
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,117
What do you mean?

343
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,077
You were a lot of help that day.

344
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,540
But why did you order so much?
It looks enough for three people.

345
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,542
No. It's just…

346
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,669
I wanted you to eat a lot.

347
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,506
In-seong, you have gotten generous
after becoming a CEO.

348
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,182
Right. What happened
to that industrial spy?

349
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,809
What?

350
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,436
We're still searching.

351
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,148
It must be a pain in the neck.

352
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,984
That's not the only thing.

353
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,279
Being a CEO
doesn't give you peace of mind.

354
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,281
The real CEO keeps pushing me

355
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,533
while my employees keep arguing.

356
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,659
Hey.

357
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:15,996
I mean…

358
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,749
Why would you work hard to earn money?

359
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,794
Bumyoung Motor Group's stocks are rising.

360
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,963
Just quit everything and invest in stocks.

361
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:27,883
Should I?

362
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,885
Yes, just call it quits.

363
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,763
All right. I'm going to quit this darn…

364
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,683
What?

365
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,068
Hyeon-ho…

366
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,778
What's wrong?

367
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,405
What is it?

368
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,826
What's the matter?

369
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,246
What is this?

370
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,957
What in the world is this?

371
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,378
I think it's my salary.

372
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,933
The salary of a CEO is on another level.

373
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,643
Right?

374
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,148
We used to get paid with virtual currency.

375
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,152
You can get paid with crypto?

376
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,528
No.

377
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,324
I'm saying the money disappeared
from our accounts almost instantly.

378
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,952
You're right.

379
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,829
It would disappear in a flash,

380
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,499
which was a shocker.

381
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,669
Darn it. Why won't it come in?

382
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,753
It's today, right?

383
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,923
We waited for a month.
Just wait patiently.

384
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,676
It's because I'm so excited.

385
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,976
Hey, what are you going to do
with your first paycheck?

386
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,186
-Me?
-Yes.

387
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,145
PREMIUM KOREAN BEEF

388
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,275
I should buy my parents a beef set.
What do you think?

389
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,360
That sounds like a good idea.

390
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,278
-Right?
-Yes.

391
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,363
Yes, we can also be good sons.

392
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,614
Yes, we can!

393
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,496
It's finally here.

394
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,376
We're rich.

395
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,753
We're rich now!

396
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:32,966
Hello. This is premium Korean beef.

397
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,718
Can I have the 140,000 won set?

398
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,428
No. I'll get the 150,000 won set.

399
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,971
-This?
-Yes, give us two, please.

400
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:38,888
Okay.

401
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,394
Thank you.

-We forgot our wallets.
-We did.

410
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,134
Sorry.

411
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,897
Are you crying?

412
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,400
No.

413
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,904
At least you took home a tuna set.

414
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,325
I bought a toothpaste set.

415
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,118
But…

416
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,373
my parents were still so happy,

417
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,708
which made me feel worse.

418
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,754
Tell me about it.

419
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,674
Parenthood isn't worth it.

420
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,010
That does it.

421
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,970
It's the department store next time.

422
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,264
All right.

423
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,101
After 29 years,
I'm going to be a decent son for once!

424
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,268
Let's do it!

425
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,730
-My bus is here.
-Right.

426
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,065
-Bye.
-Bye.

Hey.

430
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,828
About my monthly pay…

431
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,955
I deposited it. You can check.

432
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,289
I already did.

433
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,669
I was just wondering
if you could increase the amount.

434
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,479
You are getting off.

435
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,067
Hold on. I need to get off.

436
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,487
Coming through. Sorry.

437
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,574
-I'll get going then.
-Okay.

438
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,705
BALANCE: 232,350 WON

439
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,383
What…

440
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,014
I'm sorry.

441
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,226
I want to apologize
for doing everything my own way.

442
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,498
After you left,

443
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,541
I repented.

444
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,377
I also have someone…

445
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,215
that I don't want to
reconcile with or forgive.

446
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,927
You do?

447
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,054
Yes.

448
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,349
It was rude

449
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,644
and hypocritical of me.

450
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,813
Even your apologies

451
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,649
are like you.

452
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,366
Your mother…

453
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,285
has such pretty hands.

454
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,585
Her hands were at work her whole life.

455
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,131
She only stopped working
after being hospitalized.

456
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,515
I wanted to become a hotelier.

457
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,441
I got an offer!

458
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,402
I did it!

459
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,405
I did it!

460
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,322
MOM

461
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,449
My goodness.

462
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,160
Mom, I got an…

463
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:21,129
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

464
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,509
She collapsed due to hemiplegia
caused by an acute stroke.

465
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,554
And in the process,
she suffered severe head trauma.

466
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,768
She is alive,

467
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,521
but she is minimally conscious.

468
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,652
You should prepare yourself
for a long journey.

469
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,579
RECRUITMENTS

ANNUAL SALARY:
40 MILLION TO 70 MILLION WON

472
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,010
PERSONAL ASSISTANT TO SILVER LINING CEO

473
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,359
I wanted to have her enjoy a luxury hotel,

474
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,404
sleeping in a bed with a magnificent view.

475
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,324
But in reality,

476
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,162
she is stuck in a hospital bed.

477
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,458
Se-yeon.

478
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,629
I wanted to give you an answer.

479
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,508
When we were camping,

480
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,011
you asked me what my dream was.

481
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,766
Though it was for a short moment,

482
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,103
your question brought back memories

483
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,523
and made my heart flutter.

484
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,451
The situation isn't great.

485
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,293
At the news
of the self-driving car's release date,

486
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,587
Bumyoung Motor Group's stocks
are rapidly rising.

487
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,926
At this rate, the shareholder meeting

488
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,055
will make my niece the chairwoman.

489
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,474
What should we do?

490
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,812
It can't be helped.

491
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,941
I need to meet Mr. Park.

492
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,086
Thank you.

493
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,383
Goodness. Thank you.

494
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,052
Hyeon-ho, I'll pay.

495
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,054
Goodness. No, thanks.

496
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,014
Why would you pay for my parents' gift?

497
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,767
Come on. I owe you a lot.

498
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,226
And I got my first paycheck.

499
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,772
Hey, my Bumyoung Motor Group stocks
skyrocketed too.

500
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,857
Fine, but I'm paying for our meal.

501
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,862
We should also gift nice outfits
to replace their baggy pants.

502
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,905
Good idea!

503
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,282
We may not be cool, but we're not poor.

504
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,284
We're cool too.

505
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,912
Yes!

506
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,733
Welcome. What can I help you with?

507
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,780
Give me everything from here to there!

508
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,573
Thank you, sir.

509
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,664
Babe, let's go!

510
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,878
Love?

511
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,755
Don't be ridiculous.

512
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,216
I'll buy it with money.

513
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,052
How much will it cost? Answer me.

514
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:44,892
What's wrong with you?

515
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,730
What made your face turn red?
Something's fishy.

516
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,692
It's nothing. Let's go.

517
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,826
In-seong.

518
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,661
I think someone's following us.

519
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,787
Who?

520
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,164
Four o'clock, in a suit.

521
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,582
Don't look. Act casual.

522
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,543
He's my bodyguard.

523
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,711
I see.

524
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,849
It's a bit small.

525
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,476
It's meant for your wrist.

526
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,755
I can't keep saying "Excuse me"
or "Hey" whenever I call you.

527
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,217
What should I call you?

528
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,928
There's no need to discuss that.

529
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,013
They call him Mafi.

530
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,766
Mafi?

531
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,019
Are you in a mafia?

532
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,734
The legendary fist
that broke his opponent's mouthguard.

533
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,694
Mafi, for mouthguard fighter.

534
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,239
You were a rising boxer
in the national youth team,

535
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:25,284
but now you're a loan shark
with three previous convictions.

536
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,458
Why did you do a background check
if you're going to say that to my face?

537
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,175
I needed to perform a fact check.

538
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:46,097
If you run your mouth like that,
you'll see me get convicted again.

539
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,391
That's the fact.

540
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,647
He blew a bubble.

541
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,941
How did you do it?

542
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,154
You look so brutal.

543
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,782
If you stare at her like that,
she'll get scared.

544
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,325
Can't you smile?

545
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,619
How can you be so antagonistic?

546
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,548
My goodness.

547
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,425
Come over here.

548
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,176
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

549
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,303
He doesn't scare me.

550
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,930
He's like a friend of mine named Ha-seung.

551
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,100
He always messes with me
and steals my snacks.

552
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:34,770
But my teacher told me
it's because he likes me.

553
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,741
-Here.
-What is this?

554
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,285
It's a shirt for you.

555
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,789
Why would you give me…

556
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,211
By any chance…

557
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,888
Did you throw away my shirt?

558
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,556
Sorry?

559
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,600
You didn't have to buy me a new one.

560
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,062
I threw away your shirt too,
thinking I wouldn't meet you again.

561
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,440
I see.

562
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,401
Ms. Jung, what time
is the VR seminar again?

563
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,364
It is at 2 p.m. at Daejeon Expo Plaza.

564
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,949
Mr. Park, can you go there in my stead?

565
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,827
If it's in Daejeon,
can I visit my parents after?

566
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,912
Sure.

567
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,053
Since you came all the way here,
let's go in together.

568
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,305
No thanks.

569
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,771
While buying gifts, Mafi…

570
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,150
Anyway, I bought something for you too.

571
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:06,862
It's a watch.

572
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:11,575
I saw you that day, and you seemed
to use the watch in various ways.

573
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,995
I bought one that's durable.

574
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,331
I hope you like it.

575
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,375
My goodness.

576
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,879
It's a purple dress. My favorite color.

577
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,339
You always wear the same clothes.

578
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,092
-I like it.
-And…

579
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,803
Since you like beef…

580
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,475
You must have money to burn.

581
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,854
If you squander your money like this,
you'll become a beggar.

582
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,106
-It's his first time getting paid.
-That's what I'm saying.

583
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,984
That's nonsense. Since you started late,

584
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,236
you should pinch pennies to save up.

585
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,657
What? Why do you
keep comparing him to others?

586
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,536
Would you like it
if I compared Cho Yong-pil and Lee Yong?

587
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,582
Go ahead! I'm confident.

588
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,503
-Goodness.
-Father.

589
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,632
-Here.
-What is that?

590
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,300
Glasses?

591
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,765
Are you trying to warn me
to keep my eyes wide open?

592
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,392
Jeez. It's nothing like that.

593
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,811
Here. Try them on.

594
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,314
-Forget it.
-Come on. Don't turn it down.

595
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,982
-Why would I…
-Stay still.

596
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,026
-They'll look good on you.
-I don't need…

597
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,780
What?

598
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,329
Honey, what's--

599
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,500
Baro, play Cho Yong-pil's "Mona Lisa."

600
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,504
What the…

601
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,448
My goodness. Honey.

602
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,492
Sir…

603
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,327
What?

604
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,495
Sir.

605
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,414
Goodness.

606
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:04,957
Goodness.

607
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,667
Honey!

608
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,544
My goodness.

609
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,880
Honey, what's gotten into you?

610
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,928
Sir, I love you!

611
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,055
-Sir!
-Jae-chun.

612
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,766
-Sir!
-Are you okay?

613
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,019
-Look.
-What's going on?

614
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,229
Cho Yong-pil is right there.

615
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,982
-Have you gone mad? What's wrong with you?
-You're crazy.

616
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,525
Snap out of it.

617
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,193
-What's with you?
-Village Head.

618
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,738
Close your eyes.

619
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,032
-Why?
-I said close your eyes!

620
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,494
-Don't freak out.
-Okay.

621
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,163
Okay. Open your eyes.

622
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,375
-My goodness, sir.
-What?

623
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,044
-Isn't that Cho Yong-pil?
-What?

624
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,213
Your father will stand tall
in front of the village head for a while.

625
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,424
I knew he would like those
more than the beef.

626
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:01,639
But how is it that you can see
Cho Yong-pil with those glasses?

627
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,350
They're called AR glasses.

628
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,268
My company made them.

629
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,107
Yes. Well…

630
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,734
Do you remember

631
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,862
when we video-called each other?

632
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,113
Isn't it cool?

633
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,116
What is that?

634
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,078
Do you remember
how I put effects on my face

635
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,829
like a flower and a dog?

636
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,751
I remember laughing so hard.

637
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,294
Those glasses are the same.

638
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,089
They put visual effects like Cho Yong-pil

639
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,092
on top of the world that you see.

640
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,094
I see.

641
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,720
So you're saying

642
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,932
the Cho Yong-pil that he's seeing is fake?

643
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,644
Gosh, it looks so real.

644
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,978
-Sir.
-Goodness.

645
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,730
-Goodness, sir.
-I'm getting a call.

646
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,108
-All right.
-Sir!

647
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,443
-This is amazing.
-Goodness.

648
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,282
I'm sorry. I took a while, didn't I?

649
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:06,662
How did you think of
getting your parents AR glasses?

650
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,332
-Sorry?
-You did great.

651
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,584
Did I do something praiseworthy?

652
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,920
Of course.

653
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,715
Thanks to you, I struck upon an idea

654
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,759
to corner Mr. Kwak.

655
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,934
CEO PARK IN-SEONG

656
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,607
Will it work?

657
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,026
It's technically perfect.

658
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,112
There won't be a problem
if we have good teamwork.

659
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,577
KIM SEON-JU

660
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,288
We have to wait
for when Mr. Kwak is asleep.

661
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,415
Thank you.

662
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,792
-Mr. Kwak.
-Yes?

663
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,546
Goodness. Thank you
for the delicious meal.

664
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,008
I'm sorry for cornering you
without any evidence that day.

665
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,179
Enough with the apologies.
I'm glad we resolved the misunderstanding.

666
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,431
I'm starting to fall into a food coma.

667
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,724
Let's grab some coffee.

668
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:09,933
It'll be on me.

669
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,060
No. The coffee will be my treat as well.

670
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,900
How strange.

671
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,488
Is this the place?

672
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,781
Yes. The sky lounge
has an incredible view.

673
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,699
I see.

674
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,620
Why are all the elevators
under maintenance?

675
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,038
Where are the employees?

676
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,415
Why don't we take the stairs
to walk off our lunch?

677
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,876
To the sky lounge?

678
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,544
Yes. Let's go.

679
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,837
Goodness.

680
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,550
ELEVATORS UNDER MAINTENANCE

681
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,934
Take your time.

682
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,733
The coffee will taste amazing.
Don't you think so?

683
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,279
Mr. Park.

684
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,035
Don't you think

685
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,663
they would've fixed the elevators by now?

686
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,290
Come on. We're almost there.

687
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,125
Just consider it as exercise.

688
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,301
We still have 15 more floors to go.

689
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,887
We'll be there in no time.

690
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,097
Let's go.

691
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,183
We're almost there.

692
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,986
The 36th floor…

693
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,614
What?

694
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,343
It's locked.

695
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,636
Is that so?

696
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,722
Well, there's always next time.

697
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,559
Pardon?

698
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,769
What are you doing?

699
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,313
Lunchtime is almost over.

700
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,564
Let's go back to work.

701
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,650
Heading back down.

702
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,514
Goodness.

703
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,893
Buckle up.

704
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,400
All right.

705
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,491
Ms. Jung, it looks like
Mr. Kwak is fatigued.

706
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,409
Can you turn on the massage function?

707
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,128
Goodness.

708
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,225
It worked. He's asleep.

709
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,738
-Ms. Jung.
-Yes?

710
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,032
Can you…

711
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,410
turn on some music?

712
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,415
Yes, sir.

713
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,055
Gosh, this song is amazing.

714
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,851
Right, Mr. Kwak?

715
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,317
Goodness, Ms. Jung.

716
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,696
You should've woken me up if we arrived.

717
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,580
Ms. Jung?

718
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:28,668
Mr. Kim.

719
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,553
You can't possibly be here.

720
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,431
Why did you do that
at the golf course that day?

721
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,309
Why did you do that to me?

722
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,145
I had no choice.

723
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,106
I was given orders.

724
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,197
Did you have a good dream?

725
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,534
Don't get me wrong.

726
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,912
It's too late to make excuses.

727
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,707
You can't possibly be here.

728
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,250
VOICE RECORDING

729
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,334
I had no choice.

730
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,421
I was given orders.

731
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,759
I know you're not the mastermind
behind everything.

732
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,596
It's not in your nature

733
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,097
and you don't have the guts.

734
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,765
Who has your back?

735
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,018
Sorry?

736
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,272
I'm afraid I don't follow.

737
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,357
I don't know

738
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:18,778
the extent of your involvement.

739
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,489
But I know you're aware of one thing.

740
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,244
Mr. Kim was attacked.

741
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,790
What do you mean by that?

742
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:35,879
Isn't he on a sabbatical
due to health reasons?

743
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,884
You can continue to play innocent.

744
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,847
But I wonder what will happen
to the tail that's been cut off.

745
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,142
Right.

746
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,314
Do you think
they'll continue to protect you?

747
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,149
Or…

748
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,110
will they feign ignorance,

749
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,695
the way you're doing right now?

750
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,634
How did you handle the situation?

751
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,721
That novice sounded
like he knew everything.

752
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:31,101
No.

753
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,186
I can't trust you guys.

754
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,939
I'm going to go myself.

755
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,702
Will Mr. Kwak move according to our plan?

756
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,956
His own safety
is the most important to him.

757
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,625
When push comes to shove,

758
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,670
he'd be more than willing to
switch sides to survive.

759
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,339
It's human nature

760
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,758
to react to something unfair.

761
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,802
To avoid being the fall guy,

762
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,971
he'll come clean.

763
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:11,725
I'm certain

764
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,727
we'll hear from him soon.

765
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:24,654
VICE CHAIRMAN OH YOUNG-GEUN

766
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,905
What did I tell you?

767
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,534
Hello?

768
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,621
Yes, Mr. Oh.

769
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,007
The apples were very tasty.

770
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:48,136
I understand your taking pride
in your parents' orchard.

771
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,516
I heard it's extremely difficult
to grow apple trees. Is it true?

772
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,811
They're high-maintenance.

773
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,022
I figured.

774
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,609
The sweeter the fruit,

775
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,028
the more susceptible it'll be to pests.

776
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:08,740
Why did you want to see me?

777
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,045
Just as your parents

778
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,547
grew apple trees,

779
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,175
I spent my whole life

780
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,261
building up Bumyoung.

781
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,222
But the thing is,

782
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:39,020
a pest appeared out of the blue,
and it keeps making holes in the trees.

783
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,565
What is usually done in such a situation?

784
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,652
If it's serious,
the tree is cut down or incinerated

785
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,112
to prevent further damage.

786
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,866
I like that approach.

787
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,702
The same goes for business management.

788
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,916
My antsy niece

789
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:04,712
announced that she would release
the self-driving car.

790
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,009
Don't you know?

791
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,762
She's just manipulating the media.

792
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,683
Why do you think that?

793
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,894
Because

794
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,980
Mr. Kim is not in a situation

795
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,149
to release the car.

796
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,403
Isn't that right?

797
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,118
You were sleeping?

798
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,327
I'm sorry.

799
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,579
What about Min-ju?

800
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,542
No, I was just wondering
if everything was okay.

801
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,465
Yes, I called for no particular reason.

802
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,883
Go back to sleep.

803
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,426
I'll hang up.

804
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,598
IMPYEONG MENTAL HOSPITAL

805
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:54,781
NAM ****-WON, MALE

806
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,834
Do you know what apple blossoms symbolize?

807
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,755
Temptation, wisdom,

808
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,590
and success.

809
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:18,388
Once you leave, think wisely

810
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,723
about whose side you'll stand by.

811
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,395
I will not stand by anyone.

812
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,692
It's great to be young.

813
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,819
But you know what?

814
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,114
If you don't stand by my side,

815
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,535
I can't guarantee your safety.

816
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,665
Are you threatening me right now?

817
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,669
No, I would never.

818
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:57,093
Just think of it as a boomer's words
said out of concern for you.

819
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,721
Mr. Oh said that?

820
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,187
Yes.

821
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,523
Does he know something

822
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,859
or was he just fishing for something?

823
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,571
I just can't figure it out.

824
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,668
Hello?

825
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,586
This is Kwak Sam-su.

826
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,637
Yes, Mr. Kwak.

827
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,556
Let's meet.

828
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,725
I have something to give you.

829
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,604
-Me?
-I will tell you the truth

830
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,606
about that night.

831
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,316
Come out alone.

832
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,274
Mr. Kwak, stay with me.

833
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,400
Mr. Kwak!

834
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,492
If you don't stand by my side,

835
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:10,995
I can't guarantee your safety.

836
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,917
Mr. Kwak.

837
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,752
Mr. Kwak, stay with me.

838
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,677
Help!

839
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,679
Can you call an ambulance?

840
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,058
Excuse me, Mr. Kwak.

841
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,392
Move.

842
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:46,948
There's no way.

843
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,950
He called me and asked to meet.

844
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,493
He didn't commit suicide.

845
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,786
Yes, I see.

846
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,789
That's what I think too. Grab him.

847
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,210
Anything you say from now on

848
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:02,213
can be used against you in a court of law.

849
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,757
So if you're scared…

850
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:10,054
you should use your right
to remain silent.

851
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:14,725
Take him away.

852
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,333
What should we do?

853
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,794
What else can you do?
You must throw it away.

854
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,716
-Did you hear from Mr. Park?
-No.

855
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,384
Since it's complicated,
let's think simply.

856
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,719
I traced the number,

857
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,930
and its location is around Yeongbo Park.

858
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,807
What are you doing?

859
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,100
If they know you were with me,
it'll make things worse.

860
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,936
He left the base,

861
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,188
so he should've run with all his might.

862
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,066
If he was going to hesitate,
he should've just stayed on the base.

863
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:48,945
Bring me the next base in here.

864
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:53,282
