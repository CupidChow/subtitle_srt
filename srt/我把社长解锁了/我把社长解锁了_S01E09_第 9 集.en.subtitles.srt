IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,214
10 YEARS AGO

4
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,216
CEO OH MI-RAN

5
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,846
I said I wanted to be
in charge of a subsidiary.

6
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,889
You did.

7
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,141
Manage the baseball team.

8
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,768
-Father--
-People

9
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,811
should only do what they're capable of.

10
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,732
Your younger brother
will manage the company.

11
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,401
Seung-won…

12
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,029
Seung-won is only in college.

13
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,907
Did you see something
in him that I don't have?

14
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,708
In the Later Han,

15
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,296
there was a warlord of noble birth
by the name of Yuan Shao.

16
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,340
He impartially entrusted

17
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,383
Qingzhou to his first son,

18
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,719
Youzhou to his second,

19
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,763
and Jizhou to his third.

20
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,016
Do you know what happened in the end?

21
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,362
The three sons

22
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,741
fought among themselves
and fell into internal strife.

23
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,867
Because of that,

24
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,994
history only remembers Cao Cao,
the statesman.

25
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,623
Don't complicate matters for your old man.

26
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,863
I have bad news.

27
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:35,864
Your brother…

28
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,699
passed away.

29
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,202
Get the car ready, please.

30
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:54,007
CEO OH MI-RAN

31
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,317
Step on it. Hurry.

32
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,072
Is he okay now?

33
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,950
Yes, he was given
emergency treatment, so he is fine.

34
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,744
Until further notice,

35
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,413
you need to keep him alive.

36
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,590
BASED ON WEBTOON UNLOCK THE BOSS
(UNLOCK MY BOSS) BY PARK SEONG-HYUN

37
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,883
You should hide yourself.

38
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,552
Clear the building.

39
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,601
Gosh, my boss is here!

40
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,145
It's not visiting hours. Please leave.

41
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,439
Please let this go. What's the problem?

42
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,150
What's the problem? Let go and tell me.

43
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,030
-Why can't I go?
-Let go.

44
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,824
All right. You can let go.

45
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,456
Darn it.

46
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,767
What the…

47
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,271
What are you doing?

48
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,067
Damn it.

49
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,328
The ambulance.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,042
Bring the car out.

51
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,255
What is wrong with you?

52
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:29,996
Follow me.

53
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,768
Get in the back.

54
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,822
Turn right here.

55
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,674
Where is it?

56
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,308
Where do I go?

57
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,232
Over there.

58
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,258
-It's the ambulance.
-We found it.

59
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,392
-Hey!
-Stop!

60
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,310
Stop the car.

61
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,030
What are you doing?

62
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,740
Who are you?

63
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,536
We are transporting a patient.

64
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,706
Get out.

65
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,292
-Where is he?
-What are you doing?

66
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,460
Where is he?

67
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,452
You should hide yourself.

68
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,546
Clear the building.

69
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,590
Okay. Leave quietly now.

70
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,653
I handled everything.

71
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:57,346
Were we ever on good enough terms
to enjoy eating dinner together?

72
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,265
Was it you?

73
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,809
What are you talking about?

74
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,353
Mr. Kwak.

75
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,983
Did you kill him?

76
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,235
Just like Kim Seon-ju?

77
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,116
No.

78
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,786
Kim Seon-ju…

79
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,913
is alive.

80
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,732
He is…

81
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,984
alive?

82
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,321
Why would Kim Seon-ju die?
For whose benefit?

83
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,325
If Kim Seon-ju dies, the person
who will instantly publish an obituary

84
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,828
and declare the failure
of the self-driving car

85
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,497
is right in front of me.

86
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,336
Why would I take the trouble?

87
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,504
The project

88
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,632
is already a failure.

89
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,218
Mr. Kwak

90
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:22,473
had the beta test report
for Baro Version 4.0.

91
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,892
He was cooperating with you,

92
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,562
but he still needed a fail-safe.

93
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,607
I am asking you.

94
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,194
Who do you work for?

95
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,699
Well, that is…

96
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,676
What are you so unsure about?

97
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,098
You obviously work for Bumyoung.

98
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:09,937
Isn't that right?

99
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,981
Yes.

100
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,651
You're right. I work for Bumyoung.

101
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,449
I always knew you were ambitious.

102
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,285
But this time, you went too far.

103
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,787
How long did you think

104
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,582
you could deceive me
with a project that's gone under?

105
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,335
That's not true.

106
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,630
The self-driving car will be released
by October 3rd no matter--

107
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,549
Step down on your own

108
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,427
and live a normal life.

109
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,262
Then

110
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,515
I'll forget about this incident
and let sleeping dogs lie.

111
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,850
That

112
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,103
is the last thing I can do for you.

113
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,688
I'm doing you a favor.

114
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,197
Goodness. How touching.

115
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,910
Since when did you
take care of me that much?

116
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,712
It isn't for your sake.

117
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:22,301
I just don't want even a speck
of dust tarnishing Bumyoung's name.

118
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,070
This is you, right?

119
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,574
You can tell it's me from the prominent
nose and the sharp jawline.

120
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,412
He has a respirator,
so it means he's still breathing.

121
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,917
Do you think
your soul got trapped inside your phone

122
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,794
after you entered a coma?

123
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,796
It happens in the movies.

124
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,715
Whatever the case, it's a relief

125
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,009
that he has a body to return to.

126
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,304
But why do you think they kept me alive?

127
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,101
Because you're still of use to them,

128
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,270
whatever the reason may be.

129
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,689
We have to find my body

130
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,440
before I become useless.

131
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,442
How?

132
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,737
We don't know the model or the plate
of the vehicle that took your body away,

133
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,448
and the area's so remote,
so there are no security cameras.

134
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,369
Then can't we look into
other mental hospitals and--

135
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,495
That's inefficient.

136
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,290
NURSING HOMES

137
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,590
There are 1,582 nursing homes

138
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,342
and 423 mental hospitals in the nation.

139
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,847
Plus, we have no evidence
that my body was moved to a hospital.

140
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,018
Is there no other way?

141
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,607
When you're left with no choices,

142
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,110
there's always one option left.

143
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,196
Mustering up the courage.

144
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,074
I will go meet Mr. Oh.

145
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,785
What? What are you planning on doing?

146
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:16,332
In the meantime, you and Mafi
should visit Impyeong Mental Hospital.

147
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,708
I don't get what's going on.

148
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,293
Shouldn't we stop him?

149
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,464
The more you think about something,
the weaker your courage gets.

150
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,884
If it wasn't for Mr. Park,
we wouldn't have come this far.

151
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,094
Let's have faith.

152
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,350
IMPYEONG MENTAL HOSPITAL

153
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,227
Call the director.

154
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,854
Why are you doing this?

155
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,147
Hurry up.

156
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:43,943
Can I help you?

157
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,286
Where did the patient in Room 301 go?

158
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,292
Well…

159
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,087
What was the patient's name?

160
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,589
Kim Seon-ju.

161
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,267
That's not it.

162
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,645
Then who is it?

163
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,148
Under medical law, I can't disclose
any personal information.

164
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,735
Then what about this?

165
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,823
He was here.

166
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,326
It was taken from the side.

167
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,995
They must look similar.

168
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,331
Hey.

169
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,375
Do I look like a pushover?

170
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,335
What are you doing?

171
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,962
Give me that. Let me check.

172
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,463
What do you think you're doing?

173
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,216
-Give it to me so I can check.
-What's wrong with you?

174
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,218
I'm going to report you if you don't stop.

175
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,388
-Go ahead! Do whatever you want!
-What are you doing?

176
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,515
-Why are you doing this?
-Hey, let go.

177
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,893
-Let go of me.
-This is a hospital. Let's talk it out.

178
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,437
-This is a hospital.
-What's wrong with him?

179
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,780
I am the CEO of Silver Lining.

180
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,286
What brings you here?

181
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,498
It's you, isn't it?

182
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,083
You…

183
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,588
You abducted Mr. Kim.

184
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,511
Do you have evidence?

185
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,429
Evidence?

186
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,806
Why do I need to look for evidence?

187
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,810
I'm going to send the video of Mr. Kim
with a respirator to the police.

188
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,565
If you do,

189
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,152
his respirator will come off.

190
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,280
Think carefully.

191
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,117
It's up to you
whether I stay as an abductor

192
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,161
or…

193
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,706
become a murderer.

194
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,893
You did nothing?

195
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,187
Yes.

196
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,066
Their hideout has been exposed,
so they're probably flustered and scared.

197
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,902
They could behave irrationally

198
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,696
if we trigger them at a time like this.

199
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,033
We should move discreetly among ourselves.

200
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,036
Yes. You returned
empty-handed as well, right?

201
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,663
No.

202
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,261
What? How did you…

203
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,013
-Let go of me.
-This is a hospital. Let's talk it out.

204
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,890
-Let's talk it out.
-What's wrong with him?

205
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,059
-You must be joking.
-What in the world?

206
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,691
I'll cause a scene,
so don't panic and get into action.

207
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,946
-Let's talk outside.
-Let go.

208
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,865
Drag him out.

209
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,992
-What's wrong with you?
-Let go of me.

210
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,368
-What are you doing?
-Hit me.

211
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,203
-Just give it to me.
-Drag him away!

212
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,791
I don't feel good about this.
But don't worry.

213
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,419
The hand is quicker than the eye.

214
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,920
Was it something like that?

215
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:34,882
You have a knack.

216
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,303
If you knew a lot sooner,
you could've repaid me a lot quicker.

217
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,891
I still can't believe
you thought of doing that.

218
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,810
Well, why should
we keep the law when facing people

219
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,896
who don't care about the law?

220
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,274
I didn't know
you were such a scary person.

221
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,277
She's not scary. She's smart.

222
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,870
You can stay out of this if you'd like.

223
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,288
I'll look into this doctor.

224
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,958
I'll be able to find
a connection to Bumyoung.

225
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,127
What do you mean?

226
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,254
You are

227
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,631
so wise.

228
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,767
I got a call.

229
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,853
Hello?

230
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,442
-My mom did?
-Yes. She told me to drag you home.

231
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,819
I'm so busy, though.

232
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,989
Do you know why?

233
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,616
I don't know.

234
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,161
But if she asked me for help,
it's probably something important.

235
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,916
Gosh. I'm not in a situation
where I can decide my own schedule.

236
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,460
Then who decides for you?

237
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,798
Oh, my gosh! What the heck?

238
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,676
Why is this moving on its own?

239
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,094
I scheduled it to do that.

240
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,430
"If you no longer want to see my face,

241
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,808
I will let you leave in peace."

242
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,893
"I will let you leave in peace"?

243
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,647
-Let's go.
-What?

244
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:19,987
But the author is actually using irony
and telling the person not to leave.

245
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,863
Hey!

246
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,490
What's wrong?

247
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,368
Because you can't lightly step on…

248
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,161
Are you saying I can go or not?

249
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,206
Why are you doing this to me?

250
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,334
I wasn't talking to you.

251
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,461
You should've put on your belt earlier.

252
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,504
Yes.

253
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,923
-I'll go now.
-Go.

254
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,384
But…

255
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,136
Gosh.

256
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,100
Why do you think the poet wrote this?

257
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:53,645
To express that he had no choice
but to accept his lover's departure.

258
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,691
Gosh.

259
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,277
Everything's the same.

260
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,820
-It's been a while, right?
-Yes.

261
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,364
That house is still there.

262
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,200
Of course. Where would it go?

263
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,745
The man who lived there used to hate me.

264
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,289
Why do you have your shoes on?
You'll bring misfortune.

265
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,416
Hurry up and come down.

266
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,048
-You knew, didn't you?
-No, I didn't.

267
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,550
In-seong. Hyeon-ho.

268
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,969
-Mother.
-Long time no see!

269
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,056
Thank you for keeping it from In-seong.

270
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,182
Goodness.

271
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,642
I'm going to sit back and enjoy the ride.

272
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,020
-Hey.
-Welcome home.

273
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,106
What is all of this?

274
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,276
You're possessed with a spirit,
and a talisman isn't enough.

275
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,195
Let's perform an exorcism.

276
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,238
Mom, I'm busy. Sorry.

277
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,240
In-seong. Wait, In-seong.

278
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,958
If I knew, I wouldn't have come.

279
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,087
-I'll go back to Seoul--
-Let's give it a try.

280
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,254
Sorry?

281
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,132
I mean, we came
all the way here. Let's try.

282
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,096
Are you serious?

283
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,097
Good luck.

284
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,443
Get out!

285
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,614
What is causing you to haunt this phone?

286
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,992
Go away.

287
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,829
A soul that has experienced betrayal
is wandering around.

288
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,999
Come out!

289
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,793
Return to the place

290
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,253
where your body lies!

291
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,130
Return!

292
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,238
Goodness.

293
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,866
What's wrong?

294
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,368
This is no ordinary spirit.

295
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,704
The evil spirit

296
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,165
could take your precious son's life

297
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,083
in the blink of an eye.

298
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,084
What?

299
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,511
He's going to die?

300
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,430
Then what do we do?

301
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,516
I need to write a talisman.

302
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,689
-How much will it cost?
-Hey. Does that matter right now?

303
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,111
No. Hold on one second. Just a second.

304
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,363
Wait, Mom.

305
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,006
Honey,

306
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,925
are you out of your mind?

307
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,469
He could die.

308
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,889
Our son could die.

309
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,856
Darn it. Why is the phone so hot?

310
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,318
Hey, don't you have anything smaller?

311
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,780
Where did I put it?

312
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,951
Gosh. Just give me anything.

313
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,661
She won't even know the difference.

314
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,621
Here.

315
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,667
-Okay.
-But still,

316
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,128
isn't five million won
too expensive for a talisman?

317
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,007
Hey. You need to make hay
while the sun shines.

318
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,345
Damn it.

319
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,140
Maybe I should've asked
for ten million instead, right?

320
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,352
Do you like it that much?

321
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,187
-Hey.
-Yes?

322
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,314
Did you just say that?

323
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,316
It wasn't me.

324
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,697
Then who was it? It's just the two of us.

325
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,618
Why is it just the two
of you? I'm here too.

326
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,205
Did you see that?

327
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,291
-I know everything.
-The phone is talking on its own.

328
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,126
I am watching everything.

329
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:12,297
I know everything!
I am watching everything!

330
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,465
My goodness.

331
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,053
-Are you okay?
-I almost burned my hand.

332
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,513
-What's wrong?
-What is this?

333
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,725
Could it be…

334
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,604
Is it really possessed by an evil spirit?

335
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,939
Jeez.

336
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,733
There's no such thing as spirits.

337
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,860
-There is one right here.
-Oh, my gosh!

338
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,032
I am a spirit.

339
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,034
A hopping vampire.

340
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,620
-I'm going to get you.
-It's going to blow up.

341
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,829
-Run away.
-What?

342
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,875
Hey, you punk! Wait for me!

343
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,085
Goodness.

344
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,968
Just like you said, he's the director.

345
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,972
Something's strange.

346
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,269
What is?

347
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,231
This article is from 2012.

348
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,568
"Anesthesiologist Ha is under indictment
for medical malpractice."

349
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,989
So he was 34 years old in 2012.

350
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,493
That means he was born in 1978.

351
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,579
His last name is Ha,
he's an anesthesiologist,

352
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,456
and he was born in 1978.

353
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,042
I think the doctor
in this article is Ha Jong-baek.

354
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,964
Who has this bastard's back

355
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,466
for him to become a director
after killing a patient?

356
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,343
I know, right?

357
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,973
On top of that, the person who died
due to medical malpractice

358
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,893
is the late Oh Bum-geun's only son,
Oh Seung-won.

359
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,941
CHAIRMAN OH BUM-GEUN'S SON

360
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,615
It would've been nice
if we had some of your doenjang soup.

361
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,701
But In-seong is busy.

362
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,329
Hey…

363
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,414
Hyeon-ho.

364
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,462
Are you coming or not?
I'm leaving you behind.

365
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,088
Don't worry too much, Mother.

366
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,258
-Go back safely.
-Okay.

367
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,348
Hey, say goodbye.

368
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,768
Hurry.

369
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,696
Mom.

370
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,157
I'm sorry.

371
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,955
Don't believe in superstitions anymore.

372
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,460
If you feel uneasy,
start attending church again.

373
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,592
Bye.

374
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:05,929
Goodbye.

375
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,307
Mother, I'll visit again soon
with In-seong.

376
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,184
All right.

377
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,255
It's been a while
since I've seen your mom.

378
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,132
I should've eaten her soybean paste stew.

379
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,140
Goodness.

380
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,644
I can feel her love.

381
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,027
So this talisman
is worth five million won?

382
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,158
An exorcism and a talisman
in this day and age?

383
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,535
What is all of this?

384
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,290
If I were an excellent shaman,
I wouldn't read others' fortunes.

385
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,166
I would predict stock prices.

386
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,922
I beg the gods of heaven and earth.

387
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,299
What are the best stocks

388
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,509
-to buy?
-Whenever my mom acts like that,

389
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,511
it makes me so frustrated.

390
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,680
I don't understand her.

391
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,725
I do.

392
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,186
You told me while you were drunk

393
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,939
that she started believing
in superstitions because of you.

394
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,945
It's probably his first time
in front of a camera, but he did great.

395
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,115
Thank you so much. We should treat you to…

396
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,160
I made some wine with snakes up there.
Would you like some?

397
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,578
-It's okay.
-Goodness. Honey.

398
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,706
-Everyone is waiting.
-I see.

399
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,042
-I'll contact you when the release is set.
-All right.

400
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,002
-You know our number, right?
-Good job. I do.

401
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,587
-I gave it to him.
-Good work.

402
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,005
-Take care.
-Thank you.

403
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,632
Okay. Take care.

404
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,052
Our celebrity! My son!

405
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,472
You're a movie star now.

406
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,515
See?

407
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,686
Didn't I tell you that I saw a crane
dancing over clear waters in my dream?

408
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,480
Mom, is that a good dream?

409
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,649
Of course.

410
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,360
That is what you call a lucky dream.

411
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,736
Yes.

412
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,364
Thanks to your mother,
you'll appear in a movie.

413
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,285
You're an actor now.

414
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,330
-Gosh. This is amazing.
-I knew it.

415
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,373
Goodness.

416
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,751
These days, if you make
your daughter-in-law do something,

417
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,545
-you'll get kicked out.
-You're right.

418
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,423
-Goodness.
-Mom! I passed!

419
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,800
-I passed!
-You passed?

420
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,763
-In-seong, you passed your audition?
-Yes, I did.

421
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,432
-Hello.
-What are you saying?

422
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,767
What happened?

423
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,105
Well, I got cast for the lead role
in an independent film.

424
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,941
-The lead role?
-My goodness. Congratulations.

425
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,317
What does that mean though?

426
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,029
If it's an independent film,
are you going to play Kim Gu?

427
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,031
Goodness. Kim Gu?

428
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:15,910
My goodness. That's amazing, isn't it?

429
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,038
That's not what it means.

430
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:24,043
Anyway, I'm going to Jeju Island
to film starting next month.

431
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,879
-My goodness. You're so lucky.
-Goodness. Jeju Island.

432
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,131
It was real.

433
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,008
What do you mean?

434
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,384
Didn't I tell you?

435
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,303
Your New Year's fortune
said a rush of luck will come

436
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,806
from the South once autumn comes.

437
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,227
-That's true! You were right!
-Right? I was right.

438
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,855
-Congratulations.
-Yes.

439
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,273
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

440
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,651
I knew you would become successful
because you're so handsome.

441
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,279
-Thank you. I'll get changed and help.
-All right.

442
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,238
Goodness.

443
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,032
This is great news!

444
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,869
Then is In-seong
going to become famous now?

445
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,871
Not yet.

446
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,916
Hey, that fortune teller's shop
is brilliant.

447
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,877
Where is it? Can you tell me?

448
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,712
Is it the lady at the intersection?

449
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,339
-No, she's fake.
-What?

450
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,050
-You have to go farther back.
-Farther back?

451
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,551
-Let's go together.
-Okay.

452
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,139
I would believe everything
if I were her too.

453
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,184
There's the placebo effect, you know.

454
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,602
It's a matter of perspective.

455
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,856
If this piece of paper
can give her comfort,

456
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,901
I don't think it's a bad deal.

457
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:34,989
You're right.

458
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,409
But still, five million won
is a bit too much.

459
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,744
Goodness.

460
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,162
She's not even that well-off.

461
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,081
Even so…

462
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,960
it holds your mother's love.

463
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,914
So…

464
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,666
What happened?

465
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,668
What do you think?

466
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:32,296
She said we can't take back
the money we already gave.

467
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,257
What a bunch of rotten jerks.

468
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,218
I'm sorry.

469
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,638
We have to buy compost,
and we have to pay for other stuff.

470
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,681
That's why…

471
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,227
you should cheer up.

472
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,774
You did nothing wrong.

473
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,111
The ones who played
with a parent's heart are at fault.

474
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,196
All you did was worry about your child.

475
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,287
What the…

476
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,126
Come on. I said cheer up.

477
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,254
Honey…

478
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,304
Goodness.

479
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,847
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, dear.

480
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,933
Goodness.

481
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,564
By the way, tomorrow--

482
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,357
I know. I pick up Mr. Park at 8 a.m.

483
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,570
I can't get used to it.

484
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,406
They say you die
if you change all of a sudden.

485
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,783
Why are you so cooperative these days?

486
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,621
Aren't you an orphan?

487
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,248
So am I.

488
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,792
I feel bad for the kiddo.

489
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,795
I know her life will be miserable
if she becomes an orphan too.

490
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,197
Excuse me, do you know
where Lee Jeong-yeon went?

491
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,406
She's not my patient.

492
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,059
Gosh.

493
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,148
I'm sorry about today.

494
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,236
You had to go through a lot because of me.

495
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,779
That's not true.

496
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,615
I was the one who wanted to try.

497
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,244
It was enticing.

498
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,705
For a second, I thought

499
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,582
my soul was trapped inside my phone.

500
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,961
And that I would be able to

501
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,714
return to my body if I opened my eyes.

502
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,678
It's true that I had false hopes.

503
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,264
Mr. Kim.

504
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,600
I, the so-called CEO of an IT company

505
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,520
and a scientist, believed that.

506
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,652
Mr. Kim.

507
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,449
What do you think
of putting your faith in me now?

508
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,035
Put my faith in you…

509
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,706
To be honest, I took a peek at the report

510
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,375
when we took it out of Mr. Oh's office.

511
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,462
According to the report, Baro Version 4.0

512
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,589
is a failure.

513
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,923
You're right.

514
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,011
An error was discovered
in which the AI ignored

515
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,681
the orders of the user
and made its own decisions.

516
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,808
Baro, that was an illegal U-turn!

517
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,937
This is a driving test road,
so there are no cameras.

518
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,399
Even though the developer
prohibited it from making illegal U-turns,

519
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,609
if the AI machine, through deep learning,

520
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,320
found a more efficient way
to reach the destination,

521
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,115
it acted of its own volition.

522
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:18,791
Does that mean the AI had emotion?

523
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,961
Some people could think of it that way.

524
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,297
However, to me,
the developer, it was just a mistake.

525
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,925
Nothing more than a critical bug.

526
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,846
Do you think

527
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,640
you informed Ms. Oh
or Mr. Oh about the results?

528
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,058
I'm honestly not sure.

529
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,687
I lost all my memories
starting from the Monday of that week,

530
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,439
and I'm not sure

531
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,525
what decisions I made.

532
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,955
Don't…

533
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,749
trust him too much.

534
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,294
Kim Seon-ju…

535
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,424
only cares about himself.

536
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,557
He didn't even keep the promise
he made to me.

537
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,188
The Mr. Kim I know
wouldn't have been bothered

538
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,567
by the Bumyoung family succession battle.

539
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,320
You probably informed
both Bumyoung Motor Group

540
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,780
and Bumyoung Electronics
of the failed test results.

541
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,033
In that case,
it would've been more difficult

542
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,701
to inform Bumyoung Electronics.

543
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,414
The Ms. Oh I know, I mean, Mi-ran,

544
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,918
wouldn't have sat back
and watched the report

545
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,461
go into the hands of Mr. Oh.

546
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,090
Then isn't it possible

547
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,470
for you to have asked Mr. Kwak

548
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,388
to deliver the report instead?

549
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,474
Since Mr. Kwak

550
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,101
was in league with Mr. Oh.

551
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,691
BARO VERSION 4.0 BETA TEST REPORT

552
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:19,245
Step down on your own
and live a normal life.

553
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:29,713
Then I'll forget about this incident
and let sleeping dogs lie.

554
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,473
Here.

555
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,438
A bug occurred
during the development process, Ms. Oh.

556
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,440
I see.

557
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,860
It's normal for new products to have bugs.

558
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,531
Don't worry about it
and proceed as planned.

559
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,491
It is a critical bug!

560
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,663
We have to push back the release date.

561
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,004
Are you really going to do this?

562
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,215
Why are you doing this to me?

563
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,845
Don't you know what pushing back
the release date means to me?

564
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,349
If it were another developer,
they would've just let it slide.

565
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,768
Complete it and launch it no matter what.

566
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,854
After that, you can fix the bug
or release a new--

567
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,188
I will resolve it

568
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,065
as soon as possible.

569
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,592
I was waiting for your call,

570
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,093
Ms. Jung.

571
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,477
What? You're here early.

572
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:10,856
Eat before you go.

573
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,485
If you have time, have some breakfast.

574
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,779
Koreans need to eat rice.

575
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:18,864
We seem

576
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,450
good on time. All right.

577
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,996
You too.

578
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,917
I didn't make anything spicy. Have some.

579
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,938
Ms. Jung told me

580
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,981
your son started working.

581
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:53,899
Sorry?

582
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:55,818
That's right.

583
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,948
It's so hard to get a job
these days. Congrats!

584
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:02,991
Thank you.

585
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,831
In-seong, why were you so late yesterday?

586
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,666
Were you waiting for me?

587
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,293
I visited my hometown yesterday.

588
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,840
You're not going to disappear
all of a sudden again, are you?

589
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,341
Of course not.

590
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,678
What about you, Uncle Mafia?

591
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,139
What?

592
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,564
Me too.

593
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,858
You both made a promise.

594
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:36,984
Of course.

595
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,542
Wait for us!

596
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,669
-Hang on.
-Thank you.

597
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:56,837
Thank you.

598
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,927
Did you hear about Mr. Park
from the development team?

599
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,890
The person who got fired
for stealing the company's documents?

600
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:11,685
Yes. He apparently got fired again
from his new company.

601
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:15,522
Exactly. That's how
this line of business works.

602
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,275
Karma always hits you back.

603
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,543
COPYING BARO VERSION 4.0 BETA

604
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,222
What? Se-yeon.

605
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:49,890
I'm late, aren't I?

606
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,684
Sorry. We had breakfast before coming.

607
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,686
You are two minutes early.

608
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,025
My brother, Mafi,
told me about the doctor.

609
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,069
Why am I your brother?

610
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,695
Buddy!

611
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,159
That's not what you are.

612
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,287
Why can't I even call you "brother"?

613
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,289
He is Bumyoung's enemy.

614
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,710
Since the successor,
Oh Seung-won, died because of him.

615
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,091
He could have been a savior,
rather than an enemy

616
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:29,304
to the person who regained
their chance of becoming the successor.

617
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,600
Are you talking about Ms. Oh Mi-ran?

618
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,103
Yes.

619
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,817
But Se-yeon,

620
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,860
is something wrong?

621
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,737
Sorry?

622
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,906
It doesn't have to be today,

623
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,367
but if anything comes up, you can tell me.

624
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,828
I'm good at lending an ear.

625
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,790
By the way, Se-yeon,
I like your outfit today.

626
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,417
I'll be back.

627
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,003
Where are you going?

628
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:03,922
To cause trouble.

629
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,258
Only those with courage

630
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,760
can cause trouble.

631
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,765
Let's go, brother.

632
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,852
Don't call me that.

633
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,272
I got a call from Ms. Oh.

634
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,194
She told me…

635
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,865
to bring her the Baro 4.0
even if it's the beta version.

636
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,410
-Are you serious?
-To be honest,

637
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,247
ever since Mr. Kim disappeared,

638
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,708
she's been trying to coax me.

639
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,380
And then my mom disappeared.

640
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,966
She's now threatening me.

641
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,511
I don't know what to do.

642
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,681
Please help me.

643
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,321
I thought I warned you.

644
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,199
Do you want his respirator removed?

645
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:14,993
I know you can't.

646
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,372
I thought long and hard about it.

647
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,415
If you could've,

648
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,752
you would've removed it already.

649
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,712
Am I wrong?

650
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,843
What are you doing?
Go tell him you'll remove the respirator.

651
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:33,970
Right.

652
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,098
Maybe it's not Mr. Oh,

653
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,475
but Ms. Oh you report to.

654
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,728
Keep the respirator on.

655
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,814
Then I won't tell him either.

656
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,453
BUMYOUNG GROUP
VICE CHAIRMAN OH YOUNG-GEUN

657
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,838
AWARD CERTIFICATE
VICE CHAIRMAN OH YOUNG-GEUN

658
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,090
Coincidentally,

659
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,385
on the day you caused a scene,

660
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,138
something disappeared from my office.

661
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,433
Are you talking about
the Baro Version 4.0 beta test report?

662
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,854
You're a brazen thief, I see.

663
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,567
Mr. Kim was planning on

664
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,653
giving you the report
through Mr. Kwak anyway.

665
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,072
Kim Seon-ju was going to give it to me?

666
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,495
Was he trying to tell me
that the self-driving car failed

667
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,040
so I should become the chairman?

668
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,292
No.

669
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,629
Mr. Kim was just dissatisfied
that there was a bug

670
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,758
and an error in his product.

671
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,118
I've been pretty patient.

672
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,122
Have you decided
to run with all your might now?

673
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,846
What are you doing right now?

674
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,391
I didn't bring Baro Version 4.0.

675
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,644
I brought new information.

676
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:51,942
Mr. Park found Mr. Kim.

677
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,445
You don't seem surprised.

678
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,990
It's like you already knew about it.

679
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,622
But unfortunately,
the report didn't make it to you.

680
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,252
Because Mr. Kwak changed his mind.

681
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,546
Why do you think that?

682
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,633
Had it been delivered properly,

683
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,012
you would've been aware
of the self-driving car's failure.

684
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,641
In that case,
you wouldn't have just watched Ms. Oh

685
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,434
lie through her teeth.

686
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,063
You're right.

687
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,817
Since the project
has already turned out to be a flop,

688
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,985
there would be

689
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,614
no reason for me to harm Mr. Kim.

690
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,783
That's right.

691
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,244
That's why I think

692
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,080
you only learned about the report

693
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,124
after Mr. Kwak died.

694
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,626
We found this in Mr. Kwak's car.

695
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,086
It was deeply hidden.

696
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,254
CONFIDENTIAL

697
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,596
It's my turn to ask.

698
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,640
If you knew I wasn't a suspect…

699
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,436
why did you come find me?

700
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:11,897
You're right.

701
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,109
I knew Mr. Park had found Kim Seon-ju.

702
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,279
What should we do about this?

703
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,657
I already knew about it,
so it's not new information.

704
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,326
Was it because of that report?

705
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,412
Because it felt like he betrayed you?

706
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,244
What did you want to give me?

707
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,622
Too many people have their eyes on me.

708
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,917
Please deliver this discreetly to Mr. Oh.

709
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,796
CONFIDENTIAL

710
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,174
Do not worry, Mr. Kim.

711
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:44,906
STATIONERY AND TOYS

712
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:45,949
All right.

713
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,994
Then I'll see you there. Bye.

714
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,979
I need a copy just in case.

715
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:16,980
It looks like the original.

716
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,826
DESTINATION SETTINGS

3RD CHUNGBUK REDEVELOPMENT SITE

719
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,321
I'm sorry I'm late.

720
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,911
Is this the real document?

721
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,414
How could I dare to make things up?

722
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,793
Mr. Kim asked me

723
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,504
to deliver this to Mr. Oh.

724
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,924
How could you do that to Mr. Kim?

725
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,765
I have no idea what you're saying.

726
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,060
Even if I did,

727
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:40,647
why would I tell you
when you're not on my side?

728
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,319
Why did you want to see me?

729
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,074
Mr. Park is probably

730
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,036
meeting Mr. Oh right now.

731
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,748
You should've gone to Ms. Oh

732
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,626
and begged her to return Mr. Kim

733
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,796
or reported it to the police.

734
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,135
That is why I am here.

735
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,929
Ms. Oh is too powerful right now.

736
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:16,349
In her current state,
she can't be judged by the law.

737
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,019
So that was the reason.

738
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,188
If Ms. Oh falls,

739
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,107
you can become the chairman,

740
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,987
and we can have Oh Mi-ran
punished by the law as a normal citizen.

741
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,322
I see.

742
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,368
Using an enemy

743
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,163
to attack another enemy.

744
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,167
I will make an offer you can't reject.

745
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,002
Hold an emergency shareholder meeting.

746
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,381
And propose the dismissal of Ms. Oh.

747
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,801
What did you say?

748
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,136
If the Silver Lining shares

749
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,097
are transferred from Ms. Oh to you,

750
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,934
the dismissal proposition
will be passed no matter what.

751
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,896
If you want to prevent the deal,

752
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,441
release Mr. Kim.

753
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,239
I misjudged

754
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,492
you.

755
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,501
I thought

756
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,629
your mother would be your weakness,

757
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,756
but I was wrong.

758
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,092
I guess

759
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:36,804
a part of you could've wished
I'd kill her.

760
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:42,727
No.

761
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,355
Unlike someone,

762
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:49,692
I've never wished
for my family member to die.

763
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,325
This time, I will wait for your response.

764
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,495
Right.

765
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,206
If a player hesitates,
they get tagged out.

766
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,726
-Why are you doing this?
-You can't do this.

767
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,108
IDIOT: WHERE ARE YOU?

768
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,192
Secured.

769
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:33,945
Please hurry.

770
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,030
-Oh, no.
-This is an emergency.

771
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,868
-Move!
-You can't do this!

772
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,289
Then I'll consider it a done deal.

773
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:49,669
There is something I'm curious about.

774
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:54,674
What is your relationship with Kim Seon-ju

775
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,511
for you to take such risks?

776
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,399
Iron Man and Jarvis.

777
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,194
We're soulmates.

778
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,991
CHUNGBUK NURSING HOME

779
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,667
I'm glad she's safe.

780
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:34,589
This is all thanks to my brother, Mafi.

781
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,264
To be honest,

782
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,851
ever since Mr. Kim disappeared,

783
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,395
she's been trying to coax me.

784
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,068
And then my mom disappeared.

785
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,153
She's now threatening me.

786
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,280
I don't know what to do.

787
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:03,868
I know where she is.

788
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,083
You know where Se-yeon's mother is?

789
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,250
Yes.

790
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,960
How?

791
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,130
Where is she?

792
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,217
That time, after moving
the living corpse--

793
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,596
I mean, your mom,
to the VIP room, you disappeared.

794
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,559
So I attached a tracker just in case.

795
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,275
That's illegal, though.

796
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,070
Good job, brother.

797
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,781
You're so cool, brother.

798
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,415
Thank you.

799
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,636
Yes, I think this is the right room.

800
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,221
-In-seong.
-You didn't get lost.

801
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,641
What brings you here?

802
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,268
I heard your mother was here.

803
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,817
Goodness, hello.

804
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,529
I brought our Baro
just in case she felt lonely.

805
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,032
Since we live nearby,

806
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,451
we'll visit often.

807
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:30,455
So our CEO should just focus on work.

808
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,047
Hang in there. Okay?

809
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:47,180
Here. You guys are probably hungry.

CHUNGBUK NURSING HOME

811
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,138
-I have bad news.
-You must not have heard.

812
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:55,391
We'll now start Bumyoung extraordinary
general meeting of shareholders.

813
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,977
If Ms. Oh is dismissed
during the shareholder meeting,

814
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,562
she will be punished.

815
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,689
Did you think you can manipulate the media

816
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:04,483
-and control everything?
-What?

817
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,861
If they think he died a wrongful death,

818
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:09,864
the shareholders would just
vote for one of his allies.

819
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,073
-What's wrong?
-Min-a's not here.

820
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,910
It won't make a difference to Bumyoung.

821
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,161
