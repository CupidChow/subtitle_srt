00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,283
ALL NAMES, GROUPS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND EVENTS

2
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,160
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,829
You can't get me, can you?

4
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,414
Yes, I can.

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,793
I got you!

6
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,590
Are you alive?

7
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,216
You're not alive.

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,217
Goodness.

9
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,722
-Should we do it one more time?
-Yes!

10
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,099
Okay. Let's do it again.

11
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,895
I think that will be my last time.

12
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,022
Let's go. One more time.

13
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,456
He blew a bubble.

14
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,250
How did you do it?

15
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,378
You look so brutal. Can't you smile?

16
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,062
What is he doing?

17
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,901
What are you doing? Do your teeth hurt?

18
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:02,080
CHUNGBUK NURSING HOME

19
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,355
BASED ON WEBTOON UNLOCK THE BOSS
(UNLOCK MY BOSS) BY PARK SEONG-HYUN

20
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,381
This is a super expensive talisman.

21
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,511
A trivial piece of paper like this

22
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,514
can sometimes

23
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,517
comfort people.

24
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,103
I'll give it to you

25
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,522
because you're special.

26
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,276
Stick it onto your mother's bed.

27
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,993
One day in middle school,

28
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,288
I couldn't fall asleep…

29
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,666
the day before a field trip.

30
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,548
But…

31
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:42,013
I heard my mom sobbing.

32
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,189
I can't imagine…

33
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:58,196
how hopeless and difficult it must've been
for her to raise me on her own.

34
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,618
I'm now old enough to understand.

35
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,916
But I can't even tell her
how thankful I am

36
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,460
that she hasn't…

37
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,130
given up on me,

38
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,716
even until the very end.

39
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,429
It was from that day

40
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,598
that I bit my lip…

41
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,435
and suppressed my feelings of sadness…

42
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,398
so I wouldn't have to…

43
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:39,445
show her that I was struggling.

44
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,830
But after meeting you,
this is what came to mind.

45
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,748
Just like you,

46
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,629
I shouldn't have held back…

47
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,177
and shared more conversations with my mom.

48
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,597
Then maybe

49
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,351
it would've been less lonely
and hard on her.

50
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,813
I'm full of regrets.

51
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,990
Uncle Mafia, will you be late today too?

52
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,705
UNCLE MAFIA

53
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,321
Did you two get into an argument?

54
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:29,949
-Sorry?
-Sorry?

55
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,035
You guys didn't say a word
on the way back.

56
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,787
Nothing happened.

57
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,289
I will be leaving now.

58
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,128
Right. Where will you be staying
from now on, Ms. Jung?

59
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:46,007
Isn't the nursing home too far to commute?

60
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,594
I am not sure yet.

61
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,223
If it's okay with you,
you can stay here with us.

62
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,350
Here?

63
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,896
No. I'm talking about
this house, not the study.

64
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,649
Min-a would love having you here.

65
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,194
All right.

66
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,830
Good night.

67
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,924
Good night.

68
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,224
Good night.

69
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,975
What are you doing?

70
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,813
Earlier…

71
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,273
I'll see you in the morning.

72
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,867
Good night.

73
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,391
You can't fall asleep?

74
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,978
Strangely, yes.

75
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,521
Figures.

76
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,816
You've never gotten this close before.

77
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,733
What…

78
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,027
What do you mean by "close"?

79
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,363
To the two billion won.

80
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,284
Right.

81
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,829
If Ms. Oh is dismissed
during the shareholder meeting,

82
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,332
she will be
formally investigated and punished.

83
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,715
And you can get your body back.

84
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,017
Mr. Park is probably

85
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,270
meeting Mr. Oh right now.

86
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,481
If you want to prevent the deal,

87
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,735
release Mr. Kim.

88
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,035
We'll now start the August 16th, 2022

89
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,829
Bumyoung extraordinary
general meeting of shareholders.

90
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,957
Vice Chairman Oh Young-geun
will be conducting the meeting.

91
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,804
I won't steal everyone's precious time
and get straight to it.

92
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,639
In a prompt manner,

93
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,684
let us vote for the dismissal
of Executive Director Oh Mi-ran.

94
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,118
DISMISSAL OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
OH MI-RAN: AGREE

95
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,718
Mr. Oh, all the shares
have been collected.

96
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,019
I will announce

97
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:14,442
the results of the dismissal
of Executive Director Oh Mi-ran.

98
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,569
Out of a total

99
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:22,825
of 114,638,752 shares,

100
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:30,833
97,685,593 opposed.

101
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,209
As a result,

102
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,045
the dismissal
of Executive Director Oh Mi-ran…

103
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,882
has been rejected.

104
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,443
Did you call for me?

105
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,996
Mr. Park paid me a visit.

106
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,208
He made an interesting offer.

107
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,171
Did he suggest
joining forces to drag me down?

108
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,966
I gave it some thought.

109
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,012
A member of the Bumyoung family

110
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,225
tried to push ahead
with a new product release

111
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,769
even after knowing it was flawed.

112
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,314
If this gets revealed to the world,

113
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,443
will things just end
with you being kicked out?

114
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,737
I…

115
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:47,618
have no interest in sitting
on a throne that has lost its honor.

116
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,253
Sir.

117
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,214
I would like to propose another matter.

118
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,757
Go ahead.

119
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,136
As he failed to properly execute his tasks
as the executive director,

120
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,013
we should take a vote for the dismissal

121
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,724
of Silver Lining's Park In-seong.

122
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,726
-I agree.
-I'll second that.

123
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,478
-I agree.
-I agree.

124
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,355
-I second that.
-I second that.

125
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,405
Breaking news. Less than
three months after the withdrawal

126
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,824
of Kim Seon-ju,
Park In-seong is also dismissed,

127
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,494
putting the reputation
of Silver Lining at risk.

128
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,747
I've been dismissed?

129
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,958
What is all of this?

130
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,713
Isn't Silver Lining your company?

131
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,632
That is true.

132
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,428
However, if Ms. Oh
and Mr. Oh combine their shares,

133
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,430
I can't do anything.

134
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,182
We were duped by them.

135
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,735
That's enough. I can move out on my own.

136
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,411
Why are they rushing things?

137
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,163
Whether Mr. Park is the CEO or not,

138
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,040
it won't make a difference to Bumyoung.

139
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,208
I know, right?

140
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,253
I don't understand why they're
blowing things out of proportion.

141
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,381
Be careful not to break the glass.

142
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,219
Mr. Kim.

143
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,888
You must not have heard.

144
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,850
I've been appointed as the interim CEO.
Director Kim Yong-seol, no.

145
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,519
President Kim at your service.

146
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,625
Ms. Jung, you have to stay.

147
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,338
I know it must be hard but hang in there.

148
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,132
We will find a way to return.

149
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,282
Ms. Oh.

150
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,120
I am sorry to say this,

151
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,456
but Mr. Oh ordered me to look up
tickets to America and housing.

152
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,962
He must be trying
to transfer me to the US branch.

153
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,423
The public has indeed become skeptical

154
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,592
about the self-driving car's release
after the dismissal of Mr. Park.

155
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,556
If you give me the orders,
I will get rid of--

156
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,059
Do you think that would make
the shareholders vote for me?

157
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,729
Everyone would suspect me.

158
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,606
I didn't think that far ahead.

159
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,903
If they think
Oh Young-geun died a wrongful death,

160
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,158
the shareholders would just
vote for one of his allies.

161
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,494
The scariest part of elections
is the sympathy vote.

162
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,210
Do you like baseball?

163
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,545
Pardon?

164
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,630
I do.

165
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,009
It doesn't matter
how long you maintain the lead

166
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,053
as long as you win in the end.

167
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:38,015
Coming back with a walk-off
home run is more exhilarating.

168
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,019
I understand.

169
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,815
However, in order to do that…

170
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,532
Captain No,
what lengths would you go to for me?

171
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,877
2 YEARS AGO

172
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,178
Your superior said
he knew nothing about it.

173
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,389
You embezzled on your own.

174
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,809
WRITTEN STATEMENT BY NO WI-JE
SLEEPING BAG DELIVERY CORRUPTION

175
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,729
It is because of punks like you that
we're stuck using old water canteens.

176
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,651
Impress the statement.
It's for everyone's sake.

177
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,824
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL CHARGES
NO WI-JE

178
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,704
A captain misappropriated
military payments on his own?

179
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,832
That's a bit far-fetched.

180
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,834
Who are you?

181
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,254
You seem to have a sense of loyalty.
I'll give you that.

182
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,967
But you picked
the wrong person to be loyal to.

183
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,426
Who the hell are you?

184
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,891
What do you think

185
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,728
of betting your life on me,
since you were thinking of dying anyway?

186
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,824
Why didn't you wake me up?

187
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,202
You don't think I tried, Mr. Unemployed?

188
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,333
Right. Yes.

189
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,421
Where's Min-a?

190
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,591
She's in her room.

191
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,718
Still?

192
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,722
To tell you the truth,

193
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,850
she's been in low spirits these days.

194
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,934
Why?

195
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,603
Why do you think?

196
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,315
After you got fired,
all the news and YouTube videos are busy

197
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,776
bringing up rumors about Mr. Kim
and his reason for not returning,

198
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,614
saying he has an incurable disease
or that he got remarried overseas.

199
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,159
That little one has eyes and ears too.

200
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,163
Min-a, it's In-seong.

201
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,252
What? Am I "it"?

202
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,882
Where could Min-a be?

203
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,681
What?

204
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,275
What's wrong?
Did something happen to Min-a?

205
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,444
Min-a's not here.

206
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,282
Did you see Min-a today?

207
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,784
What? No, I didn't see her.

208
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,537
Then did something happen yesterday?

209
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,543
She left home this morning.

210
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,009
Hello? Yes.

211
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,471
I'm not switching internet providers.

212
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,235
What do you like the most in this world?

213
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,194
Me?

214
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,946
Choco Pie.

215
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,072
What about you?

216
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,833
How dare you try to steal?

217
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,419
Who taught you this was okay?

218
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,671
That does it. Raise your arms.

219
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,050
Did you think I wouldn't notice
if you just took it?

220
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,594
This won't do. Where is your mom?

221
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,973
How about your dad?

222
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,183
Look at you.

223
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,229
This is why you can tell
when kids grow up without parents.

224
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,481
That does it. You're going to the police--

225
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,277
What did you say?

226
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,238
What did you just say?

227
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,824
What did I do?

228
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,369
Are you her father?

229
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,167
Do you want to ride the seesaw with me?

230
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,466
Are you not going to talk to me?

231
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,139
I have so many questions for you.

232
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,350
I have eight.

233
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,979
That's seven.

234
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,607
What? You just talked.

235
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,151
Are you going to talk to me now?

236
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,074
I have a question too.

237
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,452
What is it?
Ask away. I'll answer everything.

238
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:57,042
What do I have to do
to get taken away by the police?

239
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,130
-What?
-I stole from the store.

240
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,341
Why didn't the police come to get me?

241
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,638
Min-a, good kids
don't go to the police station.

242
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,766
No. I need the police to take me

243
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,228
so that my dad will come and find me.

244
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,940
I don't want to be a good kid.

245
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,235
Dad.

246
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,488
Dad.

247
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,661
I…

248
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,248
miss my dad

249
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,626
so much.

250
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,694
SKY, WIND, STAR, AND POETRY
BY YOON DONG-JU

251
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,034
"Self-portrait."

252
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:18,248
"Skirting the spur of the hill,
I come to a lone well by a paddy

253
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,833
by myself

254
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,711
and stare into the well."

255
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,633
"And there is a man."

256
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,930
"For some reason, I come to
detest the man, so I turn away and leave."

257
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,684
"As I walk away,

258
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,854
I come to pity the man."

259
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,192
"So I go back and stare into the well,

260
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,360
and the man is still there."

261
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,532
"I turn away once again
because I come to detest the man."

262
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,702
"As I walk away,

263
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,581
I come to miss the man."

264
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,718
"Inside the well,
there is the moon, shining bright,

265
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,138
the clouds are fleeting,
the sky is spread out,

266
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,099
a blue wind blows,

267
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,477
and there is autumn."

268
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,981
"The man is also there like a memory."

269
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,295
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

270
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,005
No.

271
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,758
I'm so angry and enraged.

272
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,511
It's disappointing and upsetting.

273
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:00,517
I felt so small today
because I couldn't do anything for Min-a.

274
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,187
Just like then.

275
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,960
What did the doctor say?

276
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,214
I had to face a new life and a death

277
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,550
at the same time.

278
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,807
Am I in critical condition?

279
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,399
Let's…

280
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,443
Let's…

281
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,779
just go back to Korea.

282
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,044
I was always so full of myself,

283
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,339
but there was nothing I could do.

284
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,602
And…

285
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,521
the same thing happened again.

286
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,445
Mr. Kim.

287
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,739
I can't even hug

288
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,949
my own daughter who misses me.

289
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,916
Let her see you.

290
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,127
Let's show her.

291
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,006
Sorry?

292
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,718
We can't keep hiding it from her.

293
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,596
We should help her accept reality…

294
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,556
What?

295
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,185
Should we tell her
that her dad is living inside a phone?

296
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:09,813
Some day,

297
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,608
that could become an option.

298
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,446
Are you keeping your eye on Mr. Park?

299
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,490
I didn't notice anything odd.

300
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,867
Is that so? That's strange.

301
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,414
Generally speaking,
if a person is pushed to the edge,

302
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,625
they're bound to act recklessly.

303
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,340
They become less logical
and more emotional.

304
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,344
Are you saying he'll try
to return to his position?

305
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,889
I don't know.

306
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,057
But…

307
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,311
if you don't know
what your opponent will do,

308
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,482
you can knock him down
before his next move.

309
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:59,487
If Park In-seong gets stigmatized,

310
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,823
whatever he does

311
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,076
and whatever he says

312
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,036
won't hold water with the public.

313
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,169
Gosh, the weather's so nice.

314
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,839
I can't get in touch with Mafi.

315
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,175
Did he not tell you where he'd be?

316
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,844
No. Do you think he left for good?

317
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,555
It wouldn't be weird if he did.

318
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,767
Let's just wait for now.

319
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,561
See you.

320
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,354
If anything happens at work, call me.

321
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,693
-Mr. Park, is it true that you assaulted
-Isn't it an abuse of power

322
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,070
-an employee and were taken to the police?
-to activate sprinklers during a meeting?

323
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,822
-Please say something!
-A response, please!

324
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,408
A professional stated
that you may have anger management issues!

325
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,993
-Excuse me!
-Please say something!

326
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,412
As Park In-seong's true nature
starts to unfold,

327
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,372
some deduce that he harmed Kim Seon-ju

328
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,667
in order to be appointed as the CEO--

329
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,297
It's time to go upstairs.

330
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,175
What does "harm" mean, Mr. Sim?

331
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,014
What is that man saying?

332
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,098
Hold on.

333
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,601
The…

334
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,561
The CEO?

335
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,815
That's not the problem.

336
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,110
They're saying he's a terrible person.

337
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:28,952
Sir!

338
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,246
How did your son become
the CEO of Silver Lining?

339
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,330
Please say something!

340
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,998
-Did he really assault an employee?
-A word, please!

341
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,042
-Please say a word.
-Please say something.

342
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,169
Was Kim Seon-ju aware of everything?

343
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,420
Please say a word!

344
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,048
-Did he assault an employee?
-Ma'am, a word, please.

345
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,553
Ma'am, please say a word!

346
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,888
-Is it true?
-Please say something.

347
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,393
Is it true that you knew about everything?

348
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,771
10 MISSED CALLS FROM MOM

349
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,152
I messed everything up.

350
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,947
It's not your fault.

351
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,658
Seeing how Reporter Ko
was at the forefront,

352
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,077
I'm sure Mr. Oh was behind everything.

353
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,040
Whoever was behind it,
it's true that I did all those deeds.

354
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,503
Ultimately, it was my meddling
and my temper…

355
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,965
that provided a basis for him.

356
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,344
You can see through him.
He knew there was no flaw in the message,

357
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,221
so he flawed the messenger.

358
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,683
He was unsure of our next move,
so he forestalled us.

359
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,771
It was nonsense for a job seeker

360
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,107
to become CEO in the first place…

361
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,150
No.

362
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,736
Now is not the time to blame yourself.
You need a plan.

363
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,950
MS. JUNG

364
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,458
I have bad news.

365
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,919
SILVER LINING PERSONNEL CHANGES
AND APPOINTMENTS

366
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,212
-Maybe we should change jobs.
-We worked so hard.

367
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,840
SILVER LINING RESTRUCTURING PLAN

368
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,259
-Everyone's moving.
-Really?

369
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,767
I now know why
they dismissed you from your position.

370
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,352
Bumyoung Electronics is trying

371
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,938
to steal Silver Lining's
technology and employees.

372
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,613
FOLLOWING THE DISMISSAL OF PARK IN-SEONG…

373
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,407
-It's a department-wide transfer.
-Everyone's moving.

374
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,171
If the technology for Baro Version 4.0
falls into their hands,

375
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,257
they will try to launch it
regardless of the bug.

376
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,930
It's an AI machine
that makes subjective judgments.

377
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,641
Self-driving cars,
refrigerators, induction ranges…

378
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,441
All sorts of accidents
can happen anywhere.

379
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,484
We need to stop them.

380
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,322
But there's no way to do that.

381
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,551
Who the hell are you?

382
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,681
Where did you hide Kim Seon-ju?

383
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,146
So you have guts
because you take after your father.

384
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,690
That is why you always traveled

385
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,693
to the backwoods during your vacations.

386
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,819
Who are you?

387
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,447
How did you know that?

388
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,993
Do you think that's all?

389
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,418
Get up.

390
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,254
I also know you live in a dorm.

391
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,967
And I know your wife's go-to spot.

392
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,102
I'm going to your family right now.

393
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,521
I don't know what I'll do to them.

394
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,317
Don't go.

395
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,612
Please don't go.

396
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,031
I know this. He kept telling me this.

397
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,159
"Until further notice,
you need to keep him alive."

398
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,168
Rather than a large hospital,

399
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,587
somewhere deserted…

400
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,840
Like the hospital where I work.

401
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,636
Look for mental hospitals

402
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,054
or nursing homes in--

403
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,500
-I'll be back soon,
-Okay.

404
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,918
so practice sparring.

405
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,798
What?

406
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,454
What? Who are you?

407
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,842
Please stop and leave.

408
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,159
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

409
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,915
An insider gave a testimony
saying Park went on top of a table

410
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,459
and set off the sprinklers
during a board meeting!

411
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,712
Gosh, this dude is insane.

412
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,505
Isn't it pretty clear?

413
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,591
He obviously set off the sprinklers

414
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,093
because he didn't like
how the meeting was going.

415
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,847
On top of that, in July,
a board member of Silver Lining

416
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,891
committed suicide.

417
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,143
I don't know
if we can call it a coincidence.

418
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,914
You're making sure to eat, right?

419
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,167
I'm on your side no matter what.

420
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,092
Is it true?

421
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,595
Hey, Min-a.

422
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,223
Are you really

423
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,976
a bad person…

424
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,938
The thing is…

425
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,147
…scolder?

426
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,316
What?

427
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,071
What? She is…

428
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,824
You may sit here.

429
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,908
Hold on.

430
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:20,923
Excuse me.

431
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,849
I want to help.

432
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,695
So what you're saying is

433
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,698
when a full-time employee
was treating you unfairly,

434
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:49,577
Mr. Park In-seong used his power
to reprimand him, right?

435
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,661
That's right.

436
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,373
A young man stepped in to help me,

437
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,418
so I was bewildered.

438
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,588
When I listened closely,
I realized he was the CEO.

439
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,675
It felt like I was dreaming.

440
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:09,263
It was probably difficult for you
to reach the decision to speak up.

441
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,266
What made you pluck up your courage?

442
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,354
It was a first.

443
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,483
I was always disrespected as a janitor.

444
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,738
And I thought that was natural.

445
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,949
But he's the first…

446
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,912
who told me that's not true.

447
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,750
The first person who spoke up…

448
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,213
for people like us.

449
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,260
What station is it?

450
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,305
Tell them to take it down
if they want our advertisements.

451
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,307
It is Silver Lining's online channel.

452
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,479
Call Mr. Kim this instant!

453
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,274
I really wanted to say this.

454
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,069
When Mr. Nam Sang-won

455
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,321
-What are you doing?
-mistreated me,

456
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,157
-Mr. Park
-You can't do this.

457
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,285
-stood up for me. He's a good person.
-Hold on. Don't turn it off.

458
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,912
-I'm so grateful.
-Wait.

459
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,580
-Mr. Park…
-What are you doing?

460
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,667
Don't turn it off.

461
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,752
Why did you have to turn this on?

462
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:33,222
I am Silver Lining's interim CEO,
Kim Yong-seol.

463
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:37,518
I also worked under the former CEO,
Mr. Park In-seong.

464
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,396
I too…

465
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:46,402
like this lady, am sitting here
because there's something I need to say.

466
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,075
What do you mean by that?

467
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,496
Mr. Park In-seong

468
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:02,543
proposed a new business model
for Silver Lining's AR glasses,

469
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,879
which were on the verge of collapsing.

470
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,507
As a result, we signed contracts
with 32 countries, and it is highly likely

471
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,470
for the company to exceed a 19.2% profit
gain for the latter half of this year.

472
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,846
Thanks to him,

473
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:19,477
both Silver Lining and
400 subcontractor employees benefitted.

474
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,021
My experience with Mr. Park tells me…

475
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,817
that he's not only a good person,

476
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,654
but he's also a good CEO.

477
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,450
The CEO title suits him
much more than it suits me.

478
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,173
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

479
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,595
I'm so glad.

480
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,806
This time, we received a report

481
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,309
that Mr. Park In-seong
saved someone's life.

482
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,270
A mother and her baby

483
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,980
were bumped into by a passing man,

484
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,942
which caused her to lose her grip
on her stroller on the stairs.

485
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,402
But thanks to Mr. Park In-seong,

486
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,029
the baby was safe.

487
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,531
Park Seon-yeong reports.

488
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,742
On June 23rd, outside exit 2
of Hanguk National University station,

489
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,495
Ms. Yoon was standing there
with her stroller.

490
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,665
After bumping into another person,

491
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,834
the stroller with the baby
tumbled down the stairs.

492
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,795
At that moment,

493
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:31,382
there was a citizen who didn't hesitate
to launch himself toward the stroller.

494
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,843
It turned out to be
Silver Lining's former CEO, Park In-seong.

495
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,722
He left so frantically,

496
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:43,477
so I wasn't able to receive
his contact information or thank him.

497
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,356
But after watching the news lately,
I recognized his face,

498
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,441
and he was Park In-seong.

499
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,235
My entire fortune.

500
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,653
BUY

501
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,196
Let's go.

502
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,032
Yes, let's do this!

503
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,826
BUY

504
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,743
BUY

505
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,661
ORDER CONFIRMATION

506
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,371
BUY

507
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,581
I can do it!

508
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,585
ORDER CONFIRMATION

509
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,961
YOUR ORDER IS COMPLETE

510
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,088
The recent so-called
retail investor movement

511
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,799
of citizens who demand
the reinstatement of Park In-seong

512
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,136
has brought on a buying frenzy
of Silver Lining shares.

513
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,472
-Let's go.
-Okay.

514
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,099
Right. What about our gas?

515
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,767
-I shut it off.
-All right.

516
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,852
The personal seal?

517
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,147
The personal seal? Right.

518
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,735
We're going to be late
on our way to Seoul.

519
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,321
Gosh.

520
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,281
Why would we go to Seoul?

521
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,949
We can just go to the town bank.

522
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,994
What are you talking about?
We need to go to Silver Lining.

523
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,330
You need to go to the bank to buy stocks.

524
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,166
What? You need to go
to the company of the stocks.

525
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,127
Please. You don't even know your stuff.
Quit insisting.

526
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,713
-But I'm right!
-Give me a break.

527
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,008
-Want to bet?
-Why would we make a bet? A bet?

528
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,724
Baro, where do you go to buy stocks?

529
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,684
Yes. Stocks…

530
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,269
Yes?

531
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,272
…can be bought at home with your phone.

532
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,941
-Really?
-Really?

533
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:17,863
I thought

534
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,741
I had lived a successful life.

535
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,159
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT
KIM SEON-JU

536
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,411
But when I was in danger,

537
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,747
there was no one beside me
whom I could trust.

538
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,582
Whereas,

539
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,294
the people around you
willingly stepped up to help you.

540
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,880
Your meddling

541
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,465
and your temper

542
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,760
are returning everything
to its rightful place.

543
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,064
Hey, Se-yeon.

544
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,858
There you were.
There's going to be a board meeting.

545
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,612
They are going to revisit your dismissal.

546
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,280
Mr. Park,

547
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,784
you may not satisfy
my conditions of an ideal CEO.

548
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,619
However,

549
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,498
it's true that you are
the CEO that people want.

550
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,054
Why did you do that?

551
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,765
Why did you meddle in a situation

552
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,852
that was already sorted out
and have to ruin things like his?

553
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,438
I will handle it.

554
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,318
Did you think you could
manipulate the media

555
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,654
and control everything?

556
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,782
That tactic is so old.

557
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,285
We're living in a generation
of personal media.

558
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,703
You've lost your touch.

559
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,122
What?

560
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,625
It has already caused a stir
among the board members.

561
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,336
Just be patient.

562
00:45:57,045 --> 00:46:00,549
People are like dogs and pigs.

563
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:04,428
We can't rest assured
because they are like dogs and pigs.

564
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,639
They react emotionally, not logically.

565
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,809
People are just following the hype

566
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:14,313
and chewing out Bumyoung
for firing Park In-seong.

567
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,860
A job seeker goes back to being a CEO.

568
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,778
You achieved your dream.

569
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,533
I told you,

570
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,369
my dream was to become an actor.

571
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,287
Right.

572
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,416
Then,

573
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,586
can I ask why you gave that up?

574
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,838
I didn't give it up.

575
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,966
I'm just refraining from pursuing it.

576
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,678
Hopefully, time will sort things out.

577
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,313
Whenever I mentioned my mom,

578
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:01,610
I always received unwanted consolation.

579
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,158
Do you know what I heard the most?

580
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,080
"Time heals everything."

581
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,166
But…

582
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,961
it's half right and half wrong.

583
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,674
Time doesn't heal anything for you.

584
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,677
It's just during that time,

585
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,765
you learn how to endure
and deal with the pain…

586
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,060
until you get used to it.

587
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,732
Se-yeon.

588
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,318
I hope your dream

589
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,571
doesn't become dull.

590
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:50,951
At our age, we can be anything
except for a child actor.

591
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,249
Cheers.

592

ROYCE ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHOANALYSIS

00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,017
-Hey, you started it.
-Why, you…

594
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,936
-Hey, drag him away!
-Wait.

595
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,521
-Hit me.
-Seriously.

ROYCE ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHOANALYSIS

00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,608
It's an emergency.

598
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,653
A man is taking away
the patient you brought.

599
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:36,950
What?

600
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,411
What are you doing?

601
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,121
What in the world?

602
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,706
Help!

603
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,666
What's wrong with you?

604
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,752
Oh, no! He's taking him away!

605
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,068

606
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,494
Please leave--

MS. JUNG 50 MILLION

608
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,967
The person you are trying…

609
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,846
KIDDO'S HOUSE

610
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,603
Hello?

611
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,521
It's me.

612
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,231
Tell Park In-seong
that I found Kim Seon-ju.

613
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,607
You found Mr. Kim?

614
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,401
I'll see him at the gym.

615
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,903
What do you mean
about Mr. Kim and the gym?

616
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,530
He'll know if you say "the gym"!

617
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,290
Hello?

618
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,502
Gosh. He doesn't listen to others.

619
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,005
How can he be so rude? Gosh.

620
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,924
Therefore, Mr. Park In-seong

621
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,303
has been reappointed
as the CEO of Silver Lining.

622
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,239
MR. PARK IN-SEONG HAS THE BEST CHARACTER

623
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,246
THANK YOU, MR. PARK

624
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,165
Hyeon-ho.

625
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,382
Hyeon-ho.

626
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,260
Welcome back.

627
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,221
It is an honor to work with you again.

628
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,975
Where is Kim Seon-ju?

629
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,575
-Park In-seong!
-Park In-seong!

630

TRASH (3 MISSED CALLS)

631
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:54,656
MS. JUNG

632
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,492
Hello?

633
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,369
He found Mr. Kim!

634
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:29,482
Why did you go to such great lengths to--

635
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,461
The information leaked.

636
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,449
Hey…

637
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,284
Hey…

638
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,838
CHOCO PIE

639
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,173
No.

640
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,893
Mafi texted me
that the information was leaked.

641
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,895
The worst-case scenario comes after that.

642
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,063
Rumors of the disappearance…

643
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:32,980
It's a relief.

644
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,817
A gift. I drew it during art class.

645
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,278
Ms. Oh, you know me well?

646
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,905
I will take full responsibility.

647
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:43,533
I possess a lot. What about you, Mr. Park?

648
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,702
Baro Version 4.0 is complete.

649
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,205
-What about Baro Version 4.0?
-I'll give it to you, Ms. Oh.

650
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,082
So return Kim Seon-ju.

651
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,166
My entire life,

652
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:56,212
I have never allowed anything
that belonged to me to be taken away.

653
01:01:56,295 --> 01:02:00,049
