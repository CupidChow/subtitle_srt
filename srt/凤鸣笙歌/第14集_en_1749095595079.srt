1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,580
In the Camp of

2
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,580
I'm afraid of the future.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,580
I'm afraid of the future.

21
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,580
I'm not afraid of the future.

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,580
Why do you come today?

23
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,580
No matter what the future is.

24
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,580
I only need to depend on the more preliminary discussion.

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
Don't talk about personal circumstances.

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,580
Start something Paint the moment.

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,580
I'm afraid of the future.

28
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,580
I'm not afraid of the future,

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,580
you originally asked thełaida for aリen.

30
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:19,580
Who will follow me in the wind and rain?

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,580
You said that love is like a dream, a white flower in my life.

32
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,580
People stay in the sky.

33
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,580
The wind is like a rain, the wind is like a dream, not in the world.

34
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,580
You said that the wind moves, the light is hard, the people are helpless.

35
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,580
The moon is finally in the sky.

36
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:50,580
The true love is endless, why do we have to enjoy it?

37
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,580
Among you, I am a multi-faceted person.

38
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,580
Little Sister, how can you be a multi-faceted person?

39
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,580
Hao Xuan, I still have many things that I haven't seen clearly.

40
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:20,580
I may only be able to see you.

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,580
Promise me that you will live happily.

42
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,580
Hao Xuan.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,580
Hao Xuan.

44
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,580
Hao Xuan.

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,080
Hao Xuan.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,580
Hao Xuan. Hao Xuan. Hao Xuan.

47
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,100
Do as you're said.

48
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,980
Good night, Su Mei.

49
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,780
Yun.

50
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,860
When you read this letter,

51
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,860
I'm no longer here.

52
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,860
I'm lucky to have met you.

53
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,860
So I can have dignity and live on proud.

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,860
Ever since I had you,

55
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,860
the world has become so beautiful.

56
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,860
We float together, we wander together.

57
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,860
In the age,

58
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,860
everything is the sweetness of dignity.

59
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,860
Actually, I've always wanted to tell you,

60
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,860
I'm also in the school.

61
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,860
But compared to you,

62
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,860
I've already gone through countless times.

63
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,860
I'm so lonely, I'm in the air.

64
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,860
Sir, hello.

65
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,860
I haven't eaten for a long time.

66
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,860
Do you want to eat sugar and mud?

67
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,860
If you want to eat sugar and mud,

68
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,860
you have to rely on your own hands.

69
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,860
And not others' eyes.

70
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,860
You can only look down on others.

71
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,860
I don't want to live like this.

72
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Can I be your slave?

73
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
Sihao, you're not you.

74
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,860
Please give me a chance to change my fate.

75
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,860
What's your name?

76
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
Where did you come from?

77
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,860
I came from the cold place of Man City Ice School.

78
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,860
Then you're called cold-blooded.

79
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
Okay?

80
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
I'm here.

81
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,860
I found out

82
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,860
the way to solve the Ghost Face curse.

83
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,860
It's to follow his instructions

84
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
and enter the patrol.

85
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,860
Then you'll be killed a thousand times.

86
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,860
But the patrol itself

87
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,860
will cause a rebellion to your body.

88
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,860
Until now,

89
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,860
I can only say sorry.

90
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,860
But everything is because of that day.

91
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,860
This cold-blooded man is the most suitable for him.

92
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,860
He will definitely like him.

93
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,860
He hopes that he can understand my feelings.

94
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,860
Who's calling me?

95
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,860
I think this is your friend.

96
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,140
Before I yet dust us off,

97
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,640
it's a bad thing that I think you're more dead than dead.

98
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,820
There's no more behind

99
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,860
or behind.

100
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
See.

101
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,060
You don't need you.

102
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,460
You are just as much as you are in her eyes.

103
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,860
Who are you?

104
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,860
Do you want to make your lover fall in love?

105
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,660
This mask is the most common.

106
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
As long as you wear it,

107
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,860
it will be a great charm for you.

108
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,060
All the men in the world

109
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,860
will be treated for you.

110
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,660
I don't believe you.

111
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,660
Then please return the mask to me.

112
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,860
But you have to remember,

113
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,860
if you miss this chance,

114
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,860
your fate will be changed.

115
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,860
What a good girl.

116
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,860
If my sister is like you,

117
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
how good would it be?

118
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,860
No.

120
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,860
What are you doing to me?

121
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,860
From now on,

122
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,860
you are the one who killed the ghost.

123
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,860
She is your master.

124
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,460
If you dare to be disobeyed by her,

125
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,460
you will be killed by the evil spirit.

126
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,860
You are a good girl.

127
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,860
Maybe she is the one who killed the ghost.

128
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,260
I didn't expect the ghost would kill me.

129
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,860
I refused you many times.

130
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,860
I was so heartless.

131
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,460
Then I found out that

132
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,860
you are not clear about it.

133
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,860
You don't have me in your heart.

134
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,860
No.

135
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,860
We are the best friends.

136
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
Come on.

137
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,860
So I sealed your memories with a book.

138
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,860
You may forget me.

139
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,860
Maybe this is the best choice.

140
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
Xuan.

141
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,260
Why are you so stupid?

142
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
If it's not you,

143
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
Ao Xue won't die.

144
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
Miss Lu won't leave me.

145
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,260
You don't know what love is.

146
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,260
It's you.

147
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,260
I don't understand.

148
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Stop it. Stop it.

149
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,260
It's a big stone.

150
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
What else can it be?

151
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,260
Miss Lu's body is missing.

152
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
He only laughs at me.

153
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
I only wish to jump.

154
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
I can't laugh.

155
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,260
I can't hold back the sweet sweet.

156
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,260
I'm so mad.

157
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,260
I can't stop.

158
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
In the future, this is a dream.

159
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,260
It's a dream.

160
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,260
It's so great.

161
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,260
I only want the good.

162
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
He only asks me to kiss.

163
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
I'll hug you.

164
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
I'll make you mad.

165
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
He only laughs at me.

166
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,260
I only wish to jump.

167
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
I can't laugh.

168
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,260
I can't hold back the sweet sweet.

169
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,260
I'm so mad.

170
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,260
I can't hold back the sweet.

171
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
I only want the good.

172
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,260
He only asks me to kiss.

173
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,260
I'll hug you.

174
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,260
I'll make you mad.

175
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260
He only laughs at me.

176
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
I only wish to jump.

177
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,260
I can't hold back the sweet.

178
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,260
I'm so mad.

179
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,260
I can't hold back the sweet.

180
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260
I'm so mad.

181
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,260
I can't hold back the sweet.

182
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,260
I'm so mad.

183
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,260
I can't hold back the sweet.

184
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,260
I'm so mad.

185
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,260
I can't hold back the sweet.

186
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
