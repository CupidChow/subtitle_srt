He is very innocent

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,520
When looking through it

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,400
he is indeed really innocent

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,680
He remembered

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,280
I'm my brother

11
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,560
I was upset

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,280
8cm

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:22,780
Basically

00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,240
I just want to change my mind

15
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,080

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,640
I'm afraid I'll be late.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,840
I'll go to the hotel.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,040
I'll go to the hotel.

00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
I'll go to the hotel.

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
I'll go to the hotel.

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
I'll go to the hotel.

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
I'll go to the hotel.

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
I'll go to the hotel.

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
I'll go to the hotel.

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
I'll go to the hotel.

41
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
I'll go to the hotel.

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
I'll go to the hotel.

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
I'll go to the hotel.

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:02:05,240
Lieutenant,

00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,940
She are un Dun.

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,040
I'm her brother character.

47
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,040
I can only be her brother.

48
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
I'm not as bad as Fengqing.

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Yanshan, you're not popular anymore.

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,040
And Miss Leng is dead.

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Miss Lu has no reason to be in the lead.

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Just wait for your next step.

53
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Don't say that.

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Look at Brother Yanzi.

55
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
He must be suffering from a bad fever.

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Fine. You can drink.

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,040
But remember to drink and be careful.

58
00:02:40,040 --> 00:03:09,860
Xiaoyang, let's go to the

59
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,040
I found out that you look at the surface.

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Actually, you're a little blind.

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,040
You're a little blind?

62
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,040
No matter what happened before, it's all over.

63
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
You're my best friend.

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
I don't want to lose you again.

65
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
I'm not that kind of person.

66
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,040
What? You want me to wash your feet?

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,040
That's not bad.

68
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,040
You're so good at thinking.

69
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Now the situation is so complicated.

70
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
We have to fight together.

71
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,040
We'll find Leng Aoxue, Lu Yingsheng and Guimie.

72
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Can we find them?

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
How can we know?

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Let's go.

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
What?

76
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Go find the murderer.

77
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Let's go.

78
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
I haven't washed my feet yet.

79
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,040
There's a new one.

80
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:20,680
Officer

81
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Do you think the murderer hiding here?

82
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Before, one time when I went for the key sin

83
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Lu Yingsheng would take me here deliberately

84
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
andsize the surface.

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,040
I suspect he just wants to try something.

86
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Don't look at me. I don't understand.

87
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Young people, you're so bold.

88
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Do you dare to buy a ghost mask?

89
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Old woman, why didn't those people who danced today come?

90
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Don't be afraid.

91
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Old woman, he's a good man.

92
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
I've seen him many times.

93
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Where's he?

94
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,040
How about we leave? We'll find him next time.

95
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Let's go.

96
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
Let's go. You go first.

97
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
You go first.

98
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Come, have some tea.

99
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
That's almost interesting.

100
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Qingquan, remember to clean up the roof over there.

101
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
And over there.

102
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
It's delicious.

103
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Try this.

104
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
How is it? Is it delicious?

105
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
I'm back.

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Sister.

107
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Miss Lu, where have you been these days?

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Where have you been?

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Why are you back, sister?

110
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Why are you scolding them?

111
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Brother, it's not the right time to die.

112
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,040
These days, I was invited by a noble lady again.

113
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
I can't help it.

114
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,040
I'm not a good girl.

115
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,040
There are too many people looking for me.

116
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Lang Aoxue.

117
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Who are you?

118
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Miss Lu, do you know Lang Aoxue?

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Who is he?

120
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
I don't know him.

121
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Miss Lu, we trust you so much.

122
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
We treat you as friends.

123
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,040
If you have a secret,

124
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
we hope you can tell us.

125
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
What are you talking about?

126
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
I don't understand.

127
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Sister, let's talk.

128
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Well, they look alike.

129
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,040
But they are different.

130
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
I believe Miss Lu won't lie.

131
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Yue'er.

132
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
You're back.

133
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
I can't come back.

134
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
You're so sick.

135
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Go to the bathroom when you're back.

136
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Hurry up.

137
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Sister, I'm sorry.

138
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Go to the bathroom.

139
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Go.

140
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Let's go.

141
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Have a good rest.

142
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
What's wrong with them?

143
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
They are weird.

144
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Who is that Lang Aoxue?

145
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
How would I know?

146
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Go. Go to work.

147
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Why are you laughing?

148
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
I'm not laughing.

149
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
I'm not laughing.
