00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,120
Why did you get away from me?

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,700
I can't.

I almost forgot.

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
So this is the source of all the things.

43
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
If that's the case,

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
we'll go and tell the doctor.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
I heard it.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Brother.

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
You've mistaken the word love.

48
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Ying'er.

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
My Ying'er.

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Qiuying is my only sister in my life.

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
And my only sister.

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
We grew up together.

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
I hope she can be polite and polite.

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
She can be kind and polite.

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
I hope she can practice with me since childhood.

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
But I didn't expect

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I'd still hurt her.

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Since the truth is out,

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
you should be the one to blame.

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Brother.

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
We'll avenge Qiuying.

62
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
No matter what happens,

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
we must kill her.

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
We'll avenge Qiuying.

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Kid.

66
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
I killed your mother.

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
And I sent someone to kill you.

68
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
I'll kill you.

69
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
You go ahead.

70
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
If my mother is alive,

71
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
she must want me to be a happy person.

72
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
I forgive you.

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
That's all.

74
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
You're just a little bit more mature.

75
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
You're just a little bit more mature.

76
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Brother.

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
You're so naughty.

78
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Mr. Feng

79
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
must not like me.

80
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
He likes me.

81
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I've been through so much.

82
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I really don't feel like thinking about you.

83
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Since that's the case,

84
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
let's meet in Jianghu.

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Take care.

86
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
We'll see each other again.

87
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Let's go.

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Yu.

89
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
It's over.

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Are you really willing to give up this relationship?

91
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Mr. Feng.

92
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
If you really like Miss Lu,

93
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
then go after her.

94
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Don't always be too upset with the one in your heart.

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Miss Lu is very nice.

96
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
She is your potential.

97
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
She is also the one who helps you find love.

98
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I'm willing to give up the relationship.

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
I have my own reasons.

100
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Feng Qingyuan.

101
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
I've been through so much.

102
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I'm really tired.

103
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I need to rest for a while.

104
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
What do you mean?

105
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Are you going to leave me too?

106
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Just be your Feng Qingyu.

107
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
From now on, you'll never have Gu Xiaoyun.

108
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
No one will say that you're a good girl.

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Gu Xiaoyun.

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Thank you.

111
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Feng Qingyuan.

112
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Goodbye.

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Master.

114
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Come here.

115
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Come here.

116
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Have some shrimp.

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Is it good?

118
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Master, have some.

119
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Have some shrimp.

120
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Here.

121
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Look.

122
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I see it.

123
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Come, madam.

124
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Have a drink with me.

125
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Cheers.

126
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Tianyue.

127
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Mother.

128
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Aiyu.

129
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Mother.

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Mother.

131
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Mother, what's wrong?

132
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
You brat.

133
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
You still hope your mother dies early, right?

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
You sleep so long.

135
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
You keep talking about dreams.

136
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
What have you dreamed of?

137
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Right.

138
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I can't even call you that.

139
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
How can I?

140
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
What have you dreamed of?

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
What?

142
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Who's dreaming?

143
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Why are you still sitting here?

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
The girl who's close to you

145
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
has been waiting for you in the city.

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Hurry up.

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
I heard that girl

150
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
is a beautiful girl.

151
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Everyone will see her

152
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
in her golden age.

153
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Aiyu, hurry up.

154
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Master, you should hurry up.

155
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Don't miss this opportunity.

156
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800

Hello, I am Luo Y

199
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
is it

200
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Is it really just a dream?

201
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Maybe.

202
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Do you remember what happened to us?

203
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Say something.

204
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Do you remember it?

205
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Mr. Feng,

206
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
I really don't understand what you said.

207
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Maybe it's really a dream.

208
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I just didn't expect

209
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
you were the one who fell in love with me.

210
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Do you say that to every girl?

211
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Of course not.

212
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I'm quite satisfied with you.

213
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
I agree with this marriage.

214
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I have no problem with that.

215
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
But I have something to tell you.

216
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
I've been in a problem since I was a child.

217
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Will it turn into another person?

218
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
He's different from me.

219
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
He will do something wrong.

220
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
You have to be careful.

221
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
It turns out that

222
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
we are the same kind of people.

223
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I used to have this kind of trouble.

224
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,800
But now, everything is over.

225
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
It's late.

226
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I'll treat you to dinner.
