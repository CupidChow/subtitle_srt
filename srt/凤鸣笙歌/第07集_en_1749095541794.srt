Episode 30

3
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,500
Mr. Ye, look.

4
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
You're handsome and rich.

5
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Give me some water.

6
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
I admit that I'm handsome and rich.

7
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
But this is not the reason why you're not so innocent.

8
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Fine. I won't say it later.

9
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Master.

10
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Xiao Yanzi.

11
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
You're all here.

12
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
So it's Master.

13
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
What's the wind that brought you here?

14
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Please come inside.

15
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Wind.

16
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Wind.

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Wind.

18
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
You're so sweet.

19
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
What's that?

20
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
What do you mean?

21
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Didn't you say that you don't beat the school-lovers?

22
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Why? You're not satisfied?

23
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
You didn't pay me for so much.

24
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Look.

25
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
You're so kind.

26
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I'm happy to...

27
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Master.

28
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
They're very capable.

29
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
They can be eight hours.

30
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
What did I do?

31
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
I've seen such a black spot.

32
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
As a person, you must have your identity and position.

33
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
You can do whatever you want.

34
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
You can earn it.

35
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
You should close the door.

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Why?

37
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Is there someone who wants to kill you?

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Who is it?

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
No one wants to kill me.

40
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm fine.

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Stop.

42
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
You made such a happy decision.

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Decided.

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Confident.

45
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Dad.

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Dad.

47
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
I...

48
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,500
I'm so happy.

49
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I like you.

50
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
You're so pure.

51
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
A bunch of crazy people.

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Thank you, dad.

53
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Yu,

54
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
this is the last base in Patagonia.

55
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Right where did the knife come from?

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
He's a professional killer.

57
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
How could he come to the military department to buy knives?

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Boss.

59
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Boss.

60
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Boss, have you ever lost such a long knife?

61
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
I know.

62
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I really lost a knife.

63
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
It's a dagger that's as sharp as a knife.

64
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
A dagger?

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Do you know what it looks like?

66
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,500
It looks like it has a ghost face mask.

67
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Ghost face mask?

68
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Yes.

69
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Then?

70
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
I don't know about the rest.

71
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Boss.

72
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Sister.

73
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Sister.

74
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
It's not good for us to do this.

75
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Why are you so stupid?

76
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
How much money did we earn from Aunt Xin?

77
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
It's just that we didn't get the part back.

78
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
But this is...

79
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Don't be so anxious to fight with your mother.

80
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,500
You must hide the antidote here.

81
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Sister, you're also...

82
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Hi.

83
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
You are...

84
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Miss Lu, we...

85
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
We're cleaning up.

86
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,500
You two are so fast and early.

87
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Is this the tradition of our family?

88
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
I'm happy to work.

89
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Miss Lu, you're also early.

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
I also want to get up early to work.

91
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
I'm happy to work.

92
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Isn't it?

93
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Miss Lu, you're so generous.

94
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Please forgive us.

95
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
We're so poor.

96
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
We're only getting off work.

97
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Please forgive us, Miss Lu.

98
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Come on.

99
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Come on.

100
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Miss Lu.

101
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
It's all my own idea.

102
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
If you want to blame me, blame me.

103
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
I didn't see anything.

104
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Miss Lu, this is not good.

105
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
You two are so hardworking.

106
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
You should be the one to get this.

107
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
How is it?

108
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Did you find any clues?

109
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
It's not all my fault.

110
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
At least I know the chest of the Ghost Face.

111
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
It's in the Iron River.

112
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
What are you going to do next?

113
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Fang Qingyu.

114
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
What?

115
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
You're Fang Qingyu?

116
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
You're quite similar.

117
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
You're just a little bit fatter.

118
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Come with me to the capital.

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Yes.

120
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Why?

121
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
What are you doing?

122
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
What are you doing?

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
What are you doing?

124
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Young Master, wait.

125
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Wait.

126
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Give me the antidote.

127
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
You're still thinking about your antidote?

128
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I'm telling you.

129
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
If I get caught,

130
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
don't want your antidote.

131
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Don't.

132
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Move aside.

133
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Move aside.

134
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Let's go.

135
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Young Master Fang.

136
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Young Master Fang.

137
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Young Master.

138
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Young Master.

139
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Miss Lu, are you okay?

140
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
My stomach hurts.

141
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,500
I must have a stomachache.

142
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
I need to go to the hair salon.

143
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Yu is doing something different.

144
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Xiaoya, do you have the antidote?

145
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Young Master is a drug addict.

146
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Where's the antidote?

147
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Stop talking.

148
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm going to find Fang Qingyu.

149
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Miss Lu,

150
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
are you going to the hair salon?

151
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
No.

152
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
I just have a look.

153
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
I'm migration.

154
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
How can I go there?

155
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Of course!

156
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Right?

157
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Well...

158
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
You're still thinking about the antidote

159
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
station alone?

160
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,460
I'm telling you.

161
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm just a man of my word.

162
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,660
I have nothing to say.

163
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,180
You dare to act like a man of your word.

164
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,540
You're a man of your word.

165
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,660
You're a man of your word.

166
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,140
You're a man of your word.

167
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,340
You're a man of your word.

168
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,460
Who said that?

169
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,140
My lord,

170
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,580
A Yu is not like this.

171
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,740
It must be a misunderstanding.

172
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,500
Misunderstanding?

173
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,700
Take the witness here.

174
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,340
Take the witness here.

175
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,940
My lord.

176
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,820
I問題 you.

177
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,220
You're so smart.

178
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,460
You know me very well.

179
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,260
What a big-headed man.

180
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,980
Go ahead.

181
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,620
He's here.

182
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,340
Leave him alone.

183
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,860
But they don't like you.

184
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,140
I take me for them.

185
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,700
To the Shadow Kingdom.

186
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,500
When you say that,

187
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,460
I'll kill you.

188
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,300
Theiblers are looking at me.

189
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,940
The hobos.

190
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,220
Everyone is looking at me like this.

191
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,340
Did you take my word?

192
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,340
I'm a cow, a horse, a man.

193
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,340
I'm the one who's doing the hardest work.

194
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,340
I eat the least amount of rice.

195
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,340
I eat grass.

196
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,340
The grass is milk.

197
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,340
Boss,

198
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,340
I'm not going to give you the salary.

199
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Boss,

200
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
I'm so beautiful.

201
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,340
I'm not blind.

202
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,340
What's so beautiful about you?

203
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
It's worth my greed.

204
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,340
You're lucky.

205
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,340
You're so beautiful.

206
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,340
Sir,

207
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,340
please help me.

208
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Sir.

209
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,340
Put the wind and rain down.

210
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Go into the dungeon.

211
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
Yes.

212
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,340
Sir.

213
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
Sir.

214
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Sir.

215
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Sir,

216
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,340
the land is obviously in the lake.

217
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,340
We've never been angry with them.

218
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
Please investigate.

219
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,340
Sir.

220
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
Investigate.

221
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Please investigate.

222
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,340
Investigate.

223
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Sir.

224
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Why are you here?

225
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,340
My name is Qingquan.

226
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
My brother is my sister.

227
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
I have something to say.

228
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,340
Say it.

229
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,340
I can prove that

230
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,340
Mr. Feng and his sister

231
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,340
are very caring to us.

232
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,340
My sister.

233
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
She's stealing things from Fengming.

234
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Her face is covered with water.

235
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,340
She's a little sister.

236
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
What are you talking about?

237
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,340
I said why are you missing so much?

238
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,340
I don't know why you're so sad lately.

239
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
Sister,

240
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
you're a good person.

241
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,340
Qingquan wants to be like

242
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,340
the two young masters and Miss Lu.

243
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,340
What do you know?

244
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
When we were in Wenyi Village,

245
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,340
if it weren't for me,

246
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,340
you would have died long ago.

247
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,340
You don't know how to be a good person.

248
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,340
Qingquan doesn't know.

249
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,340
But Qingquan is worth it.

250
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,340
You should be honest with him.

251
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,340
Look.

252
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
He's a real man.

253
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Be honest with him?

254
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
I'm telling you.

255
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,340
In front of me,

256
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,340
these things are all nonsense.

257
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Eight years ago,

258
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
I was a fool

259
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
who came out of a countryside.

260
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,340
I'm also a member of the Chengxian Army.

261
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
But who can look down on me?

262
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,340
Look at the city.

263
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,340
You are all so noble.

264
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
Who's in the back?

265
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,340
I'm the one who's in the bed.

266
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
I...

267
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,340
As long as I have money,

268
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,340
I'll be your grandmothers.

269
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,340
No one will dare to look down on us.

270
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
Your Majesty,

271
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,340
money can't be used for everything.

272
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,340
The money I brought you

273
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,340
is only for the prosperity and the prosperity.

274
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,340
Good.

275
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Since the case is settled,

276
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
I'll take the blame.

277
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,340
I have to take the blame.

278
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,340
You're a fool.

279
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,340
Be honest with him.

280
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,340
Guards.

281
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,340
Take him down.

282
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Tell him the truth.

283
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,340
Yes.

284
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,340
Are you satisfied?

285
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,340
Sister.

286
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Sister.

287
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,340
Sister.

288
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,340
Are you satisfied?

289
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,340
Feng Qingyu is innocent.

290
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,340
That's great.

291
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,340
That's great.

292
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,340
I said I was innocent.

293
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

294
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

295
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,340
Su Ma.

296
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,340
Qingquan.

297
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,340
Don't put it in your heart.

298
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,340
Just do it here.

299
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
It's your sister's problem.

300
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,340
It has nothing to do with you.

301
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Thank you, boss.

302
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,340
It's okay.

303
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,340
You're back.

304
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,340
Xiaoya, are you okay?

305
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
Why don't you care about me?

306
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
You're so lively and naughty.

307
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
Can you be okay?

308
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
I...

309
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,340
Feng Ming is in a hurry.

310
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,340
You've regained your innocence.

311
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,340
But you're still a little bit more innocent.

312
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,340
You're still a little bit more innocent.

313
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,340
But it must still have an effect on our hotel business.

314
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,340
It's okay.

315
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,340
I'm thinking about it all in my head.

316
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,340
Some people are the crew of the private business.

317
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
They're just a few people.

318
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
Don't look down on them.

319
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,340
I'm going to make a hot pot with water on it.

320
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,340
Hot pot with water?

321
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,340
Hot pot with water?

322
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,340
How can I do that?

323
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,340
You're so generous.

324
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,340
You don't even care about the moon in the sky.

325
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Please remove my poison first.

326
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,340
No, I can't do that.

327
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340
You're so unreasonable.

328
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,340
No, I mean,

329
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,340
can you find me again if you want to detoxify your poison?

330
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,340
I really can't do that in the night.

331
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,340
What the hell is he doing?

332
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
What the hell is he doing?

333
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,340
Miss Lu is so smart.

334
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,340
She should understand A-Yu's intentions.

335
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,340
Miss Lu, you're so beautiful even in a white eye.

336
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,340
Brother, I'm so lucky.

337
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,340
What the hell is this?

338
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,340
It's done.

339
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,340
That's it?

340
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
What?

341
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,340
It's done.

342
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Oh my god.

343
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,340
They're so scary.

344
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,340
How is it?

345
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,340
Hot pot with water on it

346
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,340
doesn't need to be on it.

347
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
Look at A-Yu.

348
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,340
A-Yu, your talent is so much better than the mountain.

349
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,340
Much better than the water.

350
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,340
Okay.

351
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,340
Okay.

352
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,340
My sister is right.

353
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,340
You're so smart.

354
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,340
You're so lucky.

355
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,340
What do you think?

356
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,340
It's good.

357
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,340
What's wrong?

358
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
Brother Yezi.

359
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,340
You're so fast.

360
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,340
Come on.

361
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,340
Thank you.

362
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,340
Come on.

363
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,340
Come on.

364
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
Come on.

365
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,340
Come on.

366
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,340
Come on.

367
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Come on.

368
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,340
Your dish.

369
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
25.

370
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,340
Sir, your dish.

371
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,340
We need to make a count.

372
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,340
15.

373
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
15.

374
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
15.

375
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,340
How is it?

376
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,340
Is there any creativity?

377
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
It's a small thing.

378
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
It's a good idea.

379
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,340
That's right.

380
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,340
It's just a normal firework.

381
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,340
But do you know

382
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,340
why they're so happy to eat it?

383
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,340
