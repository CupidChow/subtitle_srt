1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Heartbreak

2
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
I'm not afraid of the world

3
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
I'm afraid of the world

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
I'm afraid of the world

5
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
I'm afraid of the world

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
I'm afraid of the world

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
I'm afraid of the world

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
I'm afraid of the world

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
I'm afraid of the world

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
I'm afraid of the world

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I'm afraid of the world

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
I'm afraid of the world

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm afraid of the world

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
I'm afraid of the world

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
I'm afraid of the world

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
I'm afraid of the world

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
I'm afraid of the world

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
I'm afraid of the world

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I'm afraid of the world

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm afraid of the world

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I'm afraid of the world

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
I sleep in the air

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
in the street

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm afraid of the world

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm afraid of the world

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm afraid of the world

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
I'm afraid of the world

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm afraid of the world

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm afraid of the world

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Lu...

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,900
Hi.

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,900
I'm back.

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,100
Lu...

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,700
Miss Lu.

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,100
Sister Lu, you're back.

36
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,900
Come on, brother Qing Qian.

37
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,900
Sit down and eat.

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,300
Miss Lu,

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,300
the eldest nephew is looking for you.

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,700
I've been back to his hometown recently.

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
There's another wife who wants to see him.

42
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,300
But now,

43
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,500
the wife's voice is really hard to make.

44
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,300
Which rich man is he?

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,100
Stop mentioning it.

46
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Where's the eldest brother?

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
Why didn't he come back?

48
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
Shhh...

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,900
Sister, he...

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,100
He's gone to the wedding.

51
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,900
They're really hard to make.

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
Yue'er is still a missy girl.

53
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,100
I really miss you so much.

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,300
I wonder how he's doing in heaven.

55
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
From now on,

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,300
I'll be your relative.

57
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,500
Who dares to bully you?

58
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,700
I'll get you revenge.

59
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,500
That's bad.

60
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,900
You're a kid.

61
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
You're not that sharp.

62
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
You didn't teach your uncle how to raise a child.

63
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,900
You're so young.

64
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,700
Uncle, I'm sorry.

65
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,300
But something happened to you.

66
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,700
What's wrong with you?

67
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,900
You're so old now.

68
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,300
You're so bad.

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,900
So old?

70
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Really?

71
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,400
You'll break my bones too?

72
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,900
What?

73
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,500
Sister.

74
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,700
Sentry master.

75
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,700
Sister.

76
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,500
Sis.

77
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Sis.

78
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
asting.

79
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,620
Or else, please take me away too, my lord.

80
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,620
Xiao Ya.

81
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,500
I'm not leaving! I'm not leaving!

82
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,300
A Yu, you're alive.

83
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,800
A Yu!

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,300
Looks like the eldest nephew is reluctant to leave us and return to the palace to take the revolution.

85
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,000
Your life is also so hard, eldest nephew.

86
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,800
My lord, you and your sister are all leaving.

87
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,800
How am I going to face this complicated world?

88
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
A Yu, I'm not using it.

89
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,600
Or else, I'll die together.

90
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
No, no, no. Don't.

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Calm down.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Feng Qing Yu, we've been through so many things.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If we say we don't have feelings for you, that's impossible.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But there are some things that I'm destined to do.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If you do something wrong, don't blame me.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Now, there's no difference between you and the dead.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll help you to get rid of them.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Get out of the way!

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Who are you?

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why did you kill my son?

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're wrong. I didn't want to kill your son.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I just wanted to give him a fake face.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He was very beautiful when he was born.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I just wanted him to leave the world beautiful.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're so ridiculous!

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're dead and you don't even want to tell the truth?

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm your son's favorite woman.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you kill me, I'll hate you forever.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He's a dead man now.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How can he hate me?

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is the capital.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How dare you kill my parents?

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Be careful. Du Weisi will catch you.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay. I'll let Du Weisi get you out of here.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's too late.

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He cheated me when he was doing it.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He shouldn't have died.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Feng Qing Yu, wake up.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There's a danger in the law.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's none of my business.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He's the one who should kill me.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He deserves it.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You like him, don't you?

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You like him, don't you?

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't like him.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're so stubborn.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You like him, don't you?

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's all your fault.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Sister Lu.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Sister.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Qing Quan, why are you here?

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're sleeping.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Sister, I brought you something delicious.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's called wheat noodles.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's healthy and healthy.

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Good brother.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're so considerate.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How do you know that I like to eat the camel?

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Sister.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know you like camel.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm worried that you're not well recently.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I made it for you.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Sister, I'll tell you a secret.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
My eight chicken wings are from him.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Even if you eat 100 camel wings,

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
it's hard to catch your heart.

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You're already a tiger.

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What do you want?

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How's your boss?

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Did he come back?

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The doctor said that

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
he must be able to wake up after eating the camel.

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But I don't know why.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's still in the coma.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
By the way,

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
the doctor's eye has been on my shoulder.

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's weird.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He said that if you can't wake up,

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
you can let me do it.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What do you want?

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let me do it?

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Sister, I'm not disappointed in you.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Anyway,

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I believe that you won't hurt Mr. Feng.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
There must be some misunderstanding.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Good brother, you're right.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Sister is really a fool now.

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sister, you must take good care of yourself.

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Qing Xuan is now your only sister.

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Take good care of yourself.

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Look at the noodles.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Lu Yansheng, you're not taking the picture.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I didn't kill anyone.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why did you ask me to take the picture?

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Feng Qingyu has already been with a dead person.

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's not you who did it.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I didn't do it.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He's already the ghost.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You rascal, shut up.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's Mr. Feng.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Calm down.

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't worry.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll cure this woman.

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Last night, Xiao Yanzi told me

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that you rascal,

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
you can seduce my son.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll kill you today.

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't, godfather.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I have some words about the situation last night.

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's normal for people to know.

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What's the situation last night?

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're the son of a loser.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Who would dare to seduce him?

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How dare you!

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll do justice for you today.

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Get out of this evil.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't be impulsive, brother.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't be impulsive.

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're a devil.

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Master, please spare my sister.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Get out of my way.

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Or I'll be in trouble.

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're so ugly.

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Feng Jiuyun, you're so cruel.

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No matter who loves you,

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm afraid Xia Chang won't be as good as today.

207
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I, Lu Yunsheng,

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
will fight for the love of each of you in heaven.

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then you'll die.

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You...

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's going on?

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're a bad girl.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Get out of my way.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Where's my sister?

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Get out of my way.

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Sister.

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Get out of my way.

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How can I beat you to death?

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're so stupid.

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're so stupid.

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Brother, I want to see Feng Jiuyun.

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're so stupid.

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Feng Jiuyun doesn't love you at all.

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But brother,

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Feng Jiuyun never wanted to harm me.

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We were so selfish.

227
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We wanted to kill him.

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Did you forget

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
how his parents treated me?

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We were the same age.

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But they were the master of the master's world.

232
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They were so cruel.

233
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They took me away.

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Then Feng Qingyu killed my sister.

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
She died and killed Sen Zhao.

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Can I not report it?

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're so successful today.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You killed him like a rebel.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Why did you send me to kill him?

240
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's your fate.

241
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're suffering from the pain of the patrol.

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This time, I'll decide it myself.

243
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm so lucky.

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He only cheered for me.

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He's so naughty.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He's so silly.

247
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm so stupid.

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can't help but laugh.

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm so stupid.

250
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm so stupid.

251
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm so lucky.

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm so lucky.

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm so lucky.

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He's so stupid.

255
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He's so silly.

256
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I can't help but laugh.

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He's so silly.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm so stupid.

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm so stupid.

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't help but laugh.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm so stupid.

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm so stupid.

263
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm so stupid.

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The flying bird in the sky

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The wind is blowing, the bell is ringing

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't stop

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It turns out that this is a dream

268
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This dream is so great
