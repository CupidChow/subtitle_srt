46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The one who killed you

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The one who killed me

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What a fast turn

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The one who killed me

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The one who killed me

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Shame!

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What are you doing here

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Feng Qingyu

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You look so handsome

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
a guy is an conservative

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I think you're not good at breaking the rules.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Here, I'll sell you a bowl.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wait.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You've been doing this for a long time.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You will...

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have a life of a killer, right?

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How do you know that?

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Are you also a dead man?

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Aren't you all like this?

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Give you three seconds.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And leave me alone.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Aren't you leaving?

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm leaving.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you doing?

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Su Qiunyuan.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I have to...

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Stop.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
...in the box to make a plan for you.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
To make a plan for you.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wei Yi.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Fang Qiunyuan.

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Open the door.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Fang Qiunyuan.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
She's more crazy than years ago.

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
She's really a good girl.

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Actually, Miss Lu is really cute.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Actually, Miss Lu is really cute.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why are you so protective of her?

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do you like her?

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm Qingmu and Miss Lu.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What?

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You like her too?

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I like her?

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can keep it.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yan Juechen likes Lu Yunsheng?

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I know you're here.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Come out.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Brother.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Brother.

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How about this?

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let me see your real face.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You'd better let me die.

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Who are you?

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm a hero.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But I can't believe I can't walk out of this dead body.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Miss Lu.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You were the one who gave me the last chance.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I was so lucky to have you.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I promised to be my wife.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Good thing.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're so lucky.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You should cherish it.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll keep it.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll keep it.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Take it.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Thank you, brother.

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't like chicken.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Next time, you should pay me first.

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Lu Yunsheng.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Isn't this the boss of Fengming?

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Young master Feng.

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're so arrogant.

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You came to me.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you love me?

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't have time to fight with you.

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll help you find the murderer.

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You finally believe me.

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Fine.

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll help you.

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
From the picture,

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
this murderer may be a woman.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A woman?

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's possible that she's a man.

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're talking nonsense.

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're the one who's being a liar.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Mo Fei.

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Xiaoyao.

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That beautiful girl who's in the wetter.

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's not possible.

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What should I do now?

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I have a good idea.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can help you find the murderer.

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Tell me.

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then you have to...

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Qian Chuan.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is the soul-saving weapon.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You put it on the other person's body.

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let him have a high kung fu.

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let him beg for life.

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He can't beg for death.

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He can't beg for life.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Brother.

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Look at that face.

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Sister.

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Look at this.

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What's this?

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What's this?

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Look at that.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Sister.

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're so good at playing the game.

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're so good at playing the game.

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't be silly.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We're rich.

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
When we get rich,

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
we must bring our parents to the capital.

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't worry.

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm Qian Chuan.

166
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Where can we make money?

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Brother.

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That is...

169
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Eat here.

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Eat here.

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Eat chicken.

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sister.

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We can't eat at this restaurant.

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We have to wait for others.

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Fengming is a great man.

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He's the one who takes the position of the manager.

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Brother.

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Your fortune is called the future.

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh my god.

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Sister.

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're not eating much.

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hurry up.

183
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Put it here.

184
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Please enjoy.

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Come on.

186
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Enjoy.

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Sir.

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sir.

189
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Please save us.

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Please save my poor little girl.

191
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Sir.

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Please save us.

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Who are you, sir?

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm not married yet.

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Sir.

196
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sir.

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I've been with my brother for days.

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Please forgive us.

199
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Sir.

200
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm willing to marry you

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and serve you.

202
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I have someone in my heart.

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't love him.

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can be a concubine.

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't be silly.

206
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sir.

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We can do everything

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
except for the tea and water.

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think

210
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
our restaurant is just like

211
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
the one we like.

212
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sir.

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Your father is a good man.

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Please save us.

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Look at my brother.

216
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He's a fool.

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why am I so miserable?

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why am I so weak?

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Sir.

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Fine.

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You can stay.

222
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thank you, sir.

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Thank you, sir.

224
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you, sir.

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Thank you, sir.

226
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Thank you, sir.

227
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Thank you, sir.

228
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What's your name?

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
My name is Qingquan.

230
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
My name is Big Brother.

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm the one who comes to heaven and earth.

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You didn't lie to me.

233
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's really useful.

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You...

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Come out.

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't touch me.

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm telling you.

238
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I...

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not afraid of you.

240
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Come out.

241
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why did you kill me?

242
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You...

243
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't know.

244
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Big Brother.

245
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Big Sister.

246
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Please forgive me.

247
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I didn't expect...

248
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You're so innocent.

249
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm innocent.

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm just a fool.

251
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Big Brother, please forgive me.

252
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Big Brother, please forgive me.

253
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Please forgive me.

254
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I didn't want to work hard.

255
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll go to hell.

256
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I won't be a fool.

257
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Fine.

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I didn't expect...

259
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
you two have been together for a long time.

260
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You two have been together for a long time.

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm so tired.

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm so tired.

265
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm so tired.

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm so tired.

267
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm so tired.

268
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm so tired.

269
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm so tired.

270
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm so tired.

271
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm so tired.

272
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm so tired.

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm so tired.

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm so tired.

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm so tired.

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm so tired.

277
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He only kissed me.

278
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He hugged me.

279
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He hugged me.

280
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He only laughed at me.

281
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I was far away.

282
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I was looking at the sky.

283
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
