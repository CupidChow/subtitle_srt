The End

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
To be honest, I know Feng Qing Wu.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
She's a weirdo with double personality.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Every time I become a salesman,

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll become that annoying little girl.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Life is not easy,

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but mine is not easy.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
There are too many.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is my favorite, Mu Xiaoya.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Unfortunately, she doesn't know how to speak.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She doesn't know how to speak.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is called Yan Juechen's handsome brother.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He's my brother.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Besides martial arts, he's not as good as me.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why isn't the boss coming out?

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's right.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If he doesn't come out, we'll leave.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Where's the boss?

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Boss!

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hurry up!

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Boss, come out!

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Boss!

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come out!

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Come out!

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Feng Ming Sheng Xiao Xiao.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Every day, she's happy and happy.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Welcome to the LiLin Feng Ming Sheng song.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Can we change the drawing?

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's still the old one.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Change one.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hurry up and eat yours.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Change one!

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's really pretty.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm here to take a ride.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I hope all the rich people in the capital

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
can have a good time.

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No money is just a normal person.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I hope you can be a good brother.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can be a good brother.

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll do my best.

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Thank you.

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're so good.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Can you give me a little man?

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No problem.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll give you a little man.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm a good man.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hurry up.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let me show you.

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
From the drawing,

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the man in the heart is your childhood sweetheart.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Childhood sweetheart?

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What's his name?

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's gentle and considerate.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a pity that he's a wild horse.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're so accurate.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm a great teacher.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I have nothing to hide from you.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't tell me.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm his uncle.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But I don't have a relationship with Xueyan.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think you should forget about it.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you want to say something?

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Of course.

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Good girl.

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We can make a deal.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We can make a deal.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But we'll change our fate.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Maybe your childhood sweetheart...

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No, no, no.

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
My nephew is a restaurant owner.

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There's something wrong.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Come with me.

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Childe Feng.

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Come.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's broken.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Please.

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Childe Feng is a talent.

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why waste your time here?

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you want to marry me,

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll keep you as my wife.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's her?

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You know her?

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm from another country.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But I don't know the rich people in the capital.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm a good girl.

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm a good girl.

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
My dear.

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm a good girl.

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm a good girl.

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't want to work hard.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm tired.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm just afraid you won't remember me.

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't be so stubborn.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Be careful of me.

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How dare you?

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Kill him.

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I...

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Go.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You dare to touch me?

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm afraid of death.

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wait for me.

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Go.

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Wait for me.

152
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Go.

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll kill you.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Xiaoyao, are you okay?

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's wrong?

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Nothing.

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ge Yu is missing.

158
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why are you here?

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What's wrong?

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm not here.

161
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm your uncle.

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't come here.

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Who are you?

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yu, your uncle promised your father to take good care of you.

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You can't be so rude.

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Thank you.

167
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm hungry.

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You are...

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You don't know me?

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Lu Yunsheng.

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We have met before.

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Lu Yunsheng?

173
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Mr. Feng, stop it.

174
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Mr. Feng, look.

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't laugh.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Mr. Feng,

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm here to pick you up.

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Mr. Feng, look.

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't laugh.

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Mr. Feng,

181
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Mr. Feng,

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
come here.

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm waiting for you.

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mr. Feng, look at the food.

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's not fresh.

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Are you lying?

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Mr. Feng, come here.

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Have some wine.

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay.

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No need.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm hungry.

192
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Go to my room and find me.

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll treat you to dinner.

194
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay.

195
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's go.

196
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Mr. Feng.

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sister, believe me.

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You only have one in your heart.

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Why?

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I haven't been in love for a long time.

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I miss Tian Tian.

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't be anxious.

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Actually, it's your day.

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm the kindest and most emotional.

205
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If you have a chance,

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll teach you how to make up for his worries.

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Still?

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wrong.

209
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Forget the past.

210
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I won't remember everything.

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
My brother doesn't remember it back then.

212
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What if…

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He's kimonozaki.

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Leave like a flower.

215
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll give you a good-for-nothing.

216
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're a bunch of days off.

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's just a year after.

218
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You arehiboji.

219
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why did you chase her away?

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Yes.

221
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
I think you should be careful when you're black.

222
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,800
If you don't come back soon,

223
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,680
you'll be in trouble if you get the money.

224
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,180
You...

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,320
I said you had a problem.

226
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,120
Xiao Yan Zi.

227
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,520
No, I...

228
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,440
Get him out of here.

229
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,520
My name is Yan Jue Chen.

230
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,520
Why am I born in this family?

231
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,520
Why is it so dark?

232
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,720
Why did I become Gu Xiaoyu's fool

233
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,400
the whole night?

234
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,040
She likes a girl like her.

235
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,960
Don't blow it.

236
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,800
Nan Tian is dead.

237
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,280
Nan Tian.

238
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
You...

239
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,480
Ma...

240
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,360
You...

241
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,600
You're calling me?

242
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,520
No.

243
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,000
You're herbs.

244
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,320
Probably just as 這個

245
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,480
Yu you disguised yourself as his fill.

246
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,760
Sorry, Master.

247
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Please forgive me.

248
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,560
I didn't mean it.

249
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,040
I'm a person who's layangled.

250
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
Pretend so stupid and put things in a line,

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,800
I was killed by a dead monster.

252
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,000
I was killed every day.

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
But what happened to Li Qi was that I wasn't dead.

254
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,800
I went to the mountains to meet a old man.

255
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
He said I was a mortal.

256
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,400
He wanted to give me a good punishment.

257
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,600
I said I was still young.

258
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,800
I wanted to go to Hongcheng.

259
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,000
He escaped from a forest.

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He asked me to go to the forest.

261
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,400
You are so nice.

262
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
He only asked me to go to the forest.

263
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,800
He was so nice.

264
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
He only laughed at me.

265
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
I was so far away.

266
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
I was so far away.

267
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,400
I could swim on the blue waves.

268
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
I was so far away.

269
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,400
I no longer understands Тotaly adHs.

270
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,200
On top of my imagination

271
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,400
It was my dream.

272
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,000
What I did was nice.

273
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:09,600
He only wanted to know

274
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

275
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

276
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

277
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600

278
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600

279
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600

I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

285
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

286
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

296
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind
