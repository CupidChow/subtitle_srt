45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Doctor Luo.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Come in.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You have a nice drawing.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Of course.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You came to me in the kitchen at night.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you doing?

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I really have a bad feeling.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What...

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why do I have to come to you?

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I miss you.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What?

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You miss me?

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You miss me?

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You asked me to live in the kitchen.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You didn't change my room?

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You like it like this, right?

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I thought it was convenient for you.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You like it like this.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I like the toilet.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't get it for you.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You took the medicine with me.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, right.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why are you drawing this?

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I've been dreaming of this mask recently.

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I drew it out.

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You dream of this mask?

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why?

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How do I know?

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hurry up.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I want to go to the...

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Then you go to the bathroom.

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Do you remember to drink tea?

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm leaving.

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm a crybaby.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm a crybaby.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Lu Yun Shang.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Brother.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You killed Feng Qiyu in the mask, right?

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Didn't you say that I'm the one who killed Feng Qiyu?

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Sister Sun.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm very selfish to you.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Everyone can see that you've already...

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
killed Feng Qiyu.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm not.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm not.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm not.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm not.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm not.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm not.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm not.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm not.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm not.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm not.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm not.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You've already killed Feng Qiyu in the mask.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ziti, you killed yourself.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll ask you one more time.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
When exactly did you kill Feng Qiyu?

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't know.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You...

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You killed me so easily.

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Brother.

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Who's there?

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're the one who killed the Ghost Face!

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Lu Yingsheng, what's your relationship with Lang'ang?

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
None of your business.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't talk nonsense. Kill him!

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hurry and leave.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Or else, don't blame me for being ruthless and ruthless!

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Ghost Face, I'm not willing to be your enemy.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why did you kill me?

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Could it be that my mother is your enemy?

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm not willing to be your enemy.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm willing to be your enemy.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm willing to be your enemy.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm willing to be your enemy.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Could it be that my mother is your enemy?

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You killed my sister.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm going to make you die in the blood of my sister!

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
When did I kill your sister?

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Sang'er, you...

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hurry and run! You're stupid!

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Sang'er, are you crazy?

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How dare you betray me for this brat?

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sang'er, you're a traitor.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm going to make you know that the one who betrays me has to die!

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You...

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Lu Yusheng!

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Fang Qianyu! Fang Qianyu!

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Fang Qianyu! Fang Qianyu!

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Fang Qianyu!

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Young Master, you're finally awake.

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yu, you're awake.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're awake?

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Lu Yusheng, I know you want to kill me.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But I can't bear to do it.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Please.

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't understand what nonsense you're talking about.

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm in that dream again.

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Are your brother the King of Ghosts?

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Really?

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Since you already know that I'm a killer of Ghosts,

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
then kill me.

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Lu Yusheng, there are some things you need to make clear.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
For example, your brother is a sister, right?

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
His name is Lu Qiuying.

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Lu Qiuying?

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's his name?

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He's He's Hand.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Boss Fang, your dumplings are so delicious.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can drink more if you like them.

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Xiaoya, if you talk to him like him,

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
you might find the other one too.

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Lu Qiuying, do you like Fengming's boss?

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You want to be a green hat?

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm just trying to respect him.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you really suspect that I'm the one who killed you,

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
then let's just let it go.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If you know that you're the brother of the Ghosts,

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
then you'll have to peel my skin.

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If you think...

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you want to fight, then go out and fight.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We're going to fight.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You're going to fight?

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We're going to fight our price.

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Listen, if you don't have me and my brother,

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you're nothing.

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're a little wild dog that no one wants.

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's just say goodbye here today.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Take care of yourselves.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Lu Qiuying, if you dare to leave me,

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll kill you.

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Do you dare?

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Kill him.

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Kill him.

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Kill him.

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Miss.

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Miss.

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Miss.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Miss.

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Miss.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What's wrong with her?

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm fine.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm so tired.

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She's so scary.

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hurry up.

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No.

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not me.

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What...

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What should we do?

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
She's here.

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
She's not here.

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
She's here.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Go.

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Go.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Go.
