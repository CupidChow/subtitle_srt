I'm not dead

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is it a dream?

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What's wrong?

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why are you here?

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm afraid you're in danger

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm here to help you

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why are you so fierce?

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What's wrong with you?

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You haven't woken up for so long

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You have a long dream

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How did I come back today?

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We're so busy. How would you know?

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Feng Qianyu, you met something strange yesterday

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What's wrong with me?

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Get out

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You just fell asleep

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't mind him. He's ill

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're ill. Get out

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Xiaoya, you get out too

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hurry up

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Xiaoya, you're a murderer

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're a murderer

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm afraid you're a murderer

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, I need to find out

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Who are you?

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You don't need to know who I am

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It seems that someone is meeting me

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Xiao Yanzi is in love with me

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He shouldn't have killed me

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I didn't die

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I must find the evidence to find Xiao Yanzi

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've been killed many times by a ghost murderer

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And I've been dreaming every time I die

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You guys, wake up

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've been dead for so many times

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I've been killed many times

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I've been killed many times

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I've been killed many times

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've been killed many times

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you understand?

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Xiaoya, I was scared when I was kicked

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And you were talking

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Are you the only one who's looking for me?

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Miss Lu, why are you here?

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm so poor

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm here to find you guys

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm here to find you guys

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Miss Lu, this is all my savings

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hello

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You are

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Lu...what voice?

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Lu Yunsheng

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What voice?

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Lu Yunsheng

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Lu...what voice?

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Lu Yunsheng

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I remember now

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You are my savior

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You finally remember me

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Miss Lu

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
She's so smart

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If she becomes my wife

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Then we will have a good relationship

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
My wife

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Which nephew?

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I have only one nephew

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't be the one to be the one

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Fengqing Yu, I know you've been acting weird lately

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let me calculate it for you

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Fengqing Yu, you are so great

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm doing well

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are so great

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If you don't listen to me

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I promise you

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You will be in trouble

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You will be in trouble

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You are in trouble

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You will be in trouble

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Old sister, you are selling the exchange rate

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You are selling the exchange rate

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm so sure

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What should I do now?

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The sky is cold

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You can't thank me

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Miss Lu

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What does she mean?

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why? I can only appear at night

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I hope that the night is longer

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't be the fool who becomes Fengqing Yu

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The fool

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Xiao Yanzi grew up with me

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
She is not good at acting

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
She shouldn't be the one who killed me

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What's the situation?

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Who are you?

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I said I was young

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I wanted to go to Hongcheng

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
She escaped from a forest

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I was so tired

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You are so great

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
She only treated me

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Sorry

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
She only laughed at me

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I was so far away

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I was so scared

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I was so nervous

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I was so nervous

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I didn't stop

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I was dreaming

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I was so good at acting

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I was so good

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
She only treated me

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Sorry

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
She only laughed at me

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I was so far away

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I was so scared

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I was so scared

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I was so nervous

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I didn't stop

168
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I was so good

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
She only treated me

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Sorry

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
She only laughed at me

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I was so far away

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I was so scared

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I was so nervous

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I was so nervous

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I didn't stop

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I was so nervous

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was so good

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I was so good

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
