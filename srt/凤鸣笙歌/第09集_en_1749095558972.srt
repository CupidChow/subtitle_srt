Sister.

63
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
Why are you here?

64
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
You have such a broken wine house.

65
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
You don't like your own body.

66
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Why do you treat Jin Niang like that?

67
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Why do you mention him?

68
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
He left us behind.

69
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480
He was only a piece of broken red cloth.

70
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,480
You're not a mother.

71
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,480
How dare you!

72
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
You hit me.

73
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Do you have time to hit me?

74
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Lang Zhong said that

75
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,480
you are already fatigued.

76
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
You won't be far from death

77
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
if you fight with the tiger.

78
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Am I a bad man?

79
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Yu'er.

80
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Do you hate your mother so much?

81
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Or else,

82
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,480
don't you hate her?

83
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
She left us behind.

84
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,480
There's no such mother in the world.

85
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
Mother, I want this red cloth.

86
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
It must be beautiful.

87
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
It's not suitable for a young girl.

88
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
I can't wear it

89
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,480
if a young girl wears it.

90
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
I want it.

91
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,480
I won't buy it for you.

92
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Yu'er, I may not have money.

93
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Am I your own sister?

94
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,480
You tell me.

95
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,480
Yu'er, wait for me.

96
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,480
Do you want this dress?

97
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Brother, give me a discount.

98
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Yu'er,

99
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
come out.

100
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
We have prepared the surprise.

101
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Come out.

102
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Yu'er.

103
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Who are you?

104
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
You.

105
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,480
It's you.

106
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Mother.

107
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,480
So my mother didn't abandon us.

108
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
So Xiaoyao

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
was also the one who lost her.

110
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
That's right.

111
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Who is the murderer?

112
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Did you find the murderer?

113
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Father,

114
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
such a big thing happened.

115
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

116
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
I want to tell you.

117
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
You will put his dead body on your head.

118
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
I don't want you to live that life.

119
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Your mother will not want it.

120
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
I won't.

121
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
I have kept this secret for years.

122
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Now I tell you.

123
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
I am a good father.

124
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Father.

125
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
I am sorry.

126
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Yu'er.

127
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
I believe

128
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
that time can change everything.

129
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Mother.

130
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
I will find the murderer to avenge you.

131
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Yu'er.

132
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Live well.

133
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
That's the biggest revenge for your mother.

134
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Since I entered the Xunhuang,

135
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
I will go back to the past.

136
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Don't let my mother die.

137
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
I want to change everything.

138
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Yu'er.

139
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
I am back.

140
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
This dress is for the little girl.

141
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
It's not suitable for you.

142
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Mother, I don't want this dress.

143
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Yuan, this dress is not your favorite.

144
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
It's a foreign dress.

145
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
I just hope that you and mother can be by my side.

146
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Father, you are so smart.

147
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
It's not important to me.

148
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Yuan, you have grown up.

149
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
You are getting more and more mature.

150
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Yuan, you are great.

151
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Mother, we should be together forever.

152
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
We will never be apart.

153
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Of course.

154
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Otherwise, where else can I go?

155
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Mother, let's go home.

156
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Today is your birthday.

157
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Don't you want to go out?

158
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Let's go home.

159
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Let's go.

160
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Ghost King,

161
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
you haven't killed the Gu Yu'er you wanted in ten years.

162
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
I think you are not willing to do it.

163
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
You are more and more bold.

164
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
I will arrange for you to do it.

165
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
First, I am not your killer.

166
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Second,

167
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,480
What is second?

168
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
I love her.

169
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,480
She only likes the third and fourth little girl.

170
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,480
She doesn't like you being the princess of Gao Gao.

171
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
If I am the princess of Gao Gao,

172
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
can I listen to you to invite me here?

173
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
You are useless.

174
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Even if you become the empress, I will still be your brother.

175
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,480
If you don't go, someone will.

176
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
I am not your killer.

177
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
I love you.

178
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
You are useless.

179
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
I love you.

180
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
You are useless.

181
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
I love you.

182
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
You are useless.

183
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
I love you.

184
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
You are useless.

185
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I love you.

186
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
You are useless.

187
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
I love you.

188
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
You are useless.

189
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
I love you.

190
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
I love you.

191
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
You are useless.

192
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
I love you.

193
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
You are useless.

194
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Don't be silly.

195
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
I love you.

196
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,480
I can afford a zu murder for every hour of the night.

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
I don't want to be your lover,

198
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
I want to share our ordinary life experience.

199
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Do you get angry?

200
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,880
The name is great, he only asks me to kiss

201
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,280
Hug, hug, hug

202
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,480
He only jokes with me, I'm far away

203
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,880
I don't want to be a bird in the sky

204
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,680
I don't want to be a bird in the sky, I don't want to be a bird in the sky

205
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,880
It turns out that this is a dream

206
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,880
This dream is great

207
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,350
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
