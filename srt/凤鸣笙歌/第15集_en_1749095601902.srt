Stop meses in Greatние

10
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,480
It's the dunce

11
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,640
What else can we do

12
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,240
Miss Long's body is missing

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I just left the palace.

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Miss Leng's body is gone.

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Give it to me.

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Don't fight with each other.

17
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
When is it?

18
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Who is so cruel?

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
He didn't even let go of his body.

20
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
It must be him.

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Who?

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Ghost King.

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Ghost King?

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
What does he have to do with this?

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Actually,

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
he created all of this.

27
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
He's the one who wanted to kill.

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
He wanted to kill me?

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Ghost King?

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Why did he kill you?

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
I suspect that it's related to my mother's death.

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Xiaoya,

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
my father has told me everything.

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Do you remember the situation before she died?

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
I only remember that I saw a shadow.

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Mother.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I didn't see anything else.

38
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
You said that

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
it's possible to kill your mother

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
and you.

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
It's the same person.

42
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Although Leng Aoxue admitted that she killed me,

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
I suspect that there's not one murderer.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
You said that Miss Leng and Miss Lu

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
look like mother.

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,400
So what's their relationship?

47
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I just hope that

48
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,400
she can live well.

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
You will meet the one who loves you.

50
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Yes, Brother Yan Zi.

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Look,

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
you've been drinking for three days and three nights.

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
What are you arguing about?

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Feng Qingyu.

55
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Why are you still here?

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
The world is so poor.

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm sincere to Aoxue.

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
I'm sure that I'm more than a person

59
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
who can tell you

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,400
that I'm a person who is more than a person.

61
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
You're just more beautiful than me.

62
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
You're more talented than me.

63
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
You're a big bird.

64
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
You're a big bird.

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
No.

66
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,400
You're the best in the world.

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
You...

68
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
You're a gentleman.

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Brother Yan Zi.

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,400
You really like Miss Aoxue

71
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
or Miss Lu?

72
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,400
I think you both like me now.

73
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Right?

74
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
You can't just be a person.

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
I don't know.

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I only know that I've been in love with Aoxue for ten years.

77
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I was a little bit worried.

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
I was a little worried.

79
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
I was a little worried.

80
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
I've been in love with Aoxue for ten years.

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
I thought that everything would be as I wish.

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
But then I found out that

83
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
I was in love with Feng Qingyu.

84
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
I couldn't say anything.

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
And then

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
when my parents were in the office,

87
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
they both died.

88
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
I thought that my life was gone.

89
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
It's delicious.

90
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Until I met her.

91
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Aoxue.

92
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Aoxue.

93
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Aoxue.

94
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Aoxue.

95
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
You made something too?

96
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Right.

97
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Try it.

98
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Is it good?

99
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Eat more.

100
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
This is red bean.

101
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
It's delicious.

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
It's delicious.

103
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
It's delicious.

104
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
It's delicious.

105
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
It's delicious.

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
This is red bean.

107
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Ye Yunchen, why are you standing here?

108
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Come and try it.

109
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Okay.

110
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Try it.

111
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
This is made by Aoxue.

112
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
This is made by Xiaoyao.

113
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Aoxue is still suitable for me.

114
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
You didn't try it.

115
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
How do you know that it's not suitable for you?

116
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
You did it.

117
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
You don't need to eat it.

118
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Come on.

119
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Try it.

120
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
You also try Xiaoyao's.

121
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,400
That water is the worst time in my life.

122
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Try it.

123
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
But I can't go back now.

124
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I don't know.

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Brother Qingshen.

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
What do you think of the dance I just danced?

127
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
The most beautiful and fresh.

128
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
The country is full of youth.

129
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Ayu's birthday is coming up in the next two days.

130
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
I want to celebrate it with this dance.

131
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Do you think he will like it?

132
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Aoxue in memory is always so smart.

133
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,400
He makes me feel worse than him.

134
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
I swear.

135
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,400
I will become the best myself for Aoxue.

136
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Aoxue.

137
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Aoxue.

138
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
I have something to tell you.

139
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I know what you want to say.

140
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
But I'm sorry.

141
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
I already have someone I like.

142
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
You think too much.

143
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
The weather has been getting cold recently.

144
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Be careful.

145
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
You too, Brother Qingshen.

146
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Aoxue is so cold.

147
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I fear that if I do something to have an open mind,

148
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
he will die right after his death.

149
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,400
If you have Alex with me,

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
please apologize to me suddenly.

151
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,400
fato is in Island F Mai's book,

152
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,640
He's only his brother.

153
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Like a red dust

154
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,400
He ran away from a forest

155
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm tired of the medicine

156
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
You're so good

157
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
He only asks for my advice

158
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Sorry, I'm a little bit noisy

159
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
He only jokes with me

160
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm far away from the village

161
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
I'm not a good person

162
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm a bird in the sky

163
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm a bird in the sky

164
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
I'm a bird in the sky

165
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm a bird in the sky

166
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm a bird in the sky

167
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm a dreamer

168
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

169
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm tired of the medicine

170
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
You're so good

171
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
He only asks for my advice

172
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Sorry, I'm a little bit noisy

173
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
He only jokes with me

174
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm far away from the village

175
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I'm not a good person

176
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
I'm a bird in the sky

177
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm a bird in the sky

178
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm not a good person

179
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm tired of the medicine

180
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
You're so good

181
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
He only asks for my advice

182
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Sorry, I'm a little bit noisy

183
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
He only jokes with me

184
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm a bird in the sky

185
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I'm a bird in the sky

186
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
I'm a bird in the sky

187
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
I'm a bird in the night

188
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm listening to you

189
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,000
It turns to be a dream

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,400
What a great dream
