00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
What are you doing?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,420
Your own sister

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,440
Keep calm

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,460
I don't want to do it

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,340
Save me

6
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,740
I will never come back to see you again

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Episode 1

8
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,740
Are you scared?

9
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,940
You are?

10
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,340
There are ghosts in my heart.

11
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,940
Be careful of being killed by the ghosts.

12
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,340
Let's go.

13
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,340
Young people, you are so bold.

14
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,340
Do you dare to buy a ghost mask?

15
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,340
Why not?

16
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,340
Do you like it?

17
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,340
Young people, you are so bold.

18
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,340
Be careful of being killed by the ghosts.

19
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,340
Be careful of being killed by the ghosts.

20
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
Be careful of being killed by the ghosts.

21
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,340
Why are you still here?

22
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,340
Yu, you are playing.

23
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,340
Yu, where do you think you have seen this girl?

24
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Why are you here again?

25
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
Stop.

26
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,340
Take off your mask.

27
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,340
Who are you?

28
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,340
Yu, why are you so hard on that girl?

29
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,340
Get out of the way.

30
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,340
Here.

31
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,340
Yu.

32
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
Here.

33
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
Yu!

34
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
Yu.

35
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,340
Yu.

38
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,020
Yanyan, me., I'll bring you the dishes,

39
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,660
to feed you.

40
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,300
Thank you.

41
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,060
I...

42
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,260
I just want to say some sweet words every day.

43
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,940
I'll give you candy every day.

44
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,420
I'll eat candy every day.

45
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,700
Why are you doing this again?

46
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,460
Sir.

47
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,300
How can you do this?

48
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,300
You're too long.

49
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,540
Xiao Yan Zi.

50
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,660
Have you found your aunt?

51
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,420
Let me say it again.

52
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,700
She doesn't deserve to be my aunt.

53
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,220
I think it's a bit late today.

54
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,420
Why don't you find her tomorrow?

55
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,860
It's okay.

56
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,540
Ma'am, I can't hear you.

57
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,060
Sister.

58
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,820
Open the door.

59
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,620
Sister.

60
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,420
Ma'am.

61
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,060
Ma'am.

62
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,860
Sister.

63
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,180
What's wrong with you, sister?

64
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,540
Yes, sister.

65
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,700
Sister.

66
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,340
Sister.

67
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,700
Who gave you this?

68
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,580
Xiao Ya, go find the wolf.

69
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,140
Sister.

70
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,020
Do you remember

71
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,060
how much we gave you?

72
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,700
Sister.

73
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,260
I really can't get

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,700
10,000 gold.

75
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,420
It's okay.

76
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,180
As long as you take care of my brother,

77
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,420
I'll take good care of him.

78
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,620
When he eats meat,

79
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,940
remember to drink him soup.

80
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,020
Sister.

81
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,540
Don't worry.

82
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,140
As long as I'm alive,

83
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,140
I won't let him suffer.

84
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,300
Sister.

85
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,180
I'm not afraid of crying and tears.

86
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,620
I want you to live.

87
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,020
Silly brother.

88
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,700
No one can be with you forever.

89
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,180
They say

90
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,820
beautiful women love money.

91
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,700
And the ugly women love money more.

92
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,620
Sister loves money so much.

93
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,940
You say, sister.

94
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,500
Beautiful women are not beautiful.

95
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,780
Sister.

96
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,500
Brother.

97
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,260
Sister.

98
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,900
Sister.

99
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,180
Sister.

100
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,540
Don't die.

101
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,180
Sister.

102
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,900
Brother.

103
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,660
I'm not dead.

104
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,100
I'm not dead.

105
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,140
You're not dead.

106
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,180
I'm not dead.

107
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,220
I'm not dead.

108
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,100
This.

109
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:16,980
Sister.

110
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,820
Take it.

111
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,860
Sister.

112
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,180
Feng Chunyu.

113
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,060
Come.

114
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,780
This is what you want.

115
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,100
Sister.

116
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,100
Sister.

117
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,940
Sister.

118
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,540
Sister.

119
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,220
Sister.

120
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,060
Sister.

121
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,380
What?

122
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,620
Are you afraid?

123
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,940
Who is afraid?

124
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,220
I just think

125
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,940
Long Aoxue's name

126
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,980
is a little familiar.

127
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,820
It's not.

128
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,620
Actually,

129
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,140
I have this feeling too.

130
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,820
Forget it.

131
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,420
It's okay.

132
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,260
Let's go in and have a look.

133
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,180
It's okay.

134
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,020
Let's go.

135
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
Hurry up.

136
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,580
Hurry up.

137
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:51,700
Go.

138
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,340
Theoka près στη Estoy track別

139
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,900
Very familiar

140
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,740
Yu.

141
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,740
Didn't you say that you were also in the Xun Huan Sect?

142
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,740
Maybe these books are useful to you.

143
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
I hope so.

144
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,740
Lan Ao Xue, you devil!

145
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
Hurry and come out and die!

146
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
I've been hiding it for so many years.

147
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,740
I still find it hard to find it.

148
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
Under the sun,

149
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
no crime can be hidden.

150
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
Stop!

151
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Stop!

152
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,740
It's so hard to find it!

153
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,740
Stop!

154
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,740
Stop!

155
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,740
Stop!

156
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
You found it?

157
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
You found it?

158
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,740
I found it.

159
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
I remember it.

160
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
I remember it too.

161
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,740
Sister Ao Xue.

162
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,740
You've been pretending to be Lu Ying Sheng by our side.

163
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Nonsense.

164
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,740
That Lu is just like me.

165
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
I've been sealed this memory for so many years.

166
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
I still remember it.

167
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
You remember it?

168
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,740
Ao Xue.

169
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Why did you erase our memories?

170
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,740
Do you know that you're our good friend?

171
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Good friend?

172
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
In your heart,

173
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
Mu Xiaoya is your good friend.

174
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,740
When did you get my position?

175
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
Ao Xue.

176
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,740
You used the soul number to seal our memories.

177
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
You used the voice to awaken our memories.

178
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
It's really a self-evident.

179
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
Shut up!

180
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
You're the one who's not qualified to blame me.

181
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,740
What's the point of asking the world for love?

182
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,740
You're just a friend.

183
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,740
You're just a friend.

184
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
Feng Qingyu.

185
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
You don't know what I've been through these years.

186
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Are you also trying to be smart?

187
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,740
Nonsense.

188
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
I don't understand.

189
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,740
Sister Ao Xue.

190
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
If you're willing,

191
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
we can be happy together

192
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
just like before.

193
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Happy?

194
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
Just be serious with you.

195
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Ao Xue.

196
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
Ao Xue.

197
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
Chase her.

198
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Ao Xue.

199
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
Ao Xue.

200
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
Ao Xue, come out.

201
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
Ao Xue.

202
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Ao Xue.

203
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
Ao Xue.

204
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
Where are you, Ao Xue?

205
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Ao Xue.

206
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Come out, Ao Xue.

207
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Ao Xue.

208
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
Where can they go

209
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,740
in such a big place?

210
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Come out.

211
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Come out.

212
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Come on.

213
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
You can't find me.

214
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,740
I'm here.

215
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,740
Is everything fake

216
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,740
or won't you like me?

217
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
Ao Xue.

218
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,740
Come out, Ao Xue.

219
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Ao Xue.

220
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
Ao Xue.

221
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
Where are you going?

222
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
Where are you going?

223
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,740
I'm going to sleep, Ao Xue.

224
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Come home with us.

225
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,740
Come home?

226
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,740
I haven't come home for a long time.

227
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Ao Xue.

228
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,740
Why do you insist on killing me?

229
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,740
Are you in pain?

230
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,740
Shouldn't you kill me?

231
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,740
Can you stop being so obsessed with me?

232
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
I don't want you to care about me.

233
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
Since you abandoned me,

234
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,740
we're just two worlds.

235
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,740
When did I abandon you?

236
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
Tell me clearly.

237
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
This is too annoying.

238
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
Ao Xue.

239
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
You're the master of RuLan.

240
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,740
That's right.

241
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,740
Yu, stop.

242
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Yu.

243
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,740
Stop.

244
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,740
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,740
It turns out that this is a dream.

247
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,740
This dream is made so well.
