Sir.

25
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,320
Sir.

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,280
Da Zhi Zi,

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,160
I'll take care of your auntie Ya in the future.

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't worry.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
Ya is my sister.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
I don't need you to take care of her.

31
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,000
Ya Ya,

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,920
I'll take care of you in the future.

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,880
Do you want to?

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,480
You don't want to?

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,040
You...

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
are too...

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,000
too fast.

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,680
How can you say that?

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,320
I'll wait for you.

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,160
Hum.

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,480
It's a bit fast.

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,280
Feng Qiu Yu,

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,480
you actually used me

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,280
to deal with me

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,680
with your engagement dress.

46
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,560
You're a rude and mean person.

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,280
I'm a mean person.

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
I've been living in the safest place

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,680
since I was a kid.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,040
You told me last time

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,760
that I had a good thing to do.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,280
And you ran away again.

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,720
So,

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,000
you're the killer of Ghost Face.

55
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,960
Say it again.

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,440
You can say I'm a noisy person,

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,520
but you can't say I'm a ghost.

58
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,120
Fine.

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,920
You're a stubborn girl.

60
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,200
I'll let you know

61
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,760
what you can't do

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,920
and what you can't do.

63
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,040
You...

64
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,120
What are you doing?

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,360
Wash it for me.

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
I'm telling you.

67
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,000
This is the most poisonous poison in the world.

68
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,800
Without my antidote,

69
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
you'll die

70
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
in a year.

71
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,440
Who are you scaring?

72
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,920
I don't believe you.

73
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,880
I hope your mouth

74
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,920
will be as bright as your life.

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,800
Feng Qiu Yu,

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,160
you can't die!

77
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,280
Yes.

78
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
I'll buy more vegetables.

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,680
Wash it.

80
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,400
Thank you.

81
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,520
Miss Lu.

82
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,320
Are you okay?

83
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
You're so stubborn.

84
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,400
You're so...

85
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,120
Miss Lu.

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,520
Did you eat something

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,760
that's not clean?

88
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
Xiaoya,

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,760
prepare a guest room for Miss Lu.

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,600
Before you find out the truth,

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,000
you can't let her leave.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
The room is not good enough.

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,320
Feng Qiu Yu,

94
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,640
you're so heartless.

95
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,760
You're so unreasonable.

96
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,800
I'm so unreasonable.

97
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,440
You're so unreasonable.

98
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,640
How did you know that?

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm going home.

100
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,200
You...

101
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,120
Sister,

102
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,680
do you want to go to the toilet?

103
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,440
Qing Xuan,

104
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,000
what's most important for a person is

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
to take your place.

106
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,320
When you're not good enough,

107
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,480
don't meddle in the fight.

108
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,840
Sister, you're right.

109
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Miss Lu,

110
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,280
from now on,

111
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,080
you should be a good girl

112
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,160
and have a good life.

113
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,720
Xiaoya.

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,600
Let's go.

115
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,720
Let's go.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
We didn't see anything.

117
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
We didn't see anything.

118
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,080
All right.

119
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,920
Yes.

120
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:38,760
Your Majesty.

121
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,240
You're so cold-hearted.

122
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:42,960
Really?

123
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,680
I didn't hit you in the military uniform.

124
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,760
But helped me

125
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
in order to 9 o'clock in the evening.

126
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,720
After she fell asleep,

127
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,640
Tian Qiperikota

128
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
painted a strongւwane on your body.

129
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,880
That's great.

130
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,680
Fu Qingyu, you wait for me!

131
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm so angry!

132
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Fu Qingyu, you think I'm the one who's just like you?

133
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,680
You want me to be a dumbass? You're dreaming!

134
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Miss Lu, you're so petty.

135
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
My nephew is just a little bit of a person.

136
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
He's cold-blooded and heartless.

137
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,480
But he's so cute when he's here.

138
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,880
You're so single.

139
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,680
Why would I be single? I don't owe him anything.

140
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,080
If you think I'm wrong, then let's not be a match.

141
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,280
I'm his uncle.

142
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,480
And you're his aunt.

143
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,680
Is this meaningful?

144
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,680
It's not worth it.

145
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,080
It seems so.

146
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,880
From now on, you're my younger brother.

147
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,480
Fine, you're my elder sister.

148
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
Little brother!

149
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,480
Big sister!

150
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,680
Big sister!

151
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,280
Little brother!

152
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,080
You're just like him.

153
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Fu Qingyu, open the door for me!

154
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,880
Don't be so careless! I know you're at home!

155
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,480
I can give you a big pot of medicine!

156
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,880
Why don't you open the door?

157
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,080
Open the door! Give me the medicine!

158
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
Who's the big pot?

159
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,280
You're a fool!

160
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,880
You're not giving me the medicine? I'll find it myself!

161
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,280
I feel like I'm almost done.

162
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,880
You've seen this mask?

163
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
No.

164
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,280
You're lying.

165
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,480
You're not even telling me!

166
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,080
I think I've seen this mask, but I can't remember clearly.

167
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,880
Let go!

168
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,680
Ah Yu, why are you so rude to a weak woman?

169
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,880
This isn't your style.

170
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,680
She's suspicious.

171
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,280
I'm also very careful.

172
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,680
I'm not a bad person.

173
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,880
I'm just a bad person.

174
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
I'm just a bad person.

175
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,680
I'm also a bad person. She's definitely not a bad person.

176
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,880
You're also a bad person. You're a bad person.

177
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,080
Why are you eating even the crab?

178
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Crab?

179
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,280
Oh my god! Why are you coming so fast?

180
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,480
This... Ah Yu, you're too much.

181
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,880
She's obviously eating it herself.

182
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
This is also my fault.

183
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
What a big thing, comrades!

184
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,280
You're saying that the grass is getting bigger?

185
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,480
How can you still drink wine? Your father is angry.

186
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,480
He's angry, so be it. There's nothing to be angry about.

187
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
You don't remember the bet you made with him?

188
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,680
You borrowed a thousand taels from him and opened a bar.
