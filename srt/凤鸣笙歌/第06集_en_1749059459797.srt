The old man is in the news.

After Feng Ming was born, he said...

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Is there such an old man?

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you understand that he wants to support the next generation of dreams?

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Dreaming is a piece of cake.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We really missed so many things.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I will show you

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
what business is all about.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is the biggest joke I've heard today.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Just wait and see the show.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I miss Lu Yun Sheng.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000

She is 9 years old.

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She is 90 years old.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
She is from the East to the West.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000

She is a good girl.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She is a good girl.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Unfortunately,

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I found this bad girl.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
She is so good.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Miss Lu.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Miss Lu.

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Miss Lu.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't go.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm looking for you.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You really come from the West.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You think of me.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do you know that I have run away

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
from the kitchen?

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I just said something weird.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Women must be careful of their health.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I will give you two bags of bread some day.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't care whether you are a good girl

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
or pretending to be a good girl.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You look so perverted.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can't accept it.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I really can't accept it.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
My stomach.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Little boy.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't eat my medicine next time.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I apologize to you.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I want to go to the kitchen.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I will go with you.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You are perverted.

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Miss Lu.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have something urgent to tell you.

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
About Zhen Xing and Feng Ming Sheng.

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I have a good idea.

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But I don't have a painter.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I want to keep it.

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think you are the best choice.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't have money.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't think about it.

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Give it to me.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why?

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't pull me.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't want to.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Promise me.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Miss Lu.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Qing Chen.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
See?

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't ask.

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We are just a few people in the restaurant.

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Who doesn't have a plan?

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That Lu.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
She is not a free woman.

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
She can lie to the boss.

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But she can't lie to your sister.

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a pity that you are so crazy.

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I am so crazy.

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Sister.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why are you so confident?

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Go back to work.

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You really are superstective.

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What are you gonna do?

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
In this small theater,

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
you will be Rotten Back Open,

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
when Xiaodgrad's going to be hit.

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You have toã‚“ reccord Jiasheng's recipe.

134
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Ok, ok.

135
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's not valid at that time.

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Actually you should do it when you get good idea.

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If you have reach,

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I will ask myach 34's to be transferred over country.

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,120
Hurry up!

140
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,920
Don't be afraid.

141
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,680
Everyone, slow down.

142
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,960
We are in the same industry.

143
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
We can't do it without you.

144
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,080
We can't do it.

145
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,280
Let's have 500 yuan first.

146
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,560
Okay, let's do it.

147
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,360
Slow down.

148
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,080
Sister, you are so talented.

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,160
You are so touching.

150
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,000
I am so touched.

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,120
I trust you.

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,880
How many of the big stones

153
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,720
are the same as mine?

154
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Yes, yes.

155
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,400
Give me one more.

156
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,160
Give me one more.

157
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,720
Okay.

158
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,560
Give me one more.

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
Give me one more.

160
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,120
Don't come along.

161
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,000
Whoa!

162
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,720
As you are,

163
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
our family is all in- karena.

164
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,040
I will live my life

165
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,120
to die for her.

166
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,220
Listen,

167
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,320
could you give me 500 yuan instead?

168
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,800
I would like to do a lot for you.

169
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Really?

170
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,000
How?

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,560
It's so little.

172
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,320
Its aromas.

173
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,160

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,440
One million taels!

176
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,840
One million taels!

177
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,120
You've earned so much money.

178
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Please give me the antidote.

179
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,120
Of course.

180
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,440
I don't have it either.

181
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
What? You don't have it?

182
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,080
If you don't give me the antidote,

183
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,800
I'll... I'll just suck it.

184
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,360
You sucked it.

185
