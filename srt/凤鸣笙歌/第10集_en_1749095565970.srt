No matter what, I'll forgive all of you

10
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,940
Why do I need to Pearls Fently look after him?

11
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,000
Look into your eyes

12
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,600
Broke away the two enorme ice cubes

13
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,160
Go make your special porridge

14
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
Episode 1

15
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Interesting.

16
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
I don't know

17
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,840
how she's doing.

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,320
Do you like her a lot?

19
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,840
I...

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,440
I'm not sick.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,120
Why do I like her?

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,240
My husband

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,040
is a good man.

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,720
He's a tough man.

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,640
It's you.

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,200
Young Master, have we seen her?

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,360
You're so arrogant.

28
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,960
You should have known it.

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,040
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I was wrong.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She's the one you mentioned.

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Lu Yunsheng and Miss Lu.

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,680
How do you know my name?

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
I've never seen her before.

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,520
You just met her now, right?

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,680
Then...

37
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,400
Let's meet again.

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,240
This is our young master,

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,320
Feng Qingyu.

40
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,040
Feng Mingsheng's boss.

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,800
Hello.

42
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm Feng Qingyu.

43
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,880
Nice to meet you.

44
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,200
Hello.

45
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
I'm Lu Yunsheng.

46
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,320
I'm a third-time senior.

47
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,360
I just arrived in the capital.

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,360
Please take care of my business

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,840
in the future.

50
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,840
I'll give you a love price.

51
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Once,

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,760
I didn't cherish

53
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,960
my true feelings

54
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,840
in front of me.

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,360
I only knew that I lost my way

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,680
and then I fell into a trap.

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,000
Now I'm going to

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
meet you again.

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,840
I want to say three words to you.

60
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,040
Are you afraid?

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,560
I'm afraid.

62
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,560
I'll kill you

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,160
when I'm the most afraid.

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Miss Lu, you've just arrived in the capital.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sure you haven't come to Feng Mingsheng.

66
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,600
How about

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,080
we take you to meet up?

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,480
Do you want money?

69
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,200
I'll give you a discount.

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Eight hundred?

71
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,560
I'll take care of it if I'm not eating or drinking.

72
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,360
Let's go.

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:32,920
Let's go.

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,680
If you're not eating or drinking,

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
I'll go.

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's go.

77
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,960
Hurry.

78
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,440
What are you picking?

79
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,680
Take the medicine.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,760
Why don't you take it?

81
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,920
You asked me to take this.

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,040
What's wrong with asking you to take this?

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,920
Didn't you eat it well before?

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
You don't want to poison me, do you?

85
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,040
I poison you.

86
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,640
What are you doing?

87
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,360
People are in the martial arts world.

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
How can you not love me?

89
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,840
I'm Chen Yu Luo Yan.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,240
I'm a flower.

91
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,760
People who like me...

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,680
You're doing this again.

93
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,920
are nine years old.

94
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,960
They're 90 years old.

95
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,400
From the east gate to the west gate.

96
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,440
They're noble and noble.

97
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
They're famous in the world.

98
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,440
They're rich and talented.

99
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,360
They're martial arts and martial arts.

100
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,760
They're all worshiped in my gold and stone clans.

101
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,160
I can't let you

102
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
find such a person.

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,440
Why are you laughing?

104
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,760
Then...

105
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,440
I'm a bad person.

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,840
You're a bad person.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,960
Of course, you're a bad person.

108
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,960
Have one.

109
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,120
You didn't eat like this before.

110
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,440
How can I eat it?

111
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,400
You're done.

112
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,680
Have one.

113
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm like this.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They're all worshiped in my gold and stone clans.

115
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,160
I didn't.

116
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
You're so cute.

117
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,680
Bo Jun,

118
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,640
take them out with me.

119
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,440
Here you are.

120
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,560
Well...

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,960
Thanks for your dinner.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,200
You're not letting go?

123
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,800
What should I do?

124
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
You're already very greasy.

125
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,000
You still want to be more greasy?

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
Fine.

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,400
Then...

128
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
you should be careful on your way back.

129
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,600
You're the most cowardly one.

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
You...

131
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Why are you back again?

132
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
That's interesting.

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
I didn't expect that I was in that time and space.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,400
I was a bitter little duck.

135
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
But I...

136
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
Young Master.

137
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
Young Master.

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,600
What's wrong?

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Xiaoyang.

140
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,400
I experienced the same thing again.

141
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,200
You mean...

142
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,400
you were killed by that ghost killer again?

143
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,200
Young Master.

144
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,400
I saw you were shining and glowing.

145
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,800
You were a peach blossom.

146
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
You were a little bit distant from me.

147
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
Congratulations.

148
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't be afraid. Just one silver is enough.

149
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Our Young Master won't believe what you said.

150
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,400
Dr. Lu.

151
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,800
Is that enough?

152
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,200
How do you know my name?

153
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,000
So he's the one you met in the fairy tale.

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,600
One of them? What nonsense are you talking about?

155
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,800
I don't know him at all.

156
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,600
My name is Feng Qingyu.

157
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I know him now.

158
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,800
Seeing you so rich, I'll call you my good friend.

159
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

160
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
The white ghost is awake.

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Do you dare to come with me?

162
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Of course. Who's afraid of who?

163
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Xiaoyang, you go back and stay.

164
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,200
Let's go.

165
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,400
Let's go.

166
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
I'm so good at dreaming.

167
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm so good at taking medicine.

168
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
He only cheats on me.

169
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,000
He's so noisy.

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
He only jokes on me.

171
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,400
I'm so far away from the world.

172
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,800
I'm so good at flying birds.

173
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,200
But he's so noisy.

174
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,800
He's so noisy that he doesn't listen to me.

175
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,400
I'm so good at taking medicine.

176
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
He only cheats on me.

177
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,800
He's so noisy.

178
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,600
He only jokes on me.

179
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm so far away from the world.

180
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,400
I'm so good at flying birds.

181
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
But he's so noisy.

182
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,200
He doesn't listen to me.

183
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
I'm so good at dreaming.

184
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
I'm so good at taking medicine.
