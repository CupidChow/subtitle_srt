Don't look at me.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Fu Qingyu.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Sister Hao. I haven't seen you for a long time.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I miss you.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who is your sister?

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't drink with me.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You hit my mouth.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm drunk.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Cheers.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Here.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is for you.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's for you.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll give you a drink of water.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll make you

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
feel lonely.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What did you set up?

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have nothing to do with it.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you can make

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the little girl in Gu Xiao Yu feel lonely.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Gu Xiao Yu is my sister.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Gu Xiao Yu is my sister.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Gu Xiao Yu is who?

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
一个缓得的老板

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Sheng come to you.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,960
Yes!

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Me...

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sheng!

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What's going on?

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,280
benefit

77
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,260
It's not right.

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,580
Another place I will tell you.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,160
It turned out to be the big fool of Fengqingromen.

80
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,120
I met you.

81
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,320
Such a cute girl.

82
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,360
It's a long life.

83
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,960
What are you talking about?

84
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,040
Sister Hao.

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,960
If I say

86
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,320
I've died ten times,

87
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
do you believe it?

88
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,760
I believe it.

89
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,240
Then I'm telling you.

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
There's a parallel space in this world.

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,640
There's another self in this world.

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Do you believe it?

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,160
I know you don't believe it.

94
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,360
I believe it.

95
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,880
I knew you were my good sister.

96
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,080
The moon is so beautiful.

97
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,480
It's a pity that I can only see the moon forever.

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,080
Maybe this is like my life.

99
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,160
I'll never have the light.

100
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,080
The moon is also light.

101
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,720
Sometimes I think there are two of you.

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,160
But they are all very close.

103
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,640
How can I be so close to Feng Xingyun?

104
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm not Feng Xingyun.

105
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,440
So you're not Feng Xingyun.

106
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,480
Who are you?

107
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,880
Let me introduce you.

108
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,960
I'm Gu Xiaoyu tonight.

109
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,240
Is it better than Feng Xingyun?

110
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,880
Your parents?

111
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,320
But I think your name is very good.

112
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,600
Lu Yunsheng.

113
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,120
Very good.

114
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,480
A man with sweet mouth.

115
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,960
His life is not good.

116
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,240
A woman with hard mouth.

117
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
His life is not bad.

118
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,000
Whether you're Feng Xingyun or Gu Xiaoyu,

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
you're all my good friends.

120
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
I'll support you without hesitation.

121
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,880
Me too.

122
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,480
Why don't you get sad?

123
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,640
Life is short.

124
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,640
I can't get sad when I meet my nephew.

125
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,920
Do you say that to anyone?

126
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,640
What are you doing?

127
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,640
You.

128
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,160
Go and cool here.

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,680
I...

130
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,000
Lu Yunsheng.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,200
If you only have one day left,

132
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,680
what are you going to do?

133
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,160
I'm going to change my life.

134
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,520
I'll be the real one.

135
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,600
I'll be the light.

136
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,800
What about me?

137
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
It's just a matter of time.

138
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,560
That's the situation.

139
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
It's really complicated.

140
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
My nephew.

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,520
You're not going to be a kid.

142
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,160
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

143
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,440
How about this?

144
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Tonight,

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
you'll go with me to the city.

146
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,840
You'll be able to hear the voice of the village.

147
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,160
You'll see the ghost killing.

148
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,880
Okay.

149
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,360
Feng Xingyun.

150
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,600
I believe you.

151
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,040
Miss Wu.

152
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,680
I believe you.

153
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
Xiaoyang, you believe her?

154
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,160
Fine. I believe you.

155
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,280
Anyway,

156
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,720
tonight,

157
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,280
I'll catch the ghost killer.

158
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,040
Why are you still here?

159
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,240
Why are you so anxious?

160
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,160
Maybe it's because of Xia Yu.

161
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,040
She'll come over later.

162
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Feng Xingyun.

163
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,160
I've made up for you today.

164
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,080
You're lucky today.

165
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Great.

166
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,680
Take your fortune.

167
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,720
Don't let this kid run away again.

168
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,040
I'm doing it.

169
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,040
Don't worry.

170
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,760
Just watch.

171
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,000
If the ghost killer can show up,

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,320
I'll write it down.

173
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,480
Come over and try.

174
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,520
Why are you still here?

175
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
It's so cold today.

176
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,680
Why don't we just fight?

177
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,840
We'll be a team.

178
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,280
Why are you so serious?

179
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,280
You're right.

180
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
It's so hot.

181
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
I'm about to get hot.

182
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's go.

183
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,800
You're the one who's talking.

184
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,280
I think

185
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,880
your suspicion is the biggest.

186
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,600
Shut up.

187
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,480
I'm doing it for you.

188
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,440
You're so mean.

189
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,680
You're even threatening me.

190
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,880
Miss Luo,

191
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,840
she's just like that.

192
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,160
She's trying to get out of the world.

193
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,160
Miss Luo, don't be so serious.

194
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,480
You...

195
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,800
You...

196
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,200
Xiaoya.

197
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,920
You're really good at talking.

198
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,000
Say something more.

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,560
My son?

200
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,920
I think I'm really...

201
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,280
done.

202
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,480
Xiaoya.

203
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,680
Ya Ya.

204
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,800
This is the power of love.

205
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,320
Don't talk nonsense.

206
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,240
Let's celebrate it

207
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,360
with Xiaoya.

208
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
Okay.

209
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,560
I'll sing with you today.

210
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,000
I won't be back.

211
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,160
What do you mean?

212
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,400
I haven't done anything yet.

213
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,280
My son,

214
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,600
you can do it yourself.

215
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,560
We won't wait for you.

216
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,320
Right, Ya Ya?

217
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,800
Let's go.

218
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,440
Let's go.

219
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,760
I...

220
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,800
Let's go.

221
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Bye.

222
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,240
Let's go.

223
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,360
Wait for me.

224
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,240
What do you want?

225
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
You don't have anyone to talk with.

226
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,480
What does that to you?

227
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,560
Yu.

228
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,240
Wait.

229
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,400
How many times have I told you?

230
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,720
You have to call Xiaoyu in the night.

231
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,840
Xiaoyu.

232
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,760
you are getting more and more difficult to understand.

233
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,560
Okay, Xiaoyu.

234
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,240
Little brother and Qingquan

235
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,240
He ran away from the forest and asked me to eat the medicine

236
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,640
You are so nice, he only cheered for me

237
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,040
Sorry, he is so naughty

238
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,440
He only laughed at me, I only wanted to dance and laugh

239
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,640
I made a flying bird of the sky

240
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,240
I was so mad that I was so loud that I couldn't stop

241
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,840
In the future, this is a dream, this dream is so nice

242
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,640
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

243
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,540
I only wanted to be nice

244
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,040
He only cheered for me, I only wanted to be naughty

245
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,440
He only laughed at me, I only wanted to dance and laugh

246
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,640
I made a flying bird of the sky

247
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,840
I was so mad that I couldn't stop

248
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,440
I only wanted to be nice

249
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,840
He only cheered for me, I only wanted to be nice

250
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,040
He only laughed at me, I was far away, but I didn't laugh

251
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,240
I was flying in the sky

252
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,840
I was making a fuss, I was just standing there, but I couldn't stop

253
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,440
It turns out that this is a dream, this dream is so great

254
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,840
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
