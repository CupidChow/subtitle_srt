Come on.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Come on.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You definitely can't find it.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Find it.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Come on.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You definitely can't find it.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Xiao Yang, are you okay?

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's all broken up.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You bear it.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Older Sister, you must have been so careless.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're playing games.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is it okay?

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm fine.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm fine.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm fine.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm fine.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm fine.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm fine.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm fine.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm fine.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm not in the right time.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's okay. It's okay.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's not necessary.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I fell by accident.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll take her to the clinic first.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's go.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's go.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Be careful.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's go.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's go.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're so scared.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How about we go back first?

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm a little scared.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why are you scared?

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You didn't cry and shouted to come with us.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's right.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm not worried about you two.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's okay if you burn my blood.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He doesn't like these scary places.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you better?

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's all right.

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But,

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't feel so painful when I think about it.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Then don't think about it.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Forget it.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's go to that side.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's fun to play.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't laugh at us.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm so scared.

94
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,000
Young man, you're bold.

95
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Dare to buy a mask?

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What's there to be afraid of?

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Xiaoyang,

98
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
pick one you like.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Young man, look.

100
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Is this nice?

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This...

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sure you like it.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think these two suit you.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This one.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is too ugly.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Aoxuan, why are you so happy today?

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You prepared so much food.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Today is my birthday.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Birthday?

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I made these for you.

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I hope you like it.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why didn't you say it earlier?

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We prepared a gift for you.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Compared to our relationship,

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't care about these.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do you still have any wish?

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If I have to say,

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I just hope that time can stop at this moment.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Aoxuan, what's wrong with you?

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why are you acting weird?

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Aoxuan, you're so good at cooking.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're joking.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No matter how good I am at cooking,

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not only your wife,

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
but also your born-in-law.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm also only a cook's wife.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't want to choose you.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm so independent.

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't say that.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Today is a good day.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Come on, let's have a toast.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Cheers.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Cheers.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Cheers.

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Cheers.

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Cheers.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's toast to Aoxuan,

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Qingcheng and the people who left for the country.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Cheers.

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Cheers.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Aoxuan, eat some.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Today,

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll use this magic of soul

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to erase all the memories of me.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Aoxuan,

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
if time can stop at this moment,

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
how good it will be.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Unfortunately, I don't have time.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You haven't changed at all these years.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But I'm no longer the same as before.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If I had a dream in my life,

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I would regret it.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If I could start over,

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
if I could return to the past,

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I wouldn't have been in this life.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I wouldn't have met you again.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Aoxuan.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Aoxuan.

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Aoxuan.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Aoxuan.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Aoxuan.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Wake up.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Aoxuan.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Are you just a ghost?

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Childe.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't scare me.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm not your childe.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Childe.

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're still a childe.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You must live a good life.

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Aoxuan.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Who hurt you like this?

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's me.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Aoxuan.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What's the problem?

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why does she look so young?

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ya Ya.

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
She's our good friend, Aoxuan.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
She doesn't need me in her memory.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Feng Qing Yu.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
In this death game,

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
if you and I have to sacrifice one person,

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll die now.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The ending is also full of tears.

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I said I was still young.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I wanted to go to Hongcheng.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
When I got old, she ran away from a forest.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I was so tired that I wanted you.

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
She only loved me.

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
She was so noisy and noisy.

192
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
She only laughed at me.

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I was so far away from her.

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was so scared.

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I was so scared that I was so scared.

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I was so scared that I was so scared.

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I was so scared that I was so scared.

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's me.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I said I was still young.

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
She didn't realize that I was still young.

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
She didn't realize that I was still young.

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
She was so scared that she ran away from a forest.

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I was so scared that I wanted to go to Hongcheng.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was so scared that I was so scared.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I was so scared that I was so scared.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm so happy to see you

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
