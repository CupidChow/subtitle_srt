Episode 9

5
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,740
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,740
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,740
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,740
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,740
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,740
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,740
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,740
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,740
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
You said you don't know the greetings

16
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,740
The brain never stopped

17
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,900
The song end in this YAOOOO

18
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,240
Do you know how to celebrate the warming both 안낾

19
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,380
Four months

20
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,700
the whole world will be at peace

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,360
Mind control

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Episode 1

23
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
Don't let me out.

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Or you'll die one by one.

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
You can't live without me.

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
You can't live without me.

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
They're here.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
Brother.

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
What are you doing here?

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Are you kidding me?

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Have you seen this mask before?

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
No.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
I don't know.

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
If it wasn't for you,

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
we wouldn't force you to do it.

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm a girl from a village.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
I don't understand these messy things.

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
I really don't know

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
why you're asking me

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
for such a strange mask.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
If you're not a ghost,

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
how can you have a mask?

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
I found this in your room.

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
What else do you want to say?

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Yes.

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
That's right.

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
It's me.

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
What can you do to me?

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
You're a ghost.

50
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Why did you kill me?

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Kill you?

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
You rich people

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
are always like a fake cup.

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
You're so high-ranking.

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
represent these poor people.

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
I want to be born.

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
I want to be a head of the palace.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
I want to be a head of the palace.

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
You rich people are so despicable.

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Did you hear me?

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
I want to be born.

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
What?

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
I want to be a head of the palace.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
You're so stupid.

66
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
It's time.

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Let's go.

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
I want to be born.

69
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
I want to be a head of the palace.

70
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
Fang Qianyu, don't go.

71
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
I want to be born.

72
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Don't think I'm here

73
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
or I'll go out.

74
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Don't wait for me, Fang Qianyu.

75
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
You finally catch the murderer.

76
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Are you happy now?

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Anyway,

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm just a man.

79
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
I don't know how to be happy.

80
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Mr. Feng,

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
can you give me the antidote?

82
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Don't play with me.

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
I don't want to eat you.

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Little wound.

85
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
Why are you here?

86
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Do you miss me?

87
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
I miss you.

88
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
You're so kind.

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
What are you talking about?

90
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
Disgusting.

91
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Wait for me.

92
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Hurry up.

93
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Wait for me.

94
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Hurry up.

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Cheers.

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
Why are you

97
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
making us so anxious?

98
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Are you giving us a red light?

99
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Red light is fine.

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
But not now.

101
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Where's Miss Lu?

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Miss Lu.

103
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
You only have Miss Lu in your eyes.

104
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Our friendship is too simple.

105
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
You can't use some high-level words.

106
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Miss Lu.

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Mr. Yan is so handsome today.

108
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
I always make you

109
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
look so handsome.

110
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,360
It's hard for you to know.

111
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
So,

112
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
what do you think of me today?

113
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
I really don't understand.

114
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Some people

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
don't know their own name.

116
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Exactly.

117
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Miss Lu is so handsome.

118
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm so fresh today.

119
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
I think

120
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm the one who's forced to do this.

121
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
I don't need your antidote anymore.

122
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Miss Lu.

123
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Actually, you've already

124
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
taken the antidote that day.

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
What?

126
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
How dare you fool me?

127
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Miss Lu.

128
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Don't be angry.

129
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
Otherwise, you'll be

130
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
so beautiful today.

131
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Come on.

132
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
I toast to everyone.

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
The water is so clear.

134
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
You can't leave

135
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
the wisdom and talent of everyone.

136
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
I toast to you.

137
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Come on.

138
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Let's toast.

139
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Come on.

140
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Come on.

141
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Come on.

142
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Come on.

143
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Young Master.

144
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Xiaoya is still nice to me.

145
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Come on, Young Master Yan.

146
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Have some shrimp.

147
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
You're too thin.

148
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Men are more strong.

149
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
You're more handsome.

150
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
You're more attractive.

151
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Who said Xiaoya is thin?

152
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Xiaoya is rich.

153
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
I don't believe you can show it to everyone.

154
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
I don't want to show it to everyone.

155
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm afraid that

156
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
I'll show my son's breaststroke.

157
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
The girls I'm doing

158
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
will be confused by me.

159
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
You have two faces in the night.

160
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
You think you're handsome?

161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
You're actually a spirit.

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
You're not good enough

163
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
to be a girl.

164
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
You're useless.

165
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
You're useless.

166
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
You're a little over that.

167
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Say it again.

168
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,360
You're useless.

169
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Young Master.

170
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Young Master.

171
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Young Master.

172
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
I'm sorry.

173
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Young Master.

174
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Stop.

175
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Stop.

176
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Come on.

177
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Come on.

178
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Come on.

179
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Come on.

180
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Come on.

181
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Come on.

182
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Young Master.

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Come on.

184
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Come on.

185
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Come on.

186
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Come on.

187
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Come on.

188
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
If I could keep doing this,

189
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
I would be happy

190
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
to have a good job.

191
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Xiaoya,

192
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
you've been moving more and more lately.

193
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Are you only going to play the piano

194
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
and say you love me?

195
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,360
You're still going to play the piano?

196
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
You're wrong.

197
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
You're just a little...

198
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Young Master.

199
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Young Master.

200
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Who's here?

201
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Young Master.

202
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Young Master.

203
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Who's here?

204
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Who's here?

205
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Let's have a look.

206
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
A person is here.

207
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
It's really quite surprising.

208
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
The person is here.

209
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Let's have a look.

210
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Let's have a look.

211
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Let's have a look.

212
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Let's have a look.

213
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Lu Yisheng.

214
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Why are you giving me a footprints on your feet?

215
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Why are you here?

216
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Why am I here?

217
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
What was it that you did to me

218
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
last night?

219
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,320
What?

220
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,080
What did I do to you?

221
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,960
I should ask you.

222
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,720
I remember

223
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,000
I was killed yesterday.

224
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,600
Then I woke up

225
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,840
and ran here in front of the tomb.

226
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,000
Gu Wen.

227
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,800
Gu Wen.

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,120
I don't want to see you anymore.

229
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,280
I'm wearing a shoe.

230
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,720
Get up.

231
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,360
I saw your waist.

232
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,720
Brother.

233
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,800
Why are you here?

234
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,400
Why are you here?

235
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
It's not closed.

236
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,680
Why are you sleeping?

237
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,640
I never sleep.

238
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,200
You're good.

239
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,080
You're good.

240
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,720
Boss.

241
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,520
Chuan Xi.

242
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Boss.

243
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,840
I'm wrong.

244
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,360
Please forgive me.

245
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,880
Where did you go wrong?

246
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
I'm wrong everywhere.

247
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,800
I'll forgive you for doing me a favor.

248
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,720
Is it difficult?

249
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,440
It must be a good thing.

250
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,200
Boss.

251
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,000
I'll go after I get the money.

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,280
Do you remember the ghost mask?

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,400
It's for the people who helped me find the mask.

254
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,520
You're giving it to him?

255
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,600
Don't worry.

256
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,160
Money is the devil's promise.

257
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,560
Take care of my brother.

258
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,960
Wait for your news.

259
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,760
Bye.

260
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Go by yourself.

261
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,600
He...

262
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,480
He's a big brother.

263
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
I'm not dead.

264
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,920
Why are you shouting?

265
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,200
What are you doing?

266
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,840
Who watched you?

267
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm watching the moon.

268
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,620
Then I'm going to kill Ahn Choo.

269
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,280
Maybe I'll see you in Dongkwon.

270
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,480
But I will be marinade later.

271
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,560
I can handle it at it's best.

272
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,340
Do you want to send Ah Choo back here?

273
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,120
No!

274
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,900
Don't worry, not yet.

275
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,240
Never say anything!

276
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,980
Zhen.

277
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,480
I'm going back now.

278
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Have you ever talked about the Ghost King?

279
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Ghost King?

280
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,480
This little man is still alive.

281
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Yes.

282
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
The Ghost Face and the Ghost King

283
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
have something to do with them.

284
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Yes, you can know that.

285
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
You can do it.

286
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
Of course, I don't only know

287
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
what they have to do with each other.

288
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
I also know who they are.

289
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Who are they?

290
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Give me 10,000 taels of gold.

291
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
I'll tell you.

292
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
I...

293
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
I'll go ask for a share with you.

294
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Is life important or money important?

295
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Of course, it's...

296
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Life.

297
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
You're so smart.

298
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
10,000 taels of gold.

299
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
10,000 taels of gold.

300
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
How can I find so much gold?

301
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,480
I know who you are.

302
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
You're the Ghost King.

303
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Only the Ghost King

304
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,480
can pass through so many worlds.

305
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Guess what?

306
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,480
How can I kill you?

307
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Is it because of a rare thing?

308
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,480
It's not a fairy?

309
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
You're right.

310
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Why?

311
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
I like him so much.

312
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
He dares to kill me.

313
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,480
Feng Qingyu, you hit me?

314
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Gu Xiaoyu, are you stupid?

315
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,480
The facts are all in front of you.

316
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
What else can I say?

317
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
I'll go find him.

318
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Tell me.

319
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Why did you kill me?

320
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
I didn't kill you.

321
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
You're still arguing?

322
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
I've already seen it.

323
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
What did you see?

324
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
You killed me in the castle today.

325
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,480
I didn't kill you.

326
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
I'm telling you.

327
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
You should tell me

328
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
whether you want it or not.

329
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
You're a pretty little face.

330
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Don't want it.

331
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
You're a good painter.

332
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Don't want it either.

333
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
You're a good painter.

334
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
You're a good painter.

335
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
Yu, you're too much.

336
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
How can you treat a girl like this?

337
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Do you know that she's the murderer?

338
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Miss Lu is kind.

339
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
She doesn't even dare to kill me.

340
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,480
How could she be a murderer?

341
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
You're a sweet dog.

342
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
No.

343
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
He's here.

344
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
I'm going to the far side.

345
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
I'm going to the sky.

346
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
I'm going to the sky.

347
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
I'm going to the sky.

348
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
I'm going to the sky.

349
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
I'm going to the sky.

350
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
I'm going to the sky.

351
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
I'm going to the sky.

352
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
I'm going to the sky.

353
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
I'm going to the sky.

354
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
I'm going to the sky.

355
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
I'm going to the sky.

356
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm going to the sky.

357
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
I'm going to the sky.

358
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
I'm going to the sky.

359
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
I'm going to the sky.

360
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
I'm going to the sky.

361
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
I'm going to the sky.

362
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
I'm going to the sky.

363
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
There's no time.

364
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
I'm going to the forfeit.

365
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
there is no time.

366
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
I'm going to the sky.

367
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
I'm going to the sky.

368
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
Name the puppy.

369
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Let's eat some snack.

370
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Help yourself.

371
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Take it easy.
