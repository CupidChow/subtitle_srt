00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,864
Yixi, what's wrong?

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,136
Is the demonic energy flaring up?

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,832
Yixi.

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,799
Don't shut me out. Let me in.

32
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,744
I can help you.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Yixi.

34
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,456
No.

35
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,959
I don't want you to see me like this.

36
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,120
Yixi.

00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,464
Yixi.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Yixi.

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,680
I know this isn't your true self.

40
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,039
The Night Deity is our enemy.

41
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,639
Only you can control him.

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,360
Only you can protect everyone.

43
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,560
Yixi, you're not the Night Deity.

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,479
You have a home now.

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,280

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240

47
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,400
Don't you want to travel?

48
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,960
I haven't shown you shadow plays.

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,479
You've never tried
our kingdom's candied hawthorns.

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,680
Yixi, hold on.

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
Stay strong.

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,064
Yixi.

53
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,632
Yixi.

54
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,584
Yixi.

55
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,928
Yixi.

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm here.

57
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,199
Chen, do you know?

58
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,879
I've been thinking all this time.

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,639
I hated them.

60
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,120
I hated how they
treated me like a monster.

61
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,800
I hated their beatings and curses.

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,039
All their looks were the same.

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,000
If this world is so cruel,

64
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,400
why should I protect them?

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,719
Their lives mean nothing to me.

66
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,319
But your words

67
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,439
made me realize
I couldn't lie to myself.

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,680
Deep down,

69
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,039
I still yearn for their acceptance.

70
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,340
I still want to live

71
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,639
and protect the Three Realms.

72
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,839
If it weren't for me,

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,319
you wouldn't have become like this.

75
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,000
You are the Sword Master.

76
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,439
You should've been your parents' pride.

77
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,496
I understand you.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,024
Yixi.

79
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,784
I'm right here.

80
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,279
Right here with you.

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,336
Take a sip.

82
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,879
It might calm the symptoms.

83
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,568
Another sip.

84
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,688
One more,

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,352
and it'll subside.

86
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
Better now?

87
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,079
- Stop!
- Stop!

88
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:38,620
Wan Guchen,

89
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,120
you brought this evil deity back,

90
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,000
plunging Wanfeng into grave danger.

91
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,899
The Emperor is furious.

92
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,368
You

93
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,779
have nowhere to run.

94
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:49,620
Wan Guchen,

95
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,379
surrender quietly.

96
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,056
We will

97
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,420
grant you an intact corpse.

98
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,620
Yixi, don't be afraid.

99
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,280
Yixi.

100
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,660
Don't let the deity take over.

101
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,472
Yixi.

102
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,459
Stop this!

103
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:08,620
No more senseless killing!

104
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:09,740
Don't kill me!

105
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,379
Tell her to spare me!

106
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,139
Guchen.

107
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,939
I'm your own uncle!

108
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,180
From now on,

109
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,819
I won't compete with you for anything.

110
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,139
Just make her spare my life!

111
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:22,180
Guchen.

112
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,759
Yixi, come down now!

113
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,079
He's no threat to us.

114
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:26,660
Come down!

115
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,379
You cursed creature!

116
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,648
How dare you return?

117
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,680
You sinner!

118
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,888
Get out!

119
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,660
Get out!

120
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,980
You walking calamity!

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,899
How dare you come?

122
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,100
This is all your doing!

123
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,339
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:09,459
Give my wife back!

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,759
Return my mother!

126
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,160
Why didn't you die instead?

127
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,952
Mother.

128
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,399
Get lost, you jinx!

129
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,000
Get out!

130
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,920
You're the eternal sinner
of our kingdom!

131
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,120
May you suffer
through endless lifetimes!

132
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,600
- Die miserably!
- Get out now!

133
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,279
Scram!

134
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,799
Don't touch my Xiaochuan!

135
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,784
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:40,416
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,200
Sorry won't fix anything!

138
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,340
My Xiaochuan

139
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,279
was choked to death.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,279
He was so young.

141
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,279
So kind-hearted.

142
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,840
What did he do wrong?

143
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,000
What did he do wrong?

144
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,039
Mother, I don't think he's evil.

145
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,799
Having a demon sealed inside is sad.

146
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,919
You won't kill anyone, right?

147
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,440
Xiaochuan's dead.

148
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:14,139
I won't live either.

149
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,344
It's you two

150
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,019
who killed us both!

151
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Even as a ghost,

152
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,879
I'll haunt you beyond death!

153
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,200
Heavens above!

154
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,240
Why didn't they die instead?

155
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,519
Your unfilial grandson

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
pays respects to you.

157
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,000
Get up.

158
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,872
Get up.

159
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,480
Guchen,

160
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,400
now,

161
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,799
our kingdom

162
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,840
suffers heavy casualties.

163
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,480
How can I

164
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,720
remain as the king?

165
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,360
I'm guilty.

166
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,720
Let me atone with death!

167
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,552
Grandfather.

168
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,856
Grandfather.

169
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,399
My time grows short.

170
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,799
But our kingdom

171
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,799
faces imminent peril.

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,799
The people's survival

173
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,984
now rests

174
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,419
solely on you.

175
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,976
Guchen,

176
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,200
swear

177
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,879
to save our kingdom,

178
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,360
to save these countless innocent lives.

179
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,080
I swear it, Grandfather.

180
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,992
Yixi.

181
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,152
Did I

182
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,799
do all these?

183
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,688
No.

184
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,279
This isn't your fault.

185
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yixi.

186
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,220
Wherever you go,

187
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,720
I'll stay by your side.

188
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,080
You once promised

189
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,120
to show me all life's joys.

190
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,960
If I could choose one thing,

191
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,139
I'd marry you.

192
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,240

You were rigorously selected
by the Nine Heavens as the Sword Master,

270
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,440
but you'd throw
your life away for a woman.

271
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,319
You've disgraced the Nine Heavens.

or not,

293
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,079

294
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,039

00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:18,656
Speak.

302
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:21,099
We've recently observed

303
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,420
numerous Night Clan members
active near Wanyingzhou.

304
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:25,140
We suspect

305
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,180
they've established a stronghold there.

306
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,900
We request
your intervention in this matter.

307
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,592

308
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:45,312
This is

309
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,220
my reincarnation after three centuries.

310
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Excuse me,

311
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,319
could you show me the way out?

312
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,359
I can't find it.

313
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,319
And my ankle's sprained.

314
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,240
Could you help me?

315
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:13,696
I'll reward you with this jade pendant.

316
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,608
Miss,

317
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,519
are you alone here?

318
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,299
My father abandoned us when I was young.

319
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,859
My mother and I relied on each other.

320
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,619
But then

321
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,099
she fell gravely ill

322
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,488
and left me.

323
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,240
How tragic.

324
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,319
We know the way.

325
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,256
Come with us.

326
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,039
Yes, we'll guide you.

327
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,279
Thank you.

328
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,696
Let's go.

329
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:42,656

00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:46,048

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,808
Slow down.

333
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,720
Is this the way out?

334
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,960
Why does the mist keep thickening?

335
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,759
Of course this isn't.

336
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:06,559
If you leave now,

337
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,319
how can we enjoy you?

338
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,400

339
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,680
The taste is indeed good.

340
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,559

341
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,079

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,079
Weren't you eager earlier?

344
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,640
Why run now?

345
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,559
Such potent vital energy.

346
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,768
As expected,

347
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,119
men's vile desires

348
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,359
make excellent nourishment.

349
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,200
Another one?

350
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,776

Help!

353
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,000
My foot hurts!

354
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,640
Help!

355
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,559

356
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,680
Is there anyone?

Please help me.

363
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,656
I'm so scared.

364
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,920
I just saw over there,

365
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,160
two people died horribly.

366
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,039
Could you help me?

367
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,359
Sir, please.

368
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,160
Don't you know

369
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,624

370
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,440
How should I know

371
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,180
how they died?

372
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,119
Why not

373
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,420
join them?

374
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,240
It's you causing trouble here.

375
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,400
You're an immortal.

376
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,000
No wonder I couldn't harm you.

377
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,680
You are quite attractive.

378
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,619
It'd be a shame

379
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,032
to let you die.

380
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,720
Why not let me enjoy you first?

381
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,400
How dare you!

382
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,559
Do you know who I am?

383
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,279
Quite decent.

384
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,279
How interesting.

385
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,880
The more you push me away,

386
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,319
the more intrigued I become.

387
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,279
Let me see

388
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,240
what you'll look like

389
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,339
after breaking your rules.

390
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,339
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

391
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,559
You grow more fascinating by the minute.

392
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,000
My name is Bai Chuli.

393
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,216
Your name?

394
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,359
Stop causing trouble.

395
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,880
If you don't want me to do that,

396
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,599
let's make a deal.

397
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,359
Stay by my side forever,

398
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,440
and I'll stop harming people.

399
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:29,952
Deal?

400
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,079
I've never seen someone so shameless.

401
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:35,900
If you harm anyone again,

402
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,859
I won't spare you.

403
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,779
I've seen countless men's eyes.

404
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:43,740
You can't fool me.

405
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,059
You're clearly attracted to me.

406
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:51,579
But that's fine.

407
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,980
I enjoy challenges.

408
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,420
Why are you here?

409
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,180
That woman was the former Bai Yixi.

410
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,259
So you found her after all.

411
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:09,259
I've waited for 300 years.

412
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,299
Now, I've finally found her.

413
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,339
But do you know the Night Deity
still resides within her?

414
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:19,660
When the Night Deity's power awakens,

415
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,460
you must kill her
to protect the Three Realms.

416
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:25,900
What did you say?

417
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

418
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,660
If I'd told you,

419
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,700
you might not have waited for 300 years

420
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,619
to kill the Night Deity again.

421
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,980
If that's the case,

422
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,460
I refuse to be the Sword Master.

423
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:45,819
I won't harm her.

424
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,819
This is her destiny.

425
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,859
You can abandon your position.

426
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:52,619
Others will take the role.

427
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,059
She'll still die regardless.

428
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:01,460
I've said my piece.

429
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,539
Consider the implications

430
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,859
carefully.

431
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:10,720
Why?

432
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,180
Why must it be this way?

433
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,740
(Perhaps your greatest wish)

434
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:21,740
(was to live freely and joyfully)

435
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,220
(even if the ending
would remain unchanged.)

436
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,339
(But I can't face you again.)

437
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,859
(I can't kill you again.)

438
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:32,940
(I won't let you endure the pain)

439
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,539
(of being parted from the beloved.)

440
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,880
Here you go, sir.

441
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,059
This is yours.

442
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,779
- Good.
- Good.

443
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Here, coming.

444
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,904
Here you are.

445
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,720
Madam Yu.

446
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,079
You're here, Mr. Shiyi.

447
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,160
What would you like?

448
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,119
I'll take her tonight.

449
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,400
No problem, Mr. Shiyi.

450
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,359
She's yours this evening.

451
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,680
- Good.
- Good.

452
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,440
- Good.
- Good.

453
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,416
Beautiful one.

454
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:41,536
Quickly!

455
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,160
Why so late?

456
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,519
You kept me waiting.

457
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,039
The finest things require patience.

458
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,736
What are you...?

459
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,599
So mischievous.

460
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,160
Beauty.

461
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,279
Don't waste the night.

462
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,680
Let's get to bed quickly.

463
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,160
Are you a monster?

464
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,119
Mr. Shiyi.

465
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,079
Have you forgotten me so soon?

466
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,759
You personally chose me moments ago.

467
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,640
I...

468
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,480
I know nothing.

469
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,768
Help!

470
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,720
Help!

471
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,559
Why is it you?

472
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,680
So it's you.

473
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,200
Seems fate truly binds us.

474
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,759
Weren't you in Wanyingzhou?

475
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,160
It's all for you.

476
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,039
To find you,

477
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,720
I've searched everywhere.

478
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,160
How else would we meet again so soon?

479
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,299
You promised to harm no one.

480
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,688
Unforgivable.

481
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,039
True. I did say that.

482
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,279
But on one condition.

483
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,480
You must stay by my side.

484
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,599
Have you forgotten?

485
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,512
So

486
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,799
you're the one who killed them.

487
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,480
Twisting logic.

488
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,048
Shamelessly unrepentant.

489
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,000
You think I won't kill you?

490
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
How ridiculous.

491
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,200
I am a member of the Night Clan,

492
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,400
feeding on human desires.

493
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,960
If they had all been noble like you,

494
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,839
I couldn't have slain them.

495
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,599
But you...

496
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:04,559
As an Upper Immortal
who specializes in hunting our clan,

497
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,000
why haven't you killed me yet?

498
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,839
Unless

499
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,519
you can't bear to do it.

500
00:31:15,136 --> 00:31:16,279
You...

501
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,312
What?

502
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,168
