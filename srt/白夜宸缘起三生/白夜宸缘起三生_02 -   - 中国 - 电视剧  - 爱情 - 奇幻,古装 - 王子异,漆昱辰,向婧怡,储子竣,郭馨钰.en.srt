Listen.

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,120
If you possess me while I sleep,

29
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,480
I will kill myself.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,280
You're overestimating
yourself, aren't you?

31
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,079
Your filthy body,

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,159
I refuse to enter it again.

33
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,000
I've never met anyone as foolish as you.

34
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,960
Voluntarily seeking punishment?

35
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,800
Once you recover,

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,879
we'll go retrieve my body
from the Divine Sword.

37
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,960
This time, the Night Deity
nearly took the Divine Sword.

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,560
We must strengthen our defenses.

39
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,759
300 years have passed.

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,159
The Night Deity has fully resurrected.

41
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,520
Re-sealing the Night Deity
is now urgent.

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,639
We urgently need to select

43
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,659
a new Divine Sword Master
from our disciples.

44
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:57,479
All elders and disciples
under my authority

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,479
may register for the contest.

46
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,680
Father, Master,

47
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,800
I'll participate.

48
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,000
Good.

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,319
Sign up.

50
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,400
What?

51
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,400
Sign up.

52
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,400
Be the Sword Master
and get the Divine Sword.

53
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,819
I know.

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,039
My lord,

55
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,759
I want to register.

56
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,219
She's signing up too?

57
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:32,979
Then I'll register too.

58
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,360
You're...?

59
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,039
Bai Xiaoying
isn't even a junior disciple.

60
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,960
She's merely a mortal cleaner

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,719
from the Yunxiu Pavilion.

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,680
Since she's from the Yunxiu Pavilion,

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,240
Yunya,

65
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,759
what do you think?

66
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,080
Just now, you said cultivation level

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,919
and status

68
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,879
didn't affect.

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,879
I believe

70
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,719
this rule stands.

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,439
I trust your judgment.

72
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,039
People from the Yunxiu Pavilion
show commendable courage.

73
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,879
You may participate.

74
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,319
Junior disciples
at the Divine Sword Trial Assembly

75
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,740
are already ridiculous.

76
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,360
Now even cleaning servants?

77
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,079
She's overreaching herself.

78
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,160
Exactly!

79
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,920
With such weak spiritual power,

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
why bother competing?

81
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,240
No matter.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,240
Just a practice target for us.

83
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,839
I'll help you get the Divine Sword

84
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,959
to regain my body.

85
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,360
Okay.

86
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,079
But remember.

87
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,800
When I get the Divine Sword,

88
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,839
it means your death.

89
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,019
I've tolerated you long enough.

90
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:56,139
Who do you think you are?

91
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,860
Provoking me repeatedly?

92
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:00,699
Kill me,

93
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,379
and you'll never regain your body.

94
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,779
How dare you threaten me?

95
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,319
What if I killed your mother?

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,519
I'll kill you next.

97
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,839
I'll kill your master,

98
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,839
your sect,

99
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,560
and everyone who defies me.

100
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,319
How dare you mess with me?

101
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,079
You hate me, don't you?

102
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,920
And you fear me too.

103
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,120
Demonic energy...

104
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,720
Why give me demonic energy?

105
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,360
To make you stronger

106
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,040
and make you a demon.

107
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,279
Your talent is exceptionally poor.

108
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,519
Forget rapid cultivation progress.

109
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,600
You can't even fly.

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,300
Without me,

111
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,959
you'll remain a lowly weakling
with minimal spiritual power for life.

112
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,079
You're turning me into a demon?

113
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,439
You should say,

114
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,439
"This is an honor."

115
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:32,579
Kill me if you want.

116
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,959
Don't insult me.

117
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,839
I love seeing you become

118
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,420
the wicked demon you despise.

119
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:42,579
Very soon,

120
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,959
you'll lose control

121
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,540
and become like me.

122
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,079
No way.

123
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,980
What happened?

124
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,980
I can conjure water.

125
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
I have an immortal root!

126
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,379
That's just my demonic energy

127
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,060
disguised as your immortal root.

128
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,259
But you've truly mastered it poorly.

129
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,379
Let me teach you.

130
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,740
What?

131
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,300
Stop it!

132
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,279
Now, you know what to do.

133
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,720
Don't defy me.

134
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,600
I might still consider
sparing your pathetic life.

135
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,220
Bai Xiaoying, what are you doing?

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Xiaoying?

137
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,699
Is it an intruder from the Night Clan?

138
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,860
Go inform the Master.

139
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:53,740
Xiaoying.

140
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,779
Are you there?

141
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,240
Sorry.

142
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,720
I was practicing.

143
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
My cultivation has grown.

144
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,000
I accidentally lost control.

145
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,279
Come on.

146
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,160
You don't have an immortal root.

147
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,000
How could you perform spells?

148
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,720
There's something else.

149
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,040
It seems I should report this
to the Master and elders.

150
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,620
No, no!

151
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,300
Please don't!

152
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,279
Yunqu.

153
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,720
To be honest,

154
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,920
I've developed an immortal root.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,519
Look.

156
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,059
I can't control it well yet.

157
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,820
I was afraid you'd laugh at me.

158
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,279
Xiaoying.

159
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,940
You have an immortal root now?

160
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,259
Yes.

161
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,519
Thank God.

162
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,039
When the Divine Sword awakened,

163
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,100
I happened to be practicing.

164
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,940
It activated my meridians

165
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,100
and immortal root.

166
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,740
I feel my cultivation
increasing every day.

167
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:58,940
But...

168
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,000
you know how it is, Yunqu.

169
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,600
I barely qualified
for the Divine Sword Trial Assembly.

170
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:05,740
Now, I have this immortal root.

171
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,600
If I somehow win against them,

172
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,360
it could boost everyone's morale.

173
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,379
Exactly!

174
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,559
And those moves
Xiaoying just demonstrated

175
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,580
show genuine improvement.

176
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:18,779
Maybe this time,

177
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,220
we can truly humiliate
those senior disciples.

178
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,240
Yes.

179
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:23,919
Okay.

180
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,100
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

181
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,620
But don't cause such disturbances again.

182
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:30,139
Practice well.

183
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:30,700
Yes.

184
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,059
Or the elders will come
to punish you themselves.

185
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,860
I knew you were the best, Yunqu.

186
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,580
We'll leave.

187
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:36,179
Alright.

188
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:36,600
Go.

189
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,299
I'm relieved you're okay, Xiaoying.

190
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,820
You practice so hard.

191
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
I won't hold you back.

192
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,419
I'll practice even harder.

193
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,960
Keep it up.

194
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,360
You too.

195
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,299
With your pitiful cultivation,
you want to get the Sword?

196
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,820
How ridiculous.

197
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:04,779
What's worse

198
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,879
is that I need trash
like you to regain my body.

199
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,580
(Look at your disgusting face.)

200
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,460
(If I were stronger,)

201
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,419
(I'd carve you into pieces right now.)

202
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:20,340
To attain divine understanding,

203
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,659
separate one's form.

204
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,000
Then one sees
their three souls and seven spirits.

205
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,139
(I can't kill him, separate us)

206
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,220
(or contain him.)

207
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,759
(Bound beside me.)

208
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,740
(I can't report it.)

209
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,539
(I can't give up now.)

210
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,700
(I need to find a way to give a hint.)

211
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,100
Elder Kongming,

212
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,860
I have a question.

213
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:44,700
Go ahead.

214
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,840
I've heard souls can
separate from bodies.

215
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,600
How long can they survive separation?

216
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,580
Common folk die instantly
when their souls depart.

217
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,980
Powerful cultivators
use soul-severing techniques

218
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:06,580
to move souls freely.

219
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:11,120
But this requires
tremendous spiritual energy.

220
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Otherwise, they perish from exhaustion.

221
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,039
(So that's how it is.)

222
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,360
(Ye Chenyuan's weakened cultivation)

223
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,299
(is to sustain his body.)

224
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,120
Then

225
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,759
what about the Night Deity?

226
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,200
If his soul separates from his body

227
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,440
and is bound to an immortal,

228
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,200
would he die of exhaustion?

229
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,019
Of course he would.

230
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,299
No matter how powerful he is,

231
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,200
he was still banished
by the Divine Sword.

232
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,200
How could he retain such power?

233
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,440
If he does this in the Nine Heavens,

234
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,879
I'll scatter his soul to the winds.

235
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,639
But what if because of
some magical artifact...?

236
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,519
Because of what?

237
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,379
Stop arguing!

238
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,919
Such baseless speculation is pointless.

239
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:05,779
Sit down.

240
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,759
How dare you look down on me?

241
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,600
I'll teach you a lesson.

242
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,179
Three souls and seven spirits.

243
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:15,720
Who?

244
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,559
Who hit me?

245
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,220
You're arrogant.

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
This is just minor punishment.

247
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,279
Bai Xiaoying!

248
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,120
It's you!

249
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,159
Not me.

250
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:31,799
Halt!

251
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,759
If not for Yunya's sake,

252
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,799
a cleaner like you
wouldn't even be allowed here.

253
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,159
And you remain this insolent!

254
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,200
Go reflect on your actions outside.

255
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,799
(It's scorching today.)

256
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,159
(I'm adding this to his tab.)

257
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,600
(Ye Chenyuan, don't touch me!)

258
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,940
You made me stay in this dull place.

259
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,799
Of course I'd find some fun.

260
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,080
(I'll kill you.)

261
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,480
(Just wait. I will definitely kill you.)

262
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,299
Weren't you trying to kill me?

263
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,179
You gave that old man a hint

264
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,159
that I'm here

265
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,039
by your side.

266
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,080
Too bad he's too dimwitted

267
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,399
to grasp your meaning.

268
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,399
You're just reaping what you sowed.

269
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,519
(In broad daylight,)

270
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,600
(you...)

271
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,139
No one can see me anyway.

272
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,519
You treat me badly,

273
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,279
but I still give you energy.

274
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,879
Shouldn't you thank me?

275
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,360
(Master!)

276
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,200
(Master!)

277
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,980
(Quickly undo the spell on me!)

278
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,159
You've been mischievous
and punished again.

279
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,240
Since it's Elder Kongming's meaning,

280
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,799
I can't lift this halt spell.

281
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,240
I can't do it,

282
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,799
but...

283
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,220
Alright.

284
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,059
You'll feel comfortable.

285
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,580
(Luckily, I have my master.)

286
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:29,139
(Otherwise, I couldn't go on.)

287
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,019
If you utter another word,

288
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,779
I'll kill him.

289
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:38,139
(Why?)

290
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,299
(What did Master do to you?)

291
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,460
(Or you hate to see people)

292
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,419
(treat me well?)

293
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,460
(You're serious?)

294
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,740
(Fine, I agree.)

295
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:50,340
(I'll obey you.)

296
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,940
(I'll do whatever you command.)

297
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,779
(Just don't harm him.)

298
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,580
So touching.

299
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,639
If he knew you served the Night Deity,

300
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,559
would he still treat you kindly?

301
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:04,460
(No matter.)

302
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,720
(All faults are mine.)

303
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,039
(As long as you're happy)

304
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
(and forgive me,)

305
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,240
(I'll keep my promise.)

306
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:20,580
The Divine Sword
Trial Assembly is coming.

307
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,960
The Night Deity may strike anytime.

308
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,899
Remain vigilant.

309
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,139
I know.

310
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,419
I've sent disciples to monitor the moves

311
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,059
of the Night Clan.

312
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,620
Okay.

313
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:34,600
Yunya,

314
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,000
you're my ideal candidate
for the Sword Master.

315
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,440
The trial is held for you.

316
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,740
I will prevail through fair competition.

317
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,559
I won't disappoint you.

318
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,320
Okay.

319
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,980
The prelims start tomorrow.

320
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:54,100
Though your cultivation is pitiful now,

321
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
in a trial like seizing immortal herbs,

322
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,320
surprise tactics

323
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:00,960
ensure victory.

324
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,240
Seizing herbs?

325
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,080
How do you know?

326
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:07,980
I'm warning you.

327
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
Don't try any tricks.

328
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,080
If you fail tomorrow,

329
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,460
I will kill you

330
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,539
and your master.

331
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,299
May I ask you

332
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,399
what surprise tactics I should use?

333
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:40,940
All spells actually

334
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:43,460
follow the same fundamental principles.

335
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,720
Channel natural energies

336
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:47,659
and make them your own.

337
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:55,220
Your turn.

338
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:22,779
I've never seen such an idiot.

339
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,240
Sorry about that.

340
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Though I've trained
diligently these years,

341
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,900
my cultivation remains stagnant.

342
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,859
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

343
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:51,960
Continue.

344
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:53,940
If you fail again,

345
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,599
don't blame my limited patience.

346
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,960
That's more like it.

347
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,960
Worthy of my painstaking guidance.

348
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,680
(Exactly.)

349
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,779
(After absorbing demonic energy,)

350
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,200
(my senses sharpened,)

351
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,400
(and energy gathering became easier.)

352
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,920
(The power flowing through me)

353
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:43,059
(is what I despise most.)

354
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,140
(One day,)

355
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:48,099
(I'll use the power you gave me)

356
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,279
(to kill you.)

357
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,339
The Trial Assembly officially begins.

358
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,500
Compete in assigned groups.

359
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,539
In one incense time,

360
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,220
seize the lily of the valley
from the desk,

361
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:05,220
and you'll be the victor.

362
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:06,839
First round.

363
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,819
Bai Xiaoying versus Chu Qi.

364
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,480
Xiaoying.

365
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,200
Go, Xiaoying.

366
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,859
You can do this! I trust you.

367
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:21,900
Go ahead.

368
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,980
You really showed up.

369
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,099
Let's see how you will
humiliate yourself later.

370
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,799
If you lose this trial,

371
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,640
I'll kill you.

372
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,140
You lowly cleaner

373
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:40,980
didn't get enough beating last time?

374
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,900
Back for more?

375
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,599
Please go easy on me.

376
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,759
Don't count on it.

377
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,519
This flower isn't for you.

378
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Dumb as a hog.

379
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,880
Stop dodging! Attack!

380
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,079
How can you retreat?

381
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,460
You coward want to avenge your mother?

382
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,140
Shut your mouth!

383
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,839
How could Bai Xiaoying improve so much?

384
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,880
Quit standing there!

385
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:47,819
Now!

386
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,980
Do it now!

387
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,299
Bai Xiaoying

388
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,380
of the Yunxiu Pavilion wins.

389
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:01,859
You advance.

390
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,859
- Xiaoying!
- Xiaoying!

391
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:08,859
- You're amazing! You won!
- Impressive!

392
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,079
Oh, my God.

393
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,640
- Seriously?
- How could she?

394
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,160
She's just a lowly cleaner.

395
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,220
It really happened.

396
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,460
Most absurd thing I've ever seen.

397
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,140
Outrageous.

398
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:20,779
Performing poorly

399
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:22,380
yet celebrating now?

400
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:24,160
You're incredible.

401
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,400
Practice harder later.

402
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,200
You're so skilled.

403
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,680
- We'll train harder.
- Right!

404
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:30,960
Yunya.

405
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,559
During the prelims,

406
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,759
your cleaning disciple Bai Xiaoying

407
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,819
caught my attention.

408
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,579
She lacks immortal roots,

409
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:40,819
with mediocre talent

410
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,980
and no past achievements.

411
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,420
How did her cultivation
improve so suddenly?

412
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:50,859
Though rootless,

413
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,059
her determination

414
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,559
made her my disciple.

415
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,059
After joining,

416
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,019
while handling the chores,

417
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,099
she studied diligently.

418
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,400
So her performance

419
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,440
didn't surprise me.

420
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
You once said

421
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,279
some seemingly ordinary people

422
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,400
gained sudden enlightenment

423
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,400
through cultivation

424
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,319
and then soared.

425
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,440
I believe this is her case.

426
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,160
I see.

427
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,599
That requires her
to properly harness this potential.

428
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,559
Only then can she be used by us.

429
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,519
Otherwise, she'll easily fall prey
to that power's backlash.

430
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:26,740
All efforts would then be wasted.

431
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,359
I'll teach her and lead her

432
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,000
onto the righteous path.

433
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,759
Very well.

434
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,720
Bai Xiaoying.

435
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,319
Why did you come here?

436
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,799
If you withdraw
from the trial competition,

437
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,559
all these will be yours.

438
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,839
Please take them back.

439
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:18,920
I have no need.

440
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:20,539
What do you mean?

441
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,079
I want to kill the Night Deity.

442
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,319
Bai Xiaoying!

443
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,279
Stop your glib tongue!

444
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,839
Don't push your luck.

445
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,619
This is a notice,

446
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,599
not a request.

447
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,279
If you refuse to comply,

448
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,880
we'll beat you into it.

449
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,599
Have I offended you, Senior Wanyan?

450
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,200
Why always treat me this way?

451
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,099
You've mocked me repeatedly.

452
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,799
You still pretend innocence here.

453
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:52,960
Beat her!

454
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,019
Disobey Senior Wanyan?

455
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,680
This is for your glibness!

456
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:05,819
Disobey Senior Wanyan?

457
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,579
Want to avoid the beatings?

458
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,279
Beg me for demonic energy.

459
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,279
Though I detest you too,

460
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,619
their noise is unbearable.

461
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,380
(If you transfer
demonic energy to me now)

462
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,059
(and they discover it,)

463
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,740
(they'll not only
disqualify me from the trials,)

464
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,539
(but also might even expel me
from the Nine Heavens.)

465
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:24,900
(I refuse!)

466
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,180
Since you refuse,

467
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,220
endure it.

468
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,980
Stop!

469
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:37,599
- What are you doing?
- Master.

470
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,720
- Master.
- Master.

471
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,420
Xiaoying.

472
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,519
Master!

473
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,319
Bai Xiaoying provoked us first!

474
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,119
They only...

475
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:48,759
Let's go back.

476
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:54,140
Be careful.

477
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,680
Get down.

478
00:24:59,119 --> 00:24:59,720
What?

479
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,480
Xiaoying? What's wrong?

480
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,160
Don't make me repeat it.

481
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:09,180
(I can't let him harm Master here.)

482
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,759
I'm fine.

483
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,559
Be careful.

484
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,660
Slowly.

485
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,000
Slow down.

486
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:22,900
Rourou can accompany me back.

487
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:24,619
Some ointment will suffice.

488
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:26,339
Alright.

489
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,859
Get some rest then.

490
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,140
Thank you, Master.

491
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,799
Go ahead.

492
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,460
Here.

493
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,339
Be careful.

494
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,000
Xiaoying.

495
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,480
Rest well.

496
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,680
Okay.

497
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,440
Know why you suffer?

498
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,180
Your mercy makes you weak

499
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,279
and unfit for greatness.

500
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,160
The greatest misfortune
I've suffered was meeting you.

501
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,480
Still defiant.

502
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
With all these injuries,

503
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:25,319
you can't compete tomorrow.

504
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,940
Soon, you'll beg me to heal you.

505
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,839
Beg me.

506
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,079
Then I'll heal you.

507
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,440
No need for your concern.

508
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,799
My skin's thick enough.

509
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,319
I can't bear your demonic energy.

510
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,920
One last chance.

511
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,759
Beg me now,

512
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,480
and I'll comply.

513
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:57,400
No need.

514
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:03,619
My patience wears thin.

515
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,180
Will you beg

516
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
or not?

517
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,700
I've changed my mind.

518
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,599
Skipping tomorrow's trial suits me.

519
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,279
You'll never reclaim your body,

520
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,680
nor plague the mortal realm.

521
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,140
My plans

522
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,700
are beyond your influence.

523
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,599
(It hurts.)

524
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:40,980
(Bai Xiaoying,)

525
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,660
(you must survive to seek vengeance.)

526
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,920
Please.

527
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,680
Spare me.

528
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,980
The way you beg for mercy

529
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,480
is much more pleasing
than your stubborn defiance.

530
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,299
I was ungrateful.

531
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,940
Please forgive me.

532
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:24,740
May you heal me?

533
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:32,799
Your staring

534
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,940
only fills me with disgust.

535
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,660
Close your eyes.

536
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,720
You're right.

537
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,480
It was my lack of wisdom.

Dream Spell.

551

Welcome to my dream.

552
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:03,579
You pulled me in here?

553
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:05,539
Because only I

554
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,579
want to kill you all the time.

Die!

557
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:51,680
What happened?

558
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,440
I hold no equal across the Three Realms.

Is it

not my dream?

562
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,240
I'm trapped in yours?

563
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,000
You realize it now?

564
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,759
