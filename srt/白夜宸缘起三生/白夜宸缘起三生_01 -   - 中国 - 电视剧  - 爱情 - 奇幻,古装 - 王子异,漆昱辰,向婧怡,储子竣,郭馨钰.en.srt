they called me cursed.)

(My blood corrodes all it touches.)

30
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,139
Her blood... Monster!
Your daughter's a monster!

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,460
She's ill-omened! She'll kill us all!

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,379
Night Clan filth!

33
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,879
Night Clan filth! Get out!

34
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,020
Stop contaminating us! Leave now!

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,340
Evil Night Clan spawn!

36
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,259
Mother, am I truly cursed?

37
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
Am I from Night Clan?

38
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:30,939
Will they only be content when I'm dead?

39
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:34,740
Xiaoying, you're my daughter.
You're never cursed.

40
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,539
Even for my sake,
live to prove them wrong.

41
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,860
Kill her!

42
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,819
Kill her!

43
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:47,800
What's that?

44
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,060
Night Deity!

45
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,340
Night Deity comes!

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,379
Run!

47
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,259
Xiaoying!

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,240
Xiaoying!

49
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,300
I'm here, Xiaoying.

50
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,620
Mother? Mother? Mother!

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,300
Mother! Mother! Mother!

52
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:37,699
Mother! Mother! Mother!

53
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:52,780
Who are you? How are you still alive?

54
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,699
You're Night Deity?

55
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,180
You killed my mother. Give her back!

56
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,099
What if I refuse?

57
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,780
Then I'll kill you and avenge my mother!

58
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,740
While I breathe, I'll hunt you down.

59
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Then live.
I'll await your feeble attempts.

60
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
(Remember, I'm Ye Chenyuan.)

61
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,500
Night Deity!

62
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,180
(I will survive)

63
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:50,740
(and slay Night Deity
to avenge my mother.)

64
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,660
(My only path
is to ascend the Immortal Steps,)

65
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:00,259
(reach an immortal sect,
and cultivate immortal arts.)

66
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,699
(If I fail, let death claim me here.)

67
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:42,300
Yunya, see the mortal on Immortal Steps?
She has no immortal root.

68
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,980
Yet she climbed this far alive.

69
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,899
Countless seek immortality.

70
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,540
She's the first mortal
in thirty millennia to reach here.

71
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,939
Still mortal, though.
She'll perish on these steps.

72
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,519
Her resolve is extraordinary.
She'll make something.

73
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,639
I'll take her and let her serve
as a cleaner in Yunxiu Pavilion.

74
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
(It's her.)

75
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,279
You survived?

76
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,480
Stay back.
My blood harms all it touches.

77
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,779
I'm cursed.

78
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,040
The anomaly must have
brought you endless trials.

79
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,079
Yet you warn me first despite your pain.

80
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,439
You are kind and never cursed.

81
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,199
This is Clear Spirit Ring,
an artifact I forged.

82
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,560
It will seal your abnormal energies.

83
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,399
You can live normally from now on
and fear no more.

84
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,439
Are you an immortal?

85
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,759
I vow to slay Night Deity
to avenge my mother.

86
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,639
Can you help me?

87
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,199
Destroying Night Deity
is the immortal sects' duty.

88
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,360
Live to witness his downfall.

89
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,600
You truly are immortal.

90
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,680
We finally meet again.

91
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,139
Why risk death pursuing cultivation?

92
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,019
To kill Night Deity.

93
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,019
Without immortal roots,
you'll never ascend.

94
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:36,299
Then why save me?

95
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,980
Because I've never seen your equal.

96
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,019
A mortal conquering Immortal Steps
is truly remarkable.

97
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,139
Take me as a disciple.
Teach me immortal arts

98
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,259
to slay Night Deity.

99
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,059
I'm Yunya, an Upper Immortal
of Nine Heavens. Call me Master.

100
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,299
But it's a temporary arrangement.
You need to prove your worth.

101
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:17,659
Thank you, immortal.

102
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,379
No. Thank you, Master.

103
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,039
Why are we having
cultivation training again today?

104
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,659
What's wrong with that?
We get to see Master again today.

105
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:34,460
My cultivation is so weak.
I'll just end up getting punished again.

106
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,919
Not like you.

107
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,580
Senior, can you lend me your artifact?

108
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,800
No.

109
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,160
Don't be so stingy. Just this once.

110
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,860
What's this awful smell?
It's disgusting.

111
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,899
It's that filthy cleaner.

112
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,280
She reeks. It's suffocating.

113
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,139
How can we study like this?

114
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,559
Exactly. So repulsive.

115
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,379
I'm sorry, Senior.

116
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,700
We humans just smell.
No amount of washing helps.

117
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,659
I'll try to stay further away
from you all.

118
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,379
Uncouth and vulgar.

119
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,700
Just a mortal without an immortal bone.

120
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,700
How did such trash enter Nine Heavens
and get to sit beside us?

121
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,659
It's because Master Yunya
is kind-hearted and treats all equally.

122
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,700
He tolerates even such abnormalities.

123
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,799
I just can't stand it.

124
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,080
(To practice immortal arts,)

125
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,559
(I'll avoid conflicts
whenever possible.)

126
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,180
Master is here.

127
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,540
Master.

128
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,659
- Master.
- Master.

129
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:01,159
With Night Clan attacking Mortal Realm,
you must intensify your training.

130
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,904
How's your Water Condensation?

131
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,320
Let me try, Master.

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
As expected of Senior Wanyan.
She's mastered it already.

133
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,360
Wanyan, teach us too.

134
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,080
All hail our Lord!

135
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,399
My cultivation has reached its peak.

136
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,919
I'll seize the Divine Sword
from the immortal sects now.

137
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,320
Nothing in this world
can threaten me anymore.

138
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,080
What's this?

139
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,460
(No. When did I drop it?)

140
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:28,259
Master, I found this filthy object.
It seems to be mortal.

141
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,460
Who owns this?

142
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,840
If no one claims it,

143
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,100
then Bai Xiaoying,
the cleaner, shall be punished.

144
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,120
Punish Bai Xiaoying.

145
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,019
Right. You should've cleaned properly.

146
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:43,299
Yunxiu Pavilion is Master's residence.
How dare you taint it?

147
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,360
Master's kindness breeds negligence.

148
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,299
(Disaster strikes today.)

149
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,399
(I can't escape it.)

150
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,960
It's mine.

151
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,759
Master, I... I didn't know.

152
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,200
No worries.
I made this during mortal travels.

153
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,559
It's old. The clasp must've loosened.

154
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,759
No matter how hard I practice,
I can't match their casual attempts.

155
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,860
Bai Xiaoying, how will you
defeat Night Deity like this?

156
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:48,499
Xiaoying.

157
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,040
Master.

158
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,000
I've fixed it.
Be more careful next time.

159
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,879
I'll remember your teachings.

160
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,879
Thank you for helping me today, Master.

161
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,039
In this immortal sect,
avoiding trouble is best.

162
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,720
Better than courting disaster.

163
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,320
Okay.

164
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
I'm here.

165
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,899
What's this thing?

166
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,019
Night Deity is coming.

167
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,799
Immortals, heed my command.
Destroy Night Deity!

168
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,740
Night Deity is here! To battle!

169
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,580
Hurry!

170
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,179
Night Deity, I've waited long for this.

171
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,259
Night Deity, long time no see.

172
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:25,179
Immortal Lord, still kicking?

173
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,160
He wants Divine Sword!

174
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:06,780
Mother, it's him.

175
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,720
My long-awaited day has come.

176
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:20,720
No, if he takes Divine Sword,

177
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:23,120
nothing can destroy him anymore!

178
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,600
(My blood corrodes all. Maybe...)

179
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,200
Try my Soul-Binding Rope!

180
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,879
Die!

181
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,919
My Soul-Binding Rope!

182
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,119
Ye Chenyuan was drawn
into Divine Sword. Is he sealed now?

183
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,099
That demon must still resist.

184
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,940
Stay vigilant.

185
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,900
Ye Chenyuan!

186
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,799
Who are you?

187
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,519
Don't remember me?

188
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:45,279
I'm your killer.

189
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,759
Seeking death!

190
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,000
You scoundrel!

191
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:01,359
I'll slice you to pieces!

192
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,740
Who are you?
Why does Divine Sword obey you?

193
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,540
Not sure myself.

194
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:34,539
But it's perfect.
I want you to be shredded to dust.

195
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,859
Seems hatred manifests here.

196
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,980
I suggest abandoning evil intentions.

197
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,180
Or you'll die first.

198
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,460
My mother's killer stands here.
How can I not hate?

199
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,019
My patience ends now.

200
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,579
(What did you do? Get out of me!)

201
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,340
Silence.

202
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,640
I should've used this sooner.
It spares the chitchat.

203
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,339
(Really? Me too.)

204
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,380
What are you doing?

205
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,859
(Mother, I'll avenge you.)

206
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,920
You've truly gone mad.

207
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,200
But I won't die that easily.

208
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,580
What?

209
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
Did Night Deity escape
from the Divine Sword?

210
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,640
Night Deity has always been cunning.
We must heighten our guard.

211
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:17,856
- Understood.
- Understood.

212
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,119
So I've returned to the Nine Heavens?

213
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:47,859
Why are you out here too?

214
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:53,420
I won't waste words with you.
I need to reclaim my physical form.

215
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:56,460
(So he's only in spirit form now.)

216
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,579
(I'll take him to Master now.)

217
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,539
Someone! Capture Night Deity!

218
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,819
Is anyone here? Night Deity is here!

219
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,488
- Catch Night Deity!
- Night Deity?

220
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,539
Someone!

221
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,960
- Help! Night Deity is here!
- Xiaoying.

222
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,540
Master.

223
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:17,140
You mentioned Night Deity.
Do you know where he is?

224
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,460
(Can't they see Night Deity?)

225
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,940
Xiaoying, what are you doing here alone?

226
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,980
I'm alone? Night Deity...

227
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,280
(What are you doing?)

228
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,440
If you tell him about me,
I'll kill him instantly.

229
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,480
(Don't threaten me.)

230
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,240
(Without a physical form,
you can't defeat Nine Heavens.)

231
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:56,839
I welcome mutual destruction. At least
I can kill you and your master first.

232
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,079
One light stab...

233
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,199
No!

234
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,599
Xiaoying, what's wrong?

235
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:05,400
You can tell me anything.

236
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,900
It's nothing.

237
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:15,619
I just heard Night Deity came
and searched everywhere for him.

238
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:17,579
By accident, I flew here.

239
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,599
Why did you shout
about capturing Night Deity?

240
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,319
I... I heard Night Deity
attacked the Nine Heavens.

241
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,679
I just wanted to practice harder
to support Night Deity...

242
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,760
No. Support you all.

243
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,480
Master, you must station heavy guards
at the forbidden area.

244
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:43,240
My cultivation is weak. My entering
the forbidden area would be disastrous.

245
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,159
Nonsense!

246
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,779
How can you take such a matter lightly?

247
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,140
Master, she nearly
breached the forbidden area.

248
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,200
In my opinion, twenty flogging strikes
will deter future offenses.

249
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:58,980
Yes. Senior Wanyan is right.
Bai Xiaoying should be punished.

250
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,820
Right.

251
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Senior Wanyan is correct.
Please discipline me, Master.

252
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:16,019
Someone, flog Bai Xiaoying twenty times.

253
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,220
Yes.

254
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,080
Careful.

255
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:34,639
Slow down.

256
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,400
I'm fine. Don't help me.

257
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,720
Go back first.

258
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,400
It's okay. I must see you inside.

259
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,760
Let's go.

260
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,119
If Wanyan sees you, she'll target you.
I don't want to owe you favors.

261
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,839
Xiaoying, what's happening?

262
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,559
This place remains as shabby as ever.

263
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,839
(As shabby as ever?)

264
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,940
(Could he be Night Deity the Master
mentioned who was imprisoned here?)

265
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,519
Xiaoying? Xiaoying?

266
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,599
You're injured and still this energetic?

267
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,079
Xiaoying, slow down.

268
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,440
Slowly. Take it easy.

269
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:23,679
Sit slowly. Easy now.

270
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,599
I told you to walk slowly.
Let me check your wounds.

271
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,200
The wounds have reopened.

272
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,599
Take off your clothes.
I'll get medicine.

273
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:37,919
Don't bother.

274
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
(He's bound to me.)

275
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,839
(If something happens
to me alone, no one will know.)

276
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,960
I'll trouble you then.

277
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,359
Okay.

278
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,619
Why are you still here?

279
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,740
I'm taking off my clothes.

280
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,460
Tell me how to untie this.

281
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,019
You won't stay here forever, will you?

282
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,580
Listen.

283
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,140
Until I reclaim my body, get the sword,
and break the Soul-Binding Rope,

284
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,180
you'd better accept reality quietly.

285
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,619
Otherwise, I'll make you
suffer unbearably.

286
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:31,379
You...

287
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,859
Xiaoying, why haven't you
taken off your clothes?

288
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,220
I... I'll get on the bed.

289
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,640
Rourou, can you
lower the curtains for me?

290
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,000
Why? It's just us here.

291
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,240
I haven't been well lately.
I'm sensitive to chills.

292
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,399
