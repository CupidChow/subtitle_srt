00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,759

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,159

This is

33
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,139
the Immortal Lord?

34
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,460
I'm sorry for my child.

35
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:55,819
Let the Three Realms know

36
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:58,060
she saved everyone.

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,020
Jibai,

38
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,300
will you become sword crystal

39
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,479
and follow me?

40
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,900
I will.

41
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,379
Look what we found!

42
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:43,979
What's this?

43
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,300
The legendary Divine Maiden's residence?

44
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,139
- Let us in!
- Divine Maiden!

45
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:53,300
- Come out!
- Divine Maiden, come out!

46
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,319
Divine Maiden, show up!

47
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:57,419
This is the Divine Maiden?

48
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,659
She looks just like us.

49
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,180
Come closer, Divine Maiden.

50
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:02,460
Let us see you.

51
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,740
Yes! Let us see you!

52
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,300
- Divine Maiden, come!
- Play with us!

53
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:14,819
Come.

54
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:23,779
Come.

55
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,699
Mother, what are you doing?

56
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,100
I want to see the Divine Maiden!

57
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,740
Nonsense!

58
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:31,939
She's no Divine Maiden.

59
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,180
She's cursed.

60
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,300
Within her

61
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,379
dwells the most evil, Night Deity.

62
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,459
Anyone she touches dies.

63
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,379
If you want to live,

64
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,139
come with me now.

65
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,420
- Mother.
- Hurry!

66
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:43,500
Come quickly!

67
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:44,620
Let's leave this place.

68
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,459
Never come again.

69
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,579
So this is the origin

70
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:03,139
of the deity's vessel.

71
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,420
Master said before

72
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,500
the Huiyue Abode imprisoned the deity.

73
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,019
So it was her.

74
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:24,500
Who is it?

75
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,379
That's the little beast
containing the Night Deity!

76
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:28,860
She caused my father's death!

77
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,980
I'll kill her

78
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,060
to avenge my father!

79
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,339
The Night Deity is our enemy!

80
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:34,180
Kill her!

81
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,019
Filthy beast!

82
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:35,980
Kill her!

83
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,100
You wretched creature!

84
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,699
- Kill her!
- Crush you!

85
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:39,540
Kill her!

86
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,660
Smash you!

87
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:41,740
Die!

88
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,500
- Kill her!
- You vile thing!

89
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,220
Her blood is venomous.

90
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,579
Staying here risks our lives.

91
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,500
Let's go.

92
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,019
- Go!
- Quickly!

93
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:08,787
(Huiyue Abode)

94
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,660
(Since I bring misfortune,)

95
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,420
(perhaps...)

96
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,600
(What will finally work?)

97
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,639
(This time, it'll work.)

98
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,920
(With so much poison,)

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,160
(surely this will suffice.)

100
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,959
Why am I still alive?

101
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,759
Not working, either.

102
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,120
(160 attempts now.)

103
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,000
(Seems I'll never succeed.)

104
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,439
Why?

105
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,160
Wan Guchen,

106
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,519
stop looking around.

107
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,040
See something forbidden,

108
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,199
and you'll be punished.

109
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,240
Okay.

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,480
What happened to her?

111
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,240
Let's save her!

112
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,560
Do you even know who she is?
Rushing so quickly.

113
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,600
The Night Deity's sealed within her.

114
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Her blood is venomous.

115
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,199
Just leave it there.

116
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,800
Don't meddle further.

117
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,439
Even with the Night Deity sealed inside,

118
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,639
she's done nothing wrong.

119
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,160
What if

120
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,439
she dies like this?

121
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,560
Relax. She won't die.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
Just leave it there.

123
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:53,959
Go.

124
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm still alive.

125
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,720
Someone bandaged me?

126
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,039
How are you doing?

127
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,159
Feeling better?

128
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,600
Who are you?

129
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,159
Did you bandage my wound?

130
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes.

131
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,279
I noticed the wound on your wrist,

132
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,080
so I dressed it for you.

133
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,919
I'm a junior disciple
assigned to bring you meals.

134
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,360
My name is Wan Guchen.

135
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,200
You can call me Chen.

136
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,759
Wan Guchen.

137
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,000
Meal delivery.

138
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,919
No wonder you could enter.

139
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,360
Didn't they tell you

140
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
about my identity?

141
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,080
They gave a general explanation.

142
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,600
Since you know who I am,

143
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,960
why did you save me?

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,879
Because you're someone
I've longed to meet.

145
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,919
Now that I've finally seen you today,

146
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,600
how could I bear

147
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
to leave you bleeding alone?

148
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,320
Many are curious about me.

149
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,360
Plenty come to gawk at my misery.

150
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
You're like them.

151
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,240
Seems you're recovering well.

152
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Better eat now.

153
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,759
Though it's gone cold,

154
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,159
it'll help maintain your strength.

155
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,759
(So overly attentive.)

156
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,200
(Could he have poisoned the food?)

157
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
(First using bandaging as a pretext)

158
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,799
(to lower my guard,)

159
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,080
(and then using the chance to kill me?)

160
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,679
Though this pain's intense,

161
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:31,960
I can eat.

162
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,000
Let me try.

163
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,080
You didn't poison the food?

164
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,120
Why would I poison you?

165
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,559
I told you

166
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,360
you were someone I wanted to meet.

167
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Don't worry.

168
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,919
I will never harm you.

169
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,820
I've eaten.

170
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,059
We've talked enough.

171
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,000
Will you leave now?

172
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,460
You're right.

173
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,759
It's getting late.

174
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,799
I should head back now.

175
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,940
If they can't find me soon,

176
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,799
there'll be nagging.

177
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:21,940
I'm leaving.

178
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,179
See you tomorrow.

179
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,259
All that "I won't hurt you" talk

180
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:34,259
is just lies.

181
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,320
Within days,

182
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,639
your true nature will show.

183
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,639
Just as expected, a fraud.

184
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,120
Here, fresh-picked fruits.

185
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,039
If you keep this insincere act up,

186
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,720
I won't eat your food.

187
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,179
I'll leave them here.

188
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,980
Eat whenever you wish.

205
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,159
Others refuse this duty

206
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,440
and feel terrified.

207
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,519
But you're different,

208
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,080
never missing a day in years.

209
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,679
You're pure-hearted,

210
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,080
not dangerous as they claim.

211
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,759
This person

212
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,799
looks exactly like me.

213
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,960
She lived at the Huiyue Abode too.

214
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,919
(Why?)

215
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,279
(Her memories flood my mind.)

216
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,120
(This agony...)

217
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,240
(This sorrow...)

218
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,759
If you haven't eaten,

219
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,879
stay and join me.

220
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,559
I didn't bring more utensils.

221
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,200
Then keep me company.

222
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,360
How many junior disciples are there?

223
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,919
Over 300.

224
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,000
What are your daily duties?

225
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,840
Typically,

226
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,519
we practice immortal arts.

227
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,039
But exceptions like me

228
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,919
sweep palace floors,

229
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,919
water plants, burn trash,

230
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,559
and wash clothes for immortals.

231
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,720
So you

232
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,759
encounter diverse people daily.

233
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,519
Yeah.

234
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,639
Tell me more.

235
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:12,600
I've been confined here for years,

236
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,100
knowing nothing.

237
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,279
I'll share something relevant.

238
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,159
Alright.

239
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,679
At the recent Divine Sword trials,

240
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,440
Immortal Zili won first place.

241
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,039
But the sword didn't accept him.

242
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,000
The Immortal Lord's vexed.

243
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,840
Now, they want to seek
a new Sword Master to protect you.

244
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,720
Protect me?

245
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,399
Yeah.

246
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,320
Never mind.

247
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,960
If I must have a guardian,

248
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,799
you'd be a decent candidate.

249
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,120
Me?

250
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,360
Just kidding.

251
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,039
You're just a low-ranking disciple.

252
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:04,839
True enough.

253
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,000
The world beyond...

254
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,039
I wish I could see it.

255
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,559
If you truly want to go,

256
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,400
I can help you.

257
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,119
How can you help me?

258
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,960
This place is surrounded by spells.

259
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,279
You come and go using your tokens.

260
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,119
But I can't.

261
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,880
Unless

262
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,720
that person comes here personally,

263
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,319
none of you can take me out.

264
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,319
Let me tell you.

265
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,200
My ancestors received
favors from rabbit spirits.

266
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,839
They taught me
the Three-Burrow spatial technique.

267
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,359
I can't do other magic,

268
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,079
but I've mastered this since childhood.

269
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,799
I can teach it to you.

270
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,279
Really?

271
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,119
Truly.

272
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,720
But within me...

273
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,480
Never mind.

274
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,119
It might cause trouble.

275
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,440
I have an idea.

276
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,039
Follow me.

277
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,480
So this is the magnificent Nine Heavens.

278
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,720
Of course.

279
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,680
Countless cultivators dream of
reaching this sacred place.

280
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,240
Immortal Xiyuan.

281
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,559
You look

282
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,119
so familiar.

283
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,160
What's your name?

284
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,759
She's my younger sister.

285
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:09,920
Named...

286
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:11,799
Qi.

287
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,440
Born prematurely,

288
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
she cannot speak.

289
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,279
She's a new disciple here.

290
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,839
You couldn't have met her before.

291
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,559
I must be mistaken.

292
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,799
Too many immortals here.

293
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,559
Let's find a quieter area.

294
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,319
Yeah.

295
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,799
Go.

296
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,000
So beautiful!

297
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,079
The outside world is breathtaking.

298
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,319
Tell me whenever you want to come out.

299
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,400
I'll take you out.

300
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,440
Thank you.

301
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,240
Without you,

302
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,720
I'd never see
such beauty in my lifetime.

303
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,319
You're welcome.

304
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,000
I wonder what Wan Guchen will think

305
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,559
if he sees me like this.

306
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:44,920
Stop!

307
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,480
Where's the usual meal deliverer?

308
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,319
Why isn't he here?

309
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
I don't know.

310
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,759
We were just assigned here temporarily.

311
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,240
Hurry!

312
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:56,720
No.

313
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,440
I need to find him.

314
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,799
Wan Guchen!

315
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,200
Wan Guchen!

316
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,359
Wan Guchen!

317
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,759
Wan Guchen!

318
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,279
What happened?

319
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,119
How did you get hurt?

320
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,880
I didn't bring your meal today.

322
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720
Why say that?

323
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,200
Don't apologize.

324
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,039
Who gave you these injuries?

325
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,200
Who harmed you?

326
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,000
They're still here?

327
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,440
Hide now!

328
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,319
Now!

329
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,640
Now that I'm here,

330
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,319
I won't back down.

331
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,680
Wan Guchen,

332
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,440
no wonder you've been acting strange.

333
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
I caught you red-handed.

334
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,880
What lowly maid is this?

335
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,880
Consorting with you?

336
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,279
Makes sense.

337
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,519
Lowly people

338
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,119
would do such shameless things.

339
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,359
Wan Zerui,

340
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,519
shut your mouth.

341
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,680
Bully me all you want,

342
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,119
but I won't let you insult her!

343
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,559
Wan Zerui?

344
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,119
He's your...

345
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,960
Who do you think you are?

346
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,160
Speaking to me like this?

347
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,640
You're a cursed disaster from birth.

348
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,319
If not for our grandfather's mercy,

349
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,279
how could you be sent here

350
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,799
for cultivation with me?

351
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,480
If you're his family,

352
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,960
why treat him so cruelly?

353
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,960
Pah!

354
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,559
He's the shame
of our Wanfeng royal family!

355
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,920
Attack!

356
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,519
It's alright.

357
00:22:58,819 --> 00:22:59,619
They've left.

358
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,119
You're the first to stand up for me.

359
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,279
Thank you.

360
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,359
Don't mention it.

361
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,000
Consider it repayment
for bringing me meals.

362
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,519
But tell me,

363
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
if they're your family,

364
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,000
why treat you so harshly?

365
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,200
Since childhood,

366
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
I've been seen

367
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,559
as an ill omen in their eyes.

368
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:30,920
Your Majesty,

369
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,359
our Wanfeng Kingdom
has never suffered Night Clan invasions.

370
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,680
As soon as the little prince was born,

371
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,839
the Night Clan attacked,

372
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,200
costing us
our Crown Prince and Princess!

373
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,160
This... this is an evil portent!

374
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,119
- Yes!
- Yes!

375
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,799
Misfortune struck
the moment he was born.

376
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,240
A true harbinger of doom!

377
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,079
I planted fear within him.

378
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,559
No matter his future status,

379
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,559
power,

380
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
or location,

381
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,359
he'll forever fear dogs.

382
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,079
- Troublemaker!
- Menace!

383
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,599
- Jinx!
- Nuisance! Pest!

384
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:03,960
Scourge!

385
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,000
You cursed wretch!

386
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,440
So...

387
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,480
your parents were killed
by the Night Clan.

388
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:15,839
Wan Guchen,

389
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,039
the Night Deity is sealed within me.

390
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Even so,

391
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,000
don't you resent me at all?

392
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,880
Since learning about you,

393
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,119
knowing there's someone

394
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,039
who shares my fate

395
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,000
of being seen as cursed and cast aside,

396
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,440
I've felt less alone.

397
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,200
That's why I wanted to meet you.

398
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,160
As for the Night Deity,

399
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,920
that's not your fault.

400
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,960
I won't shift hatred onto the innocent.

401
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,160
It's okay.

402
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,160
I'll protect you from now on.

403
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,279
No one will hurt you again.

404
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,960
This is the only thing
my mother left me.

405
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,359
When scared,

406
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,079
I feel her watching over me.

407
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,759
I want you to have it.

408
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:24,799
This way,

409
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,319
even when I'm gone,

410
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,039
it'll keep you safe.

411
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,000
I'll treasure it always.

412
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:43,839
Yeah.

413
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,359
Don't let others see you here.

414
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,599
Go back now.

415
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,480
I'll visit when healed.

416
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,720
Promise?

417
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,359
Yeah.

418
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,400
You're here.

419
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,079
You've waited long?

420
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,759
Not at all.

421
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,279
I have a gift for you.

422
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:51,720
Come.

423
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:53,960
Let's go somewhere.

424
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:55,839
Okay.

425
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,079
It's beautiful!

426
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,640
How did you do this?

427
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,279
You said

428
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,440
your blood made flowers wither.

429
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,079
I learned a new spell secretly.

430
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,000
Still trying to master it.

431
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,039
It can't sustain long.

432
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,119
I love it.

433
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,279
Make flowers for me often.

434
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,119
I'll make them

435
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:51,680
if you want.

436
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,039
Deal.

437
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,000
Bai Yixi!

438
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,759
You sneaked out!

439
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,039
Violating immortal laws!

440
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,119
So you really are that monster.

441
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,240
No wonder you consort together.

442
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,799
Monster pairing with the jinx.

443
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,039
How can you say that?

444
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,359
Staying here for over a decade,

445
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,960
I've never done any wrongdoings

446
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,640
and never harmed anyone.

447
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,720
Don't you know

448
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,759
you're the vessel
of the ancient evil deity?

449
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,160
If you wander around

450
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,119
and let the Night Deity
escape to wreak havoc,

451
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,039
it'll be on you!

452
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,240
I'm not the one to endanger the world,

453
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,720
nor did I choose to be the vessel.

454
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,319
Why must I bear this burden?

455
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,559
How can you say
such heartless, selfish words?

456
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,839
You lack compassion
or a sense of justice,

457
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,359
betraying the lord's mercy.

458
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,839
Since you'll endanger the Three Realms,

459
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:52,759
we can't let you live.

460
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,160
Chen.

461
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,119
Are you alright?

462
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,000
Yixi.
