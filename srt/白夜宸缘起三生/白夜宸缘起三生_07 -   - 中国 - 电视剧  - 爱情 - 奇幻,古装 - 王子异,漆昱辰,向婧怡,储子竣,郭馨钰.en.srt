Ye Chenyuan, don't...

37
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,719
Do you have feelings for her too?

Yes.

39
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,599
Good.

00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,960

Ye Chenyuan,

44
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,939
why did you ask him like that?

45
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,460
Let me ask you.

46
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,939
When we were in the Nine Heavens,

47
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:37,580

Never mind.

52
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,939
Pointless to tell you.

53
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,979
Don't you have anything to say to me?

54
00:03:58,699 --> 00:03:59,740
What do you want to say?

55
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,419

he hasn't.

99
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,560
Outrageous.

100
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,639
Fine, Ye Chenyuan.

101
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,279

102

you'll inevitably come here.

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,319
I searched everywhere

107
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,279
but couldn't find you.

108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,879
I've prepared a rare treasure

109
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,639

114
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,759
Surrender peacefully

115
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,439
and hand over what we seek,

116
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,560
and we might spare your life.

Guards!

Ye Chenyuan,

119
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,860
you collude with immortals.

120
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,899
No one will respect your rule.

121
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:44,180
Even the immortal Sword Master
is my ally.

122
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,819
Ask them all.

123
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:48,620
Will they follow you

124
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,420
or me?

125
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,100

- Night Deity!

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,899

00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,579
shall be returned to you,

130
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:26,899
provided you guard Hua Yuying
here for several days.

131
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,699
Once my cultivation is restored,

132
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,300
I'll return to take her.

133
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:37,700
Deal.

134
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,299
When the sword crystal
awakens the Divine Sword,

135
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,019
no one shall approach

136
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,139
to disrupt the process.

137
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:18,620
For the sword to have
a chance to be unsealed,

138
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,659
Yunya,

139
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,139
Xiaoying,

140
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:22,820
you two are indispensable.

You two are our heroes.

142
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,860
Henceforth, anyone
showing disrespect to them

143
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,100
will face the wrath of all of us.

144
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,139
- Yes.
- Yes.

145
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,700
My lord,

146
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:39,659
I have something

147
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,419
to tell you privately.

148
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,220
Xiaoying,

149
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,860
this is my private chamber.

150
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,820
No disturbance shall reach us here.

151
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,059
What do you wish to report?

152
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,059
Speak without reservation.

153
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,340
In the Night Clan, I've found

154
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,940
Ye Chenyuan isn't the Night Deity.

155
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,779
The true Night Deity remains hidden.

156
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,419
Regarding Ye Chenyuan,

157
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,860
what do you truly know?

158
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:18,700
He...

159
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:20,940
has high cultivation,

160
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,139
with few in the Three Realms
matching his might.

161
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,139
He joined the Night Clan 20 years ago,

162
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,419
entering seclusion ever since,

163
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,899
not even governing their clan affairs.

164
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,940
Are you aware

165
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,980
that the Night Deity's power
awakens every 300 years,

166
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,700
reborn through vessels?

167
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,059
Ye Chenyuan isn't the deity.

168
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,340
He's merely a vessel.

169
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:52,659
A vessel?

170
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,659
This truth traces back
to events 1,500 years ago.

171
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,139
This portrait
depicts Divine Maiden Xi Wu.

172
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,659
She, Emperor Jibai,
and I were immortal companions.

173
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,399
1,500 years ago,

174
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,740
to seize our sacred cultivation spring,

175
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:19,860
the Night Clan waged a war against us.

176
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,580
Emperor Jibai and I resisted fiercely,

177
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,539
forcing their retreat.

178
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,179
As I prepared to eradicate them,

179
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:32,659
the Night King's hatred erupted

180
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,220
with unimaginable fury,

181
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,139
turning him
into an unstoppable Night Deity.

182
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,980
Under his command,
they conquered the Mortal Realm,

183
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,759
causing immense suffering.

184
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,179
To protect the sacred spring,

185
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,720
Divine Maiden Xi Wu,
fresh from childbirth,

186
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,919
used a forbidden technique,

187
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,940
sealing the deity
in the newborn's pure soul.

188
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Realms stabilized.

189
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,759
With my energy.

190
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:02,539
Heaven and earth as blades.

191
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,379
- Seal!
- Seal!

192
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,460
So that's the truth.

193
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,899
But the vessel was female,

194
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,379
not male.

195
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,539
This proves

196
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,580
Ye Chenyuan cannot be the Night Deity.

197
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:26,299
That child perished long ago.

198
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,580
Over the 1500 years,

199
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,379
the Night Deity
has resurrected five times.

200
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,659
So whether Ye Chenyuan
is his new vessel remains

201
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,820
beyond superficial observations.

202
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,940
All witness

203
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,820
the unmistakable Night Deity's power

204
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,779
flowing through him.

205
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,340
If he's not the deity,

206
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:50,620
the truth becomes more urgent.

207
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,340
I understand.

208
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,500
I'll take my leave now.

209
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,320
Master.

210
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,360
How was your talk?

211
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,299
I've learned things
about the Night Deity.

212
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,360
Now, I'm certain

213
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
Ye Chenyuan isn't the deity

214
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,539
or my mother's killer.

215
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,440
I must find the true Night Deity

216
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,960
to avenge her.

217
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,559
This is my duty as the Sword Master.

218
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:35,460
Xiaoying,

219
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:37,779
I've been holding some words back.

220
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,139
Even if he's not the deity

221
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:41,419
or your mother's murderer,

222
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,500
he's still a Night Clansman.

223
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,220
For centuries,

224
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:46,580
they've brought suffering.

225
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,340
Innocents were slaughtered beyond count.

226
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,259
Moreover, he joined them 20 years ago.

227
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,220
The tragedy a decade past

228
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,960
happened under his watch.

229
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,299
Though you doubt if it was him that day,

230
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,460
it was his responsibility.

231
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:05,500
Okay.

232
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,940
I'm done.

233
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:11,700
Think it over.

234
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:30,659
(About him and me,)

235
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,820
(what should I do?)

236
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,860
(Is there truly no resolution?)

237
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,419
Why are you here?

238
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,419
Do you like it?

239
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
I have a question.

240
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:30,340
You've asked everything.

241
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,539
You're not the Night Deity.

242
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,580
You didn't kill my mother.

243
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:38,480
Right?

244
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:50,940
Look.

245
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,820
A falling star.

246
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,659
Don't change the subject.

247
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:02,580
Come sit with me for a while.

248
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,419
Okay?

249
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:19,980
I'm really happy.

250
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,440
I've been sitting here
for over 1,000 years.

251
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,600
Having you by my side

252
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,340
makes me glad.

253
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,980
You're acting strange today.

254
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,200
Fireflies.

255
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,299
These are your doing?

256
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:57,580

will you insist on killing me

you're not the Night Deity.

282
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,380
The Divine Sword is unsealed.

283
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,099
Sword Master, please claim it.

284
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,380
Congratulations, Sword Master.

00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:55,700

you'll die instantly.

Bai Xiaoying!

294
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:47,460
You've been colluding with Ye Chenyuan!

295
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,779
I knew you...

296
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,019
Keep talking nonsense,

297
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,420
and I'll rip your mouth apart.

298
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,019
Ye Chenyuan,

299
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,059
I failed to teach my girl well.

300
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:00,660
Wanyan's mistakes

301
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:01,900
are my failures.

302
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:05,380
You said

303
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,579
if I were the Night Deity,

304
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:09,299
you wouldn't kill me.

305
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,900
You'd find evidence to prove I was not.

306
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:15,940
Exactly.

307
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:18,539
Because I know you're not.

308
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,539
You're too naive.

309
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:22,140
So...

310
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,579
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

311
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,759
You didn't really think
I was helping you purge residual toxins?

312
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,319
I was injecting the Night Clan poison

313
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,480
into your body.

314
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,940
Impossible.

315
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,140
I don't believe.

316
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,579
After I came to the Nine Heavens
half a year ago,

317
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,339
my sole purpose

318
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,579
was to seize the sword.

319
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,579
Everything I've done led to this moment.

320
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,180
And now, you've finally handed it to me.

321
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,180
Are you saying,

322
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:32,779
this whole time,

323
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,740
you've been lying to me?

324
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,140
No.

325
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,059
Why didn't you seize the sword earlier

326
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,700
but help me get the crystal?

327
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,700
Because

328
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:50,779
I needed the Sword Master
to unseal it for me.

329
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,500
Stop joking.

330
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,460
I won't fall for this.

331
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,400
What's really going on?

332
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,539
Give me the sword first.

333
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,059
Whatever the problem is,

334
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:14,500
we'll solve it together.

335
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:15,460
Okay?

336
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:17,339
My problem is,

337
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,660
I intended to use you to reclaim my clan
and obtain the sword crystal.

338
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,259
I never imagined
you'd help me so wholeheartedly,

339
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:27,619
even bringing along your master.

340

or compulsions you have.

no explanation you give in the future

00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,819

Forgive me?

347
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,839
Seems you've truly gone mad.

348
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,559

00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,740
This time, you committed a grave error,

377
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,660
letting the sword be taken!

378
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,259
I would like to know

379
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,019
what explanation you would offer.

380
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,059
My lord,

381
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:10,059
I was deceived by Ye Chenyuan, causing

382
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,740
the sword's loss

383
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,779
and implicating our sect.

384
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,900
I willingly accept punishment.

385
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,099
But the Cloud Summit battle

386
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,660
was suspicious.

387
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:22,700
Ye Chenyuan isn't the Night Deity.

388
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:24,140
May I be permitted

389
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,819
to go to the Night Clan

390
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:26,940
for investigation?

391
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,660
Even at this juncture,

392
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:30,180
you still defend him?

393
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,579
Have you really developed feelings

394
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,339
for Ye Chenyuan?

395
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:38,940
I'm not defending him.

396
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,700
My lord,

397
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,819
Xiaoying acted foolishly,

398
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:45,779
but she was deceived

399
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:46,700
by Ye Chenyuan.

400
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,579
She's hurt in mind and soul.

401
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,779
She shouldn't contact him anymore.

402
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,180
I request permission to go

403
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:54,980
to reclaim the sword

404
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,059
for the Nine Heavens!

405
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,380
Master,

406
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,539
don't!

407
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,099
Enough!

408
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:04,819
This matter is assigned to you.

409
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:07,380
I've received word

410
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,500
that Ye Chenyuan has announced

411
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,980
his upcoming marriage to Hua Yuying.

412
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,859
Use this chance
to recover the Divine Sword.

413
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:18,900
As for you, Bai Xiaoying,

414
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,140
you're grounded in this Huiyue Abode

415
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,420
for self-reflection.

416
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,099
He and Hua Yuying

417
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:39,339
are getting married?

418
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,900
Ye Chenyuan.

419
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,259
Ye Chenyuan.

420
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:00,420
No!

421
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,400
Why did things come to this?

422
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,200
Do you know...

423
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,480
You asked me to marry Hua Yuying.

424
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,200
It broke my heart.

425
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:34,176
Do you have feelings for Xiaoying?

426
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,720
Yes.

427
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,619
Don't flatter yourself.

428
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,099
I never

429
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:48,619
fell for you.

430
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,619
Ye Chenyuan,

431
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,180
do I really look that easy to fool?

432
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:11,220
Master!

433
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,380
Are you here to see Xiaoying?

434
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,539
Yes.

435
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:19,980
I'll go to reclaim the sword
from the Night Clan.

436
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:21,339
I'm concerned

437
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:22,539
and came to check.

438
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:23,500
But...

439
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,059
Xiaoying's already resting.

440
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,940
You could tell me your message

441
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,380
for relay later.

442
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,180
Chang Qingrou,

443
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:35,579
are you hiding something from me?

444
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:37,019
I...

445
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:38,180
I...

446
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,299
Where's Xiaoying?

447
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,579
Master,

448
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
I couldn't stop her.

449
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:47,539
She left at dawn.

450
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:50,819
Must be for Ye Chenyuan's wedding.

451
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,579
I'll go bring her back.

452
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,420
Who's there?

453
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:31,180
Where is Ye Chenyuan?

454
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,740
I need to talk to him.

455
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,619
Today is the wedding day
of the Lord and Hua Yuying.

456
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,019
No outsiders are welcome.

457
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,299
Looks like I came in time.

458
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:46,259
How could this joyous event

459
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,380
be without me?
