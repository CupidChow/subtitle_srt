(Oh no.)

00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,584
(I made a mistake.)

29
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,180
The way you are right now

30
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:57,939
looks nothing like your usual self.

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,540
Now that you're in my grasp,

32
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,180
I'd like to see

33
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,299
what your true self

34
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,659
is.

35
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,320
What do you want?

36
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,144
Get off me.

37
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,659
Sir, don't rush to drive me away.

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,180
I'm right here before you,

39
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,020
what are you waiting for?

40
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:17,900
To restrain yourself,

41
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,699
you sealed your acupoints?

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,020
Do you think this solves it?

43
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,264
Let me tell you.

44
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,120
You are

45
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,340
even easier to be controlled.

46
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,340
(His eyes clearly showed
infatuation with me,)

47
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,259
(yet he'd rather harm himself
than touch me.)

48
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,139
(Other men would've
lost control long ago.)

49
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:50,919
Today, if we can capture that woman,

50
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,056
the bounty money will all be ours.

51
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,819
Since you reject me,

52
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:56,580
then I won't help you.

53
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,744
Lad,

54
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,199
did you see a woman
dressed like a dancer?

55
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,264
Where did she go?

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,192
Keep silence?

57
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,360
He's really suspicious.

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Could he be that woman in disguise?

59
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:25,319
Senior.

60
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,399
Show him what you got.

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,872
Okay.

62
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,899
Heaven and Earth, halt!

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,519
(These two)

64
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,160
(are utterly losers.)

65
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,560
That woman has some skills.

66
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,856
My turn.

67
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,688
Junior.

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,319
We must use our ultimate move.

69
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,379
- Run! Run!
- We can't win this fight.

70
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,019
(After playing all these tricks,)

71
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:29,939
(do you think you can escape?)

72
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:32,896
Stop!

73
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,620
E-Everything just now
was those Daoists' doing.

74
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,740
None of my business.

75
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,600
What?

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,199
You're blaming their mistakes on me?

77
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,184
No explanations needed.

78
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,139
You enjoy seducing with beauty, right?

79
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,360
You have to vow

80
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,439
that you'll never harm anyone's life.

81
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,439
If you break this vow,

82
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,259
you will be hideous.

83
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,600
Fine.

84
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,360
I, Bai Chuli, hereby vow

85
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,519
that if I commit any wicked deeds,

86
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,120
I'll be hideous.

87
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,424
Satisfied now?

88
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,720
Remember what you said today.

89
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,319
What I do

90
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,736
isn't for you to decide.

91
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,319
(To restrain yourself,)

92
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,079
(you sealed your acupoints?)

93
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,959
That immortal truly differs
from other vulgar men.

94
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,720
Pity I still don't know his name.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,120
I need to find a way to meet him again.

96
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:25,480
Don't come closer! Stay back!

97
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,496
I won't do it again.

98
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:27,639
I won't do it again. Never!

99
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,480
Weren't you trying to harass me?

100
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,624
What now?

101
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:32,279
Sorry! Spare me!

102
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,439
Please spare me!

103
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,656
Since that strange lad ruined our plans

104
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:43,552
last time,

105
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,160
so many days have passed,

106
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,319
yet we haven't seen that woman again.

107
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,959
They say the Night Clan women
seduce men with beauty.

108
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,720
Why don't we disguise ourselves

109
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
as charming scholars?

110
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,600
Good idea.

111
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,120
They say that woman
is a peerless beauty.

112
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,579
Let's flirt with her
before capturing her.

113
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,399
Are you looking for me?

114
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:12,519
You...

115
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,376
What?

116
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Stunned by my beauty?

117
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,816
What?

118
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,720
Your beauty?

119
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,848
How dare you!

120
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,399
I am stunningly beautiful.

121
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,360
How dare you to say nonsense?

122
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,759
Doubt my beauty?

123
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,120
I left your corpses intact.

124
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,720
Be grateful!

125
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,000
No one has ever doubted my beauty.

126
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,519
I, Bai Chuli, hereby vow

127
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,919
that if I commit any wicked deeds,

128
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,879
I'll be hideous.

129
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,928
Impossible.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
Impossible.

131
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,352
Look at her.

132
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,779
What's on her face? Terrifying.

133
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,919
That's terrifying.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,980
She looks like this.

135
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,440
What? Say it again if you dare!

136
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,120
That's terrifying.

137
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,259
What does she want?

138
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
What's terrifying?

139
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,919
You are. You are terrifying.

140
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,352
Men feel disgusted approaching you.

141
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:37,659
Children run away seeing you.

142
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:39,019
Stop ruining our business.

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,460
Madam.

144
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,120
Madam.

145
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,080
Madam.

146
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,799
Madam.

147
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,760
What's going on?

148
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,720
Why would she...

149
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,440
It's no use.

150
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,840
You brought back
less and less vital energy.

151
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,919
Madam had been starving

152
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,519
and forbade me from telling you.

153
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,879
Just now, she...

154
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,159
If my face were fine,

155
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,120
I would get men's vital energy.

156
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,639
It's all my fault.

157
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,120
She asked me to give this to you.

158
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
She said when you're severely injured,

159
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,480
this can protect you.

160
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,120
The supreme treasure,

161
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,279
Coldwood Origin Stone.

162
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,184
But

163
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,039
it couldn't save her life.

164
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,000
(When time goes by,)

165
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,879
(will I die like her too?)

166
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,032
Bai Chuli!

167
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,600
You feeble weaklings

168
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,960
have been staying here for long.

169
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,519
Now some are dead, others weakened.

170
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,440
Maybe you guys should move out.

171
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,032
Pah!

172
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,399
The Spiritual Spring
belongs to Madam and Ling

173
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,200
for sheltering
homeless Night Clan people.

174
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,679
Try to seize this place?

175
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,919
Shameless!

176
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,519
The winner takes all.

177
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,120
The strong devour the weak.

178
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,256
Bai Chuli,

179
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,440
you're hideous now.

180
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,879
You can't protect them anymore.

181
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,600
Stop trying to be bold.

182
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Why are you here?

183
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,840
You've been following me?

184
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,240
Seeing me like this

185
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,519
satisfies you, right?

186
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,480
I'd rather you kill me with your sword!

187
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,600
I didn't make you this way.

188
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,480
You broke

189
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,520
your own vow.

190
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,919
The men I harmed

191
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,240
had several wives at home,

192
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,799
yet they still

193
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,759
sought other women.

194
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,279
Some even abused women.

195
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,720
If they hadn't lusted after my beauty,

196
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,600
I couldn't have lured them.

197
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,759
If they could act like you,

198
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,399
could I harm anyone?

199
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,919
Are you suggesting

200
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:55,919
you did nothing wrong?

201
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,539
No.

202
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,919
What pains me is,

203
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,720
I've never harmed you,

204
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,120
yet you wanted to kill me for those men.

205
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,840
Be reasonable.

206
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,240
When did I want to kill you?

207
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,759
You made me like this.

208
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,480
It's like killing me!

209
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Even now,

210
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,759
I still don't know your name.

211
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,279
Want to know my name?

212
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,168
Of course.

213
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,679
You're the most handsome immortal

214
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,639
and the most tricky one I've met.

215
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,279
My name is Wan Guchen.

216
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,360
Wan Guchen?

217
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,159
That name sounds familiar.

218
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,120
You're the War God of Nine Heavens,

219
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,399
Wan Guchen?

220
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,519
No wonder you are so formidable

221
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
and always ruin my plans.

222
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,360
What?

223
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,608
Are you scared now?

224
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,559
You're the War God,

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,799
while I'm like this...

226
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,360
Focus on your own problem first.

227
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,480
You two stay here,

228
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,960
in case they come again.

229
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,088
Why

230
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,360
does this place feel so familiar?

231
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,120
Don't

232
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,320
look at my face.

233
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,344
What are you...?

234
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,320
I transfer my vital energy to you.

235
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,360
Stop harming others.

236
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:11,104
(Falling Snow)

237
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,000
Chuli.

238
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,519
Why hasn't Wan Guchen come anymore?

239
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,608
I don't know.

240
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,599
But I haven't gone hungry
these past days.

241
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,279
He must come secretly at night
while we sleep

242
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,119
to give us his vital energy.

243
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,359
Why doesn't he come meet us?

244
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,584
Ling.

245
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,359
Let's leave this place.

246
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,680
Why?

247
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,640
I want to see
if he'll come looking for me.

248
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,240
Okay.

249
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,808
Let's go.

250
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,880
Chuli, be careful.

251
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,136
I'm okay.

252
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,039
Chuli.

253
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,119
Your...

254
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,440
Your face...

255
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,728
Wan Guchen!

256
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,104
Wan Guchen!

257
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,539
I know it's you.

258
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:56,339
Why did you restore my beauty,

259
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,740
yet refuse to meet me?

260
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,559
Since you won't meet me,

261
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,640
I'll come find you.

262
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,112
War God,

263
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,168
you're back.

264
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,420
The Immortal Lord
asked you to go meet him.

265
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,808
Understood.

266
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,900
Why did you summon me?

267
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:46,500
I need to remind you

268
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:49,460
not to neglect your duties.

269
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,500
As the Sword Master of Nine Heavens,

270
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,859
I'll do my best naturally.

271
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,980
Don't worry about it.

272
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,220
Yet she has come to you.

273
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,460
War God.

274
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,700
Time to take action.

275
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,079
I won't harm her.

276
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:15,779
In that case,

277
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:19,740
I'll personally deal with her.

278
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,168
Wait!

279
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,539
I am here for someone.

280
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,980
Don't try to stop me!

281
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,619
So bold!

282
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:34,019
You are causing trouble here?

283
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,059
I really admire your courage.

284
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,819
You are the Immortal Lord
of Nine Heavens?

285
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,912
Exactly.

286
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,896
Perfect timing.

287
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,220
I'm here for Wan Guchen.

288
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,180
You didn't come for me,

289
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,460
but I came for you.

290
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,539
For the safety of Three Realms,

291
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,420
I have to end your life here.

292
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:58,619
Old man.

293
00:20:58,819 --> 00:20:59,859
Why being so unreasonable?

294
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:01,660
I'm just here for someone.

295
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,339
Why end my life for this?

296
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,539
Blame yourself

297
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,539
for being born into this world.

298
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:08,992
Stop!

299
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,688
Wan Guchen.

300
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,579
You finally came.

301
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:23,072
You shouldn't be here.

302
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:26,339
Since you're here,

303
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:28,460
then fulfill your duty.

304
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:31,019
She shouldn't exist in this world.

305
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:33,779
As the Sword Master of Nine Heavens,

306
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,779
if you defend her,

307
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,180
what would the masses think?

308
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,460
With me here today,

309
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,339
no one can harm her.

310
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,299
You know who she is.

311
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,180
Even if she has not awakened,

312
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:04,700
she's still one of Night Clan,

313
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,740
a scourge of all Three Realms,
and must be eliminated.

314
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,259
I expect you
to understand the importance

315
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,460
and tell right and wrong.

316
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:18,976
So,

317
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,740
you've been avoiding me

318
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,420
because who I am?

319
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,040
Old man.

320
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,088
Are you saying

321
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,900
if I weren't of Night Clan,

322
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,299
I wouldn't be treated this way?

323
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,339
What do you want to say?

324
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,700
I, Bai Chuli, love and hate boldly.

325
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:45,696
Now,

326
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,079
I have a crush on Wan Guchen.

327
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,980
If you fear me

328
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,980
because who I am.

329
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:54,944
Today,

330
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,832
I'll extract my demonic bone

331
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,619
from my body.

332
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,864
Are you insane?

333
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,380
Do you know the pain
of demonic bone extraction

334
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:09,220
rivals having your heart devoured?

335
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
A mistake

336
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,940
could lead you vanish into ashes.

337
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,259
Even so,

338
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
do you still do so?

339
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:18,912
Of course.

340
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:20,460
I won't regret it.

341
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,339
Stop!

342
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,352
Don't come closer!

343
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,224
Wan Guchen.

344
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:34,208
Do you know?

345
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:36,900
I never imagined

346
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:39,299
I'd fall for you again.

347
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,980
This demonic bone means nothing

348
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,500
compared to you.

349
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,872
Now,

350
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:25,660
who dares to question me?

351
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:29,140
I never expected you are so resolved.

352
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,779
I really admire you now.

353
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,579
But I never agreed

354
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:36,140
that I'd spare your life

355
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,099

for her?

360
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,019
Leave me be.

361
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,140
They never intended to spare me.

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,460
(Watching your beloved attacked)

381
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,776
(must be torture, right?)

382
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:37,312
Who's there?

383
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:39,180
(I am you.)

384
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:41,539
(I possess supreme power.)

385
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,032
(I can save him.)

386
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,059
What do you mean?

387
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:52,500
(Want power to save him?)

388
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,380
I must save him.

389
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:05,740
I want power.

390
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,859
I want power!

391
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:45,980
The Night Deity's power.

392
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:49,059
Her sealed Night Deity's power
has awakened!

393

Chen.

396
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:44,864
You're awake.

397
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,216
Are you hurt?

398
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:51,140
You should worry about yourself first.

399
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,140
You escaped with me
despite these grave injuries.

400
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,864
Wan Guchen.

401
00:28:58,019 --> 00:28:59,460
Sorry that I went to look for you

402
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,579
and caused your injuries.

403
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,019
Rest assured.

404
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:04,220
I'll protect you.

405
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,312
What's wrong?

406
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,019
Back in the Nine Heavens,

407
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,859
there was a voice

408
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,500
constantly speaking in my mind.

409
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,099
You know what it is,

410
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,800
don't you?

411
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,819
The Deity of Night Clan.

412
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:48,256
Night Deity?

413
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,456
Impossible.

414
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,500
That's an ancient evil god from myths.

415
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:57,619
He shouldn't exist!

416
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,339
He did exist.

417
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,900
He did exist three centuries ago.

418
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,740
I slew him.

419
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:10,539
Now he's revived within you.

420
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,259
Once the Night Deity's seal
within you weakens,

421
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,099
he'll fully awaken.

422
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,980
When that happens,

423
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,460
I'll vanish completely?
