For home buyers
Now is the last chance to buy a house

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,990
Because I can still barely get a loan
I may never have the chance to buy a house in Seoul again.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,660
I'm not not working.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,790

Just take some time off now

1.1 billion won?

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,590
No, you said 1.9 billion won.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,010
How could it increase by 10 million won in one hour?

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,050
Don't want to buy it

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,100
I can't bear to sell it, okay?

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,020
There are still many people waiting

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,100

(Royal City Xiliou is for urgent sale

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,350
Due to the recent decline in housing prices

House prices in Seoul

59
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,690
According to historical data, it will definitely rise.

60
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,690
Just hold on, you'll eventually rise

61
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,360
Especially those who spend all their money to buy a house.

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,610
As house prices continue to fall

63
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,320
Interest rates keep rising, so you're worried, right?

64
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,450
But we can't give up

65
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,030
If you sell it now, you will regret it forever

66
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,950
You must hold on

70
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,010
I wouldn't have bought the house if I had known
Should I buy cryptocurrency?

71
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,090
“So fucking envious”

72
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:52,930
What?

73
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,350
I just heard your voice.

74
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,180
No

75
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,900
Blame them for those lucky people

76
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,650
So that everyone is tempted

77
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,940
Don't have that ability

80
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,280
It's because of these speculators

82
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,200
Yes or no?

83
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,250
Oh yeah

84
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,580
But I'm not speculating, I really live there

85
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,460
Oh, you really live in there?

86
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,380
yes

87
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,260

89
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,220
At least you have a place to live now.
There was nothing before

90
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,140
So there is progress

91
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,720
Yes or no?

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,350
It's really that guy.
If I had focused on my work, I would have been a section chief long ago.

93
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,780
no way

94

96
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,540
Judging from historical data, it will definitely rise.

97

Wait and see

98
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,000
I must hold on

99

100
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,510
Really fucking

101
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,760
The question is, can you hold on until then?

102
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,590
Your monthly salary is not enough to pay the mortgage

103
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
What else can I do?

104
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,850
Sell it? What if the price goes up after selling it?

105
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,310
What if I don’t sell and the price continues to fall?

106
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,140
brute

107
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,610
Stop struggling.

108
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,110
You tried your best, kid.

109
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,200
Even if I want to sell it, no one will buy it.

110
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,320
And because I have a lot of loans, I can't rent a full house.

111
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,780
If you have a companion
Even if you are heavily in debt, it won't be so painful

112
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,290
I told you not to cancel the engagement but you didn't listen

113
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,500
Hello!

114
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,330
How can you mention "breaking off the engagement" in front of me?

115
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,040
Because I'm worried about you

116
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,170

Are you going to attend Chief Xu's farewell party?

121
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,970
I heard he treated everyone to roast beef.

122
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,560
I have to make money and don't have time to go

123
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,690
You do that part-time job
When will the loan be paid off?

124
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,480
So we gave Chief Xu a lot of wine.

125
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,190
Then lure him into telling you the secret of investment

126
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,400
-invest?
-Um

127
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,150
Seeing Chief Xu make money
Thinking about your liquidated cryptocurrencies again?

128
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,110
Really

129
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,490
How can you mention "being liquidated" in front of me?

130
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,160
Because I'm worried about you

131
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,740
Look at you, you look so awkward

132
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,330

Stop it, you house slave.

134

Stop it, you coin slave

Let's go

136
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,930
When will my cryptocurrency
Can I make a lot of money? Then I don't have to work anymore.

137
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,430
I don’t expect to make a fortune from cryptocurrencies
I just hope I don't have to work overtime.

00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,550
no

183
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,390
So please stop putting these on our doors.

184
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,190
No noise when you're not home

185
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,610
What are you doing?

186
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,030
You listen carefully

187
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,660
If my husband comes, you're screwed.

188
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,040
You are

189
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,750
Threatening me?

190
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,250
I'm worried about you

191
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,130
I've said it several times.

192
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,550
No, I am not the voice on my side.

193
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,640
Vibration and footsteps
It's all coming from upstairs.

194
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,220
Why don’t you come in and listen?

195
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,470
Wait a minute!

196
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,770
Why are you like this?

197
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,480
Will you pay my electricity bill?

198
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,480
shoe

199
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,110
slippers!

200
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,440
go out

201
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,780
Very quiet

202
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,490
wrong

203
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,030
It was noisy just now

204
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,000
Young people are so shameless that they refuse to admit their mistakes

205
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,170
You look down on me, don't you? Because I'm a tenant.

206
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,050
What?

207
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,460
Hey, what did you just say?

208
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,630
I can't bear it any longer.

209
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,220
What else can you do if you can't bear it?

210
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,860
Really

211
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,860
Damn, was this intentional?

212
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,760
What are you doing?

213
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,600
Hello

214
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,230
I live downstairs at No. 1401

215
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,980
Um, what's the matter?

216
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,480
That's the one

217
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,360
No. 1301 downstairs always comes to me to complain

218
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,320
She said they have a senior high school student and a junior high school student.
You should know that this is a sensitive period.

219
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,320
so what?

220
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,870
It seems that what I said is a bit complicated

221
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,960
If the phone is placed on the ground, it will ring at night.

222
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,620
The vibration sound will be very loud

223
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,920
There are also sounds of furniture being dragged and footsteps.

224
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,460
You like exercising, don't you?

225
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,630
Loud noise during exercise

226
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,920
Are you talking about me?

227
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,100
It seems like it’s been a few months?

228
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,100
Right after you moved in

229
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,100
The sound starts

230
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,770
You mean you're quiet at home?

231
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,850
After I moved in
Your downstairs neighbors start complaining about noise?

232
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,560
right

233
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,110
Then you must feel very annoyed and wronged.

234
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,360
Thank you for understanding

235
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,200
I'm in your situation now.

236
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,780
What?

237
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,660
I slept well.

238
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,990
Suddenly the neighbor downstairs came up to me and told me that I was very noisy

239
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,330
Oh this is really...

240
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,460
-Talk to the management office...
- I told him

241
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,580
Not on my side

242
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,710
I should check first before coming to you.

243
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,760
I made the same mistake as my downstairs neighbor

244
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,010
Sorry for waking you up.

245
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,100
If you're really sorry
Can you come upstairs and talk to me?

246
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,020
Ah? I'll go and tell you?

247
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
They are noisy every night.

248
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,770
Please tell them
If you continue to quarrel, it will not end well.

249
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,190
You think it's your upstairs...

250
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,360
If it's not me, it's not you.
Isn't that definitely upstairs?

251
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Please

252
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,110
I said sorry

253
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,660
My phone was on vibrate and I didn't hear the alarm.

254
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,450
Yeah, it's almost here.

255
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,210
Um

256
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,840
Scare me

257
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,300
I live on the 14th floor, downstairs from you.

258
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,760
oh

259
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,590
Is there anything I can help you with?

260
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,060
Don't you really know why I came up to you?

261
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,890
The children are sleeping now

262
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,690
We have mats on the floor.

263
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,980
Even with the mat...

264
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,520
(Noise-free room
Noiseless safety mat installation certification)

265
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,030
The vibration alarm is very loud

266
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,860
What are you talking about?

267
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,740
I don't even set an alarm for fear that the kids will wake up

268
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,080
Stop lying

269
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,250
I just heard you say something about an alarm clock.

270
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,660
Are you eavesdropping on my phone call?

271
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,080
It's so late and you're still talking so loudly

272
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,960
How could I not hear it?

273
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,880
I didn't set an alarm

274
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,210
So of course I can't hear the alarm.

275
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,840
What?

276
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,850
I feel embarrassed for being late
So I just lied and said I didn't hear the alarm

277
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,430
Really?

278
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,100
I don't like to talk bad about others behind their backs.
But it seems I have to tell you

279
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,850
That's the sound from upstairs.

280
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,860
Is that the 17th floor?

281
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,940
Yeah, they get up early.

282
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,360
How could the sound from the 17th floor reach our house?

283
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,030
I live on the 14th floor

284
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,860
Go see it for yourself.

285
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,410
Oh shit

286
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,250
(Mincheng Church members, the Lord loves us)

287
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,420
Who is it?

288
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,260
Sir, I am the neighbor on the 14th floor
The downstairs downstairs from you

289
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,050
Come in

290
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,310
Jesus created us

291
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,850
What's wrong with this guy?

292
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,860
You bring it into the room.

293
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,980
More for neighbors...

294
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,650
Haven't you seen a walker?

295
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,950
Hello sir

296
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,290
What are you doing coming up from the 14th floor so early in the morning?

297
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,660
Because of the noise, Mr.

298
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,750
The noise caused a lot of inconvenience to the residents downstairs.

299
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,920
I hope you can keep your voice down.

300
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,130
Is there any noise?

301
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,010
I have difficulty walking a few steps, why is there noise?

302
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,590
The time period when neighbors heard the noise

303
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,010
In the early morning after you wake up

304
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,260
This time period

305
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,970
Especially the alarm clock vibration sound

306
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,930
Do you have any evidence?

307
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,810
Huh? Evidence?

308
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,270
It's miserable enough that I have to sit all day.

309
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,150
You don't even have any evidence.
Just say that I, an old man, make noise

310
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,360
I have difficulty walking.

311
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,740
That's not the case.

312
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,450
In the past

313
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,200
Neighbors know each other's living room number.

314
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,950
Mutual understanding and care should be like this

315
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,330
How is it possible that there is no sound at all when people are living there?

316
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,040
And the sound of dogs

317
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,960
How is that possible?

318
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,290
How could Xiaopang’s voice possibly reach you?

319
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,380
This is not a paper house.

320
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,750
If it's not a person barking, then it must be a dog barking

321
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,670
If you have so much dissatisfaction
Don't say this here.

322
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,050
Let’s go upstairs and talk!

323
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,680
Sir, I have already climbed several floors.

324
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,850
Go and formally protest to the residents’ representatives!

325
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,470
that…

326
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,380
Damn

327
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,010
Damn

328
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,060
Are you number 1401?

329
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,440
oh…

330
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,030
Oh hello

331
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,360
Do you know me?

332
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,490
The person downstairs just called me and told me

333
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,860
Say you want to talk to a resident representative

334
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,120
Do you want to come in and talk?

335
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,380
You come up to my level.
Just because of the noise problem?

336
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,510
yes

337
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,720
Because everyone told me to go upstairs and say

338
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,220
I'm sorry, I finally came to your side.

339
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,640
Why is everyone only thinking about upstairs?

340
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,980
This is the wall structure.

341
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,150
The walls of each house are connected together.

342
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,940
Is it the sound from upstairs or downstairs?

343
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,030
How do they know?

344
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,150
Are you saying this is a problem with the apartment itself?

345
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,910
What's wrong with the apartment?

346
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,240
Ultimately, the problem lies with people

347
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,240
That's right.

348
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,120
My downstairs neighbor keeps posting notes on my door

349
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,790
I am so wronged

350
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,880
I'll help you solve this problem.

351
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,710
I am the landlord of No. 1301

352
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,050
Are you the landlord of No. 1301?

353
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,430
I won't renew my contract with them.
So can you hold out for another two months?

354
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,810
If you are the landlord, please go and talk to them.

355
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,640
I can't stand it for another two months.

356
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,060
This is your compensation.

357
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,610
No, you can't do this.

358
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,440
What about me

359
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,440
More than just a landlord

360
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,360
Also a resident representative?

361
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,530
I want to get those weird people
Evicted from our apartment

362
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,080
I hope you can cooperate

363
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,580
Too

364
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,500
How can there be no sound when people live there?

365
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,710
I thought so too

366
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,250
As expected

367
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,840
You and I are both registered users and have a common language

368
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,130
No, my house.

369
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,470
Bought it on loan

370
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,260
It's hard to buy it with loans everywhere

371
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,060
That's not easy either.

372
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,430
You must be able to borrow money

373
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,520
No, I don't have any ability.

374
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,900
What's your name?

375
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,900
My name is Lu Yusheng

376
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,230
Do you live alone?

377
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,190
right

378
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,780
For now

379
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,400
Live alone

380
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,700
That’s a heavy burden, right?

381
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,370
I can't sell it because I'm afraid the price will go up.

382
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,160
And it’s not easy to find a fully rented house outside

383
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,540
I guess people around you will look at you strangely.

384
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,920

385
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,170
Hold on for a while longer

386
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,710
As long as the intercity express train is open, things will be fine.

387
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,300
Is there really hope for intercity express rail?

388
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,010
certainly

389
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,010
This is a critical period for our apartment.

390
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,430
There must be no commotion.

391
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,140
you understand

392
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,020
I mean, right?

393
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,940
Um

394
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,440
I see

395
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,400
For our apartment

396
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,900
I will try my best to endure

397
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,120
(Please keep quiet shhh!)

398
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,590
Damn it

399
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,180
It's terrible

400
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,340
This is pretty serious, shouldn't we call the police?

401
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,720
You can say you are being blackmailed, illegally stalked, etc.

402
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,890
What if that stimulates them even more?

403
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,850
Residents' representatives said to be careful

404
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,730
Just because she gives you some money you call her your representative?

405
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,810
The money she gave was enough to pay the interest

406
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,230
Of course, she should be the representative

407
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,110
You are just trying to draw water with a bamboo basket.

408
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,530
Here you are again

409
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,860
never mind

410
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,160
Seeing your attitude, I won't help you.

411
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,370
-What?
-Aren't you curious?

412
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,290
-Say it
-Want to know?

413
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,210
hurry up

414
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,080
yesterday

415
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,290
I gave Chief Xu a lot of wine

416
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,880
Finally, he told me about a lead investment forum

417
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,960
Hello

418
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,510
You better be careful with that stuff, boy.

419
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,140
You mean manipulating the market or something...

420
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,260
-Shut up!
-Oh shit

421
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,260
Come here

422
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,310
-come over
- It's so dirty

423
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,430
- Damn
- Look

424
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Hello!

425
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,430
look

426
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,810
Tonight at twelve o'clock

427
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,520
If GB coin falls to 815 won, it will be the bottom price

428
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:20,030
Then it started to rise again and on Liberation Day
The rate of return will reach 815%, which is the peak

429
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,490
Then it will hit the bottom

430
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,530
That is, buy it at 815 won

431
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,240
- Then earn 815% profit
-Um

432
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,000
GB coin name
It is the abbreviation of the Korean pronunciation of Liberation Day.

433
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,420
Yes, 815% return
This is roughly equal to earning nine times the principal.

434
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,210
Nine times?

435
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,630
Fuck you idiot, you still believe this?

436
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,550
All right

437
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,470
You see, these people smashed first and then pulled last week.

438
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,220
First, lower the price of Lauracoin to 500 won
Then stir it up to make it five times higher

439
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,720

441

Isn't that illegal? This is dangerous.

442
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,110
It seems your situation is not that urgent.

443
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,070
Forget it. I don't need to convince you.

444
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,820
You don't want such valuable information.

445
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,950
I really don't understand

446
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,610
That's not the case.

447
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,990
I don't have any capital to invest

448
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,240
I don't have the money to invest.

449
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,040
This is definitely profitable. If you don't have money, you can look for private loans.

450
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,370
Private loan?

451
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,630
You want me to borrow money again?

452
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,590
Hey, this is not a loan.

453
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,800
This will help you pay back the money

454
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,260
As long as you can get
About 80 million won 8x9 equals 72

455
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,180
Enough to pay off your 700 million won debt
You don't have to pay it back for a lifetime, and you'll still have 20 million left after you finish paying it back.

456
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,100
I don't know. I'm in enough pain now.

457
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,020
It's not 100% guaranteed.
They also asked me to look for private loans.

458
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,180

You may have to mortgage your house)

sorry

466
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,070
It's not my fault

467
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,570

no

471
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,090
I can't go on like this

473
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,800
Are you sure? Can you swear to it?

Have you got the funds?

476
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,730
- I'm going to borrow it.
-Really?

477
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,560

I want to sell now and put up an "urgent sale" ad

480
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,490
Now it's all about "urgent selling"

481

482
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,240

486
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,080
Sign the contract and pay the deposit today

487
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,500
It's so late now

488
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,050
How to sign a contract?

489
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,710
If you don't sign today, I won't sell it.

490
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,760
I won't sell it tomorrow.

00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,920
-You know what?
-815

544
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,250
Just buy it when it reaches 815 won, right?

545
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,500
It is the date of Liberation Day on 815

546
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,710
- It's time to focus
-Um

547
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,050
Hang up first

548
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,970
Oh my god

549
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,060
(Gobit Purchase Contract
GB coin purchase transaction completed)

550
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,990
Hello

551
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,570
Are you watching?

552
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,950
-Hello
-Um

553
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,000
What the fuck is going on?

554
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,580
that is

555
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,040
It seems to have doubled.

556
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,460
Changyu, am I seeing things?

557
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,590
-Right?
-Right?

558
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,960
-Yeah?
-Hey this...

559
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,250
-This is too...
- Wait, that's not right.

560
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,880
This is too unrealistic, isn't it? Still rising

561
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,880
Be quiet

562
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,890
Before reaching the expected rate of return
You must never let your guard down, you know?

563
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,180
Can you repeat what I said about the peak day?

564
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,390
Well

565
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,220
August

566
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,390
-No.15
- On August 15th

567
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,560
morning

568
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,190
8 o'clock

569
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,520
-15 points
-8:15

570
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,020
Peak yield

571
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,980
-815%
-Yes.

572
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,070
-Right?
- Just remember 815

573
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,450
Because after 8:15, they will all be thrown away

574
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,160
We have to throw it away before that, okay?

575
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,280
Don't be too greedy

576
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,530
-good
-good

577
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,330
-Hello
-What's wrong?

578
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,540
In this case

579
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,040
About 800…

580
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,380
What's wrong?

581
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,290
800…

582
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,710
When the rate of return reaches 800%

583
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,380
-Just sell it, right?
-Um

584
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,050
If something goes wrong

585
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,340
We have to sell it quickly.

586
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,300
Should we apply for annual leave?
Stay at home until Liberation Day.

587
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,140
24 hours a day attention

588
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,810
-Hello Changyu
-What's wrong?

589
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,890
-What's wrong again?
-Thank you

590
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,270
-Thank you!
- You still wait

591
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,600
Thank you after you are completely free from the loan.

592
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,520
good

593
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,530
wait…

594
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,490
cough

595
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,860
(income: +137333799 won
Yield: +161.65%)

596
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,020
(It's too noisy, be quiet!)

597
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,440
I'm really sorry

598
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,570
But can I go in and take a look?

599
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,990
noise

600
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,320
Are you doubting me?

601
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,910
If you don't want to be suspected
Then let's take a look at it together.

602
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,080
Oh...really

603
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,580
Good to see

604
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,250
Really

605
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,590
I'm going crazy

606
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,880
Why is it so quiet when someone comes over?

607
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,720
Is this really a coincidence?

608
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,510
That's right

609
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,140
I don't understand either

610
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,640
It's like someone is watching us

611
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,390
Who is watching?

612
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,430
I think

613
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,730
It's downstairs

614
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,270
-downstairs?
-Um

615
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,690
You'll know when you go and see it.

616
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,990
I think the people downstairs are not normal

617
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,650
I guess they were making noise in retaliation

618
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,070
How about we go and take a look?

619
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,450
It turns out that the sound from downstairs can reach our house.

620
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,120
You may not know

621
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,290
Our Apartments

622
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,710
this

623
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,000
This wall is connected to every household.

624
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,130
Are you kidding?

625
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,130
What?

626
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,670
I won't continue to endure

627
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,470
Do you think the downstairs can beat the upstairs?

628
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,230
Damn

629
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,490
Are you kidding?

630
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,610
It's just a joke.

631
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,750
(Please be quiet!)

632
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,670
Hello!

633
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,380
I know you guys are out at home

634
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,550
Are you coming out or not?

635
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,260
- Damn
-What are you doing?

636
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,300
I live upstairs

637
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,560
They filmed our house.

638
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,680
Spying on our house and making noises

639
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,980
I heard it was your side that made the noise.

640
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,150
Me? My side?

641
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,070
Who said that?

642
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,070
Is that what they said?

643
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,480
etc.

644
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,690
Excuse me

645
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,280
It's really not me, okay?

646
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,530
Hello!

647
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,630
Can I borrow your lighter?

648
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,340
good

649
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,550
What are you looking at?

650
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,010
nothing

651
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600
In the apartment building next door
Did you know that a murder occurred?

652
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,860
Really? What's going on?

653
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,740
Because of the noise problem in the apartment

654
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,280
No matter what, you can't kill people.

655
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,330
We also have a serious noise problem in our apartment.

656
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,540
It's really worrying

657
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,790
Not to that extent.

658
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,250
People who make noise generally don't know how loud it is.

659
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,760
What?

660
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,100
If a murder really happens

661
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,020
Will house prices fall a lot?

662
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,850
What are you talking about?

663
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,020
You fuck

664
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,650
It turns out it’s you!

665
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:43,240
The man who stabbed my tire with a knife
You're the beast.

666
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,490
Let’s see who can hold out the longest. I won’t go out!

667
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,410
I won’t go out!

668
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,040
(August 9th is six days away from Liberation Day)

669
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,350
come on!

670
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,940
(There are four days left until Liberation Day)

671
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,610
Damn it!

672
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,870
(There are three days left until Liberation Day)

673
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,080
(Two days left until Liberation Day)

674
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,920
Open the door, damn.

675
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,380
-come out
-Come out

676
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,760
-Come out
-Are you home or not?

677
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,970
-Hello!
-What are you doing?

678
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,070
I am in Seoul now

679
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,030
Come see my son

680
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,410
Wait a moment

681
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,080
I have to go cook.

682
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,080
mom

683
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,540
Get up

684
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,840
Come and eat

685
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,510
Is it tiring to live here?

686
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:28,800
tired

687
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,510
Mom, I'm sorry.

688
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,770
If I were from Seoul

689
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:35,680
mom

690
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,060
Everything is fine now

691
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,440
I have settled my debt and your loan

692
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,530
Please be quiet

693
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,440
ah?

694
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,570
It's noisy!

695
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,740
Hold

696
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,990
(One day left until Liberation Day)

697

(Royal City of Silio)

699
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,850
Damn

700
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:48,940
You fucking

701
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,440
You want to fight me, right?

702
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:51,740
All right

703
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,740
Damn it

704
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,500
-Open the door!
-What for?

705
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,410
Please open the door

706
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,040
I said it's not my side!

707
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,670
Please come out and see

708
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,130
Please open the door

709
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,420
Why the hell are you always targeting me?

710
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,010
- He was at home
- Don't open the door at home.

711
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:18,680
The sound is gone

712
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,600
So shameless

713
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,270
The subwoofer sound is gone

714
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:22,520
-Huh?
- Really?

715
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,350
You still have the nerve to say I'm noisy

716
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,560
So it’s you?

717
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,770
You're so embarrassed to ask me to keep my voice down?

718
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,820
So shameless

719
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,530
Did you see that? It's his side.

720
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,400
Let's stop guessing.

721
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,360
Since everyone is here
Let’s take a look at it together

722
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,410
-good
- Okay, let's take a look together.

723
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,410
Wait a moment

724
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,990
This situation is easy to be misunderstood

725
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,950
- Just take a look
-have a look

726
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,620
What are you doing? You can't come in.

727
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:46,580
Are you trespassing?

728
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,290
This sound is not like normal apartment noise.
More like a subwoofer sound

729
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,290
How come there is a subwoofer?

730
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,210
There's no point in us talking here.

731
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,670
Call the police directly

732
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,470
Good alarm

733
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:56,590
Let him go to jail

734
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,970
Stop doing this

735
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,430
- That's too much.
-Well?

736
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,470
- Really
-What?

737
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,730
Do you want to make a big deal out of this?

738
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,730
Everyone knows
This is a critical period for our apartment.

739
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,940
We have to live a normal life though.

740
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,650
Apartment prices stabilized
We can live a good life

741
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,900
You want to catch a bug?
And destroy the entire apartment?

742
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,370
Just catch the one who makes the noise
What other impacts could this have on the apartment?

743
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,490
I think you're making a big deal out of nothing

744
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:28,960
how?

745
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,630
Do you want to report it to the radio station?

746
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:32,840
Do you want to post it online?

747
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,340
You want everyone to know

748
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,050
Is noise a serious problem in our apartment?

749
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,390
I thought about it

750
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,680
I think you guys are weird

751
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,730
If you can't stand the noise, just move out.

752
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,140
Why do you still want to live here?

753
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,350
-You mean...
-You're right.

754
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,940
To prevent other people from moving in.

755
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,150
Is that what he meant by making noise on purpose?

756
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:56,110
-Yeah
-Why?

757
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:58,820
Once the intercity express train is opened, the monthly rent and full rent will increase

758
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,110
So you want to promote it to the public
This apartment has a noise problem, right?

759
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,320
Wait a moment

760
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,330
How did we get there?

761
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,870
What kind of logic is this?

762
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,250
You doubt us

763
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,120
Is it because we are tenants?

764
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,420
Come on, you guys are the ones causing trouble

765
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,380
Sir, the last time you came to my house

766
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,380
No sound, right?

767
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,590
Do you know why?

768
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:23,010
Because the people downstairs from me
Using a cell phone to secretly monitor our home

769
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,930
If I'm home they make noises

770
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,770
Be quiet when someone comes

771
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,520
To make everyone doubt me

772
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,730
Do you have any evidence?

773
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:30,890
evidence?

774
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,900
Show everyone your phone

775
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,020
You are their family.

776
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,860
We have to visit their home first.

777
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,110
They must have a subwoofer.

778
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:39,280
etc.

779
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,490
Okay, Yusheng

780
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,990
If you look downstairs first

781
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,780
Will you show everyone your house?

782
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:45,700
Um

783
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,120
Of course.

784
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,410
But it shouldn't be necessary

785
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,580
Then let's go visit your house first.

786
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,040
Everyone is already on this floor

787
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,750
- Let's look at their house first.
-how?

788
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,710
You want to hide it while everyone is at my house?

789
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,470
No, I won't stay here.

790
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:01,590
Yusheng

791
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,050
I know it's not you

792
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,470
-right
- I'll show it to you first.

793
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,180
Arguing is just a waste of time

794
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,850
Okay, let's look at our house first.

795
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,320
The administrator can go in.

796
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,320
Oh ok

797
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,820
Let me watch it too.

798
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,860
Anyway, every household has the same structure.

799
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:23,950
It's rare to see it once, so watch it carefully

800
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,030
Okay, it should be faster if two people watch it

801
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:29,830
gentlemen

802
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,290
I will search your house myself.

803
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,580
as you like

804
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,790
-Where did this come from?
-Did you hear that?

805
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,960
Can you hear it?

806
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:40,710
Look, it’s not me?

807
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,220
It's not me, right?

808
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,340
Then let's go downstairs.

809
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,340
Let's go

810
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,680
Found it

811
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,980
We should hear that kind of speaker

812
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,460
(Super noise revenge
18 hours of construction site noise audio)

813
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,250
Didn’t you say it was downstairs?

814
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,800
Um?

815
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,880
this…

816
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,300
You're a scumbag

817
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,680
What the hell are you doing?

818
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,600
what the hell?

819
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,060
How did you do that?

820
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:41,730
You have to go to a mental hospital before you go to the police.

821
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,530
Hold!

822
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,820
When did you come in?

823
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,280
What are you doing?

824
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,070
When did you come in?

825
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,370
go out!

826
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,660
Get out!

827
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,250
Get out!

828
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,160
What’s going on in there?

829
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,330
It's not me.

830
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,290
He must have entered our house through the balcony.

831
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,920
All that stuff is installed...

832
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,880
what to do?

833
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,040
Hello

834
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:37,870
-Hello
-He was beaten, right?

835
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,040
Could he be dead?

836
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,790
I didn’t do anything…

837
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,260
- Sorry to borrow it.
- Someone called the police here. Let's go take a look.

838
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,800
- He hit someone.
-etc

839
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,470
Raise your hand

840
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,510
Back

841
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,390
Not me…

842
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,520
- Kneel down and don't move.
-husband

843
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,680
- Kneel down
-Were you beaten?

844
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,020
You were arrested for violence

845
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,520
This beast hit someone!

846
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:02,730
Really

847
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,190
How many times have I said it?

848
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,940
I was the one who got beaten

849
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:07,940
The person downstairs is self-harming

850
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,650
Got it, please wait.

851
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,240
The victim will arrive soon

852
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,370
8:15 Clearing

853
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,410
-Liquidation
-Oh my god, I'm going crazy

854
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:16,870
I am the victim!

855
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,170
Excuse me

856
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,630
Sir, today I

857
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:23,710
Can't stay here like this now

858
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,590
I really have a matter of life and death to attend to.

859
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,260
I'll go home and be back soon

860
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,970
Can I come back in handcuffs after this?

861
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,430
What's the matter?

862
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,970
It's my personal matter.

863
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,140
-Personal matter?
-right

864
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,560
Then let's do the work first.

865
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,060
Please give me your phone.

866
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,150
I need to call a lawyer, give me the phone.

867
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,400
Which one of these two?

868
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,610
that

869
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,950
Black Black

870
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:51,950
but

871
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:53,620
Why two phones?

872
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,950
One of them

873
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,160
It's connected to the noise speaker.

874
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,250
Yeah?

875
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,290
Can I go to the bathroom?

876
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,210
So sudden?

877
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,590
Do you want me to pull it here?

878
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,300
Wait a minute

879
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,220
Sudden stomach pain

880
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,470
catch

881
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,140
Wait a moment!

882
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,390
Relax!

883
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,810
-Wait a moment
-Don't move

884
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,440
-Don't move
- Please let me go

885
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,860
What's going on? Why is it so noisy?

886
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,980
Why did they quarrel when I was doing paperwork?

887
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,320
I want to write a report!

888
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:32,740
The suspect just tried to escape

889
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,160
Feel sorry!

890
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:41,080
What are you doing? Where does this guy come from?

891
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
He suddenly ran away

892
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,380
(Login by QR code)

893
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,840
(QR code identity authentication)

894
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,300
Bring me the keys

895
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,800
Oh shit

896
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,220
That's my personal space, damn.

897
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,220
Get out before I break the door down!

898
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,230
Please

899
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,440
Please

900
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,120
(yield: +624.98%)

901
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,580
The key is here

902
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,490
Open the door

903
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,590
(Confirmed to sell)

904
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,180
continue

905
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:36,890
Open

906
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:37,800
push

907
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:39,260
Wait a moment

908
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,510
There is a sofa

909
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:42,720
Just ten seconds, sir.

910
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,890
Ten seconds! Shoot!

911
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,100
shot

912
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:48,020
Why are you shooting it in the face?

913
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:52,940
Hit

914
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,570
- Push it open
- Push away

915
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,080
(Confirmed to sell)

916
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,370
Don't move!

917
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,290
Raise your hands

918
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,540
What does he want to do with my computer?

919
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:09,710
(Confirmed to sell)

920
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,750
(Cancel confirmation of sale)

921
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:20,100
You can't hold on like that.

922
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,010
Hello

923
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,890
(Cancel confirmation of sale)

924
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,020
What's wrong with him?

925
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,270
He is moving

926
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,980
(Cancel confirmation of sale)

927
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,650
(Cancel confirmation of sale)

928
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,030
(Confirmed to sell)

929
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,250
(Confirmed to sell)

930
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,970
No matter what, you shouldn't use a stun gun.

931
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,970
This is excessive force.

932
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,430
Please help me tell me, I hope nothing will happen

933
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:04,890
Are you okay?

934
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:06,600
Are you okay?

935
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,850
We are on Mr. Jeon Kwang-cheol's phone
Found the hidden video

936
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,940
There is also money to testify
It was the one downstairs who started it.

937
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,610
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

938
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:17,820
He said he misunderstood you.

939
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,360
Will you forgive him?

940
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,740
That's how we do it.

941
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,740
Okay, that's it.

942
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,910
Although you are wronged, but the current situation
This is the most reasonable way to deal with it

943
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,040
Will you please listen to me?

944
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,420
You can go back now. Your phone is here.

945
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,960
Put it in this bag.

946
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,860
The house price is finally going up.

947
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,020
Approved

948
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,030
(Express Rail confirmed to open)

949
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,110
I've been waiting for a long time.

950
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:29,640
(yield: -99.98%)

951
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,000
(I wrote to you when I was a child and never...)

952
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,710
(Sorry I want to end this)

953
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:35,670
(Leave you there alone...)

954
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,870
(My house in Seoul...)

955
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:45,220
(All gone)

956
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:54,680
(Sorry, Mom, I feel wronged)

957
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,580
Hey, did I tell you to be quiet?

958
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,040
Not me

959
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,040
It's really not me

960
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:01,880
You beast!

961
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,050
Not me

962
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,630
Not me

963
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,260
Help!

964
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,180
-save…
-"Help"?

965
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:15,890
Hold!

966
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:16,810
-"Help"?
-save…

967
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,560
Help

968
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,560
We today

969
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,020
Just get this over with, you bastard.

970
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,700
What?

971
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:38,830
Is it really not you?

972
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:42,130
I said it wasn't me you bastard!

973
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,230
Even if I feel wronged

974
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,770
You have to think about your mother too, right?

975
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,610
Everything is screwed

976
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,940
Those two bastards downstairs

977
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,030
Ruined my life

978
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,870
so what?

979
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:16,660
Are you going to kill them with this?

980
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:19,580
You see, they keep making noise.

981
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:21,250
that is

982
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,250
Why make noise at all?

983
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,840
There must be a reason, right?

984
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,000
I think so.

985
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:29,960
Let's go downstairs first.

986
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,880
- Let's go together
-Together?

987
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:34,640
Why do you suddenly want to go with me?

988
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,600
You just treated me like a bad guy.

989
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:39,390
Go check it out

990
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,380
Huh?

991
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,600
Is anyone there?

992
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,970
Is there no one?

993
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,980
Oops, the door is not locked.

994
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,140
Aren't you afraid of being stolen?

995
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:37,070
It seems that no one

996
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,330
They might be back soon.

997
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,200
Let's see if there are any big speakers.

998
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:43,960
Large speakers

999
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:08,900
Nothing suspicious

1000
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,900
But why is there this sound?

1001
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,860
It seems that it's not their side.

1002
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,280
It should be someone else's house

1003
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:22,950
Oh my god, so much money owed

1004
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,580
Loans, income tax

1005
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,420
(Enforcement Notice)

1006
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,580
Depend on

1007
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:32,420
The landlord was born in 2009

1008
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,380
have a look

1009
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,970
(Real Estate Full Lease Renewal Contract)

1010
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:37,510
(Jia Zhuhao, the agent of Jia Junzhe)

1011
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,720
Jia Junzhe was born in 2009

1012
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,060
The top floor also bought our house.

1013
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,270
I tell you, it's even scarier.

1014
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,020
Our landlord is also on the top floor

1015
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,230
Really?

1016
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,900
They used my full rental deposit to pay the balance

1017
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,190
So are the 13th, 14th and 15th floors all top floors?

1018
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,610
There may be more

1019
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,200
What are you doing?

1020
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,740
Are they buying the entire apartment building?

1021
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,120
Damn it.

1022
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,290
She must have known in advance that the intercity express train would be connected

1023
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,500
So I deliberately made noise

1024
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,540
So that you can buy the whole apartment yourself

1025
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,500
You can't say that either.

1026
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,000
So many households belong to her.
The noise problem is not good for her.

1027
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:15,420
You saw it last night.

1028
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,010
No one mentions this because they are afraid it will affect the house price.

1029
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,430
That's it

1030
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,720
It's the top floor that's making the noise, right?

1031
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,470
If it's really the top

1032
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:26,220
These contracts are just empty words.

1033
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,770
Why?

1034
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:30,230
Because we found the evidence

1035
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:31,730
If she doesn't cancel the contract

1036
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,690
We can tell her that we're going to report it to the media.

1037
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:35,320
What the fuck else can they do?

1038
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:37,740
People like them

1039
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:39,950
Don't want to make things bigger

1040
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,950
good

1041
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,620
Makes sense

1042
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:45,950
So now all we have to do is find the evidence, right?

1043
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,660
evidence

1044
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,250
Even if you find a speaker,

1045
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,170
But we can't go in.

1046
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:59,050
(Top level answer and hang up)

1047
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:10,560
Hello

1048
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,310
Are you awake?

1049
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,110
Did I not wake you up?

1050
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:16,110
Is there anything I can help you with?

1051
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:18,730
I want to talk to you about yesterday.

1052
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,070
Could you come up for a moment?

1053
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,110
Now?

1054
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,820
Just a moment

1055
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:26,660
Good to know

1056
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,960
Could you please help me with this?

1057
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,720
Feeling better?

1058
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,430
good

1059
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:53,690
What do you want to do...

1060
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,690
What happened yesterday

1061
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,280
It was indeed the person living downstairs who hurt himself, right?

1062
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:06,620
Isn't this matter resolved?

1063
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,700
You can tell me frankly

1064
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:14,960
I can help you

1065
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,920
Why are you saying this suddenly?

1066
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,880
because

1067
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,960
I didn't want to pursue it.

1068
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,420
But the person downstairs is in a bit of a state...

1069
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:27,720
Wait a moment

1070
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:33,930
Who is it?

1071
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,520
oh

1072
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,230
I am the tenant of No. 1501

1073
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,320
Do you remember me?

1074
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,400
Is there anything I can help you with?

1075
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,530
oh

1076
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,110
- I have a problem at home.
-Excuse me

1077
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,070
Can I use the restroom?

1078
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,570
Can I talk to you now?

1079
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,660
- Over there
- It will only take a moment.

1080
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:58,100
-Are you the landlord?
-Wait a moment

1081
01:08:58,190 --> 01:08:59,770
- Get out you bastard!
-Wait a moment

1082
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,730
Toilet

1083
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:03,610
- I thought the bathroom was there!
-What's going on?

1084
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:07,110
He was just searching our room.

1085
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:08,070
You thief

1086
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,410
I'm not a thief

1087
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:13,330
You knew the intercity express train would be open a long time ago, right?

1088
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,620
You bought my house for cheap.
Deliberately making noise

1089
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,120
What are you talking about?

1090
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:19,790
Why should we save that little money?

1091
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:21,710
- Do that kind of thing?
- "That little bit of money"?

1092
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:23,130
"That little bit of money"?

1093
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:26,800
Then cancel the contract.
Otherwise I will report it to the radio station and the newspaper

1094
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,800
This will make things worse.

1095
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,510
how?

1096
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,640
I mean it.

1097
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,650
Let's talk about your matter another day.

1098
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:47,110
Please pull him out.

1099
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:48,530
"Pull him out"?

1100
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:50,030
- That's enough
-You think I can't do it?

1101
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:51,450
Fuck

1102
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,780
-I'll find evidence!
-come out

1103
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:54,330
I want to find all the evidence in your house.

1104
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:55,240
open

1105
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,870
In that situation just now
You should take a step back and look for it another day.

1106
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,170
How could I quarrel with them in public?

1107
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,790
I'm sure

1108
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,340
The top is the culprit

1109
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,920
Do you see anything?

1110
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,170
I saw a fingerprint identification iron door

1111
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,680
Ordinary people don't have that kind of stuff in their homes.

1112
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,760
They must be making noise in that room

1113
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,930
You said there is an iron door with fingerprint recognition at home?

1114
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:17,720
-Um
- It's a bit suspicious.

1115
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:20,390
Shit, I must find a way to get in again...

1116
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,560
I know, don't get excited.

1117
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,440
Calm down and let's make a plan together

1118
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:28,400
Together?

1119
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:30,950
I wronged you and I owe you a favor

1120
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,450
If you're willing to help me

1121
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:34,410
Of course I am happy

1122
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:37,530
We were stupid enough to doubt each other before.

1123
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,160
I didn't expect those people were making the noise.

1124
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,540
That is to say

1125
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:43,040
That's right

1126
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,130
My name is Lu Yusheng

1127
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,670

1128
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,510
Brother, you don't need to use honorifics with me anymore.

1129
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,840
I didn't use honorifics.

1130
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:58,260
Let's go take a shower and rest for a while.

1131
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:00,100
It takes physical strength to recover the house and find evidence.

1132
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:01,850

1136

Wake up so soon?

1137
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,360
My wireless network is down

1138
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,900
Can you share your network?

1139
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:55,490
Wireless network? I don't have any either.

1140
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,200
Yeah?

1141
01:11:58,740 --> 01:11:59,580

1142
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:00,990
Then I'll go first

1144
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,830
Why

1145
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,210
I'm going to the sauna. Would you like to come with me?

1146
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,260
Steaming can relax your body

1147
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,010
I just washed it.

1148
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:17,970
I want to go back and take a nap. I'm leaving first.

Don't you want to take a nap?

1153

I can't sleep

1154
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:26,750
You can fall asleep after steaming

1155
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:27,660
Um

1156
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,210
Oops, I forgot
I didn't pay the management fee so I can't get in.

1157
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,760
- You go in first.
- Can I charge my card?

1158
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:39,430
We usually can't...

1159
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:40,630
Is that ok?

1160
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,050
Okay, just this once.

Do I look like a gangster?

1166
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,760

1167
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:23,550

1169
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:26,390
Undercover

1170
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,760
Undercover reporting or something like that?

1171
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:29,100
Yes, undercover

1172
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:31,230
I got the tattoo after I started doing this job.

1173
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:32,640
I've been stabbed.

1174
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:34,480
I have been tortured, but what’s the point?

1175
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,400
I risk my life to do this

1176
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,570
But no one recognizes

1177
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:41,570
The money was earned by the radio station.

1178
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:42,990
So I think it’s meaningless

1179
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:45,910
Later I decided to start a project myself

1180
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:48,870

1181
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,500
So I thought: “What about the apartment noise incident?”

1182
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:54,670
We both experienced apartment noise.

1183
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,290
I really want to kill them, you know.

1184
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,750
Right?

1185
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:01,050
yes

1186
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:03,510
I really want to kill them.

1187
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:05,760
Right?

1188
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:14,100
Maybe it's because I didn't sleep well.

1189
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:15,730
Feeling so tired

1190
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,110
I'm going back first

1191
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,360
You go back slowly and have a good rest

1192
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,740

01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,960
Are you crazy?

1278
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:04,800
These are the result of several months of hard work!

1279
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:08,300
You know

1280
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,930
What are these?

1281
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:11,970
It can solve

1282
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:13,930
Noise Problems in Apartments in Korea

1283
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:16,390
The ugly truth! Do you know?

1284
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,560
You fuck

1285
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:24,900
Hello!

1286
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:26,950
Damn, I can't die now.

1287
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:32,450
Depend on

1288
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:34,660
I haven't recorded the interview video yet.

1289
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:37,830
Who told you to touch the video data?

1290
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,920
court death

1291
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
The plan is ruined.

1292
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:45,420
Okay fuck it let's end this today

1293
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,550
What?

1294
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:50,510
Where is the other one?

1295
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:13,540
Is it the police station?

1296
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:15,040
I am from the Royal City of Xiliou

1297
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,870
The man who caused trouble yesterday

1298
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:17,790
About Lu Yusheng

1299
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:20,920
He seems to have killed his downstairs neighbor.

1300
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,250
He just went up to the top floor and said he was going to kill them too.

1301
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:52,530
Huh?

1302
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:56,870
Apartment Noise Serial Killer Lu Yusheng
Hiding under my bed

1303
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,710
Looks like he wants to kill me too.

1304
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:01,880
what to do?

1305
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:03,880
Um

1306
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:06,300
Hang up first

1307
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,520
Yusheng

1308
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:22,650
Why do you want to kill people?

1309
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,980
And in someone else's house?

1310
01:26:27,690 --> 01:26:29,150
Did you kill him with that hammer?

1311
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:30,990
how?

1312
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:32,610
Want to kill me too?

1313
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:34,120
Hello

1314
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,530
Spare me

1315
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:39,410
You crazy

1316
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,290
Who would believe you with the condition of your house?

1317
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:44,460
Everyone will

1318
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:48,000
Everyone in this apartment thinks that except you
No one is going to kill your downstairs neighbor

1319
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,380
Because I prepared in advance.

1320
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:53,590
You want to blame everything on me?

1321
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:56,890
Hello

1322
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:59,020
You wanted to die

1323
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,890
Since you are going to die
Wouldn't it be better to die with more meaning?

1324
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:03,190
Died as a murderer

1325
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:05,310
Does it make sense?

1326
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,480
In a broad sense, it is sacrifice

1327
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:10,690
If no corners were cut when this apartment was built

1328
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,360
How could this happen?

1329
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:16,160
This is all because of your shit.

1330
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,200
Is it because of me?

1331
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:27,420
Hello

1332
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,050
Look at it

1333
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,680
The dream you exchanged your life for

1334
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:36,300
Is it really just like that?

1335
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:38,680
Aren't you curious?

1336
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:41,810
People spend hundreds of millions of won on homes

1337
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:43,310
Why should we suffer from noise?

1338
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:45,900
Hate, curse, or even kill each other?

1339
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:47,310
Why do you do this?

1340
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,650
Why not build apartments properly?

1341
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,650
Who embezzled public funds when building the apartments?
Who allowed cutting corners?

1342
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:52,900
Who is it?

1343
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,780
the truth

1344
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:58,620
On the top floor of this apartment

1345
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:00,830
In that iron door room

1346
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,620
Oh shit

1347
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:05,080
Is the head injured seriously?

1348
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,720
Then just target the top layer right from the start.

1349
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:16,220
Why are you targeting me?

1350
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:17,390
Why me?

1351
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:20,510
I didn't do anything wrong
Why drag me into your farce?

1352
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,680
I checked everyone in this apartment.

1353
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:24,640
You best fit the image of an angry, violent young man

1354
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:27,190
Your life is rough.

1355
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:31,020
You are a contemporary young person
A symbol of the pain and suffering faced

1356
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:33,230
Right? House slaves

1357
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,200
You are a great messenger

1358
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:40,450
"A young man lost his mind due to noise in the apartment

1359
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:42,660
Beat neighbor to death with hammer, then committed suicide

1360
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:45,790
In such a bloody battle
One person miraculously survived

1361
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:47,460
That's reporter Rong Zhenhao

1362
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,210
He has a ledger in his arms

1363
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:54,260
Recording the truth behind apartment noise

1364
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:58,220
By Jung Jin-ho, reporter
Risking his life to reveal the truth

1365
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:59,340
His sincerity

1366
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:01,100
Changed the world

1367
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:05,100
Yusheng

1368
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:08,140
I won't let you

1369
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,270
Died in vain

1370
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:12,820
Sorry Yusheng

1371
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:14,780
Big Brother

1372
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:19,450
etc.

1373
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:22,410
Big Brother

1374
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,700
I will help you

1375
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:25,120
As long as you

1376
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,410
Help me get my house back

1377
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:28,540
I will help you

1378
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:30,830
I'll do this with you, bro.

1379
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,790
You want to help me kill someone?

1380
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:37,090
Because someone downstairs suddenly broke in
So your plans are ruined, right?

1381
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:40,640
In this case
This must end tonight.

1382
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:43,390
Can you do it alone?

1383
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:46,270
If you fail on your own
The truth cannot be revealed

1384
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:54,440
I've had enough of that.

1385
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:59,030
I want my house back
I want to get my life back.

1386
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:01,240
Delivering information to the world

1387
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,620
I have no reason to betray you

1388
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:08,290
What message is conveyed?

1389
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:11,870
Tenants about to be evicted from their apartment due to noise issues

1390
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,000
Killed landlord and then committed suicide

1391
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:20,430
Pretty good

1392
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:21,550
But Yusheng

1393
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:23,720
In case something goes wrong

1394
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:27,350
I will go to Nanhai to visit your mother

1395
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:30,140
You also have to be interviewed.

1396
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:45,530
Spare me

1397
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:47,490
Spare me...

1398
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:00,080
What are you going to do?

1399
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,510
Let me formally introduce myself

1400
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:07,630
I am the universal detective Rong Zhenhao
Nice to meet you

1401
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,680
What?

1402
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,310
During your tenure as prosecutor, a year ago

1403
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:15,730
A show that explores the truth about the shoddy workmanship in this apartment
It was you who prevented it from being banned, right?

1404
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:17,520
I am the reporter for that show.

1405
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,610
I risked my life to interview
I was stabbed by a gangster.

1406
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:22,860
As a result, external pressure led to me being tricked.

1407
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:24,780
Do you know how bad I felt?

1408
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:26,360
That's not external pressure.

1409
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:28,900
That incident was investigated at the time so...

1410
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:31,780
Since then
I will start to focus on tracking you down.

1411
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:34,740
But you suddenly resigned.

1412
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:37,000
Then I started buying apartments here.

1413
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,460
I know it is a shoddy project but I still buy it

1414
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:40,170
So I moved in here with you.

1415
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:41,540
I want to live near your house.

1416
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:43,630
You might find some interesting things

1417
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,050
You seem

1418
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:47,470
Misunderstood

1419
01:33:47,550 --> 01:33:49,260
Okay, let me ask you a question.

1420
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,180
Where are the ledgers?

1421
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:57,930
In that room with the iron door, right?

1422
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,310
Ledger?

1423
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:05,110
Okay, I'll ask again. Listen.

1424
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:09,110
You and your husband, the supervisor
Details of the bribes squandered together

1425
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:12,160
There is also a list of people involved in South Korea's shoddy construction

1426
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,990
All neatly listed in a ledger

1427
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:16,620
This account book

1428
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:18,450
Where?

1429
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:21,620
I don't know what you're talking about

1430
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:27,300
Madam Inspector

1431
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:30,170
A conversation between you and your husband
I heard it all

1432
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,890
Block the camera and you can hear the sound

1433
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:34,600
I mean the intercom.

1434
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:38,430
You are the shoddy engineering agent.
You are afraid to take on everything

1435
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,020
So I have kept that account book.

1436
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:42,810
Because that's your universal shield.

1437
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:43,730
good

1438
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,900
This universal shield

1439
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:47,690
Is it in the room with the iron door?

1440
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:49,990
I said I don't know

1441
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:50,900
Hold

1442
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:51,900
He knows

1443
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,320
My husband knows

1444
01:34:55,410 --> 01:34:56,530
He uses that room alone.

1445
01:34:57,410 --> 01:35:00,080
What's Inside
I don't know what he's doing in there.

1446
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,330
I really don't know

1447
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,460
Well, let's check the facts.

1448
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,500
Look at it

1449
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:08,710
Come

1450
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,380
Let's go

1451
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:14,840
Oh my god, you ate a lot.

1452
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:18,470
Come

1453
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:23,440
good

1454
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:24,980
Yusheng

1455
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,520
I was a little too much before

1456
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:28,860
sorry

1457
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,110
I know it at a glance

1458
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,570
You don't do this because you want to.

1459
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:37,740
I know you're threatened, right?

1460
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:38,950
The neighbor downstairs died

1461
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:41,200
How did he die?

1462
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:45,960
He wanted to kill me too.
So I just pretended to be on his side.

1463
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:48,170
I will help you

1464
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:52,210
That's it

1465
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:54,680
I knew it would happen. You were right to do this.

1466
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:58,100
If you help me, I will help you solve all your problems.

1467
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:00,010
Air gun in the study

1468
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,100
-Is it usable?
- Can be used

1469
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,640
You use the air rifle to subdue him.

1470
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,770
I'm not helping you because I like you.

1471
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:08,770
Your mistake should be punished accordingly.

1472
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:11,900
It's not like that. I'm not that kind of person.

1473
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:13,690
Do you believe what the murderer said?

1474
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:15,860
Please

1475
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,200
Save me

1476
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:18,700
Help me

1477
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:21,120
- I will give you your house back
-Hold!

1478
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:24,960
You bastards

1479
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,460
What the hell? Fuck! Follow me

1480
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:28,960
Come fuck me

1481
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:32,920
Is that all?

1482
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:34,630
Is that all? Shit!

1483
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:36,340
Where are the ledgers?

1484
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:39,010
Call you a bitch!

1485
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,180
Is that all?

1486
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:45,140
Is that all that's in the safe? Shit!

1487
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:47,140
Where are the ledgers?

1488
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:49,810
I'm sorry I embezzled the apartment management fee.

1489
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:52,650
I also accepted bribes when choosing a service company. I was wrong.

1490
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:54,650
But you can't do this, can you? Spare me.

1491
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:56,150
- I am willing to be punished
-You bitch!

1492
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:58,910
Stop playing tricks, you bastards.

1493
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:01,280
This is impossible! Fuck

1494
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,410
Get up you beast

1495
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:05,250
Say you're a beast

1496
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:06,870
Where are the ledgers?

1497
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,590
Let's all die together!

1498
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:16,970
Where are the ledgers? Shit!

1499
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:18,880
Where are the ledgers?

1500
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:21,010
I just need the ledger

1501
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:22,430
Where are the ledgers?

1502
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:23,970
Where are the ledgers?

1503
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:27,560
The truth is here with you

1504
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:29,400
Right?

1505
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,660
You're a worthless guy.

1506
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:51,750
Standing on their side

1507
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,300
You idiot! Fuck!

1508
01:37:57,170 --> 01:37:58,170
Hold

1509
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,180
You fucking traitor

1510
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,260
Go to hell, bastard!

1511
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:04,760
You bastard!

1512
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:26,240
You go catch him

1513
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:27,200
Kill him

1514
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:29,540
You beast

1515
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:31,540
I'm going to kill you

1516
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:33,630
We must not let him leave alive, catch him!

1517
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:35,380
You beast!

1518
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,340
Money represents!

1519
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,670
Money represents!

1520
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:41,840
Money represents! Please open...

1521
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:43,140
Open the door

1522
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,520
Go to hell

1523
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:56,670
Depend on

1524
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,350
Kill him

1525
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:21,110
Kill him

1526
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:26,410
Enough

1527
01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:28,620
Let the police handle it.

1528
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:31,540
Two people died here.

1529
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:34,120
Who is responsible?

1530
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:38,830
If you don't kill him

1531
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,460
You will take the blame

1532
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:48,470
Hello

1533
01:40:51,470 --> 01:40:52,470
You don't have to worry

1534
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:54,810
That won't happen.

1535
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:56,520
I will handle this properly.

1536
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,350
Believe me

1537
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:00,190
Kill him

1538
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:01,570
Please

1539
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:03,070
Wake up

1540
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:05,280
Can't trust her

1541
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:06,780
Kill him

1542

1543
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:10,950
Kill him!

1544
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:39,560
You missed your chance asshole!

1545
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:42,110
You're a useless guy.

1546
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:47,190
Too indecisive

1547
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:58,500
So people still need to live in a better place

1548
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,130
Otherwise you'll have to deal with a lot of messy people.

1549
01:42:02,330 --> 01:42:04,130
What a mess

1550
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:11,930
So I didn't say

1551
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:15,390
Can’t you just take in any tenants?

1552
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:19,350
It seems to be you

1553
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:21,690
The mentally ill person he mentioned

1554
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:26,020
You worked so hard to move in here.
Is this the ending?

1555
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:33,820
I really didn't expect this.

1556
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:42,540
Why didn't you idiots hear me?
Is the account book right here?

1557
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:48,800
This is it, right?

1558
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:50,340
What's the use of this?

1559
01:42:51,050 --> 01:42:51,970
You take this public.

1560
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:54,600
Can you blame me for the noise problem in the apartment?

1561
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:55,800
or

1562
01:42:55,890 --> 01:42:57,560
Do you think you can change the world?

1563
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:02,810
So what?

1564
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:07,190
Build apartments properly without cutting corners

1565
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:08,530
Will the noise problem go away?

1566
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:10,610
Won't

1567
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:13,360
I told you

1568
01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:15,660
The problem with apartment noise is people

1569
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:17,780
Why blame the quality of the apartment?

1570
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:23,120
Building it stronger means the cost will go up

1571
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:25,130
This will also increase the price

1572
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:26,750
Then finally

1573
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:30,130
People like you can't afford a house.

1574
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,260
How can you not understand such a simple truth?

1575
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,600

1576
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,020
Can't rely on hope

1577
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:43,480
Be pragmatic

1578
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:47,230
I think your life is over.

1579
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:50,980
I'll try harder in the next life.

1580
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:55,490
I don't want

1581
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:35,280
Wow

1582
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:37,200
Pretending to die is too painful

1583
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:39,660

1584
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:42,580
