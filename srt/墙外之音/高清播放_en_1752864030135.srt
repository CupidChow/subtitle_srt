For home buyers
Now is the last chance to buy a house

6
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,990
Because I can still barely get a loan
I may never have the chance to buy a house in Seoul again.

7
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,658
I'm not not working.

8
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,785

Just take some time off now

1.1 billion won?

13
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,590
No, you said 1.9 billion won.

14
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,009
How could it increase by 10 million won in one hour?

15
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,052
Don't want to buy it

16
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,096
I can't bear to sell it, okay?

17
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,016
There are still many people waiting

18
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,100

(Royal City Xiliou is for urgent sale

57

House prices in Seoul

59
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,687
According to historical data, it will definitely rise.

60
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,689
Just hold on, you'll eventually rise

61
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,357
Especially those who spend all their money to buy a house.

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,608
As house prices continue to fall

63
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,318
Interest rates keep rising, so you're worried, right?

64

But we can't give up

65
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,030
If you sell it now, you will regret it forever

66

I wouldn't have bought the house if I had known
Should I buy cryptocurrency?

71
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,092
“So fucking envious”

72
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:02,927

74
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,184
No

75
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,895
Blame them for those lucky people

76
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,647
So that everyone is tempted

77
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,941

82
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,203
Yes or no?

83
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,247
Oh yeah

84
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,584
But I'm not speculating, I really live there

85
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,461
Oh, you really live in there?

86
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,378
yes

87
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,256

89
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,221
At least you have a place to live now.
There was nothing before

90
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,139
So there is progress

91
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,724
Yes or no?

92
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,353
It's really that guy.
If I had focused on my work, I would have been a section chief long ago.

93

no way

94

96
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,540
Judging from historical data, it will definitely rise.

97

98
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,002

Really fucking

101
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,758
The question is, can you hold on until then?

102
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,593
Your monthly salary is not enough to pay the mortgage

103
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,304
What else can I do?

104
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,847
Sell it? What if the price goes up after selling it?

105
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,308
What if I don’t sell and the price continues to fall?

106
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,144
brute

107
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,606
Stop struggling.

108
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,108
You tried your best, kid.

109
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,195
Even if I want to sell it, no one will buy it.

110
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,322
And because I have a lot of loans, I can't rent a full house.

111
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,783
If you have a companion
Even if you are heavily in debt, it won't be so painful

112
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,285
I told you not to cancel the engagement but you didn't listen

113

Hello!

114
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,330
How can you mention "breaking off the engagement" in front of me?

115
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,041
Because I'm worried about you

116
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,168

Are you going to attend Chief Xu's farewell party?

121
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,972
I heard he treated everyone to roast beef.

122
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,557
I have to make money and don't have time to go

123
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,685
You do that part-time job
When will the loan be paid off?

124
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,480
So we gave Chief Xu a lot of wine.

125
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,190
Then lure him into telling you the secret of investment

126
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,400
-invest?
-Um

127
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,154
Seeing Chief Xu make money
Thinking about your liquidated cryptocurrencies again?

128
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,113
Really

129
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,490
How can you mention "being liquidated" in front of me?

130
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,159
Because I'm worried about you

131
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,744
Look at you, you look so awkward

132
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,329

136
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,928
When will my cryptocurrency
Can I make a lot of money? Then I don't have to work anymore.

137
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,432
I don’t expect to make a fortune from cryptocurrencies
I just hope I don't have to work overtime.

00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,552
no

183
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,389
So please stop putting these on our doors.

184
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,193
No noise when you're not home

185
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,612
What are you doing?

186
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,030
You listen carefully

187
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,659
If my husband comes, you're screwed.

188
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,036
You are

189
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,747
Threatening me?

190
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,251
I'm worried about you

191
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,129
I've said it several times.

192
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,549
No, I am not the voice on my side.

193
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,635
Vibration and footsteps
It's all coming from upstairs.

194
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,220
Why don’t you come in and listen?

195
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,474
Wait a minute!

196
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,769
Why are you like this?

197
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,479
Will you pay my electricity bill?

198
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,480
shoe

199
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,107
slippers!

200
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,441
go out

201
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,777
Very quiet

202
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,490
wrong

203
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,033
It was noisy just now

204
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,998
Young people are so shameless that they refuse to admit their mistakes

205
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,168
You look down on me, don't you? Because I'm a tenant.

206
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,045
What?

207
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,463
Hey, what did you just say?

208
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,633
I can't bear it any longer.

209
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,220
What else can you do if you can't bear it?

210
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:57,855
Really

211
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,862
Damn, was this intentional?

212
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,761
What are you doing?

213
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,598
Hello

214
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,225
I live downstairs at No. 1401

215
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:36,977
Um, what's the matter?

216
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,479
That's the one

217
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,358
No. 1301 downstairs always comes to me to complain

218
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,322
She said they have a senior high school student and a junior high school student.
You should know that this is a sensitive period.

219
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,324
so what?

220
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,869
It seems that what I said is a bit complicated

221
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,956
If the phone is placed on the ground, it will ring at night.

222
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,624
The vibration sound will be very loud

223
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,918
There are also sounds of furniture being dragged and footsteps.

224
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,461
You like exercising, don't you?

225
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,631
Loud noise during exercise

226
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,924
Are you talking about me?

227
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,095
It seems like it’s been a few months?

228
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,097
Right after you moved in

229
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,098
The sound starts

230
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,767
You mean you're quiet at home?

231
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,853
After I moved in
Your downstairs neighbors start complaining about noise?

232
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,563
right

233
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,108
Then you must feel very annoyed and wronged.

234
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,361
Thank you for understanding

235
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,196
I'm in your situation now.

236
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,781
What?

237
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,658
I slept well.

238
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,994
Suddenly the neighbor downstairs came up to me and told me that I was very noisy

239
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,330
Oh this is really...

240
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,457
-Talk to the management office...
- I told him

241
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,583
Not on my side

242
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,713
I should check first before coming to you.

243
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,756
I made the same mistake as my downstairs neighbor

244
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,008
Sorry for waking you up.

245
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,096
If you're really sorry
Can you come upstairs and talk to me?

246
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,015
Ah? I'll go and tell you?

247
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,100
They are noisy every night.

248
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,769
Please tell them
If you continue to quarrel, it will not end well.

249
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,188
You think it's your upstairs...

250
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,357
If it's not me, it's not you.
Isn't that definitely upstairs?

251
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,442
Please

252
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,113
I said sorry

253
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,657
My phone was on vibrate and I didn't hear the alarm.

254
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,454
Yeah, it's almost here.

255
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,205
Um

256
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,835
Scare me

257
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,297
I live on the 14th floor, downstairs from you.

258
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,757
oh

259
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,592
Is there anything I can help you with?

260
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,057
Don't you really know why I came up to you?

261
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,892
The children are sleeping now

262
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,685
We have mats on the floor.

263
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,979
Even with the mat...

264
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,523
(Noise-free room
Noiseless safety mat installation certification)

265
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,029
The vibration alarm is very loud

266
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,864
What are you talking about?

267
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,741
I don't even set an alarm for fear that the kids will wake up

268
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,076
Stop lying

269
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,245
I just heard you say something about an alarm clock.

270
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,664
Are you eavesdropping on my phone call?

271
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,084
It's so late and you're still talking so loudly

272
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,960
How could I not hear it?

273
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,878
I didn't set an alarm

274
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,214
So of course I can't hear the alarm.

275
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,840
What?

276
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,845
I feel embarrassed for being late
So I just lied and said I didn't hear the alarm

277
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,431
Really?

278
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,102
I don't like to talk bad about others behind their backs.
But it seems I have to tell you

279
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,853
That's the sound from upstairs.

280
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,855
Is that the 17th floor?

281
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,941
Yeah, they get up early.

282
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,360
How could the sound from the 17th floor reach our house?

283
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,028
I live on the 14th floor

284
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,863
Go see it for yourself.

285
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,410
Oh shit

286
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,247
(Mincheng Church members, the Lord loves us)

287
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,422
Who is it?

288
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:57,261
Sir, I am the neighbor on the 14th floor
The downstairs downstairs from you

289
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,054
Come in

290
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,310
Jesus created us

291
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,854
What's wrong with this guy?

292
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,856
You bring it into the room.

293
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:09,982
More for neighbors...

294
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,653
Haven't you seen a walker?

295
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:19,950
Hello sir

296
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,287
What are you doing coming up from the 14th floor so early in the morning?

297
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,664
Because of the noise, Mr.

298
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,749
The noise caused a lot of inconvenience to the residents downstairs.

299
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,918
I hope you can keep your voice down.

300
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,128
Is there any noise?

301
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,005
I have difficulty walking a few steps, why is there noise?

302
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,591
The time period when neighbors heard the noise

303
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,010
In the early morning after you wake up

304
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,261
This time period

305
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,971
Especially the alarm clock vibration sound

306
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:41,930
Do you have any evidence?

307
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,807
Huh? Evidence?

308
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,268
It's miserable enough that I have to sit all day.

309
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,146
You don't even have any evidence.
Just say that I, an old man, make noise

310
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,357
I have difficulty walking.

311
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,735
That's not the case.

312
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,445
In the past

313
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,198
Neighbors know each other's living room number.

314
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,950
Mutual understanding and care should be like this

315
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,328
How is it possible that there is no sound at all when people are living there?

316
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,038
And the sound of dogs

317
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:06,955
How is that possible?

318
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,291
How could Xiaopang’s voice possibly reach you?

319
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,375
This is not a paper house.

320
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,754
If it's not a person barking, then it must be a dog barking

321
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,673
If you have so much dissatisfaction
Don't say this here.

322
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,050
Let’s go upstairs and talk!

323
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,677
Sir, I have already climbed several floors.

324
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,847
Go and formally protest to the residents’ representatives!

325
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,474
that…

326
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,375
Damn

327
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,014
Damn

328
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,062
Are you number 1401?

329
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,439
oh…

330
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,025
Oh hello

331
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,360
Do you know me?

332
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,487
The person downstairs just called me and told me

333
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,864
Say you want to talk to a resident representative

334
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,118
Do you want to come in and talk?

335
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,383
You come up to my level.
Just because of the noise problem?

336
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,509
yes

337
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,720
Because everyone told me to go upstairs and say

338
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,221
I'm sorry, I finally came to your side.

339
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,640
Why is everyone only thinking about upstairs?

340
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,977
This is the wall structure.

341
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,147
The walls of each house are connected together.

342
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,940
Is it the sound from upstairs or downstairs?

343
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,025
How do they know?

344
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,154
Are you saying this is a problem with the apartment itself?

345
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,906
What's wrong with the apartment?

346
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,242
Ultimately, the problem lies with people

347
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,243
That's right.

348
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,121
My downstairs neighbor keeps posting notes on my door

349
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,790
I am so wronged

350
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,877
I'll help you solve this problem.

351
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,713
I am the landlord of No. 1301

352
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,050
Are you the landlord of No. 1301?

353
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,428
I won't renew my contract with them.
So can you hold out for another two months?

354
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,806
If you are the landlord, please go and talk to them.

355
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,642
I can't stand it for another two months.

356
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,062
This is your compensation.

357
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,605
No, you can't do this.

358
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,441
What about me

359
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,443
More than just a landlord

360
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,362
Also a resident representative?

361
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,532
I want to get those weird people
Evicted from our apartment

362
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,077
I hope you can cooperate

363
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,581
Too

364
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,501
How can there be no sound when people live there?

365
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,711
I thought so too

366
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,254
As expected

367
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,840
You and I are both registered users and have a common language

368
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,133
No, my house.

369
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,468
Bought it on loan

370
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,261
It's hard to buy it with loans everywhere

371
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,055
That's not easy either.

372
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,431
You must be able to borrow money

373
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,518
No, I don't have any ability.

374
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,895
What's your name?

375
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,897
My name is Lu Yusheng

376
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,232
Do you live alone?

377
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,191
right

378
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,776
For now

379
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,403
Live alone

380
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,697
That’s a heavy burden, right?

381
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,367
I can't sell it because I'm afraid the price will go up.

382
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,161
And it’s not easy to find a fully rented house outside

383
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,539
I guess people around you will look at you strangely.

384

385
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,168
Hold on for a while longer

386
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,712
As long as the intercity express train is open, things will be fine.

387
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,299
Is there really hope for intercity express rail?

388
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,009
certainly

389
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,012
This is a critical period for our apartment.

390
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,432
There must be no commotion.

391
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,143
you understand

392
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,019
I mean, right?

393
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:58,937
Um

394
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,439
I see

395
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,399
For our apartment

396
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,901
I will try my best to endure

397
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,121
(Please keep quiet shhh!)

398
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,586
Damn it

399
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,175
It's terrible

400
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,344
This is pretty serious, shouldn't we call the police?

401
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,722
You can say you are being blackmailed, illegally stalked, etc.

402
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,891
What if that stimulates them even more?

403
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,851
Residents' representatives said to be careful

404
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,728
Just because she gives you some money you call her your representative?

405
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,814
The money she gave was enough to pay the interest

406
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,232
Of course, she should be the representative

407
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,109
You are just trying to draw water with a bamboo basket.

408
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,528
Here you are again

409
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,864
never mind

410
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,158
Seeing your attitude, I won't help you.

411
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,369
-What?
-Aren't you curious?

412
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,288
-Say it
-Want to know?

413
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,206
hurry up

414
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,083
yesterday

415
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,294
I gave Chief Xu a lot of wine

416
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,879
Finally, he told me about a lead investment forum

417
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,964
Hello

418
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,509
You better be careful with that stuff, boy.

419
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,135
You mean manipulating the market or something...

420
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,261
-Shut up!
-Oh shit

421
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,262
Come here

422
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,306
-come over
- It's so dirty

423
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,432
- Damn
- Look

424
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,517
Hello!

425
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,434
look

426
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,810
Tonight at twelve o'clock

427
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,523
If GB coin falls to 815 won, it will be the bottom price

428
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:30,028
Then it started to rise again and on Liberation Day
The rate of return will reach 815%, which is the peak

429
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,488
Then it will hit the bottom

430
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,533
That is, buy it at 815 won

431
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,243
- Then earn 815% profit
-Um

432
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,995
GB coin name
It is the abbreviation of the Korean pronunciation of Liberation Day.

433
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,416
Yes, 815% return
This is roughly equal to earning nine times the principal.

434
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,210
Nine times?

435
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,629
Fuck you idiot, you still believe this?

436
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,547
All right

437
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,465
You see, these people smashed first and then pulled last week.

438
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,219
First, lower the price of Lauracoin to 500 won
Then stir it up to make it five times higher

439
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,721

442
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,105
It seems your situation is not that urgent.

443
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,066
Forget it. I don't need to convince you.

444
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,819
You don't want such valuable information.

445
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,946
I really don't understand

446
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,614
That's not the case.

447
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,992
I don't have any capital to invest

448
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,244
I don't have the money to invest.

449
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:23,039
This is definitely profitable. If you don't have money, you can look for private loans.

450
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,374
Private loan?

451
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,626
You want me to borrow money again?

452
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,587
Hey, this is not a loan.

453
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,796
This will help you pay back the money

454
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,257
As long as you can get
About 80 million won 8x9 equals 72

455
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,176
Enough to pay off your 700 million won debt
You don't have to pay it back for a lifetime, and you'll still have 20 million left after you finish paying it back.

456
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,096
I don't know. I'm in enough pain now.

457
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,016
It's not 100% guaranteed.
They also asked me to look for private loans.

458
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,184

467

no

471
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,090

473

476
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,726
- I'm going to borrow it.
-Really?

I want to sell now and put up an "urgent sale" ad

480

Sign the contract and pay the deposit today

489
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,714
If you don't sign today, I won't sell it.

490
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,757

00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,916
-You know what?
-815

544
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,251
Just buy it when it reaches 815 won, right?

545
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,504
It is the date of Liberation Day on 815

546
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,713
- It's time to focus
-Um

547
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,048
Hang up first

548
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:47,966
Oh my god

549
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,059
(Gobit Purchase Contract
GB coin purchase transaction completed)

550
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:52,989
Hello

551
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,574
Are you watching?

552
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,951
-Hello
-Um

553
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,996
What the fuck is going on?

554
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,581
that is

555
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,041
It seems to have doubled.

556
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,459
Changyu, am I seeing things?

557
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,585
-Right?
-Right?

558
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,961
-Yeah?
-Hey this...

559
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,254
-This is too...
- Wait, that's not right.

560
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,881
This is too unrealistic, isn't it? Still rising

561
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,882
Be quiet

562
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,885
Before reaching the expected rate of return
You must never let your guard down, you know?

563
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,179
Can you repeat what I said about the peak day?

564
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,388
Well

565
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,223
August

566
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,392
-No.15
- On August 15th

567
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,560
morning

568
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,187
8 o'clock

569
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,521
-15 points
-8:15

570
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,023
Peak yield

571
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:27,982
-815%
-Yes.

572
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,068
-Right?
- Just remember 815

573
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,445
Because after 8:15, they will all be thrown away

574
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,155
We have to throw it away before that, okay?

575
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,281
Don't be too greedy

576
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,532
-good
-good

577
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,326
-Hello
-What's wrong?

578
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,535
In this case

579
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,038
About 800…

580
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,375
What's wrong?

581
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,293
800…

582
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,711
When the rate of return reaches 800%

583
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,379
-Just sell it, right?
-Um

584
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,049
If something goes wrong

585
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,342
We have to sell it quickly.

586
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,303
Should we apply for annual leave?
Stay at home until Liberation Day.

587
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,138
24 hours a day attention

588
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,807
-Hello Changyu
-What's wrong?

589
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,892
-What's wrong again?
-Thank you

590
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,268
-Thank you!
- You still wait

591
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,604
Thank you after you are completely free from the loan.

592
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,522
good

593
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,534
wait…

594
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,494
cough

595
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,857
(income: +137333799 won
Yield: +161.65%)

596
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,023
(It's too noisy, be quiet!)

597
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,442
I'm really sorry

598
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,569
But can I go in and take a look?

599
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:01,988
noise

600
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,322
Are you doubting me?

601
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,908
If you don't want to be suspected
Then let's take a look at it together.

602
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,076
Oh...really

603
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,577
Good to see

604
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,251
Really

605
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,585
I'm going crazy

606
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,880
Why is it so quiet when someone comes over?

607
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,716
Is this really a coincidence?

608
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,509
That's right

609
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,136
I don't understand either

610
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,637
It's like someone is watching us

611
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,389
Who is watching?

612
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,432
I think

613
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,727
It's downstairs

614
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,271
-downstairs?
-Um

615
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,690
You'll know when you go and see it.

616
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,985
I think the people downstairs are not normal

617
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,654
I guess they were making noise in retaliation

618
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,072
How about we go and take a look?

619
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,451
It turns out that the sound from downstairs can reach our house.

620
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,119
You may not know

621
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,287
Our Apartments

622
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,705
this

623
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,000
This wall is connected to every household.

624
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,126
Are you kidding?

625
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,128
What?

626
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,673
I won't continue to endure

627
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,469
Do you think the downstairs can beat the upstairs?

628
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,233
Damn

629
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,486
Are you kidding?

630
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,613
It's just a joke.

631
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,753
(Please be quiet!)

632
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:41,670
Hello!

633
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,381
I know you guys are out at home

634
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,549
Are you coming out or not?

635
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,259
- Damn
-What are you doing?

636
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,304
I live upstairs

637
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,556
They filmed our house.

638
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,684
Spying on our house and making noises

639
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,978
I heard it was your side that made the noise.

640
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,147
Me? My side?

641
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,065
Who said that?

642
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,066
Is that what they said?

643
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,484
etc.

644
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,693
Excuse me

645
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,278
It's really not me, okay?

646
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,530
Hello!

647
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,626
Can I borrow your lighter?

648
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,336
good

649
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,554
What are you looking at?

650
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,014
nothing

651
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,602
In the apartment building next door
Did you know that a murder occurred?

652
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,855
Really? What's going on?

653
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,735
Because of the noise problem in the apartment

654
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,284
No matter what, you can't kill people.

655
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,329
We also have a serious noise problem in our apartment.

656
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,539
It's really worrying

657
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,792
Not to that extent.

658
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,254
People who make noise generally don't know how loud it is.

659
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:08,757
What?

660
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,096
If a murder really happens

661
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,016
Will house prices fall a lot?

662
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,853
What are you talking about?

663
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,024
You fuck

664
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,651
It turns out it’s you!

665
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,237
The man who stabbed my tire with a knife
You're the beast.

666
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,489
Let’s see who can hold out the longest. I won’t go out!

667
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,407
I won’t go out!

668
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,044
(August 9th is six days away from Liberation Day)

669
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,353
come on!

670
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,938
(There are four days left until Liberation Day)

671
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,614
Damn it!

672
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,865
(There are three days left until Liberation Day)

673
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,084
(Two days left until Liberation Day)

674
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,921
Open the door, damn.

675
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,383
-come out
-Come out

676
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,760
-Come out
-Are you home or not?

677
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:58,969
-Hello!
-What are you doing?

678
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,073
I am in Seoul now

679
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,032
Come see my son

680
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,408
Wait a moment

681
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,077
I have to go cook.

682
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,081
mom

683
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,541
Get up

684
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,835
Come and eat

685
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,505
Is it tiring to live here?

686
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:38,801
tired

687
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,511
Mom, I'm sorry.

688
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,765
If I were from Seoul

689
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,683
mom

690
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,062
Everything is fine now

691
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,441
I have settled my debt and your loan

692
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,526
Please be quiet

693
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,443
ah?

694
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,570
It's noisy!

695
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,741
Hold

696
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,994
(One day left until Liberation Day)

697
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,959
(income: +407779009 won
Yield: +479.98%)

698
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,868
(Royal City of Silio)

699
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,846
Damn

700
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:58,941
You fucking

701
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,442
You want to fight me, right?

702
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,735
All right

703
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,736
Damn it

704
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,495
-Open the door!
-What for?

705
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,412
Please open the door

706
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,039
I said it's not my side!

707
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,666
Please come out and see

708
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,126
Please open the door

709
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,420
Why the hell are you always targeting me?

710
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,010
- He was at home
- Don't open the door at home.

711
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:28,679
The sound is gone

712
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,596
So shameless

713
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,265
The subwoofer sound is gone

714
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,516
-Huh?
- Really?

715
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,353
You still have the nerve to say I'm noisy

716
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,563
So it’s you?

717
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,772
You're so embarrassed to ask me to keep my voice down?

718
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,815
So shameless

719
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,525
Did you see that? It's his side.

720
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,402
Let's stop guessing.

721
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,362
Since everyone is here
Let’s take a look at it together

722
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,406
-good
- Okay, let's take a look together.

723
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,408
Wait a moment

724
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,994
This situation is easy to be misunderstood

725
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:52,953
- Just take a look
-have a look

726
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,621
What are you doing? You can't come in.

727
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,582
Are you trespassing?

728
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,293
This sound is not like normal apartment noise.
More like a subwoofer sound

729
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,294
How come there is a subwoofer?

730
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,212
There's no point in us talking here.

731
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,672
Call the police directly

732
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,465
Good alarm

733
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,592
Let him go to jail

734
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:07,968
Stop doing this

735
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,429
- That's too much.
-Well?

736
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,471
- Really
-What?

737
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,725
Do you want to make a big deal out of this?

738
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,728
Everyone knows
This is a critical period for our apartment.

739
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,939
We have to live a normal life though.

740
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,650
Apartment prices stabilized
We can live a good life

741
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,903
You want to catch a bug?
And destroy the entire apartment?

742
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,365
Just catch the one who makes the noise
What other impacts could this have on the apartment?

743
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,492
I think you're making a big deal out of nothing

744
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:38,957
how?

745
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,627
Do you want to report it to the radio station?

746
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,836
Do you want to post it online?

747
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,340
You want everyone to know

748
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,050
Is noise a serious problem in our apartment?

749
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,385
I thought about it

750
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,679
I think you guys are weird

751
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,725
If you can't stand the noise, just move out.

752
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,144
Why do you still want to live here?

753
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,354
-You mean...
-You're right.

754
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,940
To prevent other people from moving in.

755
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,150
Is that what he meant by making noise on purpose?

756
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,109
-Yeah
-Why?

757
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,820
Once the intercity express train is opened, the monthly rent and full rent will increase

758
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,114
So you want to promote it to the public
This apartment has a noise problem, right?

759
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,324
Wait a moment

760
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,326
How did we get there?

761
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,869
What kind of logic is this?

762
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,246
You doubt us

763
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,124
Is it because we are tenants?

764
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,417
Come on, you guys are the ones causing trouble

765
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,380
Sir, the last time you came to my house

766
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,381
No sound, right?

767
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,590
Do you know why?

768
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,011
Because the people downstairs from me
Using a cell phone to secretly monitor our home

769
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,930
If I'm home they make noises

770
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,765
Be quiet when someone comes

771
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,517
To make everyone doubt me

772
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,726
Do you have any evidence?

773
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,894
evidence?

774
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:41,895
Show everyone your phone

775
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,022
You are their family.

776
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,857
We have to visit their home first.

777
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,110
They must have a subwoofer.

778
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,277
etc.

779
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,487
Okay, Yusheng

780
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,990
If you look downstairs first

781
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,783
Will you show everyone your house?

782
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,701
Um

783
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,120
Of course.

784
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,414
But it shouldn't be necessary

785
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,583
Then let's go visit your house first.

786
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,043
Everyone is already on this floor

787
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,753
- Let's look at their house first.
-how?

788
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,714
You want to hide it while everyone is at my house?

789
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,465
No, I won't stay here.

790
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,591
Yusheng

791
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,051
I know it's not you

792
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,469
-right
- I'll show it to you first.

793
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,179
Arguing is just a waste of time

794
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,853
Okay, let's look at our house first.

795
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,315
The administrator can go in.

796
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,316
Oh ok

797
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,818
Let me watch it too.

798
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,862
Anyway, every household has the same structure.

799
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,947
It's rare to see it once, so watch it carefully

800
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,033
Okay, it should be faster if two people watch it

801
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:39,828
gentlemen

802
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,289
I will search your house myself.

803
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,582
as you like

804
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,794
-Where did this come from?
-Did you hear that?

805
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,962
Can you hear it?

806
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,714
Look, it’s not me?

807
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,215
It's not me, right?

808
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,342
Then let's go downstairs.

809
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,343
Let's go

810
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,678
Found it

811
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,977
We should hear that kind of speaker

812
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,457
(Super noise revenge
18 hours of construction site noise audio)

813
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,251
Didn’t you say it was downstairs?

814
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,795
Um?

815
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,881
this…

816
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,301
You're a scumbag

817
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,683
What the hell are you doing?

818
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,601
what the hell?

819
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,061
How did you do that?

820
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,733
You have to go to a mental hospital before you go to the police.

821
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,527
Hold!

822
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,821
When did you come in?

823
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,280
What are you doing?

824
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,074
When did you come in?

825
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,368
go out!

826
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,661
Get out!

827
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,246
Get out!

828
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,164
What’s going on in there?

829
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,334
It's not me.

830
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,294
He must have entered our house through the balcony.

831
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,921
All that stuff is installed...

832
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:16,883
what to do?

833
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,037
Hello

834
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:47,873
-Hello
-He was beaten, right?

835
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,042
Could he be dead?

836
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,794
I didn’t do anything…

837
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,255
- Sorry to borrow it.
- Someone called the police here. Let's go take a look.

838
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,798
- He hit someone.
-etc

839
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,467
Raise your hand

840
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,512
Back

841
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,389
Not me…

842
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,516
- Kneel down and don't move.
-husband

843
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,684
- Kneel down
-Were you beaten?

844
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,019
You were arrested for violence

845
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,520
This beast hit someone!

846
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:12,731
Really

847
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,191
How many times have I said it?

848
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,942
I was the one who got beaten

849
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,944
The person downstairs is self-harming

850
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,654
Got it, please wait.

851
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,239
The victim will arrive soon

852
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,366
8:15 Clearing

853
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,410
-Liquidation
-Oh my god, I'm going crazy

854
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,870
I am the victim!

855
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,165
Excuse me

856
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,625
Sir, today I

857
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,710
Can't stay here like this now

858
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,587
I really have a matter of life and death to attend to.

859
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,255
I'll go home and be back soon

860
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,965
Can I come back in handcuffs after this?

861
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,425
What's the matter?

862
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,968
It's my personal matter.

863
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,138
-Personal matter?
-right

864
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,558
Then let's do the work first.

865
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,060
Please give me your phone.

866
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,145
I need to call a lawyer, give me the phone.

867
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,399
Which one of these two?

868
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,609
that

869
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,945
Black Black

870
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:01,947
but

871
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,615
Why two phones?

872
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:04,950
One of them

873
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,160
It's connected to the noise speaker.

874
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,245
Yeah?

875
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,294
Can I go to the bathroom?

876
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,212
So sudden?

877
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,588
Do you want me to pull it here?

878
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,298
Wait a minute

879
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,218
Sudden stomach pain

880
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,472
catch

881
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,141
Wait a moment!

882
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,394
Relax!

883
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,812
-Wait a moment
-Don't move

884
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,438
-Don't move
- Please let me go

885
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,856
What's going on? Why is it so noisy?

886
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,984
Why did they quarrel when I was doing paperwork?

887
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,318
I want to write a report!

888
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,737
The suspect just tried to escape

889
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,155
Feel sorry!

890
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,079
What are you doing? Where does this guy come from?

891
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:52,998
He suddenly ran away

892
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,377
(Login by QR code)

893
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,837
(QR code identity authentication)

894
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,298
Bring me the keys

895
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,799
Oh shit

896
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,218
That's my personal space, damn.

897
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,220
Get out before I break the door down!

898
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,232
Please

899
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,442
Please

900
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,117
(yield: +624.98%)

901
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,577
The key is here

902
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,494
Open the door

903
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,587
(Confirmed to sell)

904
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,175
continue

905
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:46,885
Open

906
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:47,802
push

907
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,262
Wait a moment

908
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,513
There is a sofa

909
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,724
Just ten seconds, sir.

910
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,893
Ten seconds! Shoot!

911
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,102
shot

912
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,021
Why are you shooting it in the face?

913
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:02,942

00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,572
- Push it open
- Push away

915
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,080
(Confirmed to sell)

916
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,373
Don't move!

917
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,290
Raise your hands

918
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,541
What does he want to do with my computer?

919
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,709
(Confirmed to sell)

920
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,754
(Cancel confirmation of sale)

921
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,095
You can't hold on like that.

922
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,012
Hello

923
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,889
(Cancel confirmation of sale)

924
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,016
What's wrong with him?

925
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,268
He is moving

926
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,980
(Cancel confirmation of sale)

927
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,652

(Confirmed to sell)

929
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,245
(Confirmed to sell)

930
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,966
No matter what, you shouldn't use a stun gun.

931
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,968
This is excessive force.

932
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,429
Please help me tell me, I hope nothing will happen

933
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:14,889
Are you okay?

934
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,599
Are you okay?

935
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,854
We are on Mr. Jeon Kwang-cheol's phone
Found the hidden video

936
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:24,941
There is also money to testify
It was the one downstairs who started it.

937
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,609
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

938
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,819
He said he misunderstood you.

939
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,363
Will you forgive him?

940
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,740
That's how we do it.

941
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:33,741
Okay, that's it.

942
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,912
Although you are wronged, but the current situation
This is the most reasonable way to deal with it

943
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,038
Will you please listen to me?

944
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,417
You can go back now. Your phone is here.

945
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:47,964
Put it in this bag.

946
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,856
The house price is finally going up.

947
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,024
Approved

948
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,025
(Express Rail confirmed to open)

949
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,109
I've been waiting for a long time.

950
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,641
(yield: -99.98%)

951
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,995
(I wrote to you when I was a child and never...)

952
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,705
(Sorry I want to end this)

953
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,665
(Leave you there alone...)

954
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:46,874
(My house in Seoul...)

955
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,216
(All gone)

956
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:04,684
(Sorry, Mom, I feel wronged)

957
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,576
Hey, did I tell you to be quiet?

958
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,039
Not me

959
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,041
It's really not me

960
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:11,876
You beast!

961
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,047
Not me

962
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:17,632
Not me

963
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,262
Help!

964
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,180
-save…
-"Help"?

965
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:25,890
Hold!

966
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:26,808
-"Help"?
-save…

967
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,559
Help

968
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:29,560
We today

969
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,021
Just get this over with, you bastard.

970
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,704
What?

971
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:48,830
Is it really not you?

972
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:52,125
I said it wasn't me you bastard!

973
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,226
Even if I feel wronged

974
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,771
You have to think about your mother too, right?

975
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,606
Everything is screwed

976
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:18,943
Those two bastards downstairs

977
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,029
Ruined my life

978
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,865
so what?

979
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,659
Are you going to kill them with this?

980
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,579
You see, they keep making noise.

981
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,247
that is

982
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,250
Why make noise at all?

983
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,835
There must be a reason, right?

984
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:38,004
I think so.

985
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:39,964
Let's go downstairs first.

986
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,884
- Let's go together
-Together?

987
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,635
Why do you suddenly want to go with me?

988
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,596
You just treated me like a bad guy.

989
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,390
Go check it out

990
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,381
Huh?

991
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:27,595
Is anyone there?

992
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:29,972
Is there no one?

993
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:32,975
Oops, the door is not locked.

994
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,144
Aren't you afraid of being stolen?

995
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,073
It seems that no one

996
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,326
They might be back soon.

997
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,203
Let's see if there are any big speakers.

998
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:53,955
Large speakers

999
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:18,896
Nothing suspicious

1000
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,899
But why is there this sound?

1001
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,861
It seems that it's not their side.

1002
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,280
It should be someone else's house

1003
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,952
Oh my god, so much money owed

1004
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,580
Loans, income tax

1005
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,416
(Enforcement Notice)

1006
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:39,584
Depend on

1007
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,420
The landlord was born in 2009

1008
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,380
have a look

1009
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:45,965
(Real Estate Full Lease Renewal Contract)

1010
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,508
(Jia Zhuhao, the agent of Jia Junzhe)

1011
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:51,721
Jia Junzhe was born in 2009

1012
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,056
The top floor also bought our house.

1013
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,266
I tell you, it's even scarier.

1014
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,019
Our landlord is also on the top floor

1015
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,228
Really?

1016
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,897
They used my full rental deposit to pay the balance

1017
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:05,192
So are the 13th, 14th and 15th floors all top floors?

1018
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,611
There may be more

1019
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,195
What are you doing?

1020
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,739
Are they buying the entire apartment building?

1021
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,117
Damn it.

1022
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,286
She must have known in advance that the intercity express train would be connected

1023
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,496
So I deliberately made noise

1024
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,540
So that you can buy the whole apartment yourself

1025
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,500
You can't say that either.

1026
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,003
So many households belong to her.
The noise problem is not good for her.

1027
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,421
You saw it last night.

1028
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,006
No one mentions this because they are afraid it will affect the house price.

1029
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:29,425
That's it

1030
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,719
It's the top floor that's making the noise, right?

1031
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:34,472
If it's really the top

1032
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:36,223
These contracts are just empty words.

1033
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:38,768
Why?

1034
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,227
Because we found the evidence

1035
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,729
If she doesn't cancel the contract

1036
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:43,689
We can tell her that we're going to report it to the media.

1037
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,316
What the fuck else can they do?

1038
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:47,735
People like them

1039
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,946
Don't want to make things bigger

1040
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,948
good

1041
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:53,616
Makes sense

1042
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,952
So now all we have to do is find the evidence, right?

1043
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:57,662
evidence

1044
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,246
Even if you find a speaker,

1045
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,165
But we can't go in.

1046
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,048
(Top level answer and hang up)

1047
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:20,559
Hello

1048
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,311
Are you awake?

1049
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,105
Did I not wake you up?

1050
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,107
Is there anything I can help you with?

1051
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,734
I want to talk to you about yesterday.

1052
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,069
Could you come up for a moment?

1053
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:32,113
Now?

1054
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,823
Just a moment

1055
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:36,659
Good to know

1056
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:45,960
Could you please help me with this?

1057
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,724
Feeling better?

1058
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,434
good

1059
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:03,686
What do you want to do...

1060
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:08,691
What happened yesterday

1061
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:13,279
It was indeed the person living downstairs who hurt himself, right?

1062
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:16,615
Isn't this matter resolved?

1063
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,704
You can tell me frankly

1064
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:24,957
I can help you

1065
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,918
Why are you saying this suddenly?

1066
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:28,878
because

1067
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,963
I didn't want to pursue it.

1068
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,424
But the person downstairs is in a bit of a state...

1069
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:37,720
Wait a moment

1070
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:43,934
Who is it?

1071
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,519
oh

1072
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,230
I am the tenant of No. 1501

1073
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:50,316
Do you remember me?

1074
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,400
Is there anything I can help you with?

1075
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:52,526
oh

1076
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,112
- I have a problem at home.
-Excuse me

1077
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,073
Can I use the restroom?

1078
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,574
Can I talk to you now?

1079
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,659
- Over there
- It will only take a moment.

1080
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,102
-Are you the landlord?
-Wait a moment

1081
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:09,770
- Get out you bastard!
-Wait a moment

1082
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:11,730
Toilet

1083
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,607
- I thought the bathroom was there!
-What's going on?

1084
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:17,111
He was just searching our room.

1085
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,070
You thief

1086
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,406
I'm not a thief

1087
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:23,325
You knew the intercity express train would be open a long time ago, right?

1088
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,619
You bought my house for cheap.
Deliberately making noise

1089
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,122
What are you talking about?

1090
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,790
Why should we save that little money?

1091
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,709
- Do that kind of thing?
- "That little bit of money"?

1092
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,127
"That little bit of money"?

1093
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,797
Then cancel the contract.
Otherwise I will report it to the radio station and the newspaper

1094
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:37,798
This will make things worse.

1095
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:41,510
how?

1096
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:44,638
I mean it.

1097
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:55,649
Let's talk about your matter another day.

1098
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,109
Please pull him out.

1099
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,527
"Pull him out"?

1100
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,029
- That's enough
-You think I can't do it?

1101
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,447
Fuck

1102
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,781
-I'll find evidence!
-come out

1103
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,325
I want to find all the evidence in your house.

1104
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:05,242
open

1105
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,873
In that situation just now
You should take a step back and look for it another day.

1106
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,166
How could I quarrel with them in public?

1107
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:13,792
I'm sure

1108
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,336
The top is the culprit

1109
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,921
Do you see anything?

1110
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,174
I saw a fingerprint identification iron door

1111
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:21,675
Ordinary people don't have that kind of stuff in their homes.

1112
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,761
They must be making noise in that room

1113
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:25,930
You said there is an iron door with fingerprint recognition at home?

1114
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,723
-Um
- It's a bit suspicious.

1115
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,392
Shit, I must find a way to get in again...

1116
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,561
I know, don't get excited.

1117
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:36,440
Calm down and let's make a plan together

1118
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,400
Together?

1119
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:40,945
I wronged you and I owe you a favor

1120
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,447
If you're willing to help me

1121
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,406
Of course I am happy

1122
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,534
We were stupid enough to doubt each other before.

1123
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,161
I didn't expect those people were making the noise.

1124
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,537
That is to say

1125
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,040
That's right

1126
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,126
My name is Lu Yusheng

1127

1128
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,507
Brother, you don't need to use honorifics with me anymore.

1129
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:03,842
I didn't use honorifics.

1130
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:08,264
Let's go take a shower and rest for a while.

1131
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:10,099
It takes physical strength to recover the house and find evidence.

1132
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:11,850

1136
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:57,187
Wake up so soon?

1137
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,357
My wireless network is down

1138
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,901
Can you share your network?

1139
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,487
Wireless network? I don't have any either.

1140
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,198
Yeah?

1141
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:09,575
knew

1142
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:10,993
Then I'll go first

1144
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,834
Why

1145
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,211
I'm going to the sauna. Would you like to come with me?

1146
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:23,255
Steaming can relax your body

1147
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,008
I just washed it.

1148
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,968
I want to go back and take a nap. I'm leaving first.

Don't you want to take a nap?

1153

I can't sleep

1154
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,745
You can fall asleep after steaming

1155
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:37,663
Um

1156
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,211
Oops, I forgot
I didn't pay the management fee so I can't get in.

1157
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,755
- You go in first.
- Can I charge my card?

1158
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,425
We usually can't...

1159
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,634
Is that ok?

1160
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,053
Okay, just this once.

1161
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,682

01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:21,582
Do I look like a gangster?

1166
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,758

1167
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:33,552

1169
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:36,388
Undercover

1170
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,764
Undercover reporting or something like that?

1171
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:39,099
Yes, undercover

1172
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,226
I got the tattoo after I started doing this job.

1173
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,644
I've been stabbed.

1174
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,480
I have been tortured, but what’s the point?

1175
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,398
I risk my life to do this

1176
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,567
But no one recognizes

1177
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:51,570
The money was earned by the radio station.

1178
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:52,988
So I think it’s meaningless

1179
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:55,908
Later I decided to start a project myself

1180
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,869

1181
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,498
So I thought: “What about the apartment noise incident?”

1182
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,666
We both experienced apartment noise.

1183
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,294
I really want to kill them, you know.

1184
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,754
Right?

1185
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,048
yes

1186
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,509
I really want to kill them.

1187
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:15,761
Right?

1188
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:24,102
Maybe it's because I didn't sleep well.

1189
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:25,729
Feeling so tired

1190
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,106
I'm going back first

1191
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,358
You go back slowly and have a good rest

1192
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:31,735

01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:11,963
Are you crazy?

1278
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,799
These are the result of several months of hard work!

1279
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:18,303
You know

1280
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,930
What are these?

1281
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:21,973
It can solve

1282
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:23,933
Noise Problems in Apartments in Korea

1283
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,394
The ugly truth! Do you know?

1284
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:28,563
You fuck

1285
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:34,903
Hello!

1286
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:36,946
Damn, I can't die now.

1287
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:42,452
Depend on

1288
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:44,662
I haven't recorded the interview video yet.

1289
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:47,832
Who told you to touch the video data?

1290
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:48,917
court death

1291
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:53,004
The plan is ruined.

1292
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:55,423
Okay fuck it let's end this today

1293
01:24:57,717 --> 01:24:58,551
What?

1294
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,512
Where is the other one?

1295
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:23,535
Is it the police station?

1296
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,036
I am from the Royal City of Xiliou

1297
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,871
The man who caused trouble yesterday

1298
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:27,789
About Lu Yusheng

1299
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:30,917
He seems to have killed his downstairs neighbor.

1300
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,253
He just went up to the top floor and said he was going to kill them too.

1301
01:26:01,614 --> 01:26:02,532
Huh?

1302
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:06,870
Apartment Noise Serial Killer Lu Yusheng
Hiding under my bed

1303
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:09,706
Looks like he wants to kill me too.

1304
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:11,875
what to do?

1305
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:13,877
Um

1306
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,296
Hang up first

1307
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:30,518
Yusheng

1308
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:32,645
Why do you want to kill people?

1309
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:34,981
And in someone else's house?

1310
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,152
Did you kill him with that hammer?

1311
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:40,987
how?

1312
01:26:41,654 --> 01:26:42,614
Want to kill me too?

1313
01:26:43,114 --> 01:26:44,115
Hello

1314
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:45,533
Spare me

1315
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:49,412
You crazy

1316
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:52,290
Who would believe you with the condition of your house?

1317
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:54,459
Everyone will

1318
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:58,004
Everyone in this apartment thinks that except you
No one is going to kill your downstairs neighbor

1319
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,381
Because I prepared in advance.

1320
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:03,593
You want to blame everything on me?

1321
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:06,888
Hello

1322
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,015
You wanted to die

1323
01:27:09,098 --> 01:27:11,893
Since you are going to die
Wouldn't it be better to die with more meaning?

1324
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,186
Died as a murderer

1325
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,313
Does it make sense?

1326
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,482
In a broad sense, it is sacrifice

1327
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,693
If no corners were cut when this apartment was built

1328
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,362
How could this happen?

1329
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:26,157
This is all because of your shit.

1330
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,202
Is it because of me?

1331
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:37,418
Hello

1332
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:39,045
Look at it

1333
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:43,675
The dream you exchanged your life for

1334
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,302
Is it really just like that?

1335
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:48,680
Aren't you curious?

1336
01:27:49,472 --> 01:27:51,808
People spend hundreds of millions of won on homes

1337
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:53,309
Why should we suffer from noise?

1338
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,895
Hate, curse, or even kill each other?

1339
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,313
Why do you do this?

1340
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:58,648
Why not build apartments properly?

1341
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:01,651
Who embezzled public funds when building the apartments?
Who allowed cutting corners?

1342
01:28:01,734 --> 01:28:02,902
Who is it?

1343
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,780
the truth

1344
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:08,616
On the top floor of this apartment

1345
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:10,827
In that iron door room

1346
01:28:12,495 --> 01:28:13,621
Oh shit

1347
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,081
Is the head injured seriously?

1348
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,715
Then just target the top layer right from the start.

1349
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:26,217
Why are you targeting me?

1350
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,385
Why me?

1351
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:30,513
I didn't do anything wrong
Why drag me into your farce?

1352
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:32,682
I checked everyone in this apartment.

1353
01:28:32,765 --> 01:28:34,642
You best fit the image of an angry, violent young man

1354
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,186
Your life is rough.

1355
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:41,024
You are a contemporary young person
A symbol of the pain and suffering faced

1356
01:28:42,191 --> 01:28:43,234
Right? House slaves

1357
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:46,195
You are a great messenger

1358
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:50,450
"A young man lost his mind due to noise in the apartment

1359
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:52,660
Beat neighbor to death with hammer, then committed suicide

1360
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,788
In such a bloody battle
One person miraculously survived

1361
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:57,457
That's reporter Rong Zhenhao

1362
01:28:58,082 --> 01:29:01,210
He has a ledger in his arms

1363
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:04,255
Recording the truth behind apartment noise

1364
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:08,217
By Jung Jin-ho, reporter
Risking his life to reveal the truth

1365
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,344
His sincerity

1366
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,095
Changed the world

1367
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:15,099
Yusheng

1368
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,144
I won't let you

1369
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:20,271
Died in vain

1370
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:22,815
Sorry Yusheng

1371
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:24,776
Big Brother

1372
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:29,447
etc.

1373
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:32,408
Big Brother

1374
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:33,701
I will help you

1375
01:29:34,285 --> 01:29:35,119
As long as you

1376
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,412
Help me get my house back

1377
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:38,539
I will help you

1378
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:40,833
I'll do this with you, bro.

1379
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,794
You want to help me kill someone?

1380
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:47,090
Because someone downstairs suddenly broke in
So your plans are ruined, right?

1381
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:50,635
In this case
This must end tonight.

1382
01:29:52,011 --> 01:29:53,388
Can you do it alone?

1383
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:56,265
If you fail on your own
The truth cannot be revealed

1384
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,440
I've had enough of that.

1385
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:09,028
I want my house back
I want to get my life back.

1386
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:11,239
Delivering information to the world

1387
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:13,616
I have no reason to betray you

1388
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:18,287
What message is conveyed?

1389
01:30:19,872 --> 01:30:21,874
Tenants about to be evicted from their apartment due to noise issues

1390
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,002
Killed landlord and then committed suicide

1391
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:30,425
Pretty good

1392
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:31,551
But Yusheng

1393
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:33,719
In case something goes wrong

1394
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,348
I will go to Nanhai to visit your mother

1395
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:40,143
You also have to be interviewed.

1396
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:55,528
Spare me

1397
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:57,488
Spare me...

1398
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,084
What are you going to do?

1399
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:14,505
Let me formally introduce myself

1400
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:17,633
I am the universal detective Rong Zhenhao
Nice to meet you

1401
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:19,677
What?

1402
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,305
During your tenure as prosecutor, a year ago

1403
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:25,725
A show that explores the truth about the shoddy workmanship in this apartment
It was you who prevented it from being banned, right?

1404
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:27,518
I am the reporter for that show.

1405
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:30,605
I risked my life to interview
I was stabbed by a gangster.

1406
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:32,857
As a result, external pressure led to me being tricked.

1407
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,775
Do you know how bad I felt?

1408
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:36,360
That's not external pressure.

1409
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:38,904
That incident was investigated at the time so...

1410
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:41,782
Since then
I will start to focus on tracking you down.

1411
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:44,744
But you suddenly resigned.

1412
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:46,996
Then I started buying apartments here.

1413
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:48,456
I know it is a shoddy project but I still buy it

1414
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:50,166
So I moved in here with you.

1415
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:51,542
I want to live near your house.

1416
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,628
You might find some interesting things

1417
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,047
You seem

1418
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:57,465
Misunderstood

1419
01:33:57,548 --> 01:33:59,258
Okay, let me ask you a question.

1420
01:33:59,842 --> 01:34:01,177
Where are the ledgers?

1421
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:07,933
In that room with the iron door, right?

1422
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:11,312
Ledger?

1423
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:15,107
Okay, I'll ask again. Listen.

1424
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:19,111
You and your husband, the supervisor
Details of the bribes squandered together

1425
01:34:19,945 --> 01:34:22,156
There is also a list of people involved in South Korea's shoddy construction

1426
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:23,991
All neatly listed in a ledger

1427
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:26,619
This account book

1428
01:34:27,578 --> 01:34:28,454
Where?

1429
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:31,624
I don't know what you're talking about

1430
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:37,296
Madam Inspector

1431
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:40,174
A conversation between you and your husband
I heard it all

1432
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,885
Block the camera and you can hear the sound

1433
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:44,595
I mean the intercom.

1434
01:34:46,305 --> 01:34:48,432
You are the shoddy engineering agent.
You are afraid to take on everything

1435
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:50,017
So I have kept that account book.

1436
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:52,812
Because that's your universal shield.

1437
01:34:52,895 --> 01:34:53,729
good

1438
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:55,898
This universal shield

1439
01:34:55,981 --> 01:34:57,692
Is it in the room with the iron door?

1440
01:34:58,943 --> 01:34:59,985
I said I don't know

1441
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:00,903
Hold

1442
01:35:00,986 --> 01:35:01,904
He knows

1443
01:35:04,156 --> 01:35:05,324
My husband knows

1444
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:06,534
He uses that room alone.

1445
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,079
What's Inside
I don't know what he's doing in there.

1446
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:11,330
I really don't know

1447
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:15,459
Well, let's check the facts.

1448
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:16,502
Look at it

1449
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:18,713
Come

1450
01:35:19,755 --> 01:35:21,382
Let's go

1451
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,844
Oh my god, you ate a lot.

1452
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:28,472
Come

1453
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:33,436
good

1454
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:34,979
Yusheng

1455
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:36,522
I was a little too much before

1456
01:35:38,023 --> 01:35:38,858
sorry

1457
01:35:39,442 --> 01:35:41,110
I know it at a glance

1458
01:35:41,193 --> 01:35:43,571
You don't do this because you want to.

1459
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:47,742
I know you're threatened, right?

1460
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:48,951
The neighbor downstairs died

1461
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:51,203
How did he die?

1462
01:35:53,622 --> 01:35:55,958
He wanted to kill me too.
So I just pretended to be on his side.

1463
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:58,169
I will help you

1464
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:02,214
That's it

1465
01:36:02,298 --> 01:36:04,675
I knew it would happen. You were right to do this.

1466
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:08,095
If you help me, I will help you solve all your problems.

1467
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,014
Air gun in the study

1468
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:12,099
-Is it usable?
- Can be used

1469
01:36:12,683 --> 01:36:13,642
You use the air rifle to subdue him.

1470
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:16,771
I'm not helping you because I like you.

1471
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,773
Your mistake should be punished accordingly.

1472
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:21,901
It's not like that. I'm not that kind of person.

1473
01:36:21,984 --> 01:36:23,694
Do you believe what the murderer said?

1474
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:25,863
Please

1475
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:27,198
Save me

1476
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:28,699
Help me

1477
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:31,118
- I will give you your house back
-Hold!

1478
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:34,955
You bastards

1479
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,458
What the hell? Fuck! Follow me

1480
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:38,959
Come fuck me

1481
01:36:42,087 --> 01:36:42,922
Is that all?

1482
01:36:43,422 --> 01:36:44,632
Is that all? Shit!

1483
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:46,342
Where are the ledgers?

1484
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:49,011
Call you a bitch!

1485
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:51,180
Is that all?

1486
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:55,142
Is that all that's in the safe? Shit!

1487
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:57,144
Where are the ledgers?

1488
01:36:57,812 --> 01:36:59,814
I'm sorry I embezzled the apartment management fee.

1489
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:02,650
I also accepted bribes when choosing a service company. I was wrong.

1490
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:04,652
But you can't do this, can you? Spare me.

1491
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:06,153
- I am willing to be punished
-You bitch!

1492
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:08,906
Stop playing tricks, you bastards.

1493
01:37:09,573 --> 01:37:11,283
This is impossible! Fuck

1494
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:13,410
Get up you beast

1495
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:15,246
Say you're a beast

1496
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:16,872
Where are the ledgers?

1497
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:24,588
Let's all die together!

1498
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:26,966
Where are the ledgers? Shit!

1499
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:28,884
Where are the ledgers?

1500
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:31,011
I just need the ledger

1501
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:32,429
Where are the ledgers?

1502
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:33,973
Where are the ledgers?

1503
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:37,560
The truth is here with you

1504
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:39,395
Right?

1505
01:37:57,079 --> 01:37:58,664
You're a worthless guy.

1506
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:01,750
Standing on their side

1507
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:06,297
You idiot! Fuck!

1508
01:38:07,172 --> 01:38:08,173
Hold

1509
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:11,176
You fucking traitor

1510
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,262
Go to hell, bastard!

1511
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:14,763
You bastard!

1512
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,243
You go catch him

1513
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:37,202
Kill him

1514
01:38:38,537 --> 01:38:39,538
You beast

1515
01:38:40,414 --> 01:38:41,540
I'm going to kill you

1516
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:43,626
We must not let him leave alive, catch him!

1517
01:38:43,709 --> 01:38:45,377
You beast!

1518
01:38:46,503 --> 01:38:47,338
Money represents!

1519
01:38:47,838 --> 01:38:48,672
Money represents!

1520
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:51,842
Money represents! Please open...

1521
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:53,135
Open the door

1522
01:38:58,515 --> 01:39:00,517
Go to hell

1523
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:06,667
Depend on

1524
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:26,353
Kill him

1525
01:40:30,107 --> 01:40:31,108
Kill him

1526
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:36,405
Enough

1527
01:40:36,905 --> 01:40:38,615
Let the police handle it.

1528
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:41,535
Two people died here.

1529
01:40:42,786 --> 01:40:44,121
Who is responsible?

1530
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:48,834
If you don't kill him

1531
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:52,463
You will take the blame

1532
01:40:57,634 --> 01:40:58,469
Hello

1533
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:02,473
You don't have to worry

1534
01:41:03,432 --> 01:41:04,808
That won't happen.

1535
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:06,518
I will handle this properly.

1536
01:41:07,519 --> 01:41:08,353
Believe me

1537
01:41:09,354 --> 01:41:10,189
Kill him

1538
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:11,565
Please

1539
01:41:12,232 --> 01:41:13,067
Wake up

1540
01:41:14,276 --> 01:41:15,277
Can't trust her

1541
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:16,779
Kill him

1542
01:41:18,697 --> 01:41:19,656
Yusheng

1543
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:20,949
Kill him!

1544
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:49,561
You missed your chance asshole!

1545
01:41:50,854 --> 01:41:52,106
You're a useless guy.

1546
01:41:55,734 --> 01:41:57,194
Too indecisive

1547
01:42:06,578 --> 01:42:08,497
So people still need to live in a better place

1548
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:11,125
Otherwise you'll have to deal with a lot of messy people.

1549
01:42:12,334 --> 01:42:14,128
What a mess

1550
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:21,927
So I didn't say

1551
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:25,389
Can’t you just take in any tenants?

1552
01:42:28,517 --> 01:42:29,351
It seems to be you

1553
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:31,687
The mentally ill person he mentioned

1554
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:36,024
You worked so hard to move in here.
Is this the ending?

1555
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:43,824
I really didn't expect this.

1556
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:52,541
Why didn't you idiots hear me?
Is the account book right here?

1557
01:42:57,963 --> 01:42:58,797
This is it, right?

1558
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:00,340
What's the use of this?

1559
01:43:01,049 --> 01:43:01,967
You take this public.

1560
01:43:02,467 --> 01:43:04,595
Can you blame me for the noise problem in the apartment?

1561
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:05,804
or

1562
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,556
Do you think you can change the world?

1563
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:12,811
So what?

1564
01:43:14,396 --> 01:43:17,191
Build apartments properly without cutting corners

1565
01:43:17,274 --> 01:43:18,525
Will the noise problem go away?

1566
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:20,611
Won't

1567
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:23,363
I told you

1568
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:25,657
The problem with apartment noise is people

1569
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:27,784
Why blame the quality of the apartment?

1570
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:33,123
Building it stronger means the cost will go up

1571
01:43:33,749 --> 01:43:35,125
This will also increase the price

1572
01:43:35,918 --> 01:43:36,752
Then finally

1573
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:40,130
People like you can't afford a house.

1574
01:43:40,797 --> 01:43:42,257
How can you not understand such a simple truth?

1575
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:46,595

1576
01:43:48,096 --> 01:43:50,015
Can't rely on hope

1577
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:53,477
Be pragmatic

1578
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,231
I think your life is over.

1579
01:43:59,149 --> 01:44:00,984
I'll try harder in the next life.

1580
01:44:04,446 --> 01:44:05,489
I don't want

1581
01:44:43,568 --> 01:44:45,279
Wow

1582
01:44:45,862 --> 01:44:47,197
Pretending to die is too painful

1583
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,658

1584
01:44:51,451 --> 01:44:52,577
