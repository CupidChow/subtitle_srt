00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,208
(Double Mints)

2
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,042
How's it going?

3
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,417
Not bad.

4
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,875
Nice one.

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,458
The deadline is close.

6
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:33,917
Yeah, right?

7
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,833
Off you go, I'll take care of it.

8
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,125
You sure? I hope I didn't sound demanding.

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,167
Urgent business, y' know?

10
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,083
Sorry, see ya.

11
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,417
You're too soft.

12
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:07,750
Oh well. He's been working late recently.

13
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,542
Hello?

14
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:22,458
Mitsuo?

15
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,875
Sorry, but who's calling?

16
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:27,583
It's Mitsuo.

17
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:33,750
Mitsuo. You mean...

18
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,167
Mitsuo?

19
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,000
Come right away.

20
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:41,583
I killed a woman.

21
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,500
You're a smart.

22
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,875
Do something.

23
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,417
Let's...

24
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,917
dump the body.

25
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,125
Head to the mountain.

26
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,667
We can dig a hole

27
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,083
and bury her, we'll manage.

28
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:40,208
We need tools, like shovels.

29
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:42,875
Mitsuo?

30
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,500
Stop yapping about. annoying

31
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,625
We¡K

32
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,542
It's been ages...

33
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:03,000
-Ryoko Maruyama
-Yes.

34
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,583
Next, boys.

35
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,375
Kenji Adachi.

36
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,542
Yes.

37
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:11,833
Cheer up.

38
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,375
It's only the first day.

39
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,625
- Ataru Igami.
- Yes.

40
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,625
Okay.

41
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,583
Mitsuo Ichikawa.

42
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,292
- Yes.
- Yes.

43
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,625
Oh?

44
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,583
Same names... same spelling?

45
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,708
No, that's different.

46
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,792
Ur... what am I supposed to do?

47
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:40,750
Okay, Ichikawa as in a number.

48
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:41,625
Yes.

49
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,792
Okay.

50
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,792
Ichikawa, like the city.

51
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:47,833
Yes.

52
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:48,917
Okay.

53
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,250
- Kosuke Ihara.
- Yes.

54
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,333
Okay.

55
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,958
How can you be so cruel, Mitch?

56
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,417
To someone who has same name as you?

57
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:02,167
Over points

58
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:04,875
That's right, too much

59
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,375
Pure evil, a demon.

60
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,333
That's right

61
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,958
You're beyond evil,

62
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,333
Adachi.

63
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,625
Yeah.

64
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:41,583
- Iguchi.
- Yes.

65
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,750
Ichikawa.

66
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,167
Ichikawa?

67
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,750
One of you is here, right?

68
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,917
Yes.

69
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:53,708
The other one?

70
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,458
Dunno.

71
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,500
Skiving, huh?

72
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,750
Never thought he's that type.

73
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,125
- Ihara.
- Yes.

74
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,458
- Uchida.
- Yes.

75
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,750
Uno.

76
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,542
Kouda.

77
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,875
Darnit!

78
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,167
Today's PE sucks, doesn't it?

79
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:25,292
Vaulting box, pain in the ass.

80
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:27,875
Why should we carry these, though?

81
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
Just to annoy us?

82
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,958
How do we carry them?

83
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,875
One by one, I guess?

84
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,875
- Hey, no box today, mat instead.
- Oh yeah?

85
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,708
Should've told us earlier.

86
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,458
Well, mat isn't any better.

87
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,792
You got that end?

88
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,500
Ready, now!

89
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,500
It's heavy.

90
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,375
- How is it?
- Too wide.

91
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,875
Can you manage?

92
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:52,583
Need help?

93
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,542
- I'm good, it's fine.
- You sure?

94
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:55,958
- Really?
- Get out, take your time.

95
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,208
Push!

96
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,208
Yeah, we got through.

97
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,833
- Wait, I'll shut the door.
- Yep.

98
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,458
I'll let you out.? Mitsuo.

99
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If you promise you'll obey me forever.

100
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,542
I'll let you out.

101
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,625
You'll be my dog.

102
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,167
Okay.

103
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,958
Dogs don't speak.

104
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:07,750
Woof.

105
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,833
Again.

106
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,583
Woof.

107
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,667
Don't you fuckin' forget your promise!

108
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,417
That ring...

109
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,333
This? Cheap shit.

110
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,292
She wanted matching rings.

111
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,917
Women love mementos, don't they?

112
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,917
You shouldn't keep it.

113
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,333
I guess...

114
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,167
Help me dig, Mitsuo.

115
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,833
She's your girl.

116
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,458
I'm feeling sick.

117
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,167
I am drunk.

118
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,333
Remember our promise?

119
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,458
That you obey me forever.

120
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,417
You are still my dog.

121
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,042
Damn,

122
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,333
I didn't ask her to die.

123
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,417
Hey!

124
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,250
Finish the rest.

125
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,417
We'll be back in Tokyo soon.

126
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,542
You know...

127
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,667
I can't do it.

128
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,458
I'll turn myself in.

129
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,000
What?

130
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,500
I can't do it.

131
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,833
It was...

132
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,458
an accident.

133
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,042
Now I know...

134
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:36,042
I was in love with her.

135
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,708
What the fuck?

136
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,000
Get off!

137
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,542
Mitsuo. I'll kill ya!

138
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,250
Go on then.

139
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,458
Huh?

140
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,417
You think you can, sissy?

141
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,792
Hey.

142
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,125
Hey!

143
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,542
Hey baby, what're you up to?

144
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,833
-Are you chatting me up?¡H
-I was serious.

145
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,417
-I am not
-I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

146
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:04,667
Come on, leave him!

147
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,125
-Play with me
-Disgusting.

148
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,958
Shame you're my type but not today.

149
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:09,708
Why not?

150
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,042
- 'coz of my boyfriend!
- Just today.

151
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,708
He'll go mad.

152
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,875
C'mon!

153
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,875
Mr. Boyfriend?

154
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,625
Hey,

155
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,167
Mitsuo.

156
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,000
Give me a break.

157
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,833
Don't be so jealous.

158
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,458
What the hell? Dickhead.

159
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,208
Drop dead!

160
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,167
- Look at me, prick!
- It hurts.

161
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:36,792
- I'm gonna kill ya...
- That fuckin' hurts!

162
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,583
Asami?

163
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,458
Asami?

164
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,417
Asami?

165
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,958
Asami?

166
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,000
Hey, you drunk too much.

167
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,750
Asami, You're drunk.

168
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,000
Totally wasted.

169
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,333
C'mon baby, get up.

170
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,375
How much did you drink?

171
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,542
Are you okay?

172
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,208
You drunk too much, baby.

173
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,292
Goddammit!

174
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,500
Have you found anything?

175
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,083
No, nothing.

176
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,458
Shit.

177
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,625
Hey.

178
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:04,625
You.

179
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,625
Are you sure this is the place?

180
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,667
Of course, I am.

181
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,833
You saw the hole, right?

182
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,958
Were you dreaming or something?

183
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,458
As if...

184
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,250
How did you get here then?

185
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,917
By car, with a friend.

186
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,167
Ah!

187
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,542
The ring...

188
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,500
Haven't you found the ring either?

189
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,708
Didn't find it?

190
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,292
Stop talking rubbish, you!

191
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,542
Thank you for the good work.

192
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,375
Let's call it a day,

193
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:45,875
sorry.

194
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,667
What's going on?

195
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,083
I'm sorry.

196
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:52,667
I'm sorry.

197
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,375
Let's go.

198
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:27,000
Covered the body with soil
and went back home.

199
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:37,833
You.

200
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,292
I let you go but next time won't be the same.

201
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,958
It's all true.

202
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,042
Little shit...

203
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,292
Yes.

204
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:58,458
How's it going?

205
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,250
Mr. "Anti-Mob" Nakaoka?

206
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,625
What brings you here?

207
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,458
Easy. No need to be hostile.

208
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:13,625
He's linked to the Saeki family, isn't he?

209
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:15,875
But he's nobody,

210
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,458
just an errand boy.

211
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,750
I'm afraid the info was bogus.

212
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,667
I guess he was drunk.

213
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:27,583
He said he buried the body so we went,

214
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:30,667
didn't find a damn thing!

215
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,542
Disappointing, huh?

216
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:51,917
Um...

217
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,292
Can I smoke?

218
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,958
Of course not.

219
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,167
I'm so sorry!

220
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:25,917
Mitsuo. Wait here.

221
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,750
Huh? I apologized properly, didn't I?

222
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,542
What a prick.

223
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,167
Mr. Saeki!

224
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,500
Thank you for your visit!

225
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,750
It's fine, lie down.

226
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:23,833
Here.

227
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,083
No... I...

228
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,958
I'm so sorry!

229
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,833
Did I hear you say sorry?

230
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:56,208
For getting battered by Murakawa's?

231
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:12,958
Calm down.

232
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,083
Oh well... Okuda.

233
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,042
You've been battered badly.

234
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,667
So you spilled the beans,

235
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,000
you told them about us, huh?

236
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,958
It can't be helped.

237
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:38,917
No

238
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,458
I... did not say anything.

239
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,500
Look at you,

240
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,833
I might've done
the same if I get beaten like that.

241
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:50,125
It can't be helped.

242
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,875
Thank you, Boss.

243
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:28,083
What're you doing?

244
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:33,292
Call the police and tell them you did it.

245
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,417
Are you okay?

246
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,083
Call an ambulance?

247
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,583
Mitsuo, get in.

248
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,750
Yes.

249
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:25,042
What should we do with
Murakawa's gang, Boss?

250
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:28,375
Let's wait and see.

251
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:30,625
It might just be settled with money.

252
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:39,167
How can you show your face
after a week of absence?

253
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:41,458
I'm sorry.

254
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,875
Call me before you go away.

255
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,833
Yeah...

256
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,667
What did you say?

257
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:53,375
Yes.

258
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:58,375
So you can back to work, right?

259
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:00,917
Yes.

260
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:15,708
Mr. Ichikawa... um...

261
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,333
You have a visitor.

262
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,125
Who?

263
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,417
From the police.

264
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,583
Police?

265
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,042
Yes.

266
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,917
Okay. Thank you.

267
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:36,250
Okay.

268
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:41,667
§AMr. Ichikawa?

269
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:44,792
Hello. I'm Nakaoka from Shinjuku station.

270
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,542
What a grand place.

271
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,208
Can I see your ID, please?

272
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,958
Oh, excuse me.

273
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,750
Follow me.

274
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,833
Go somewhere else, maybe?

275
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:13,375
It's fine. I've done nothing wrong. Please.

276
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,625
Does a system engineer make good money?

277
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:21,625
So so, I guess.

278
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,792
I thought detective as worked as a pair?

279
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,958
Is it only on TV?

280
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:31,083
Normally, yes.

281
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,542
But I don't like having a buddy.

282
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,125
I prefer working alone.

283
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,000
Especially in this case.

284
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:47,333
You don't look like a popular guy.

285
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,667
I got very drunk and killed a woman.

286
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:59,125
Then buried the body with my friend.

287
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:03,375
I buried the matching ring as well.

288
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:06,375
Do you know what I'm on about?

289
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:08,833
Not really.

290
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:10,958
He's drunk most of the time.

291
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,917
Are you married?

292
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,208
How about you?

293
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,750
Excuse me...

294
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:30,292
Well well, this is a nice ring.

295
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,042
Isn't it amazing?

296
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,292
It's my favorite.

297
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,833
Thank you for your time.

298
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:42,250
Are you going?

299
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:44,250
I'll come again.

300
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,833
Anytime, as you like.

301
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,833
I'd be your friend.

302
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:37,292
It's my nephew's tea, he lives a decent life.

303
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:41,292
Excuse me.

304
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,125
Mitsuo,

305
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:44,917
you have a visitor.

306
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,917
Hello again.

307
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:49,875
Sit down.

308
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:51,167
Yes.

309
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,917
What was it about again?

310
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:01,917
Well, I just came to see his face today.

311
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,250
Then why didn't ya go to his house, eh?

312
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,667
Shut up!

313
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,625
He's got a pretty face.

314
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,542
Can I ask you something?

315
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,292
What is it?

316
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:28,625
There are only men in the Yakuza's world.

317
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:32,250
Very male orientated.

318
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,625
How can I put it...

319
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:38,833
Is being homosexual normal?

320
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:46,208
Is it that good?

321
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,583
What is?

322
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,833
Men's body?

323
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,125
Watch your fucking mouth.

324
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,500
Easy.

325
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,792
Is that the question?

326
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:10,958
I guess...

327
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:15,083
it depends on the person.

328
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:22,083
I'll leave you two here.

329
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,083
Let's go.

330
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,167
Don't detectives worked as a pair?

331
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:44,000
Only on TV?

332
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,875
The other Mitsuo said the same thing.

333
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:57,208
Having the same name connects
you two like twins, I wonder?

334
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,375
You saw him?

335
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:08,625
Can you recognize this ring?

336
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:14,375
The matching ring you bought
with her, remember?

337
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,125
Mitsuo!

338
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:29,042
We found her. The dead body!

339
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,167
Mr. Saeki.

340
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,458
A new burden when you have
enough on your plate, huh?

341
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,250
I'm off.

342
00:38:57,042 --> 00:39:00,292
Mitsuo, where did you hide the body?

343
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:05,208
They found her. The cop came with the ring.

344
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:11,750
Damn it! You hid the body
somewhere obvious, didn't ya?

345
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,083
What should we do?

346
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:20,000
It's all your fault!

347
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,833
It's your fault!

348
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,417
Calm down.

349
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,542
The ring is fake.

350
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,708
Nothing to worry about.

351
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,708
¤£Don't worry, Mitsuo.

352
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,500
Do something, alright?

353
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,042
Hey, Mitsuo.

354
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,583
I'll call you later.

355
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,125
Who are you talking to?

356
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,875
Better not be a girl. Hang up!

357
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:56,208
Long relationship?

358
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:57,958
On and off.

359
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,708
What do you mean?

360
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,167
Mitsuo?

361
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,667
C'mon stop it,

362
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:17,542
Mitsuo. I'll call the police!

363
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,083
Explain, Mitsuo.

364
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,792
Isn't it obvious?

365
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,250
She wasn't dead.

366
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:44,667
Well, she was in her last breath.

367
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:49,500
She was unconscious

368
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:52,958
and severely dehydrated.

369
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:23,083
I dug her out and washed all the mud off.

370
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:30,375
Gave her some water, she woke up as normal.

371
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:34,292
What are you talking about?

372
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,667
Hey... what's going on?

373
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:40,708
Nasty,

374
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:45,208
I told her we met the night
before and had drinks.

375
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:50,208
¤°Seriously, what's going on?

376
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,417
She remembers nothing about that night.

377
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,542
- Which night?
- Good for you.

378
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,500
Yep,

379
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,500
I can taste you, Mitsuo.

380
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,750
Ew... you two are gross.

381
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,083
Why did you do it?

382
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,542
To have something on you?

383
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:45,375
That ain't why, eh?

384
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,042
You make me angry on purpose,
so you get punished, right?

385
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,542
Fucking pervert.

386
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,875
It's your fault...

387
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:24,917
Your eyes... the way you see me.

388
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:36,542
Come on, cut it out.

389
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:40,417
I don't get you two anyway. So weird...

390
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,083
Get out. Or I'll kill ya.

391
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,625
I'm going!

392
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,167
Suck me.

393
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:22,417
There's a good dog.

394
00:45:57,667 --> 00:46:00,625
Orange juice, please. No ice.

395
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,333
You two having fun?

396
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:21,875
Detective.

397
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:24,875
You want this?

398
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:42,375
Good work.

399
00:46:56,917 --> 00:47:00,792
Hey, do you remember what we discussed?¡H

400
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:05,875
About the four of us going to Disneyland.

401
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:11,625
Oh, Ima and Fumi might
bring their boyfriends as well.

402
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,917
Hey, Mitsuo...

403
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,208
are you listening?

404
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:24,958
Huh?

405
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:26,500
I'm listening.

406
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,125
No, you weren't.

407
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:36,792
Do you like another girl or something?

408
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:45,750
That won't happen.

409
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,458
Can I come to your place?

410
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,250
No...

411
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:10,417
Wait until my birthday.

412
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:20,750
I want to make our first one very special.

413
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:36,042
Mitch!

414
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:37,875
Hurry up!

415
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,250
Sorry. That was funny...

416
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:44,292
Do you know how to make a drink
out of those free sugar syrup?

417
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:46,708
He's been drinking only that these days.

418
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:48,833
Idiot!

419
00:48:49,042 --> 00:48:50,042
So stupid.

420
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:51,375
Hey, Mitsuo!

421
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,500
Am I disturbing you?

422
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:56,458
Wow, having a date?

423
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:58,333
- Nice one!
- She's cute.

424
00:48:58,458 --> 00:48:59,667
A couple?

425
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,542
- Really?
- Since when?

426
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:03,083
Leave us alone!

427
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:06,333
- No way!
- Why do you like him?

428
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:10,125
-I'm leaving now, bye
-Bye.

429
00:49:40,792 --> 00:49:42,333
How long then?

430
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:46,167
With that girl?

431
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:48,250
You mean, Ri?

432
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:50,125
You call her Ri?

433
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:53,542
Hmm... Rina?

434
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:54,792
Risa?

435
00:49:54,917 --> 00:49:56,208
Rika?

436
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,625
Ritsuko?

437
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:59,208
Her name is Ritsuko.

438
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:01,500
Ritsuko.

439
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,417
And, since when?

440
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,375
The end of last year?

441
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,625
Oh, really?

442
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:15,750
Fucked yet?

443
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:44,125
Mitsuo?

444
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,083
What?

445
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:01,458
Who was it?

446
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:04,708
Delivery, but it was for next door.

447
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,875
Do you like music?

448
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,167
Yes.

449
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:15,292
Oh, did you think it was Mitsuo?

450
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:21,833
Despite sharing a name,
you two are so different.

451
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:24,208
I'm not dirty-minded like him.

452
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:27,792
- Mitsuo? Dirty-minded?
- Oh, yeah.

453
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,750
Look at your nails!?

454
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,083
This?

455
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:39,833
My classmate did them for me.

456
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,375
Let me see again?

457
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:26,417
All yours.

458
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:08,792
Mitsuo...

459
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,542
Why?

460
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:26,667
Wait...

461
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,708
Let me exp...

462
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:34,542
Doesn't matter now.

463
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:41,500
It's fine.

464
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:44,750
Let me... just once.

465
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,792
I'm sorry.

466
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:50,125
So sorry.

467
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:52,708
Don't speak.

468
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,042
Wait.

469
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,708
I'm sorry.

470
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:12,833
Tonight, we continue studying about
the philosopher Plato's Symposium.

471
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,042
Let's recap the last seminar.

472
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:21,500
Phaedrus claims that Eros is
praiseworthy as he was one of

473
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,958
the most ancient gods.

474
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:29,042
Eros is the source of 'goodness'

475
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:34,375
and the most powerful god as
he brings virtue and happiness.

476
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:37,000
In reply to this...

477
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:38,917
Do you want some?

478
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:41,667
I owe you from the school days.

479
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:48,083
- No thanks.
- Joke, idiot.

480
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:52,667
Sleepy?

481
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:56,833
Turn that shit TV off.

482
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:07,333
And today, we learn Aristophanes'
opinion on those three people.

483
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:13,708
In ancient times, there were
three kinds of humans.

484
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:20,167
Man, woman, and
the union of the two,

485
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:25,125
and this kind was called 'Androgynous.'

486
00:57:25,417 --> 00:57:28,458
They had four arms and four legs,

487
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:32,708
two faces and two genitals.

488
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:33,625
¡qAndrogynous¡r

489
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:37,208
Androgynous were ever so arrogant.

490
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:41,833
Eventually they got cut in two by Zeus.

491
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,250
Since then, one desires the other half.

492
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:51,875
The third gender Androgynous,
or hermaphrodite.

493
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,125
What were they?

494
00:57:55,708 --> 00:58:01,333
In this modern age, this gender is long gone.

495
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:06,375
But a gender that consists
of both man and woman

496
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,417
did exist as a form as well as a name.

497
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:16,583
Half-man-half-woman gender
commonly existed in a mythical age.

498
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:19,583
What does this mean?

499
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:24,750
Maybe Mitsuo and I were together as one.

500
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:29,250
And we got cut in two...

501
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:33,167
You're a bit mad.

502
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:40,958
Mitsuo!

503
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,250
That's enough.

504
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:13,708
Yes, Boss.

505
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:18,833
Mitsuo.

506
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,583
Mitsuo.

507
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:23,167
Mitsuo,

508
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,125
you've got your errand boy?

509
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,333
- What's all this?
- No.

510
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,500
- Goddammit!
- Mitsuo!

511
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:36,792
Mitsuo?

512
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,583
You are Mitsuo, too?

513
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,458
Very confusing.

514
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:50,500
The bottom line is, he's been
pinching from the takings.

515
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,625
What?

516
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,000
What's up? Hey...

517
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:03,208
Has he gone?

518
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:09,708
Damn, this is no good.

519
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:15,417
I was relying on him to do a job tomorrow.

520
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,708
You wanna try?

521
01:02:39,542 --> 01:02:40,750
Oh, excuse me.

522
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:46,542
I'm sorry.

523
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:48,625
- Thank you.
- You are welcome

524
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:12,542
Hello?

525
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:13,875
How's it going?

526
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,458
All done.

527
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,208
Where are you now?

528
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,333
I'm at the front.

529
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:20,708
Don't move

530
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:22,750
someone is coming

531
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,792
Mr. Ichikawa.

532
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,792
Having a day off?

533
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,708
Don't run.

534
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:31,583
It's for the job.

535
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:54,917
I bought them earlier.

536
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:02,500
Do you want one?

537
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:10,292
You've got a lot more balls than I thought.

538
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:14,208
Shop while working, huh?

539
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,625
Little something for Mitsuo?

540
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:23,625
You are strange.

541
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:30,583
I'll give you something special

542
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:33,583
as you are a good helper.

543
01:05:35,042 --> 01:05:38,167
A world premier non-cut DVD.

544
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:41,667
An Oscar-worthy masterpiece.

545
01:05:41,792 --> 01:05:44,625
¡qHair cutting ceremony¡r

546
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:10,417
Is it recording?

547
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:14,000
Yep, the red light is on.

548
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:16,250
Okay, all set.

549
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:18,917
I'm so sorry, Mr. Saeki.

550
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:20,583
C'mon stand up!

551
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,875
Don't make a fuss.

552
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,208
Are you crying?

553
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:46,208
What's wrong, eh?

554
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:01,417
Please, Mr. Saeki, let me go!

555
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:03,042
Mr. Saeki!

556
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:05,667
Gimme your arm.

557
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:11,500
Let's start

558
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:13,625
Keep still!

559
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:48,792
C'mon, get up.

560
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:08,500
He is so skinny and weak.

561
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:10,375
Will anyone buy this?

562
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:30,750
Please...

563
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,917
Mr. Saeki.

564
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,833
Hey, look at him. Nice face.

565
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:45,208
You love it, don't ya?

566
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:50,000
Go on, moan like a bitch.

567
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:51,792
Say I want more, baby!

568
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:03,917
Don't let him cum, keep filming.

569
01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:07,625
Oi, Mitsuo.

570
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,042
You wanna cum?

571
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:12,208
Yes.

572
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,958
Go on, say it then.

573
01:10:16,917 --> 01:10:18,458
Please let me... cum.

574
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:33,667
You are a pretty boy, Mitsuo.

575
01:10:58,917 --> 01:11:00,250
Did you watch it?

576
01:11:06,417 --> 01:11:07,583
Yeah, I did.

577
01:11:29,667 --> 01:11:30,917
Mitsuo!

578
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:17,833
Mitsuo...

579
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:29,792
You look awful, man.

580
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,625
I thought you'd die.

581
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:36,500
Water...

582
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,333
I did die.

583
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:03,625
Died once...

584
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:10,042
and revived.

585
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,542
Come closer.

586
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:32,625
More.

587
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:38,083
Closer.

588
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,500
This morning

589
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:38,667
There was a shooting incident
on a Tokyo street.

590
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:44,042
The victim was 47-year-old male,
a member of the Uchida gang family.

591
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:47,292
The shooting started at his apartment

592
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:50,750
and the suspect has not identified yet.

593
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:54,458
Police are searching for
a man who fled the scene...

594
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,625
It's getting messy.

595
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:00,000
Don't get involved.

596
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:00,667
Yes.

597
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:02,708
Sit down, Mitsuo.

598
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,042
Yes, Boss.

599
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,000
Excuse me.

600
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:15,500
You want out, huh?

601
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,250
Out of what?

602
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:21,375
You are not even our member.

603
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,250
All you need to do is fade away.

604
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:27,375
- So...
- I want to end properly.

605
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:32,625
Oh, I see.

606
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,292
Hey, bring it over.

607
01:15:35,417 --> 01:15:36,667
Yes, Boss.

608
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:44,125
I appreciate all the help
you gave me, Mr. Saeki.

609
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:46,167
I really do, but...

610
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:49,917
I want this to end. Period.

611
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,833
You wanna draw a line.

612
01:15:55,917 --> 01:15:57,250
Here you are.

613
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:04,208
Okay, do one last job
for me before you go then.

614
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,083
Easy job for a little part-timer like you.

615
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,417
You don't need to hit anyone.

616
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:27,250
Give them a bit of warning, that's all.

617
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:39,917
- You've got a Japanese car? Lame.
- I think it's cool.

618
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:42,500
Never seen a gangster driving a Lexus.

619
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:44,208
No, it¡¦s so special

620
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,208
I have never seen the gangster
driving a Lexus car

621
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:47,792
That is.

622
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:51,583
What'd ya want?

623
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:56,500
You, dumbass. What are you doing here?

624
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:57,708
This is the Murakawa family's turf!

625
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,625
Get out of here.

626
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:03,000
- Can't you hear me, eh?
- What the fuck you want?

627
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:04,667
Are you deaf?

628
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:05,958
Didn't you hear?

629
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:07,375
Find something to go elsewhere.

630
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,375
I want you to leave soon, have you heard?

631
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,750
Get the fuck out of here!

632
01:17:12,042 --> 01:17:13,250
You fucking with us?

633
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:15,042
Where is...

634
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,292
I got it.

635
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:42,917
Argh!

636
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:45,417
What the hell!

637
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:54,542
They shot me for real.

638
01:19:42,167 --> 01:19:44,083
Hello, Mitsuo?

639
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:46,875
Where are you?

640
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,792
Just got back home, and you?

641
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:55,417
Mitsuo?

642
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:57,500
Never mind.

643
01:19:57,792 --> 01:19:59,083
Mitsuo!

644
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,167
I know you'd come here.

645
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:34,625
You look so pale.

646
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:35,792
Get off!

647
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:38,167
You made a big scene.

648
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,167
- Give it to me.
- Piss off!

649
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:43,833
Don't let that thug exploit you.

650
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:46,125
I'll say you turned yourself in.

651
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:56,208
Mitsuo.

652
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:59,542
Mitsuo!

653
01:21:00,042 --> 01:21:01,375
Mitsuo!

654
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,542
Mitsuo!

655
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:05,958
Your Mitsuo is worried!

656
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:08,292
- Piss off!
- Come on.

657
01:21:08,417 --> 01:21:10,833
I know you're not a bad boy.

658
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,375
That's enough.

659
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,208
Go away...

660
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,583
I told you not to come.

661
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,292
Go away.

662
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,333
Go away!

663
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:22,083
Next,

664
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:25,708
the police announced that Mitsuo Ichikawa
was wanted (Revenge shooting?)

665
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:34,625
on suspicion of attempted murder
and violating gun and sword laws.

666
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:39,083
The suspect who is on the run is also

667
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:44,250
linked to another shooting involving...
(Policeman got shot Critical condition)

668
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:46,125
a policeman in the Shinjuku area.

669
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:48,958
Damn! Where is Mitsuo?

670
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:55,292
Hello?

671
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:56,750
Hey, Doggy.

672
01:22:57,333 --> 01:23:01,292
Your master made such
a mess, we're in trouble.

673
01:23:41,042 --> 01:23:42,333
I found it!

674
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:02,875
Mitsuo...

675
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,500
Calm down, Doggy.

676
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,917
He's on anesthetic.

677
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,333
What did you make him do?

678
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:13,750
He's got shot running away.

679
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,917
He's got shot? Ran away...

680
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:21,000
Geez, he turned it a big thing.

681
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:25,833
What the hell!

682
01:24:29,792 --> 01:24:31,583
It's your fault!

683
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:34,583
Hey, there's a patient here.

684
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:37,583
You all used him, dragged him in...

685
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:39,542
and made him a criminal!

686
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:44,458
That's not true, Doggy.

687
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:48,708
He always

688
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:53,792
belonged to this side of the world.

689
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:02,958
Mitsuo!

690
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,792
Mitsuo!

691
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,750
Mitsuo.

692
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:30,000
Why?

693
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,250
How come he's here?

694
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,583
I asked you not to tell him!

695
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:38,000
Why did you...

696
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,083
Cut that yap yap shit out!

697
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:47,917
You should be grateful to get treated.

698
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:52,458
You wanna end this, yeah?

699
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:02,000
Stay here for a while.

700
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:04,542
Wait for a call.

701
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:09,250
I better go too.

702
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,333
Use the room next door.

703
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:17,125
Thank you.

704
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:24,583
That detective...

705
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:30,625
That detective Dead?

706
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:34,750
Not sure yet.

707
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:39,833
He's dead.

708
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:43,917
I killed him.

709
01:26:44,042 --> 01:26:45,542
Mitsuo, don't worry.

710
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,208
Shut up!

711
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:49,292
I'll kill ya!

712
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:53,042
Go on then.

713
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:57,250
Yeah.

714
01:26:58,542 --> 01:27:00,208
I'm about to.

715
01:27:00,458 --> 01:27:01,625
Hell yeah.

716
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:04,125
Yeah.

717
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:07,042
I'm gonna kill you!

718
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:11,250
I...

719
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:15,542
do...

720
01:27:39,958 --> 01:27:41,042
Hey.

721
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:43,500
Yeah?

722
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:48,458
The story we saw on TV, about the ancients,

723
01:27:50,042 --> 01:27:51,375
remember?

724
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:54,000
Yeah...

725
01:27:57,125 --> 01:28:00,542
Fury gods cut them in half.

726
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:03,958
Since then, each man

727
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:08,250
desires the other half.

728
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:12,292
Longing to be as one.

729
01:28:36,167 --> 01:28:37,417
Mitsuo.

730
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:34,417
Tell me...

731
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:42,833
The two finally got back as one.

732
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:49,000
Then... what now?

733
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:00,333
Two semicircles merged to

734
01:30:03,792 --> 01:30:06,708
form a ball and started to roll.

735
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:29,292
Where do we go from here?

736
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,208
Where can we go?

737
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:20,042
Mitsuo?

738
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:22,875
Mitsuo!

739
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:31,250
Mitsuo...

740
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:40,875
Mitsuo...

741
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:44,708
Why do you always leave me behind?

742
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,750
Hello?

743
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,500
Hi.

744
01:32:18,375 --> 01:32:20,083
Where has he gone?

745
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:22,208
I know you know.

746
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:26,250
He wants you to leave him alone.

747
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:32,000
Is he with you?

748
01:32:34,167 --> 01:32:36,083
I'm afraid not.

749
01:32:37,083 --> 01:32:39,083
Don't you understand, Doggy?

750
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:43,250
He's doing all this just for you.

751
01:32:43,417 --> 01:32:46,917
He's crossed the line,
there's no turning back.

752
01:32:47,042 --> 01:32:50,833
He made a choice not
to get you involved.

753
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:53,000
Understand?

754
01:32:54,042 --> 01:32:55,958
You don't understand.

755
01:32:57,208 --> 01:32:58,583
What?

756
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:03,292
What if I squeal on the
shooting to the police?

757
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:07,500
Are you serious?

758
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,875
I don't intend to do it.

759
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:12,042
The point here is,

760
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:14,333
I can do it if I'm desperate.

761
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:16,792
All I want to know,

762
01:33:18,792 --> 01:33:21,500
is where I can find Mitsuo.

763
01:33:55,167 --> 01:33:56,375
That's him.

764
01:34:05,583 --> 01:34:06,750
It's chilly.

765
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,333
Is that it?

766
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:11,625
Korean poaching boat knows the best route.

767
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,167
You shit!

768
01:34:49,292 --> 01:34:51,333
Piss off! Go away!

769
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:54,583
I said go away!

770
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:40,000
I crossed the line too!

771
01:36:01,042 --> 01:36:02,333
C'mon,

772
01:36:02,458 --> 01:36:04,375
we gotta get going.

773
01:36:43,292 --> 01:36:45,250
I'm Kim from Hwang family.

774
01:36:50,833 --> 01:36:53,500
When we arrive, we'll take a land route.

775
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:56,042
Bear with me.

776
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:59,625
My boss can't wait to meet ya.

777
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:08,125
What did he say?

778
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:11,125
Dunno.

779
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,917
It's swelling.

780
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:25,292
Painkiller.

781
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:27,167
It's yours.

782
01:37:27,292 --> 01:37:28,750
Take it.

783
01:37:41,917 --> 01:37:43,250
You took it?

784
01:37:44,333 --> 01:37:45,583
Yeah.

785
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:53,833
Mitsuo.

786
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:00,875
D'you wanna die with me?
