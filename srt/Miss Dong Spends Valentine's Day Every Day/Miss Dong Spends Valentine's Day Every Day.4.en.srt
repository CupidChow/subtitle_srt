1
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,600
It's okay.

2
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,240
It's okay.

3
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,000
Hey.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,240
Don't move.

5
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,360
You need to keep an eye on him.

6
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,600
I'm fine.

7
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,479
What are you doing?

8
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,810
The doctor is doing this for your own good.

9
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,460
If it weren't for my senior, you would have died.

10
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,100
I didn't ask her to take care of me.

11
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,080
Forget it. Let's go.

12
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,610
Let's go.

13
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,320
Senior.

14
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,120
Wait.

15
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,760
Ah.

16
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,079
Oh, that's the problem.

17
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,810
Your heart beats faster when you get close to him.

18
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,280
My heart beats faster when you get close to me.

19
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,280
This setting seems to have appeared in my novel too.

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,079
[Is he like everyone else?]

21
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,440
Senior.

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,040
Hey. Hey.

23
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,720
It's 4 o'clock.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,000
Let me take you home.

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,680
It's 4 o'clock.

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,760
Gosh.

27
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,079
I want to stay up all night.

28
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,140
Maybe we can escape the circulation.

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,600
Why don't we have breakfast?

30
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,160
Sure. Where?

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Is it okay next to the hospital?

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,480
Okay.

33
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
Hey, senior.

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,960
Why am I back?

35
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,050
You promised to hold on until the morning.

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,010
Is it okay next to the hospital?

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,930
Happy Valentine's Day. Got it.

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,080
Hey, do me a favor.

39
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,880
What is it?

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,400
Hey.

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,320
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll be responsible for you.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,330
Be responsible for him.

44
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,360
Next to the hospital.

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
Next to the hospital.

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
Next to the hospital.

47
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,170
You, do you think I still have a chance?

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,160
Have you forgotten the rules?

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,880
Don't say anything. Let him choose.

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,600
Right.

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,160
I dropped my flower.

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,120
Can you pass it to me?

54
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,240
Excuse me.

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,500
I have an appointment.

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Wei Wei.

57
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,180
You still remember me.

58
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,770
Then who did you choose?

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,440
Whatever.

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
I don't know.

61
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,620
I felt like I was waiting for someone.

62
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,840
I shouted out when you came.

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,280
That's great.

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,220
You're the only person who can remember me here.

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,320
Let's eat first.

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,959
OK

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Why is it so spicy

68
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,360
Call your chef here

69
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,240
Who told you to put so much chili in this steak?

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,360
Sorry, miss.

71
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,159
This is our VVVIP card.

72
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,680
It'll be free when you come.

73
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,000
You don't have to be so polite

74
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,560
I just got inspiration when I saw you

75
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,280
I wonder if I'm honored

76
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,480
to invite you to my dinner party tonight. Run!

77
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
Give me a chance to apologize.

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,340
Is this how you apologize?

79
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,000
Wei Wei.

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,480
I dirtied your clothes.

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,400
I have to be responsible for you.

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,280
Are you crazy?

83
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,680
You stained his clothes.

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,960
I made you coffee.

85
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,280
Can I have your number?

86
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
What do you think?

87
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,840
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,280
This is my boyfriend.

89
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Is he an adult?

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,200
Come with me to the police station.

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,800
Check it out.

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,560
Hey.

93
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,600
It's more tiring

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
is more tiring than working.

95
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,680
Why aren't you in the elevator today?

96
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,240
Wait.

97
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,159
I want to see if there's anything wrong with him.

98
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,140
What are you afraid of?

99
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Aren't you a pervert stalker?

100
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,720
No.

101
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,160
I'm afraid of you.

102
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,400
Are you afraid that your heart will beat faster

103
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,680
and cause a heart attack?

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,720
You got the wrong person.

105
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
Tell me if you are my memory from yesterday.

106
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

107
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,200
Then don't blame me.

108
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,600
Let's kiss.

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Ah.

110
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,960
You've been playing for a long time.

111
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,760
What?

112
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,480
Are you serious?

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,960
Darn it.

114
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,480
When will this end?

115
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm going to work overtime.

116
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,280
Workers don't have love.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,680
Don't give me your blessings.

118
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,360
I'm a part-timer. I don't care

119
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
I don't care.

120
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,360
I need to work.

121
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,440
Haha, it's finally quiet.

122
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,480
Dong Wei Wei.

123
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,480
Boss, I'm here to work overtime.

124
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,760
Why are you working overtime on Valentine's Day?

125
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,040
You should go on a date too.

126
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,160
No, boss.

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,320
I really want to work overtime.

128
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,960
Please let me work.

129
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,240
Sure.

130
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,040
We have a big client today.

131
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,120
Please treat them well.

132
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,760
Okay.

133
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,640
Hey.

134
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,400
Wait, boss.

135
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,480
Is the big client you mentioned a man?

136
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,440
Yes.

137
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,760
Handsome CEO.

138
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,960
Of course.

139
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,240
Ah.

140
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,080
Pervert stalker.

141
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,440
That's how you treat Party A.

142
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,160
I can terminate the contract

144
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,080
I can terminate the contract.

145
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,160
Whatever.

146
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,960
We'll restart tomorrow anyway.

147
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,080
Reboot?

148
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

149
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,800
It's Valentine's Day when I wake up every day.

150
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
There's no tomorrow in my world.

151
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,240
Forget it. You won't believe anything I say anyway.

152
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,120
Is writing a novel stressful?

153
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,520
Humph.

154
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,419
You just said my brain is Watt.

155
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,840
Maybe you've watched too many movies lately.

156
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,200
I advise you

157
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,260
watch less movies.

158
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,610
It's easy to overthink.

159
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,000
And movies make you doubt this world.

160
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,440
That's not good.

161
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you.

162
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,680
Pick the coriander.

163
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,440
Why?

164
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Your boss wants you to treat me well.

165
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,040
Okay.

166
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,640
Handsome.

167
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,400
Give me a plate of coriander.

168
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,960
Enjoy.

169
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,760
Thank you.

170
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,160
Is this how you treat me?

171
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,160
That's right. This is how I treat guests.

172
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,800
You can ask someone else to keep you company.

173
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,400
Humph.

174
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,080
What?

175
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,960
Hey.

176
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,900
I'm not eating.

177
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,320
Why is she here again?

178
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,320
Even a hamster can escape.

179
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,000
I also want to break free from my fate.

180
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,680
Dong Wei, Sun Qianling,

181
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,000
Lin Mochen, Yao, Rui.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,320
Yuyu. Yuyu. Yuyu.

183
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,640
Jia Xinyu.

184
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,480
Liang, you.

185
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,900
Jack Wang, Chang, Kai.

186
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:08,880
Special actor.

187
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,200
Xiao Jie, Ma Huixiang.

188
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,520
[Flower shop boy, Hwang, Kim]

189
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:09,840
Doctor in Cardiology, Yoo Ji-kyung.

190
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,160
Pilot Hui.

191
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,440
Lawyer Ye Gengyun.

192
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,760
