1
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,759
Is Kang-woo a PC?

2
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,160
Aren't you a NPC?

3
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,960
Wei Wei.

4
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,520
You're just like them.

5
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,440
Do you think I'm a PC?

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,930
What do you mean?

7
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Lin Mochen, stop!

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,800
Jiang Yu!

9
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,840
Let go of me.

10
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,479
Let go.

11
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,560
How did this happen?

12
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,640
Do you know hate comes from love?

13
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Okay.

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,680
Let's end it here.

15
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Reboot!

16
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,880
Still in the game.

17
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,610
Where is Lin Mochen?

18
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Sorry.

19
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,860
The number you dialed is not in the service area.

20
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,040
Tell me.

21
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,560
What's the password?

22
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,700
It's not Dong Wei Wei's birthday,

23
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,079
nor your birthday.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,440
or any point of your life.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,680
Tell me.

26
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,160
What is the password?

27
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,000
Aren't you AI?

28
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,079
Aren't you good at calculating?

29
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,600
Lin Mochen.

30
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200
You are a liar.

31
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Who are you to be with her?

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why?

33
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,660
Because I love her.

34
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,720
She loves me.

35
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,360
She loves you.

36
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,480
Lin Mochen.

37
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,680
If it weren't for you,

38
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,440
I would have married her.

39
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,200
It was me.

40
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,640
If

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,080
she loves you,

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,880
I quit.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Haha.

44
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,120
You quit.

45
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,040
Lin Mochen.

46
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,000
Why didn't you say that

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Why didn't you say that?

48
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,360
Why?

49
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,480
Lin Mochen, wait for me!

50
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,000
We can definitely get out.

51
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,760
I have no feelings.

52
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,640
Don't be so full of yourself.

53
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,240
I've finished all human emotions learning.

54
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,480
I'm no longer an ordinary NPC.

55
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,600
Warning.

56
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,080
Someone is approaching.

57
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Someone is approaching.

58
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,480
Wei Wei.

59
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,360
Wei Wei.

60
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,440
Wei Wei.

61
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,040
Acting.

62
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,260
Hypocritical.

63
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,480
Did you learn it from humans?

64
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
I learned it from you.

65
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,400
Are you so willing to let me go?

66
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,640
I have the box.

67
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
The password is also in your memory.

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,330
As long as you remember,

69
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,040
I can read

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,960
Lin Mochen.

71
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,960
Lin Mochen.

72
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,080
Wei Wei.

73
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
Dong Wei Wei.

74
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,080
Lin Mochen.

75
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,640
Lin Mo Chen.

76
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,200
Lin Mochen.

77
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,840
The rabbit is still there.

78
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,140
The rabbit is still there.

79
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,920
Back then, I also played this rabbit.

80
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,000
By the way,

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,320
someone

82
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,040
It's...

83
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,970
It's really you.

84
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,680
What?

85
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,480
Lin Mochen.

86
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,040
You...

87
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,480
What happened to you?

88
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,360
What happened to you?

89
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
Say something.

90
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,440
What happened to you?

91
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,080
Say something.

92
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,300
Did Kang-woo do it?

93
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,520
By the way, what did you just say?

94
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,160
It's really you.

95
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,400
What do you mean?

96
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,200
Well,

97
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,930
Maybe we've met a long time ago.

98
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,799
I'm going to file a complaint.

99
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,679
It was you.

100
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,280
You scared me to death that day.

101
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,480
Mr. Lin.

102
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,480
How is your game company going?

103
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,240
Almost.

104
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,720
You have to call me Mr. Lin.

105
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,960
Mr. Lin.

106
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,440
Hello, Mr. Lin. Hello, Mr. Lin.

107
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,300
Hello, Mr. Lin.

108
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,890
I heard that we're going to play an immersive VR game.

109
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,640
Won Woo-joo?

110
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,360
Yes.

111
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,640
especially for female users.

112
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
love and love.

113
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,360
Let them enjoy the game.

114
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,840
Isn't it marketable?

115
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,200
Shouldn't you ask her

116
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
what she likes.

117
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,970
Do you want to ask me?

118
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,000
What does she like?

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,920
Love Castle.

120
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,120
Pink bubbles.

121
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,040
and fluffy toys.

122
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
What is this?

123
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,520
Did I offend you?

124
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,900
Open your mind.

125
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
Don't be prejudiced.

126
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,360
What, boss? Louder.

127
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm thinking.

128
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,400
and less prejudice.

129
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,840
Hey, why are you eavesdropping?

130
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,280
Yeah.

131
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,600
What I said just now

132
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,730
what I said just now?

133
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
It's not that easy.

134
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,640
Are you a game player?

135
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,240
You're a balloon seller.

136
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,080
Work hard.

137
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,840
What are you eavesdropping?

138
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,720
I'm giving you some advice.

139
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,240
Business is business.

140
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,170
Don't be so full of yourself, okay?

141
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,640
Do you know how many nights

142
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,160
for this game?

143
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,840
You said I was arrogant.

144
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,700
What about you?

145
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,520
No, boss.

146
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,940
You've never met a girl, have you?

147
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,040
I...

148
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,420
I want to file a complaint.

149
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,440
Hey, I'll file a complaint.

150
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,160
Complaint?

151
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,680
Why did you file a complaint?

152
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,240
Didn't you say that?

153
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,120
I was just saying.

154
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,760
I was just angry.

155
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
I just can't stand

156
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
to be nosy.

157
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,440
It's so hot.

158
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,120
It's not easy for a girl

159
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,040
for a girl.

160
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,440
Are you waiting for her here?

161
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,540
You should at least apologize to her.

162
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,160
Let's go.

163
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,240
It's melting.

164
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,840
Let's go.

165
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,160
Let's go.

166
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,970
I didn't apologize to you that day.

167
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,240
I'll make it up today.

168
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,800
That day, I thought

169
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,960
I must make this game

170
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
to prove it to you.

171
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,080
You did it.

172
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,680
Actually, I didn't.

173
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,240
After all, I hurt you so much.

174
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,000
But

175
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,800
you're different now.

176
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
You're quite the same as before.

177
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,800
Gosh.

178
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,320
I didn't expect

179
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,680
I met you in the end.

180
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,200
I've studied so many data.

181
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,320
I couldn't have met you earlier.

182
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,760
So this playground program has bugs.

183
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
Is it because you're new?

184
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,120
Maybe because

185
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,280
lack of emotions.

186
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,520
So it's not perfect no matter how I write it.

187
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,720
Emotions.

188
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,410
For example, Kang-woo.

189
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,010
his feelings for you were fluctuated.

190
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,560
That's why he evolved.

191
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,160
Password. I got it.

192
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,280
Actor Form.

193
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,600
Dong Wei Wei, Sun Qianling.

194
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,960
Lin Mochen Yao Rui

195
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,560
