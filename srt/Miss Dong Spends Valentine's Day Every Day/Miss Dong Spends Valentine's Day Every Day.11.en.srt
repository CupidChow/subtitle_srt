1
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,520
Right? It's you.

2
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,440
Do we know each other?

3
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,320
Yes.

4
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,200
Are you free later?

5
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,280
Of course. Where are we going?

6
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,240
Marriage.

7
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,120
What? Marriage?

8
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,759
One.

9
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,200
Yes, I said to get married to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,120
Marriage?

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,100
Lou Qin.

12
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,360
Why is the red light so long today?

13
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,890
It's the sixth one already.

14
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,970
This is a test of our sincerity.

15
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,199
Let's take a taxi.

16
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,200
Wait, slow down.

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Sir.

18
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,040
Come here.

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,200
Sir.

20
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,160
Hey.

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,640
Hey, sir.

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,120
Hello

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,600
Sir.

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,200
No

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,200
Gosh.

26
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,880
Hey.

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,780
Lin Mochen.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,720
Get in, Jiang Yu.

29
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,200
Okay.

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,400
Is this appropriate?

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,880
I used your car.

32
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,000
Am I your driver?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,800
Can you drive?

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,000
Where are you going?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,840
Civil Affairs Bureau.

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,560
No.

37
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,360
Hey.

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,120
Hey.

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,360
Gosh.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,960
Are you sure you want to do this?

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,680
Yes.

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,520
It says

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,880
it takes more than three hours to get stuck in traffic.

44
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,400
Run.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,400
Ah

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,280
Run!

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,920
I'm still late.

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,160
What should I do?

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,960
It's weird.

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,280
It's like

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,010
deliberately set up a barrier.

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Did someone stop us from getting married?

53
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
The harder, the more like a test.

54
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,520
I must

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,600
I must get married.

56
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,000
Come back tomorrow.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,960
But tomorrow, you might...

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,000
forget it.

59
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,320
I won't forget.

60
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,340
How about this?

61
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,500
We'll get married tomorrow morning.

62
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,680
may not work.

63
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
Try it.

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,360
Ah.

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,240
Let's go.

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,280
Get married.

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,600
I wonder if Kang-woo

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,660
if Kang-woo still remembers what happened yesterday.

69
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,280
Think about it.

70
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,520
Come on.

71
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,100
Why do I keep having these dreams lately?

72
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,800
I think I often see someone in my dreams.

73
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,440
Kang-woo.

74
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,770
[Come get married tomorrow morning.]

75
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Wei Wei.

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,240
Kang-woo.

77
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,690
Do you really remember?

78
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,560
I don't know.

79
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,760
I heard a voice telling me to come and get married.

80
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,560
Great.

81
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,480
Here.

82
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,720
Why is the camera broken?

83
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,200
What?

84
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,520
The camera is broken.

85
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,240
Do you only have one camera here?

86
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,570
This is the only camera.

87
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
Kang-woo.

88
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,200
Wei Wei.

89
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,720
Hey.

90
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,440
Look at the camera.

91
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,560
Oh.

92
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,820
The machine is broken.

93
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,840
How about

94
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,970
come back tomorrow?

95
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,520
It's just a ceremony.

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,980
Let's change another one.

97
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,440
Sure.

98
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,800
Ta-da.

99
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,560
Hurry up.

100
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,640
We're almost off work.

101
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,880
I'm coming.

102
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,840
Who are you?

103
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,760
Kang-woo.

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,440
Ah, Mr. Jiang Yu,

105
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,400
will you marry Dong Wei Wei and Dong Wei Wei?

106
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,080
Be it poverty or wealth,

107
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,480
health or sickness,

108
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,480
forever?

109
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,530
He needs emergency treatment.

110
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,120
Wait.

111
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm a professional.

112
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,200
Let me do it.

113
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,720
You're a part-timer.

114
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,720
Wow.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,760
Okay.

116
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
It should be fine.

117
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,480
But I'll be off work in two minutes.

118
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,200
No, I'm not married yet.

119
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,920
As a professional doctor,

120
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,800
he won't wake up soon.

121
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,480
Well...

122
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,560
can we hold the ceremony first?

123
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,280
We really love each other.

124
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,880
Really?

125
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,520
You can fool me,

126
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,120
but you can't fool yourself.

127
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
Really? I object.

128
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,000
Lin Mochen.

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,480
I remember.

130
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,400
What do you remember?

131
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,160
I remember what I wanted to tell you that day.

132
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,960
Something romantic.

133
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,210
What did you say?

134
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Romantic words.

135
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,400
It's too late.

136
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,560
We're almost off work.

137
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
It's okay. It's just a process.

138
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
It's not true.

139
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,720
That was a rehearsal.

140
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,720
Your true love is here.

141
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,880
Come on.

142
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,600
I, Lin Mochen, am willing to marry Miss Dong Wei Wei.

143
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,920
No matter she's poor or poor,

144
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,880
I do. I do.

145
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,400
Next,

146
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,900
Change the ring first.

147
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,540
Don't you have one?

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,730
I brought it.

149
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,600
The groom can kiss your bride.

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
The last step of the ceremony.

151
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,600
This.

152
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,160
If we can escape the circulation,

153
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,760
Open your mind.

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,000
You're lucky.

155
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,400
Let me take a photo with you.

156
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,740
You don't need to get off work now.

157
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,920
No need.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,160
I don't think Miss Dong wants to do it.

159
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,680
Maybe Mr. Lin doesn't want to.

160
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
You can tell me if you want to.

161
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
Who wants to take a photo with you?

162
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,720
Did you just say that?

163
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,280
Stop fighting.

164
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,400
Newlyweds.

165
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,120
Let's take a photo together.

166
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,320
Come closer.

167
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,680
Come on. Three, two, one.

168
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,920
