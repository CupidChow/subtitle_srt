1
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,360
It's going online soon.

2
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,880
Can’t you even think of an attractive slogan?

3
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,009
Mr. Jiang, you've denied all of these.

4
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,479
Lin Mochen, let's see how long you can be proud of.

5
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,240
When will this date end?

6
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,120
Hey.

7
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,760
What kind of boys do girls like?

8
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,000
It must be you.

9
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,840
Handsome and rich.

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,280
Who told you to make an objective statement?

11
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,760
Answer my question.

12
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,680
No.

13
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,880
Why do you want to ask this today?

14
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Are you trapped in love?

15
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,079
Can you answer the question?

16
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,720
Ah.

17
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,840
Who is it?

18
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,079
Dong Wei Wei.

19
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,640
How is that possible?

20
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
Oh.

21
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,520
Yes.

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
You're double-faced.

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,600
Do you like her?

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,280
Humph.

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,200
Dong Wei Wei.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
How is that possible?

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,760
[Laughing]

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,560
There's no reason for love.

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,079
Humph.

30
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,680
What you just said

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,560
this red rose.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
It's too vulgar.

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,400
It's tacky, but it's useful.

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,160
If we have more,

36
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,760
The sky is full of stars.

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,080
Is this pretty?

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,200
The meaning of stars is that I'm willing to be an extra.

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,640
It means to protect the one you love silently.

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,770
It's very romantic.

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,600
Why should I be an extra?

42
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,520
Is that the point?

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,880
Just listen to me.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,760
Joon-sung.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,920
Joon-sung.

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,000
Hey.

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,200
Do you know what stars symbolize?

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,120
Yes.

49
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,960
Ah.

50
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,640
Did the stars save your life?

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,480
It's tacky, okay?

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,720
I shouldn't have listened to him.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,660
You're willing to be an extra.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,160
Don't be so emotional.

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,360
What kind of flower do you like?

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Himawari.

57
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,280
It's sunny.

58
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,680
It's also very romantic.

59
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,880
Okay, I got it.

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,480
Why did you suddenly give me flowers today?

61
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,960
I followed you and had a crush on you.

62
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,160
Why didn't you give me a ride before?

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,920
I'm in a good mood today.

64
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,160
You're not in the circulation, are you?

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,800
No one else will change

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
You're the only one who's changing.

67
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,840
You helped me out yesterday.

68
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,959
Miss.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't seem to understand what you're talking about.

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,680
Every time I meet him,

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,280
time will restart for no reason.

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
No, I have to find out.

73
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
That's not right.

74
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,880
Lin Mochen used to follow me.

75
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,280
How can I find him?

76
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,960
I know who you're looking for.

77
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Follow me.

78
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
Why should I trust you?

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,290
You don't trust me? Do you trust these men?

80
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,560
Then send me to get a skirt first.

81
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,880
Why did you bring me here?

82
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,960
Do you think

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,890
a little mental problem recently?

84
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,240
It's not my problem.

85
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
This world is the problem.

86
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,400
Do you think the world is repeating every day?

87
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,400
You're just too nervous.

88
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,600
Relax and enjoy life.

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,280
No, no, no.

90
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,640
I don't want to enjoy it anymore.

91
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,680
This time is different.

92
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,960
I've prepared a few great handsome guys for you.

93
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,720
Don't.

94
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,720
I'm going to throw up.

95
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,240
That's it.

96
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Lin Mochen.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,720
Oh.

98
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,760
Sorry.

99
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,640
It's okay.

100
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,360
Are you stained?

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,280
I'm fine.

102
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,880
I'm really fine.

103
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,440
Hey.

104
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,040
What are you doing?

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
Take off your clothes.

106
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:06,800
What?

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,960
Do you need my help?

108
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,040
Hey.

109
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,640
What are you doing?

110
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,160
Don't be nervous.

111
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,600
I've prepared something better for you.

112
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
No.

113
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Wait.

114
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,640
No.

115
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,800
Wait a minute.

116
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,240
I...

117
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,040
Hey.

118
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,080
Open the door!

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,480
Darn it.

120
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,040
Where did this woman

121
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,600
took Dong Wei Wei?

122
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,200
Why are you here?

123
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,320
I'm worried about her too.

124
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,200
Can't I?

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Guys,

126
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,680
I hid Dong Wei Wei.

127
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,240
In these rooms,

128
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,040
Whoever finds it first will get it.

129
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,410
There must be more than 100 rooms here.

130
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,640
It depends on your fate.

131
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,200
What do you want?

132
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,480
I advise you to hurry up.

133
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,800
Be careful

134
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,930
she'll fall in love with someone else.

135
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,080
You deserve that she doesn't like you.

136
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
What were you doing earlier?

137
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,280
Hey, where is the surveillance room?

138
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,409
The negative floor.

139
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,040
Hey.

140
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,720
Whose prank is this?

141
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,560
But he's really fast.

142
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,120
Have you seen these two ladies?

143
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,840
Which room are they in?

144
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,840
We can't tell you this.

145
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,120
Please.

146
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
This is really important to me.

147
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,760
Sorry, we have rules here.

148
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Please.

149
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,480
Pretty lady.

150
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,400
I swear I'm not a bad person.

151
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Please help me.

152
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,240
Sister.

153
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,200
Please.

154
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,360
Sister.

155
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,840
Okay.

156
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,800
Thank you.

157
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,200
Hello bro

158
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,360
Hey.

159
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,440
Excuse me.

160
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,360
Do you have the CCTV from half an hour ago?

161
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,320
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,039
The CCTV has been broken for a long time.

163
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,640
No.

164
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,360
This is a serious violation.

165
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,960
Are you looking for someone?

166
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,600
Ask the receptionist.

167
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,080
I...

168
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
I can do this.

169
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,320
Oh.

170
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Wei Wei.

171
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,600
Wei Wei.

172
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,840
Wei Wei.

173
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,560
Wei Wei.

174
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,800
Oh.

175
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,120
Sorry.

176
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,840
It's the wrong way.

177
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
Lin Mochen.

178
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
Isn't the door locked?

179
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
How did you get in?

180
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,400
Oh, well...

181
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,880
There's no one else here

182
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,640
The door is broken.

183
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,000
Who else could it be?

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,440
Well...

185
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,100
What about that woman?

186
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
I don't know.

187
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,880
Okay, I'll see if you're safe.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm leaving.

189
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,480
Hey.

190
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,160
Where are you going?

191
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,240
The door is broken.

192
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,120
No.

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,520
Why is the door broken?

194
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,440
No, brother.
