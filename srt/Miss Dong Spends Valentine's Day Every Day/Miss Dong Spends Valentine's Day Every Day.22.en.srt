1
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
Did you find Bug?

2
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,520
I've been observing all the way.

3
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,720
There's no sign.

4
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
I walked 36,000 steps today.

5
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,620
but I couldn't find it.

6
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,090
They didn't find anything either.

7
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,120
Wait.

8
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,289
Why is the amusement park gone?

9
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
It's really gone.

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,120
But I've been there before.

11
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,560
Could it be...

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,600
the man in black has hacked into the city planning bureau?

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,759
Is the amusement park

14
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,039
in the game?

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,720
Let's go and have a look.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,120
If the amusement park is still there,

17
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,759
the biggest bug is in the amusement park.

18
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,960
A bug that can't even find the man in black.

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,400
So before the bug is resolved,

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,680
he will erase the amusement park from the map

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,010
so that we won't find it.

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,560
Smart.

23
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,280
Really.

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,360
If this bug

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,220
is really in this amusement park,

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,329
I don't know if I should be happy or sad.

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,280
Why?

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,960
Because this amusement park

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,600
is the first program I wrote.

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,860
It's just some changes later.

31
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,240
Then Bug will be your savior.

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's go.

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,200
You set this up too?

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't think so.

35
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,240
Hey.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,079
Our last couple is here too.

37
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,480
Well,

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,410
our super battle on Valentine's Day will begin soon.

39
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,360
Can we skip this?

40
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,400
No.

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,800
The rule of the amusement park today is

42
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,040
to enter the park through all barriers.

43
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,080
What are you waiting for?

44
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,240
Let's get started.

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,920
We don't know what will happen tomorrow.

46
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,780
Now let's start our first battle.

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,400
Cover your eyes and feed the red-sugar rice cake.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,520
Finish it in three minutes.

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,680
Lin Mochen made me suffer so much.

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,040
It's time to tease him.

51
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,800
On your mark.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,600
Three, two, one, go.

53
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,560
Aha

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,320
I'm sorry, honey.

55
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,160
Remember.

56
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,690
You'll be eliminated if you take off the mask.

57
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,800
Time's up.

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
You can take off your eyeshades now.

59
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,960
[Laughing]

60
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,290
Did you do it on purpose?

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,520
No.

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm confident in your game ability.

63
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,280
Next, hold the badminton.

64
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,560
The loser will be eliminated.

65
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,000
The loser will be eliminated.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,800
I'll use my left hand.

67
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,520
Hey.

68
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,050
Who are you looking down on?

69
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,760
Heart bumping.

70
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,220
Can you use your left hand?

71
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,329
I was left-handed when I was young.

72
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,800
Here.

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,800
Okay.

74
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,640
I'll do it.

75
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,600
Oh, yeah! The killer!

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,360
Next game, 30 seconds of heartbeat.

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,080
Only 30 seconds

78
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,720
in 30 seconds

79
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,520
can pass.

80
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,260
What are you doing?

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,400
Put your hand on my heart.

82
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,440
Maybe the second is more accurate.

83
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,159
Action.

84
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,460
Don't leave anything behind.

85
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,280
It's so delicious.

86
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
I'm so touched.

87
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,720
I think my arm is cramping.

88
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,560
Congratulations to this couple.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,640
Not a second less.

90
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,840
I feel

91
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
This 30 seconds

92
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
Like a lifetime

93
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,680
Congratulations.

94
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,080
You are the only couple who cleared the stage.

95
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,880
Now enter the garden.

96
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,320
Enjoy your night

97
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,920
This is not the time to talk about this.

98
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,840
Let's split up.

99
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,460
Let's go together.

100
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,200
Hey, little rabbit.

101
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,840
Hey.

102
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,440
It's bug.

103
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,240
What about the black suitcase?

104
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,440
It seems that the black suitcase is in this room.

105
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,159
Let's go in.

106
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,760
Yes.

107
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,880
Oops.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,320
Why can't I get in

109
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,440
[Laughing]

110
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,640
Gosh.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,560
Looks like we have to find a way

112
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,880
to open this lock.

113
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,760
Like this.

114
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,640
I'll go find the tools.

115
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
Wait here.

116
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,640
You're here.

117
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,440
I've been looking for you.

118
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,560
Kang-woo.

119
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,320
You came at the right time.

120
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,040
It's locked.

121
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,840
Give me a hand.

122
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,640
No need.

123
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Let me.

124
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,240
I'll help too.

125
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,960
It's rusty.

126
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,360
Okay.

127
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,040
I said I don't need you.

128
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,320
Can't you hear me?

129
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,080
Lin Mochen, are you jealous?

130
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,440
Jealous?

131
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,800
Why would I be jealous?

132
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,320
Let me ask you.

133
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,720
Do you trust me or him?

134
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,800
Does it have anything to do with you and him?

135
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Why not?

136
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
I said I don't need him.

137
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,640
He just wanted to help.

138
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,120
He wants... I said I...

139
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,680
All right.

140
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,480
I don't want to quarrel with you.

141
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,920
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,700
I don't want to do this either.

143
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,200
What are you doing?

144
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,360
I'll help.

145
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,520
I don't need you to fix bug.

146
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,800
But I'm a scientific computer student.

147
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,640
Have you forgotten?

148
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,280
What are you doing today?

149
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,040
No.

150
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,170
I suspect Kang-woo.

151
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,480
Kang-woo.

152
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,560
Kang-woo.

153
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,720

154
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,680
Kang-woo.

155
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,680
Come out!

156
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,280
Kang-woo.

157
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,800
I was right.

158
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
The man in black is Kang-woo.

159
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,640
Kang-woo!

160
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,800

161
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,760

162
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,720
Come out.
