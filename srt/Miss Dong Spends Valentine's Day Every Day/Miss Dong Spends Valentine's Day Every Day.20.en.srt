1
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
We've cleared the stage.

2
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,720
The game has been changed.

3
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,520
Attention.

4
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,400
The game settings have been changed.

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,560
Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin.

6
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,440
Can you hear me?

7
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,120
Yes.

8
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,520
There's someone else in the game.

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,960
Anyway, don't order.

10
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,080
End the exit button.

11
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,880
That's a trap.

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,410
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,640
Who is he?

14
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
We couldn't find him.

15
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,080
That person.

16
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,120
I don't know how

17
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,160
to become the master of the game.

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,280
We suspect that...

19
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
What's wrong?

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,079
Hey no

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,520
Hey, no!

22
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,360
How's the preparation for the press conference?

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,240
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

24
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
before they do.

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Lin Mochen hasn't made a move yet.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,960
We can definitely

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,690
launch the game before he does.

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,840
Mr. Lin is busy

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,040
is busy coaxing his little girlfriend.

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Welcome, reporters.

31
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,720
Dear colleagues, welcome to this game press conference.

32
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,640
[When Sweet]

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,880
using the latest Yuan Woo Tech.

34
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,880
AI automatic production.

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,280
to bring the most vivid

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,760
for every girl.

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,880
Liang You, don't be proud.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,880
Call security.

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,600
Wake up.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
You're still in the game.

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,060
Security! Where is the security?

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,780
She doesn't believe she's still in the game.

44
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,920
She'll believe it soon.

45
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,000
Liang You, you plagiarized someone else's game

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,240
and seduced my boyfriend in private.

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm going to kill you!

48
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,620
Don't hurt Yuu-yu. That's funny.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,960
I'll protect you.

50
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,720
Let me do it.

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,570
How is it? Do you believe me now?

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,360
Mine.

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,760
Yoyo.

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,720
Shengyou.

55
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,280
Shengyou.

56
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,800
Shengyou.

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,480
Mr. Lin.

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,440
I didn't expect that there are so many bugs

59
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,720
in your game.

60
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,920
We shouldn't be thinking about this.

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,040
We should think about how to get out of here.

62
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,320
What?

63
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,480
It must be because you have too many bugs in the game.

64
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,000
because you have too many bugs in the game.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,120
Who told you to do the beta test so quickly?

66
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,640
You copied the bug well too.

67
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,680
Last time we were on the Ferris wheel because of bug.

68
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,480
That's right.

69
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,600
But some idiots

70
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,530
can't tell the difference between game and reality.

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,840
It's all because of him.

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,200
He got me.

73
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,200
Who?

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,880
Tell me.

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,600
We're in the same boat now.

76
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,320
If you don't tell us,

77
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,450
if you don't tell us?

78
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,240
Are you still thinking about my game?

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,560
That person...

80
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,840
I didn't see his face.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,240
I need your hairpin.

82
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,960
This is the highest authority to control the game.

83
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,420
Why should I give it to you?

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,170
You've been in the game for so long.

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,280
you've learned nothing.

86
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,520
Do you know what's the most expensive thing in this game?

87
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,280
It's the sweet plot.

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,159
You're wrong.

89
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,159
Every NPC in the game

90
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,159
is an independent AI.

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,760
They will choose

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,040
and their reactions

93
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,360
and their reactions.

94
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,740
It's not arranged in advance.

95
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
You can also give me this technique.

96
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,940
Who are you trying to coax?

97
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,000
Isn't this my game skin?

98
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,400
He's not just a skin now.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,840
How is it?

100
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,440
Do you believe it now?

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,890
You'll soon become the invisible master of the game.

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,480
Who are you?

103
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,280
As long as you let me control the game,

104
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,920
I can give you AI technology right away.

105
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,840
But I want you to control it for me.

106
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,520
Lin Mochen.

107
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,440
That's easy.

108
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,300
When did it happen?

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,440
I've been in the game for so long.

110
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,600
I feel dizzy.

111
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
How can I remember?

112
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,080
So,

113
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
you give him the privilege

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
to him.

115
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,080
and let him control the game.

116
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,840
right?

117
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,800
That man in black doesn't have the spirit of contract.

118
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,680
He even controls me in the game.

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,880
That means

120
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,480
the one we saw last time

121
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,640
can go up and down

122
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,600
and invincible.

123
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,130
because of the skill given by the man in black.

124
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,159
Hey!

125
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,360
At this time,

126
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,640
still flirting with men?

127
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,960
If it weren't for me,

128
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,120
You don't know your bug

129
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,520
has been fixed, right?

130
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,960
Gosh, the wall is back to normal.

131
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,120
Bug is fixed.

132
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,760
The AI nowadays

133
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,880
are so smart.

134
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
Too fast.

135
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,320
Is this man in black also at the venue?

136
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,880
Why did the man in black fix the bugs?

137
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,680
He shouldn't let the more bugs, the better.

138
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,240
He's a bad guy anyway.

139
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
Unless...

140
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,840
Unless this loophole can let us escape.

141
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,920
I didn't expect the bug in your game

142
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,360
in your game.

143
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,040
Oh, I see.

144
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,440
In other words,

145
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,920
we need to find Bug

146
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,120
we'll find Bug first.

147
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,320
we can escape.

148
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,120
Smart.

149
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,960
But how do we find

150
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,890
how do we find it?

151
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,440
We can't try our luck.

152
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,920
When I designed this game,

153
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,520
for the convenience of the city,

154
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,000
I set up a city planning bureau.

155
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,120
There are all kinds of strange things

156
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,040
in this city.

157
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,320
But the images

158
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,360
and data

159
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,680
are in the hands of the city planners.

160
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,320
He's a very responsible PC.

161
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,050
He won't show it to our players.

162
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,080
Then steal it.

163
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
I'll seduce him.

164
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,640
Okay.

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,720
No.

166
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,960
I don't trust you.

167
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,080
Darn it.

168
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
No.

169
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
Wei Wei.

170
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,300
The door is not locked.

171
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,360
You are...

172
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,760
Well...

173
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,840
I have something

174
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,480
I need your help.

175
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,280
Ah.

176
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I just saw a faceless man.

177
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,160
It's really scary.

178
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
Yeah, that's not my business.

179
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,520
But aren't you a city planner?

180
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,520
Hi, I'm only responsible for the building on the map.

181
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,080
Yes.

182
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
It's a building.

183
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
There's a building

184
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,360
He's a man with no face.

185
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm scared to death.

186
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,120
Don't cry.

187
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,370
I'm afraid of girls crying.

188
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,480
If you keep crying,

189
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,880
I'll be sad, baby.

190
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,240
Ahem.

191
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,080
What's wrong?

192
