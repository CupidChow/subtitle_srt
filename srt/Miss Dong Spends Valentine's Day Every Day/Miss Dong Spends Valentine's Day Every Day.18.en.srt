1
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,640
Try one

2
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,880
It tastes good

3
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,080
It's really good.

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,080
Oh scan the QR code

5
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,479
You can get a box for free.

6
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,039
Wait.

7
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,080
Is this

8
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,039
your personal WeChat?

9
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,479
Today is White Day.

10
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,520
If you eat my chocolate,

11
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,000
you have to get my love.

12
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,760
You set me up.

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,200
Hey.

14
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,360
Wait.

15
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Lin Mochen, you're really something.

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,760
You skipped February 14.

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,600
Come to March 14, right?

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,800
It was supposed to be the second stage.

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,880
Even the beta testers are not open.

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,360
Lin Mochen.

21
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,920
I don't know

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,280
I don't know.

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,560
Did something go wrong with this game?

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,360
Is there any third or fourth stage?

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
No way.

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,440
Humph.

27
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,480
You said you lost your highest authority.

28
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,960
What do you mean?

29
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,000
You won't let me stay here forever, right?

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,280
I have another way.

31
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,400
What?

32
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,400
Every festival,

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,280
every festival.

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
We can leave

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,920
we can leave.

36
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,360
Today's mission is to make chocolate

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
for Beloved.

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,920
I don't have one.

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
This is the mission today.

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,720
A girl was confessed on February 14.

41
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,200
On March 14,

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,560
on March 14.

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,840
You're carrying personal goods, aren't you?

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,160
You even gave me a gift to show your feelings.

45
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
I'm not sincere.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,960
You want me to make you chocolate?

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,040
You wish.

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,440
This is set by the system.

49
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,360
I have no right now.

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,760
I can't change it.

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,320
I won't do it.

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,720
That's enough.

53
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,440
Too much

54
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,720
What?

55
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,320
Are you afraid of diabetes if you eat too much?

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,120
Why didn't you consider

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,560
why didn't you consider

58
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,890
the players' feelings?

59
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,140
You wrote this script, right?

60
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,810
Are you sure this is edible?

61
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,279
You said it.

62
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,140
The important thing is the heart.

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,560
We didn't pass.

64
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,200
Is it because you didn't work hard?

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,000
Who has the final say?

66
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,240
System.

67
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,520
When we developed the game,

68
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,360
we used a lot of

69
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,159
AI.

70
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,320
Our standards

71
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,560
are automatically determined by AI.

72
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,480
And many dramas

73
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,400
are automatic.

74
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,760
It has nothing to do with me.

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,120
You want to take the blame?

76
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
If it weren't for you,

77
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,780
we would have passed the test.

78
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,690
It's all your fault.

79
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,840
Oh, my.

80
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,040
You even used a knife.

81
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,920
What's wrong?

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Ha.

83
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,960
Yes.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,640
Make chocolate for Beloved.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,080
Maybe the system thinks

86
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,880
you're not my lover.

87
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,780
What are you trying to say?

88
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,880
That's impossible.

89
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,400
I'll do my best today.

90
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,680
Work hard.

91
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,050
Open your mouth.

92
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,720
How is it? Is it good?

93
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes.

94
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,320
Sweet.

95
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
Humph.

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,880
How is it?

97
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,640
I told you he's not your lover.

98
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,840
What is the end?

99
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,280
Come to think of it,

100
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
The key point of White Valentine's Day is

101
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,000
to exchange feelings.

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,880
Then the boy has to

103
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,520
finish all the chocolate

104
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,680
to accept your feelings.

105
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,480
Right?

106
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,880
Really.

107
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,800
So no matter what you do,

108
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,840
I'll finish it.

109
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,120
No.

110
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,200
Hey.

111
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,320
No.

112
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,159
No, this...

113
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,290
What does this mean?

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
Don't be nervous. It's just mustard.

115
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360
Not too much.

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,280
Dong Wei Wei, you've gone too far.

117
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,880
It's a creative dish.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,960
Open your mind.

119
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,100
Don't leave anything behind.

120
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,480
What's wrong?

121
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,320
It's so delicious.

122
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
I'm so touched.

123
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
What is this?

124
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,640
Here it comes.

125
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,120
No.

126
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,820
What are you doing?

127
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm here to say sorry.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,640
You can be angry and reject me.

129
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,400
but I'll love you forever.

130
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,200
No, boss.

131
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
There's no one in my house.

132
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,520
Just tell me the truth.

133
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,650
Romantic movie.

134
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
Mission cleared.

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,840
He's so proud.

136
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,160
This doesn't feel good.

137
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,520
That works too.

138
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,980
What a stupid game. I quit.

139
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,880
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,159
What?

141
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,880
I said I'm sorry.

142
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,280
If I apologize to you

143
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,559
every day,

144
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,679
When will you forgive me?

145
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,880
Say it 30,000 times.

146
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,120
Isn't that a lifetime?

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
As long as you don't mind.
