1
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,240
What happened?

2
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,680
Why did I dream of him?

3
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,880
I don't think this is a dream.

4
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Oh my god.

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,720
This picture is so weird.

6
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,640
No.

7
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,600
At this rate,

8
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,040
do I have to fall in love with this pervert?

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,080
No, no.

10
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,010
I have to find out

11
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,920
Why are you following him?

12
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,160
Hush.

13
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,919
Pretend to have a good chat with me.

14
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,680
Ah.

15
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,760
But I think he's dangerous.

16
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,440
The more dangerous it is, the more we need to find out.

17
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,240
Anyway,

18
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,280
I trust you the most in this world.

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Trust?

20
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes.

21
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,570
You're the only normal one.

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,800
Oh.

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,640
Now. Let's go.

24
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,560
Finally, it's my turn to follow him.

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,480
It's like he's coming from the sky.

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,400
Yes, he's weird.

27
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,120
Every time

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
falling from the sky.

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,000
This is for you.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,280
Happy Valentine's Day.

31
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,560
Soy milk is for free.

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
So sweet

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,680
Oh.

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,320
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,640
Let me take you to buy a new one.

36
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,960
Everyone is in the same place.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,080
Wherever we meet every day,

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,200
is fixed.

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,480
Only Lin Mochen is different.

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,160
Except at the beginning,

41
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,800
It must be in the elevator.

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,800
Later,

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,640
he was different from others.

44
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,440
How?

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,130
Others always show up at a fixed point.

46
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,040
He's always the same.

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,600
Let's go.

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,280
Let's go.

49
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,720
Hello.

50
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,040
Excuse me.

51
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,320
Why do I feel

52
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,560
I've seen this before.

53
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
Why is he here?

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,840
Does he have memories of yesterday?

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
Have you seen these two people?

56
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,800
We can't leak our customers' information.

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,000
Aren't you confident?

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,160
Go ask him.

59
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,079
I...

60
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,440
Can't you tell?

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,000
He's shy.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Impossible.

63
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,400
Why are you here again?

64
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,120
You again?

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,760
What do you want?

66
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,400
She seems to have something to tell you.

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
Yes.

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,240
Why are you here today?

69
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,130
Do you remember yesterday?

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,720
We were signing the contract yesterday.

71
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
Stop pretending.

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
I was in the hotel yesterday.

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
and watched fireworks.

74
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,600
and eye contact.

75
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,480
So you dreamed of me.

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,600
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,560
You like me.

78
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
What's your relationship with her?

79
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,840
She's my senior.

80
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,320
And then?

81
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,600
And...

82
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,050
This has nothing to do with you.

83
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,480
Pure puppy, right?

84
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,280
But I think she has a crush on someone.

85
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,280
That crazy stalker?

86
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
No way.

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,240
Women know women best.

88
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,040
Why don't you stop the loss

89
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,680
and get along with another sister?

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,120
Yoyo.

91
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,920
Who is he?

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,440
Don't be angry. He's not as obedient as you.

93
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,880
Jack Wang.

94
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,280
Hey.

95
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,360
You don't have a job?

96
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
We're here for a date.

97
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,160
Yes.

98
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,840
No.

99
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,280
Boss, let me explain.

100
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,159
He is your boss.

101
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,480
Yoyo is so charming.

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,159
Who is she?

103
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,920
Ah.

104
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,280
You want her to come here?

105
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,640
I'm fascinated by women, boss.

106
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,240
Yes.

107
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,920
This is not a place to talk.

108
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,520
Let's talk somewhere else.

109
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Okay.

110
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,560
Why are you quiet again?

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
Let's play a game.

112
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,800
Okay.

113
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,560
Ice breaking.

114
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,160
Classic banquet game.

115
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,080
Come on.

116
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,760
Make a move to the cup.

117
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
Let's start with you.

118
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,620
It's your turn, handsome.

119
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,160
Now the order is reversed.

120
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,640
Do the movements to the cup

121
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,120
to the person next to you.

122
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,280
It's not fair.

123
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,120
Only you know the rules.

124
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,520
Yeah, I should have kissed him too.

125
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,720
You...

126
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,560
Don't be afraid.

127
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,320
Didn't we agree to break the ice?

128
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Right.

129
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,560
Hey, Wei Wei.

130
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Hello?

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,120
I didn't mean it.

132
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,730
It's okay. It's just a game.

133
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,960
Hey.

134
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,800
Oh.

135
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,640
Ah.

136
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,520
You're so thin. Can you catch it?

137
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,840
What? You want to replace him?

138
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,200
I can.

139
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,280
Ah.

140
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,640
Now it's my turn.

141
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,760
Lin Mochen.

142
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,960
Come here.

143
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,840
Come here.

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,840
Yoyo.

145
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,040
I don't think I can do this.

146
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,840
Hey.

147
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
Do you have scissors?

148
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,400
Boss, I was wrong.

149
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,520
You is suspicious.

150
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,240
Keep your distance.

151
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,799
Also, keep an eye on him.

152
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,400
Don't let me see you outside again.

153
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,920
You ran so fast.

154
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,330
Didn't you see the way Lin Mochen looked at me?

155
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,720
He must think I'm a bad guy.

156
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,680
Then who are you?

157
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,960
I'm on your side.

158
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,120
Do you also think Lin Mochen is a bad guy?

159
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,400
Yes. And did you find that

160
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,320
something will happen

161
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,960
something will happen.

162
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,640
But sometimes I think

163
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,360
he's a good guy.

164
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,360
Don't trust men.

165
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,960
Trust me instead.

166
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,240
Is she also like me? Is she also trapped here?

167
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,400
But she seems to enjoy it.

168
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,880
Can I really trust her?

169
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,960
No.

170
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,530
We still need evidence.

171
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,200
Otherwise, Lin Mochen won't admit it.

172
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,960
When did Dongjiang City Planning Bureau

173
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,360
When was it built?

174
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,000
Why did I sleep for so long?

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
Where am I?

176
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,000
Hello

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,520
Excuse me, where am I?

178
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,760
Ah

179
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,480
