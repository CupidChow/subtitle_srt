1
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,680
They like the love castle.

2
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,960
Pink bubbles.

3
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,720
and fluffy toys.

4
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
What is this?

5
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
Did I offend you?

6
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Open your mind.

7
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,080
Don't be prejudiced.

8
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,120
How can you play a love game without dating?

9
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,640
I have data.

10
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,160
Hey.

11
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,810
I don't understand.

12
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,250
Boss, what's wrong?

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,880
I don't know why.

14
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,850
I have a heart problem whenever I see Dong Wei Wei.

15
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Dong Wei Wei.

16
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Heart disease.

17
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,960
[Laughing]

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,480
When girls are surrounded by flowers and applause,

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,240
shouldn't it be exciting?

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Logically speaking.

21
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,840
Then why did she

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
scared today?

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,240
That should be her.

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,040
the sample.

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,720
No.

26
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,240
I have to delete this.

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,480
No.

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,040
I've been thinking about it.

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,200
I said delete it.

30
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,800
What's with this faceless man?

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,079
The boundary of the game.

32
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,320
NPC is not done yet.

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,360
It will be solved soon.

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,160
Don't worry.

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,290
It won't be exposed.

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
Search again.

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,090
Don't ever scare her again.

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,800
Scare her?

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,280
It's not about her being exposed in the virtual world.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
but to scare her.

41
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,640
Then what?

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,079
Stop being stubborn.

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,360
I can't bear to.

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,100
Isn't it because you like her?

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,080
Yes, I like Dong Wei Wei.

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
I want to confess to her.

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,560
Okay?

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,160
Sure.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,280
Have you figured out what to say?

50
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,400
Yeah, how should I say it?

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,760
Hey.

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Mr. Lin.

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Are you crazy?

54
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,880
I want to be with her.

55
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,360
I can't use her.

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,160
How long have you been preparing this game?

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,840
How much energy did you spend to record it every day?

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,440
Do you really have the heart?

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,600
Let me ask you.

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
If she knows I used her

61
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,800
to do experiments,

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
what would she think?

63
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,360
No matter what,

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,000
this experiment has started.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,460
It's useless to delete it.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
But I think she likes you.

67
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,240
Explain to her.

68
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,360
Explain?

69
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,160
I will.

70
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,120
Hey.

71
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,160
So you mean

72
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,640
if I make her happy,

73
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,120
she wouldn't be so angry.

74
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,500
Yes, that's right.

75
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,280
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,880
I'm here to take you home.

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,620
I'll take you home.

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,880
I'm leaving.

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,360
After I leave,

80
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,280
I don't want to see you again.

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,920
If you're unhappy,

82
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,120
I can give up this game.

83
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,959
Why can't I remember

84
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,600
about entering the game?

85
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,840
Because

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,200
to let you immerse yourself in it.

87
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,240
Before you entered the game,

88
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,640
we hid a part of your brain.

89
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,960
Indeed, we need a beta tester.

90
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,760
But later,

91
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,159
she really fell in love with me.

92
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,680
Wei Wei.

93
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,560
Don't worry.

94
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,840
I'll take you home.

95
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,020
I think the exit control is stuck.

96
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,800
I'll contact the game engineer.

97
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,000
Hello?

98
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
Sorry, boss.

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,240
My withdrawal function failed.

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,960
Someone stole our authority.

101
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,760
When will it be fixed?

102
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,760
The game has been hacked.

103
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,320
No one can leave the game until we find him.

104
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,360
We have a mole here.

105
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,280
How is that possible?

106
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,760
The girl called Yoyo.

107
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,680
lured me to the hotel

108
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,920
and set me up with Wei Wei.

109
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,960
Later,

110
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,480
talk behind Dong Wei Wei's back.

111
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,080
Isn't that what you want, boss?

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,720
Tell me.

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,600
Are you fascinated by women?

114
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
Tell her what business secrets we have.

115
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,680
Are you still working together to lie to me?

116
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,720
Wei Wei.

117
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,840
I will take you back.

118
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,120
I won't trust you anymore.

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,280
Wei Wei.

120
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,820
Wei Wei, what's wrong?

121
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,680
What should I do?

122
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
If something goes wrong in the game, your brain will be damaged.

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,880
Help!

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,480
Boss, you're so anxious.

125
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,640
This is a game.

126
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,440
There's only NPC in the hospital.

127
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,760
Of course I know.

128
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,400
You won't ask the engineer

129
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,760
from reality?

130
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,600
Yes.

131
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,760
You can't go out.

132
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,420
But maybe we can still come in.

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,680
Don't worry, Mr. Lin.

134
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,640
Her brain wave has stabilized.

135
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,640
It should be a short faint

136
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,000
when he was emotional.

137
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,560
She'll wake up soon.

138
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
What happened to her in the real world?

139
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,680
I checked her when she logged in the game.

140
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,000
His condition is stable.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,560
So,

142
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,680
we can only enter this game world now.

143
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,600
You can't go out.

144
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,400
That's right.

145
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,880
What about the male NPC?

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,159
Who are you?

147
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
Leave us alone.

148
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
They're doing fine.

149
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,600
No, we can't.

150
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,680
Our NPC is automatically produced by AI.

151
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,440
Once we meet gamers,

152
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,880
they start to interact.

153
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,960
I can't stop.

154
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,080
Your words will affect others' rest.

155
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,240
You used to have the highest authority in the world.

156
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,120
But it doesn't work now.

157
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,800
It's really tricky.

158
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
These NPC can't be controlled.

159
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Unless... Unless external interference.

160
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,680
Can't you hear me?

161
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,880
Shut up!

162
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,840
Ah.

163
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,640
Sir.

164
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,080
Please don't interrupt my work.

165
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,000
You're not a professional doctor.

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,800
How can you test people's temperature with your hands?

167
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,640
Who are you?

168
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
I'm the patient's family.

169
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,360
I don't know him.

170
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,800
Oh, sorry.

171
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,159
Please leave.

172
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,040
And this one in white coat.

173
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,700
Where did this fake come from?

174
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm sorry.

175
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,960
I bought this hospital.

176
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,080
What?

177
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,840
I don't have the right to control this game,

178
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,240
but I'm rich.

179
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,400
It's not fair.

180
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,960
I'm sorry

181
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,240
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,400
You're fired.

183
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,680
It's fair.

184
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,490
You're using a plug?

185
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,560
I didn't.

186
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm the boss.

187
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,440
If you're the boss,

188
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,800
just let me out.

189
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
What the hell is this?

190
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
It can monitor your physical condition

191
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,880
and some supplies and help functions.

192
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,760
I'll be relieved if you wear it.

193
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,800
