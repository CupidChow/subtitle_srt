1
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
They have a new activity.

2
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,440
This looks interesting.

3
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,780
Cultivation Department.

4
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,520
Add this idea

5
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,960
into our game.

6
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,560
I'll go in and have a look.

7
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,200
What kind of event is this?

8
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,520
Are you waiting for someone?

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,130
I have a suggestion for you.

10
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,940
Don't turn your back to the door and wait.

11
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,840
Okay.

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,880
Thank you.

13
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,640
You really have a different attitude.

14
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,760
Who are you waiting for?

15
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,890
I'm waiting for you.

16
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,320
Yoyo.

17
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,810
What did you call me?

18
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,800
I've always wanted to say sorry.

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,720
I was too obsessed with the past

20
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,460
and a little stubborn.

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,720
How are you going to

22
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,160
make it up to me?

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,079
Compensate?

24
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,280
Cut.

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,560
Your performance

26
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,480
was too stiff.

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
It's really hard for me to fit in.

29
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,300
How about this?

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,400
When you talk to Shengyou,

31
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,880
look into her eyes.

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Eyes.

33
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,600
Is this okay?

34
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,960
Also,

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,880
at the beginning,

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,400
at the beginning.

37
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,840
Be silly.

38
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,200
Silly.

39
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,360
That's right.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,600
It's a real show.

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,040
Foolish first, then affectionate.

42
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,570
Don't look at the few lines.

43
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,940
There must be changes.

44
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,520
Let's try again.

45
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,450
Who are you waiting for?

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm waiting for you.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,520
Wei Wei.

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,520
It's Youyou.

49
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,520
You're younger than me.

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,560
He's a bit wild.

51
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,120
That's what I want.

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,960
Hey.

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,120
Is there any movement missing?

54
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,240
Move.

55
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,520
Hey.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,560
Good.

57
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,220
Good arm strength, young man.

58
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,120
Hey.

59
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,120
What?

60
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,520
He's taking advantage of you.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,820
Can't you tell?

62
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,760
He's NPC. Are you jealous of him?

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,520
Besides,

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,050
It's none of your business.

65
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,160
[Laughing]

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,010
So this is the process of cultivation.

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,400
It's quite exciting.

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,120
What a pity.

69
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
I don't have time to enjoy today

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,120
Wait

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,440
What's wrong?

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
Don't go.

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,720
You've grown too fast today.

74
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Or...

75
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,040
I'm trapped.

76
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,840
Sorry.

77
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,000
I designed this hotel.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,240
I have a little hobby

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
about the labyrinth.

80
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,000
What do you want?

81
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,280
Sorry.

82
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,000
Here.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,460
Search wherever you want.

84
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,080
What?

85
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,560
Should I do it myself?

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,320
Hey.

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,980
Don't move.

88
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,280
You two, turn around.

89
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,400
You or me?

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,040
Or...

91
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,000
Hair.

92
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,600
It's hair.

93
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,360
Found it.

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
This is a small punishment

95
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
for the thief.

96
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,440
Hello.

97
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Lin Mochen.

98
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,400
Wei Wei.

99
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,520
Will we meet again?

100
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,520
Maybe.

101
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,000
Maybe.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,659
means we'll never meet again.

103
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,360
I just want you to be happy.

104
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,960
Thank you so much.

105
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,240
Let's go.

106
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
Humph.

107
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,240
You want to trap me

108
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,480
to trap me.

109
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,600
I feel like I've slept for a long time.

110
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
I had a long dream.

111
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,520
Ah.

112
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,640
I finally escaped.

113
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,400
No.

114
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,680
I need to check.

115
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,920
Ah.

116
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,940
The flowers are blooming.

117
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,800
Great.

118
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,840
This is my real home.

119
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,400
No handsome guy. Haha.

120
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,600
What about Lin Mochen?

121
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Will I see him again?

122
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,880
Meet him?

123
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
No.

124
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,880
Meet him.

125
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,200
No.

126
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,900
I don't want to see him.

127
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,640
Meet him.

128
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,200
No.

129
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,039
Meet him?

130
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,080
I have to give it back to him.

131
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,320
I'd better go back.

132
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,170
She definitely doesn't want to see me.

133
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,600
I'll just give her a gift and apologize.

134
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,400
It should be fine.

135
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,840
No problem.

136
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,320
Hey.

137
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,280
I'm leaving.

138
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,520
After I leave,

139
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,920
I don't want to see you anymore.

140
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,800
Forget it.

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,260
Let's not disturb her.

142
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,160
Oh.

143
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,760
The receptionist finally got off work.

144
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,160
I feel refreshed.

145
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,280
Hello, miss.

146
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,720
Are you joining our tasting event?

147
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,520
No way.

149
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,160
