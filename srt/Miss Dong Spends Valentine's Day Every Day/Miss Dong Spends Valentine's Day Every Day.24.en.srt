1
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,640
Oh no.

2
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,520
He might have found my password.

3
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,460
What password?

4
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,039
Bug needs final repair.

5
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,200
I need my personal password

6
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,479
to end it.

7
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
What should we do?

8
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,039
Who?

9
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,039
Kang U.

10
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,720
I see.

11
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,600
The password is the day you first met.

12
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,320
Kang U.

13
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,680
If what I did before

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,960
to you,

15
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,160
I apologize, okay?

16
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,000
No need.

17
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,759
He's the one

18
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,600
is him.

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,080
Kang U.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,200
I really thought of you as

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,280
in this world.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,610
But it's different now.

23
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,520
You're like a younger brother.

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,400
Can you understand?

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
I don't.

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,930
You think you are true love.

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,860
I don't believe it.

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,400
Wei Wei.

29
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,120
Wei, Lin Mochen.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,960
Wei Wei.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,920
Lin Mochen, can you hear me?

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,880
Wei Wei, why aren't you talking?

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,640
Can you hear me?

34
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,040
Wei Wei, you two, Wei Wei.

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,770
This is the exit of the game.

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,079
You can get out if you turn right.

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,079
Wei Wei.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,090
I'm different from him.

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,320
I won't lie to you.

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,880
As long as you turn right,

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,280
Lin Mochen's door will explode.

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,720
Do you love him that much?

43
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
One of you can go.

45
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,320
What will you do if he leaves?

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,200
What's the result of turning left?

47
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,120
You're so selfish.

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,520
to run away.

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,520
If I'm not mistaken,

50
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,240
This is a trap, right?

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
That's right.

52
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,770
As long as you turn this handle,

53
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,800
Dong Wei Wei's door

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
will explode.

55
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,840
Don't lie to me.

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,720
I guess

57
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
no matter who turns the handle,

58
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,720
I'll be the last one to die.

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,680
She'll stay, right?

60
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,610
What do you mean?

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,240
You don't love her at all.

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,240
You just want to keep her in the game

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,220
and let her accompany you.

64
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm not as despicable as you said.

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,760
It's okay.

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,600
Lin Mochen.

67
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,160
It's okay.

68
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,880
Let me die. Let her go.

69
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,440
If you die,

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,360
she'll leave.

71
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,140
Keep your promise.

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,520
Did Lin Mochen find Bug?

73
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,960
Did he forget me because he was in love

74
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,880
or on purpose?

75
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,520
Warning.

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
What's going on?

77
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,200
Where are you?

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,400
[I'm warning the player that the game is too long.]

79
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
His vitals are dangerous.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,160
Please leave now.

81
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,720
Warning.

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
What should we do?

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,680
Where are you?

84
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Amusement park.

85
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,680
This wasn't on the map before.

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,600
Is it open?

87
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,680
Two versions of maps.

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,280
I got it.

89
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,280
Bug must be there.

90
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,560
Guys.

91
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,520
Turn left and you'll explode your door.

92
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,400
Make your choice.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,880
I...

94
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,560
stay.

95
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,840
You...

96
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,600
Go back.

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
No!

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,240
Lin Mochen.

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,120
Be good.

100
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,280
No.

101
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,240
No.

102
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
Wei Wei.

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,720
Lin Mochen.

104
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,760
No!

105
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,840
Then I won't play with you.

107
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,760
Kang-woo.

108
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,520
Wei Wei.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,920
Wei Wei.

110
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,159
Kang-woo.

111
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,840
Please let him go.

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,240
Please let him go.

113
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,360
Kang-woo.

114
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,040
Wei Wei.

115
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,240
Did you lie like him?

116
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,440
Wait.

117
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
She really can't do it.

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,460
I'm exhausted.

119
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,240
This is Dong Wei Wei's data report.

120
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,960
The player has been in the game for over a week.

121
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Her body can't take it.

122
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,680
Her brain can't take it either.

123
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
She'll die soon.

124
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,480
Let her go.

125
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,920
A little self-awareness

126
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,120
change day and night.

127
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,280
I know.

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,880
Kang-woo.

129
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,480
You said you love her.

130
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,960
Yes, I do.

131
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
My body will be destroyed.

132
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,080
but my consciousness won't.

133
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,850
I want the subtle consciousness to be with me.

134
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,200
Ask her

135
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,520
Is she willing?

136
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,600
Yes, she will.

137
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,960
She was just fooled

138
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,040
by your sweet words.

139
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,159
Lin Mochen, you are a liar.

140
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,800
No.

141
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,520
Wei Wei.

142
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,960
He's a scumbag.

143
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,360
Do you know

144
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,040
how despicable

145
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,720
to fool you?

146
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,800
He didn't.

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,200
He's not like that, Kang-woo.

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,480
He's...

149
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,640
We were the ones who got married that day.

150
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,960
It was us.

151
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,480
Mr. Kang-woo.

152
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Will you marry

153
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,360
Dong Wei Wei

154
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,240
Miss Dong Wei Wei as your wife?

155
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,000
Be it poverty or wealth,

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
health or sickness,

157
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
and never give up.

158
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Forever?

159
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,440
Kang-woo!

160
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,400
Ah.

161
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,960
Just because Lin Mochen is the game owner,

162
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,440
he deliberately made me faint at that time.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,760
That was a rehearsal.

164
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,679
Your true love is here.

165
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,280
Come on.

166
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,760
Yoyo is also a liar.

167
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,320
I could have found you in the hotel first.

168
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,200
It's all because of her.

169
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Wei Wei.

170
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,640
When I get lost and come back,

171
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,640
Lin Mochen.

172
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,080
You are a liar.

173
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
If it weren't for him,

174
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,840
we would've been together.

175
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,480
He's not like that, Kang-woo.

176
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,520
Wait.

177
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,960
When did you wake up?

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,160
At first, I only had one day of memory.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,160
until I met Wei Wei.

180
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,760
many inexplicable fragments

181
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,440
just flashed in my head.

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
Until...

183
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,320
she wanted to get married.

184
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,040
Yes.

185
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,520
Wei Wei.

186
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,040
Trust me.

187
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,360
I'm really not a NPC.

188
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm really not.

189
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,400
I have my own feelings.

190
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,880
I really have.

191
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,680
As for you,

192
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,200
it's useless.

193
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,640
Do you really think

194
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
I'm not prepared at all?

195
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,440
Lin Mochen can't defeat you.

196
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,240
but it doesn't mean that you can't beat her.

197
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,880
I designed her skin carefully.

198
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,440
Max.

199
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,000
If I die,

200
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,080
will my consciousness stay?

201
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,880
I don't think so.

202
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Let them go.

203
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,440
or I'll die in front of you.

204
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,920
Let them go.

205
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,240

216

I thought I had control over the world,

217
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,240
but I can't let you look at me one more time.

218
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
Then what's the point of my existence?

219
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,840
Kang-woo, what are you doing?

220
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,760

Wake up, Wei Wei.

231
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,000
Wei Wei, wake up.

232
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,840
Wake up.

233
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,240
Wake up, okay?

234
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,200

235
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,760

That's...

239
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,040
That's Kang-woo.

240
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,520
I made AI.

241
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,000
What?

242
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,640
Do you think it's because of me

243
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,920
because I did it?

244
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,200
You're so smug.

245
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,440
You should think about

246
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,600
how to make AI more valuable.

247
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,800
What smells so good?

248
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,480

250
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,720

00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,440
Didn't we agree

257
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,770

258
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,880
Right.

259
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,180
Are you sure you don't want them anymore?

260
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,000
I've decided to start over.

261
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,320
