1
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,880
Slow down

2
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,800
Oops

3
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,560
What's going on?

4
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,560
Did you eat something?

5
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,680
I just feel uncomfortable.

6
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,520
Not really.

7
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,280
Right

8
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,240
I sprained my ankle just now

9
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,400
And my foot.

10
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,880
Yes.

11
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,039
I set this bug

12
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,840
into a black suitcase.

13
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,400
so that we can find

14
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,560
What are you looking for?

15
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,680
We can just copy this.

16
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,880
This...

17
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,120
Alright.

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,050
Okay, thank you.

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,840
Oh, right.

20
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,440
I need to backup my computer.

21
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Wait.

22
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,260
Oh, this...

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,600
What's wrong with you

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
Why are you sweating so much?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,039
Well

26
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,360
Maybe it's hypoglycemia.

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,400
Oh.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,280
Wait for me.

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,120
I'll be right back.

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,079
Wait

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,680
I'll be right back

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,560
I'll be right back.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,079
Planner, he's waiting for you outside.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,040
Oh.

35
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,800
What's wrong, baby? Planner.

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,600
Oh, baby.

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,920
Wait for me. Coming.

38
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,800
Soon.

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm coming. My head hurts.

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
Hey, baby.

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,520
My head hurts, baby.

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,280
Yes, my head hurts.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,010
Okay, let me give you a massage.

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,920
Here?

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
Push harder.

46
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Ah, here. Yes.

47
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,120
Is it comfortable?

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,000
You pervert.

49
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,720
Who?

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is someone there?

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,640
Security! Security!

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,680
You...

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Security.

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,720
Darn it.

55
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,240
Go to hell!

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,400
This game is so big.

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,640
To prevent the player's experience from falling,

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
some maps

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,079
is automatic expansion

60
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,920
by users.

61
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,010
I don't know if I should praise you.

62
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,280
When are we going to find it?

63
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,810
There's something wrong with these four places.

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
It's not that bad.

65
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
Let's look for them one by one.

66
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,410
We should be able to make it.

67
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
It's too late.

68
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,360
We have to split up.

69
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
If you find any bug is not repaired,

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,290
inform your teammates.

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,920
But this is a sweet plot.

72
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,180
There must be many sweet scenes in it.

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,760
It's a waste of time.

74
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,480
We have to find a way

75
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
to push forward the plot.

76
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,280
Just the two female players.

77
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,360
So many men.

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
How long will they hold us up?

79
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Unless...

80
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,340
someone can help us shift the firepower.

81
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,370
What do you mean?

82
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,280
Why are you laughing?

83
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,560
It's okay. It's pretty.

84
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,880
But

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,600
it's time for you to experience how a female player feels.

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,560
Why didn't he change?

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,720
Liang You has a skin

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,960
has been used by me.

89
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,240
Let's go.

90
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,200
Remember,

91
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,600
if you meet a man,

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,360
you must predict their predictions.

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
so that we can speed up the game.

94
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's go.

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,800
What?

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,320
You want to know each other, right?

97
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
Eat or drink?

98
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,520
Hurry up.

99
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,040
Actually I want to say

100
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,280
I saw the flowers behind you.

101
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,720
Give it to me.

102
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,080
Will you?

103
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,040
Yes.

104
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,960
Take the flowers means I accept it.

105
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,159
I have something to do.

106
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,120
I have to go.

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
What do you want?

108
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,880
Who are you?

109
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Why are you here?

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,760
I'm here to catch the adulterer.

111
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,920
Isn't he licking?

112
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,200
Why is there a scumbag?

113
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,080
Bah!

114
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,760
Stop licking.

115
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
Do you deserve it?

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,360
That's so dramatic.

117
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,880
You hit the wrong person. You should hit him.

118
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,610
I want to hit you. What's wrong?

119
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,160
Lin Mochen.

120
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,280
Your AI outlook is not right.

121
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Excuse me.

122
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,880
Is something wrong with your eyes?

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,040
No.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
Do you know

125
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,040
it's impolite to wear sunglasses indoors.

126
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,040
Ah sorry I'm used to it

127
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
Let me tell you a joke.

128
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,480
Go ahead.

129
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,680
One day,

130
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,740
Ya went shopping with her boyfriend.

131
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,170
The streets are crowded

132
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,520
Ya grabbed a hand in panic

133
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,800
Not boyfriend

134
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,680
So Ya said

135
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,620
I was wrong.

136
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,640
I was wrong.

137
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,520
Waiter.

138
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,320
Bill, please.

139
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
You don't want to eat?

140
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll pay.

141
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,440
How can you let a girl pay?

142
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,600
Bastard!

143
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,480
What is this?

144
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you want more popcorn?

145
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,840
No.

146
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,200
Where's Kele?

147
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,400
Can you be quiet?

148
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,370
Is this sexual harassment?

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,840
Dong Wei Wei must be so wronged.

150
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,840
Ah.

151
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Let's see if you dare to do anything.

152
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,680
Don't be angry.

153
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,000
Let me tell you a joke.

154
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,720
One day Taro and Bobo quarreled.

155
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
Taro was so angry that she ran away from home.

156
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,700
Milk tea thought Bobo went too far

157
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,720
So she eloped with Taro

158
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,880
Only peck.

159
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,000
So do you want it or not?

160
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,880
You're disgusting.

161
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,679
Don't flirt with people online.

162
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,440
Hello?

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Wei Wei.

164
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,330
I didn't expect this game to be such a failure.

166
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,520
It's so disgusting.

167
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,500
for making you suffer.

169
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,200
