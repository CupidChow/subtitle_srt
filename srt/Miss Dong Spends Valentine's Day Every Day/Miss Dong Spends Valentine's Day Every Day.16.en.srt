1
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,400
Yoyo.

2
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,200
You traitor!

3
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,720
Did you give her a plug?

4
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,280
Impossible. I really didn't.

5
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,440
This...

6
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,280
Is she the real master of the game?

7
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,920
That can't be.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,960
I just brought her into the game.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
That's too exaggerated.

10
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,060
Shengyou, be careful.

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,080
Yoyo.

12
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,290
Are you okay?

13
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,920
Yoyo.

14
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,840
Yoyo.

15
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,960
Yoyo.

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,079
Enough.

17
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,040
Stop crying.

18
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,600
I only removed Yoyo's skin.

19
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
What about Yoyo?

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,360
The real Yoyo.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,220
He's long gone.

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
These days, this fool

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,960
are the real Yoyo.

24
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,040
I just implanted a dummy in my skin.

25
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,680
Hey, take care of this skin.

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,640
The skin is full of virus.

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Don't let the virus mess up the game.

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,880
Then why did you do that?

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,360
I have to ask

30
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,079
this pervert traitor.

31
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,840
Ah.

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,560
You know Yuyo.

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,840
Yes.

34
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,720
Liang You, the female boss.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,960
Liang You?

36
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
I don't know him.

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,360
You've seen her.

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,400
The day before we entered the game, she...

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,360
Stop it.

40
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,920
Is your face okay?

41
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,560
Hey, didn’t we agree to submit the manuscript today?

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,120
What are you doing? When will Long Aotian fall?

43
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Long Aotian, such a shameful name.

44
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,560
That was her.

45
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,120
In reality,

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,200
in reality.

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,720
But there's no progress.

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,370
He wants to copy some creativity here.

49
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,320
Humph, your stupid game

50
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,580
What's there to steal?

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,600
She can't work with us.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,530
so she wanted me to bring her to the game world.

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,800
I just gave her a game account.

54
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,040
There's nothing else.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,720
I don’t know about the virus.

56
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,840
Mr. Lin, please forgive me.

57
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,680
I have a family.

58
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,400
Wait.

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,080
Lin Mochen.

60
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,560
That day,

61
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,320
touch her face that day.

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,000
You two seem to have a good cooperation.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,800
It's not about me.

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
I swear.

65
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,840
their cooperation didn't work out that day.

66
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,560
Mr. Lin,

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,220
Is it really impossible for us to work together?

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
No.

69
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,120
Sorry.

70
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,120
Where is Mr. Lin?

71
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,000
He left.

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,280
You are?

73
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,640
She asked me for help after that.

74
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,640
You know me.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
I really can't refuse.

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,760
By the way,

77
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,960
I went out to look for you that day.

78
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,200
but you disappeared.

79
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
Can't you call me when you disappeared?

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,200
I thought

81
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,640
I could explain this to you later.

82
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,440
Besides, men with sense of propriety

83
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,720
wouldn't touch other women's faces like that.

84
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,080
What did I do?

85
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,120
By the way,

86
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,960
How much did she copy?

87
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,320
The game is almost over.

88
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,400
So she put the virus in and trap us.

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,120
and let her game go online

90
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,880
and occupy the market, right?

91
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,640
Everyone, in our business,

92
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,960
creativity is everything.

93
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,420
It may degrade our creativity one day later.

94
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,080
So please work harder for the last time.

95
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
9 a.m. tomorrow.

96
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,120
let our game

97
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
on time.

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,120
How are they doing?

99
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,800
They're all watching.

100
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,440
Still in the game.

101
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,700
It won't come out soon.

102
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,680
Players' game is too long.

103
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,600
it will harm your health.

104
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,640
I suggest to quit.

105
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,640
According to you,

106
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,600
we can get out

107
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
we can get out.

108
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,880
The virus has attacked our game system.

109
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,000
Even if it's cleared,

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,800
we can't change the fact that the game was invaded.

111
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,800
She used the virus

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,760
to get out of the game.

113
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,000
Say something that people can understand.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,840
Find Liang You.

115
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
and take the key to her game control.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,840
Understand?

117
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
What's the key?

118
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,880
It may be in any form.

119
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,340
But there's a bunch of strange numbers on it.

120
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,660
Hey, you should have told me earlier.

121
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,320
Hey.

122
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
Why did she faint again?

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,840
Oh no.

124
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,640
How long has she been in the game?

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,120
She's in the game world.

126
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,640
There's no need to rush.

127
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,400
Are you kidding me?

128
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
If a player is in danger in Woo-joo,

129
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,480
he'll be brain dead in reality.

130
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,200
Hurry.

131
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,280
Doctor.

132
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,120
He was fired.

133
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,760
This will be refreshed automatically in the game.

134
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,520
Wei-wi.

135
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,600
Kang-woo, why are you here?

136
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,680
I'm worried about Wei Wei too.

137
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,400
Can't I?

138
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
You call her Wei Wei?

139
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:30,920
Ah.

140
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,850
What are you waiting for? Save him.

141
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,360
Humph.

142
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,060
Can you stay away from her?

143
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
I'm her boyfriend now.

144
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Does she admit it?

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We're just arguing.

146
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,400
She's in danger every time she meets you.

147
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,650
Does this have anything to do with you?

148
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,040
Lower your voice.

149
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,700
The patient is still resting.

150
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,920
Who's the patient's family?

151
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,480
Me.

152
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,440
Who is it?

153
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,600
I'm her boyfriend.

154
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,880
I'm her brother.

155
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,160
You're her junior.

156
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,640
You...

157
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,840
Who will pay the bill?

158
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,440
Here.

159
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,850
I'll leave it to you.

160
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,560
Go and pay the bill.

161
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,600
By the way,

162
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,860
you said the patient didn't admit that he's her boyfriend.

163
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,640
Can I meet him?

164
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,000
You wish.

165
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,240
Listen.

166
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,000
I won't let you off if you keep harassing your patient.

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,840
Yes.

168
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,000
And call the security.

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
Get rid of this unrelated person.

170
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,440
You...

171
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,559
Actor table.

172
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:40,919

173
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,200
Jiang, Yu, Zhang Yiqian.

174
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,520

Bride, Feifei.

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,320
Chef.

183
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,600
