1
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,720
It's just the highlight.

2
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,280
Why is it restarting again?

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,160
Why are you here?

4
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,520
Yeah.

5
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,120
I wanted to see you earlier,

6
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,280
so I came.

7
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,720
Ah

8
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
What?

9
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,160
Your tie is crooked.

10
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
It's written in a novel.

11
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm testing you.

12
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,560
That's a bad move.

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
As long as it works.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,840
Okay.

15
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,800
Wait.

16
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,640
Forget it.

17
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's enjoy dating for a few days.

18
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,160
What?

19
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,960
Uh...

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,760
Nothing.

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,480
Ha.

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,010
Let's go.

23
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
I'll take you out.

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,560
Ah.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,040
What's wrong?

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,480
Nothing.

27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,120
By the way,

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,720
Where do you want to go later?

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,640
Yeah.

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,400
I want to go somewhere empty.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,060
What are you doing?

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,240
Goodness.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,960
I just want to find a quiet place to relax.

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,200
Oh.

35
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,520
Hey.

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,079
Got it.

37
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,610
Let's go.

38
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,280
Ah.

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,520
Isn't the Ferris wheel under repair?

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
What?

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,480
I have some shares.

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,240
But I miss it.

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,160
Yes.

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,240
I've been here before

45
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,680
With whom?

46
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,290
Are you jealous?

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,320
Why would I be jealous?

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm just asking.

49
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,160
I just came to write a novel

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,640
to experience life.

51
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,440
Yes.

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,260
Inspiration comes from life.

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
What is this?

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,480
Open your mind

56
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,800
Enjoy it.

57
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,760
Gosh.

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,840
What is this?

59
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,020
This is a new business developed by our company.

60
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,680
How did you do that?

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Well...

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
I'll tell you later.

63
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
What?

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,640
Wei Wei.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
Hello, Jack Wang.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,640
What's going on?

67
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,760
I told you not to let her come.

68
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,480
This place hasn't been developed yet.

69
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,280
Why hasn't the beta test been solved?

70
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,560
I think there's bug.

71
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,960
Is there a virus?

72
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,330
What's going on?

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,360
Too much work.

74
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
You don't keep an eye on your date every day.

75
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Mr. Li, it's okay.

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
Dong Wei Wei is right beside me.

77
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,640
Don't worry.

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,400
Take Dong Wei back first.

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,240
Lin Mochen.

80
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,840
Do you have something

81
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,160
to tell me today?

82
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,600
Wait for me.

83
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
I'll be back soon.

84
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,080
and tell you everything.

85
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,920
I...

86
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,640
Excuse me.

87
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,680
Something is wrong here.

88
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,960
Let me take you home.

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,200
Is he up there alone?

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,960
What about the other staff?

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,560
You said you wanted to be alone.

92
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,020
Well...

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,800
But he can't be up there alone.

94
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,640
What if something happens to him?

95
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,720
Don't worry.

96
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,250
He'll be fine on his own.

97
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,960
It's getting late.

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,080
Get in.

99
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,400
It's almost time.

100
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,600
You can't see this.

101
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,800
Why not?

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,240
Please don't look.

103
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,440
I haven't gotten even with you

104
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,770
you lied to me last time.

105
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,810
The questionnaire.

106
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,040
Hello, beauty.

107
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,810
Are you interested in doing a questionnaire?

108
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,840
Why is it all about love?

109
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,120
Are you picking on me?

110
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,240
Just fill it out.

111
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,440
Answer honestly.

112
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,880
You can get a 100-dollar cash red packet.

113
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,040
Okay, I'll show you what I've got today.

114
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,170
Did your company make this?

115
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,640
Of course, I'm the one who gave you the form.

116
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,320
I don't know.

117
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,080
The preliminary assessment that Miss Dong Wei Wei has been single for a long time.

118
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,480
She was stood up just now.

119
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,200
Today, I was hit hard by showing off my love.

120
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,360
or a low-income social animal.

121
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
It fits our target.

122
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,680
It's suitable for beta testing.

123
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,280

Why is it all about me?

126
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,240
Stop!

127
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,400
What does this mean?

128
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,700
I'll explain to you when the boss comes back.

129
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,480
I remember.

130
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
I remember last time

131
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,600
I think so.

132
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,120
I was standing here.

133
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,720
You fell asleep last time.

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,360
Don't look at me. I don't know.

135
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,000
Is it my birthday?

136
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,840
It's Valentine's Day every day.

137
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,080

All kinds of scenes and all kinds of boys are up to you.

141

I'll show you the sweetest love in all kinds of scenes.

142
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,640
I have new choices every day

143

144
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,520

Immersive?

147
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,610
That's what the beta testers mean, right?

148
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,000
So Lin Mochen followed me

149
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,520
