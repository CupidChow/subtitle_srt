1
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,410
Have you had a strange dream recently?

2
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,720
Is it hard to sleep?

3
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,920
You didn't take the medicine they gave you, did you?

4
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,520
Don't even take aspirin.

5
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
You can't even eat aspirin.

6
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,280
Yes.

7
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,720
Did you eat

8
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,930
Did you drink the coffee they gave you?

9
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,720
Tell me at least you smoke your own cigarettes.

10
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,840
Why didn't I think of that?

11
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,900
Someone must have drugged me.

12
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,960
This might be a crazy place.

13
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,560
But I don't know.

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,479
I need to analyze it calmly.

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,040
The conclusion is

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,480
a hunger strike.

17
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,560
Maybe I don't eat the food here.

18
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
I can sober up.

19
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,760
Don't eat

20
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,760
Oh no no

21
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,740
Mutton skewers. Mutton skewers.

22
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,440
Mutton skewers.

23
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,560
You want to seduce me?

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,760
No way.

25
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,440
You're trying to seduce me too?

26
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,960
Ah.

27
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,360
I called you many times, but you didn't answer.

28
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,160
so I came to see you.

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,920
Then what is this?

30
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,650
My lunch box.

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,970
Let's eat together.

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,560
No need.

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm on a diet.

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,340
You're so thin and you're still on a diet.

35
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,360
What is this?

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,640
Here.

37
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,290
Have some barbecue.

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,720
This is unhealthy.

39
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,360
My lunch box.

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,840
It's healthy with low fat.

41
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,040
And it doesn't grow fat.

42
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,079
Did you really make this yourself?

43
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,560
Of course.

44
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,680
Of course, he added my secret recipe.

45
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,800
Ta-da.

46
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,440
No.

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,240
Don't try to fool me.

48
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,840
Ah.

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,220
You're really not eating?

50
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,720
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,920
I'll eat.

52
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,960
Even if I starve to death today,

53
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,420
I won't eat you even if I jump off the balcony.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,880
Yeah!

55
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
That's amazing.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,480
I fell for his trick.

57
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,520
That's not a good idea.

58
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,120
Even if it's drug,

59
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,080
It's so effective.

60
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,810
Yes, we can't go on a hunger strike.

61
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,120
Chumen.

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
Yes.

63
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,440
Sweet reality show.

64
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,680
Why didn't I think of that?

65
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,640
No wonder So many men talk to me every day.

66
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,280
and so many sweet tricks.

67
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,040
Yes, sweet love reality show.

68
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,600
Lin Mochen.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,540
Just follow the director.

70
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,420
That's why I'm following you.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,480
Wow.

72
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,600
I didn't expect you to be so straightforward.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,480
Stop acting.

74
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,240
Act what?

75
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,220
A reality show.

76
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,360
Love reality show.

77
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,320
Tell me how much they gave you.

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,640
Miss Dong, although this is the first time I've sent you flowers,

79
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,120
but I'm sincere.

80
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,080
You signed the confidentiality agreement, right?

81
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,640
It's okay. Keep your voice down.

82
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,770
They can't hear you.

83
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I see.

84
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,560
You must doubt my feelings.

85
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,840
I promise you.

86
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
If we can continue to get along,

87
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,520
I will understand you well.

88
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,159
Why are you so stubborn?

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360
Miss,

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,760
This can be defined as sexual harassment.

91
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,280
Yo.

92
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,240
Why didn't you say it when you kissed me?

93
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
That was sexual harassment.

94
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,520
Kiss you.

95
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,640

96
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Stop pretending.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,080
You filmed here without my permission.

98
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,880
I can sue you for invading my portrait rights.

99
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
privacy and personal freedom.

100
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

101
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,560
Where's the radio?

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
What is this?

103
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,360
This is a watch.

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,460
And earphones.

105
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,440

I won't believe you this time.

110
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
You're not a director?

111
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm a stalker who has a crush on you.

112
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,130
Isn't it normal to have your photo?

113
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,080
Besides,

114
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,680

115
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,880
I don't believe

116
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,680
there must be a hidden identity.

117
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,080
Are you crazy?

118
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Give up. There's no reality show.

119
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,200
Is it broken?

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,440

121
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,720
Is this it?

124
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,080
Why didn't I notice it?

125
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,920
If you like it, I can give it to you.

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,600
What?

127
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,960
It's just a brooch.

128
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,600
This should be it.

129
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,720
Miss,

130
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,960
Can we talk outside?

131
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,280
Stop acting.

132
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,680
Enough.

133
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,160

134
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,600
Give it to me.

135
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,160

136
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,080
Don't...

137
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,090
This is sexual harassment.

138
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,680
I'm not saying this.

139
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,080
Can you stop making these disgusting scenes?

140
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,520

145
