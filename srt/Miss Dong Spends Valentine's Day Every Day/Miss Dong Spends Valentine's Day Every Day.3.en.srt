1
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
You scared me.

2
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,960
Is it a nightmare?

3
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,080
Lin Mochen

4
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,600
is so unlucky.

5
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,330
I think I'm really stuck in the circulation of Valentine's Day.

6
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,880
This circulation is a bit weird,

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,160
and I met a stalker with bad luck.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,440
But before the accident,

9
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,240
before the accident.

10
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,800
Then

11
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,760
I think we can go on a date.

12
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,200
Sorry, Miss.

13
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,600
I have a heart condition.

14
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,960
Gosh.

15
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,120
Your operation is amazing.

16
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
It's like a novel is in reality.

17
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,400
It's nothing.

18
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
I can teach you.

19
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,760
I don't think it's a good idea.

20
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,880
It's okay.

21
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,760
Come on.

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,000
Sit down.

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,079
This is the headset.

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,320
This is moving.

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,760
This is a skill.

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,880
Don't look at me. Look at the screen.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,560
You're a minor.

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,490
How dare you flirt with a girl here?

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,260
You're a minor?

30
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
Then why did you come to the internet cafe to play games?

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,080
I'm an adult tomorrow.

32
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,480
Why don't you celebrate my birthday with me tomorrow?

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,640
You may never

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,280
you may never grow old.

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,480
I'm sorry, young kids are immature.

37
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,800
Why don't I treat you to dinner and apologize to you?

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,920
Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,600
You held her hand before she agreed.

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm your captain. How could you talk to me like that?

41
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,520
Wait.

42
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
Don't you need training?

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,440
Yeah, don't you two have training today?

44
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,079
Let's go.

45
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,680
No.

46
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,720
Now you know the training.

47
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,240
I'm your leader. What are you doing?

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
You're the worst.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,680
What are you doing?

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,740
What are you doing?

51
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,090
He's gone. Go after him.

52
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,640
What are you doing?

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,040
Ah!

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,020
Where did you come from

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,560
What's wrong with him

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
No.

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,520
Why do I feel this plot is familiar?

58
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,160
What should we write next?

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,800
A uniform temptation.

60
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,240
I just finished the campus romance.

61
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,649
The captain is good.

62
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,400
Dong Wei Wei.

63
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,960
The theme of the captain is too vulgar.

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,000
Change it to E-sports and sweetness.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,880
E-sports theme needs sweetness.

66
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,680
Let's be jealous.

67
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,120
This is my novel.

68
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,960
It turns out to be so ridiculous in reality.

69
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,320
Lin Mochen bought my copyright.

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,600
Now it's the same plot.

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,960
Did I wear it in my novel?

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,740
You have to explain it to me today.

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,640
Why did you buy my novel?

74
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,120
You don't want to make money.

75
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,280
I just think

76
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,200
my novel

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,000
is bad.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
Don't worry.

79
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,650
I won't break the contract.

80
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,640
And my novel is already in front of me.

81
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,500
Don't tell me it's a coincidence.

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,240
Are you too stressed and tired recently?

83
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
I'm very sober.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,240
Then you had a nightmare and didn't rest well.

85
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
Don't change the subject.

86
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,380
Tell me. Why are you following me?

87
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,160
I like you.

88
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,920
I like you.

89
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,480
Yes, I have a crush on you.

90
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
You're a pervert.

91
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm going to call the police.

92
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,760
Did I hear your heartbeat?

93
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,640
Stop pretending.

94
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm not that strong.

95
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,240
Are you feeling better?

96
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
Lin Mochen! Lin Mochen!

97
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,080
Gosh.

98
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,040
Again?

99
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,360
I knew it.

100
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,800
Lin Mochen, it's a bargain for you.

101
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,480
Wait.

102
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,200
According to the drama,

103
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,960
Shouldn't you wake up?

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,500
The elevator is ready.

105
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,200
Hey.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,159
I owe you, Lin Mochen.

107
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,080
I was unlucky in my previous life.

108
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,400
I met you.

109
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,680
Oh.

110
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,600
Aren't you an alien?

111
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,880
Don't pretend to faint now.

112
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Ah.

113
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,800
Ah.

114
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Senior.

115
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,960
Kang-woo.

116
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,320
What are you doing here? What are you doing here?

117
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,280
I couldn't sleep that night.

118
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,400
Then I walked to your downstairs.

119
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,680
Senior, why are you still with him?

120
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,120
He suddenly fainted. I...

121
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,080
He's a stalker. Don't you know?

122
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,000
I can't just let him die.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,320
No, haha.

124
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,080
I thought

125
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,159
you only cared about me.

126
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Stop pretending, little brother.

127
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,120
Hey.

128
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,860
Let me do it.

129
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,080
Ah.

130
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,810
You don't look like a dog today.

131
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,320
What?

132
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Oh, nothing.

133
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,760
Luckily, you're a normal person.

134
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,800
Ah.

135
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,200
I said you're a good person.

136
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,320
Well, no.

137
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,080
