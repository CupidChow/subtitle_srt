1
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,720
Why did I sleep for so long?

2
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,160
Where am I?

3
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,160
Hello

4
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,360
Ah

5
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,479
Ah.

6
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,360
Oh my god.

7
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,560
What is that?

8
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,240
Is it real or a dream?

9
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,360
So scary.

10
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,600
So scary.

11
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,800
No, I'm not going anywhere today.

12
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, at home.

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,490
I'm not going anywhere.

14
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,560
Dong Wei Wei is working overtime today.

15
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,120
Sorry, boss.

16
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
I might catch a cold today.

17
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,200
I can't go.

18
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,720
Humph!

19
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,180
I already used this trick.

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,240
I told you I caught a cold.

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,160
Miss Dong Wei Wei.

22
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,800
Congratulations. She got the product trial experience from our company.

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,240
Excuse me.

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,760
Not interested.

25
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,620
Thank you. Bye.

26
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,760
Hum.

27
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
No one wants me to go out.

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,880
Sleep at home tonight.

29
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,920
Okay.

30
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,200
It's getting dark.

31
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,440
Good, another peaceful day.

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,920
Housers, there's a fire in the apartment.

33
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,240
Please evacuate in the lobby.

34
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,400
Stop the elevator!

35
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,079
No way.

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,320
It must be a prank.

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,040
It's a prank.

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,000
Gosh.

39
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,200
Ah!

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,680
No way.

41
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,920
Do I have to die when I go out?

42
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,880
Ah!

43
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,720
Help! Help!

44
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,650
Is anyone there?

45
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,200
Help! Is anyone there?

46
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Cough.

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,360
Help! Is anyone there?

48
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,440
Somebody help me

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,920
Cough.

50
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,120
Wei Wei.

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,080
Somebody help me Somebody help me

52
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,540
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

53
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,399
Wait.

54
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,519
Are you going on a date with me later?

55
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,600
Hold tight.

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,160
Hey, you...

57
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,880
Hey.

58
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,079
Cough.

59
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,250
Why are you here?

60
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,960
I was just passing by.

61
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,400
You're doing well.

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
What do you mean?

63
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,980
Do you want something bad to happen to me?

64
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,240
Hey.

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,840
Ah.

66
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,680
Wait.

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,360
So my sweet love belongs to you.

68
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,760
What did you say?

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,560
I don't understand at all, okay?

70
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,000
Where is he?

71
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,320
I don't know.

72
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,800
I'm just a stalker.

73
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,560
Yes.

74
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,840
I don't believe

75
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,240
You...

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,720
How did you get in?

77
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,159
Miss, can you do me a favor?

78
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,280
Are you...

79
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,600
Someone is chasing me.

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,240
Can you let me hide here?

81
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,360
Who are you?

82
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,280
I'm just a loser.

83
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,360
Thief!

84
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,200
It's quite interesting.

85
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,880
Ah.

86
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,440
What's wrong?

87
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,840
Someone is chasing me.

88
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
You'll help me, right?

89
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,720
No.

90
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,200
You're trespassing.

91
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,080
No, I want to call the police.

92
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,680
Hey.

93
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,000
What's going on?

94
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,080
I heard a thief broke into your house.

95
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,400
I'm here to save you.

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,080
This is also trespassing.

97
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,000
No.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,240
Now it's a battle between men.

99
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,320
Are you crazy?

100
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh my god.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,680
What are you talking about?

102
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,740
Stop fighting.

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,760
Hit outside, you hear me?

104
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,640
Hey.

105
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,640
So powerful

106
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,360
So handsome

107
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,040
Gosh.

108
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,600
This world is getting more and more ridiculous.

109
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,240
No.

110
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
I won't go out today.

111
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
Ah!

112
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
Don't be afraid. I'm not a pervert.

113
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,520
Get out!

114
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,640
Actually, I...

115
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,280
You're not leaving?

116
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,010
I'm leaving.

117
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,880
This is for you.

118
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,040
Happy Valentine's Day.

119
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,240
I will never be happy again.

120
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,600
Dating every day

121
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,040
is more tiring than working.

122
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,880
Yes.

123
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,400
Why did I sleep for so long?

124
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,040
How did you get in?

125
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,640
I called you many times, but you didn't answer.

126
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,480
I was worried about you.

127
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,680
so I asked the landlord to open the door.

128
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,840
Can I sit here?

129
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,679
Ah.

130
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,200
You have a fever.

131
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,400
and put it on for you.

132
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,680
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,860
I didn't ask for your permission.

134
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
Have a good rest.

135
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,800
I won't bother you.

136
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,600
Wait.

137
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,080
Let me take you somewhere.

138
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,880
Let me tell you.

139
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,960
It's really scary.

140
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,120
I saw him that day.

141
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,960
He has no face.

142
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,860
Shameless?

143
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,360
Miss, what's up?

144
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,520
Well...

145
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,880
How dare you!

146
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,560
Why are you scolding me?

147
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,600
It's not like that.

148
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,460
He really has no facial features.

149
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,560
Forget it. You won't believe me anyway.

150
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,200
I believe you.

151
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,280
I mean, I believe.

152
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
You mean you're trapped in this day?

153
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,560
Not exactly.

154
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,200
I'm trapped in this world.

155
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
This world?

156
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,400
Come to think of it, Lin Mochen is a little strange.

157
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,200
What else did he tell you?

158
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,000
Are you stressed out from writing novels?

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
Maybe you've watched too many movies lately.

160
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,600
I advise you

161
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,840
watch less movies.

162
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,840
That way, you'll overthink.

163
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,440
Movie?

164
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,040
Yes.

165
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,810
Let's watch a movie.
