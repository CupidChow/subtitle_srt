1
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,800
Well...

2
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,600
Actually, you look better without glasses.

3
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,840
Oh, right.

4
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,000
Should I take you upstairs?

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,479
No, thanks.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
I had fun today.

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,160
Thank you.

8
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,640
See you tomorrow.

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,360
Okay.

10
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,720
Bye.

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,000
You're quite lucky today.

12
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Pervert stalker.

13
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,320
Help!

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Lower your voice.

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,400
Lower your voice.

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,079
Who are you?

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,730
Why are you here?

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,440
I have something to do.

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,280
About work.

20
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Liar. I saw you several times today.

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,520
You're mistaken.

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,320
Miss Dong.

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,500
You'll be struck by lightning if you lie.

24
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,880
It's just a coincidence.

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,120
No way.

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,880
Again?

27
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,480
What did I say?

28
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,560
You said you weren't a pervert stalker.

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,000
Have you always been so superstitious?

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,560
Aren't you scared at all?

31
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,360
Ah.

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,079
Why are you always like this?

33
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,760
Did he target me when he bought the copyright?

34
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,720
No, maybe he came to buy the copyright

35
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,079
to buy the copyright.

36
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,340
I bought your copyright because your novel is good.

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,480
How did he know what I was thinking?

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,800
I can tell from your face.

39
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
What are you thinking?

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,480
Is he a hacker who investigates others?

41
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,320
who sells information?

42
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,280
You didn't have to follow me.

43
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,480
Don't tell me he's looking for a chance to kill me.

44
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,560
Then, human trafficking.

45
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,800
Ah!

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,960
Madam, I can sue you for sexual harassment.

47
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,280
There's no knife.

48
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,520
I know karate.

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,360
Don't think too much.

50
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,320
Take a rest.

51
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,760
I'll be fine tomorrow.

52
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,200
Ah.

53
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,000
Dream on.

54
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,000
How did I get back yesterday?

55
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,760
When did I change my clothes?

56
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,560
Is Lin Mochen still outside?

57
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,480
Jiang Yu.

58
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,320
Yes, Kang-woo looks reliable.

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Hey.

60
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,920
I remember I added him yesterday.

61
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,040
You look better without glasses.

62
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,610
Happy Valentine's Day.

63
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,640
Again? It's already past Valentine's Day.

64
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,940
This is for you.

65
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,370
Happy Valentine's Day.

66
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,040
Isn't Valentine's Day over?

67
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,200
You're not awake yet, are you?

68
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
It's February 14 today.

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,640
But yesterday, you already...

70
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Oh, sorry.

71
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,920
I'll buy you a new one.

72
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,520
I can't say no, right?

73
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,400
Hey.

74
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,400
Flower.

75
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,220
I think I'm really stuck in Valentine's Day.

76
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll be responsible for you.

77
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,160
I don't want this dress, okay?

78
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,040
No.

79
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,920
Shake.

80
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,920
So rude.

81
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,720
Who doesn't have many brothers?

82
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,920
What's going on?

83
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,160
Is the meteor so real?

84
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,320
Again?

85
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,920
No, I need to go in for a drink.

86
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,720
to calm down.

87
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,920
Beauty, are you alone?

88
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,080
Where are you going to put your hand?

89
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,120
None of your business.

90
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,640
Ah!

91
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,840
You're quite strong.

92
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,280
Let's go.

93
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,480

94
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,500
I've been waiting for you all day.

95
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,920
Someone is following you?

96
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,240
Yes, he hid in our elevator.

97
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,100
What a pervert.

98
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,120
I'll protect you.

99
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,920
He's thin. You can beat him.

100
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,960
I'm going to take you down today!

101
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,700
That's him. Pervert stalker.

102
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,720
What?

103
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,760
How did I get back yesterday?

104
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
I changed my clothes.

105
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,360
How would I know

106
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,560
the last person I saw yesterday was you?

107
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
Did you fall asleep?

108
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,770
Stop talking to him.

109
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,360
Are you okay?

110
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,039
I was wrong just now.

111
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,170
Whatever. Let's go.

112
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,320
He's back.

113
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,760
He should be fine now.

114
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
Does he have any superpower?

115
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,280
Ah.

116
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,920
