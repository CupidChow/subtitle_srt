1
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,039
Stop fighting.

2
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,900
Stop fighting.

3
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,960
Here, newlyweds.

4
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,320
Come on, let's take a photo together.

5
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,880
Come closer

6
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,200
Come on. Three, two, one.

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,960
Why didn't the alarm ring today?

8
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,880
Cough.

9
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,080
Cough

10
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,280
Cough.

11
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Why are you here?

12
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
I made you breakfast.

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,479
Oh, it's okay.

14
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,960
Is the cycle really over?

15
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,520
Try it.

16
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,160
[Laughing]

17
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm in a good mood today.

18
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,920
I'll treat you out.

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,730
Let's go.

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,560
Hey.

21
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,240
Oh, right.

22
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,079
I almost forgot.

23
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,800
I have a gift for you.

24
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,380
Why don't you wait for me downstairs?

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,120
Okay.

26
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,440
I think it's really over.

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Hello, Jack Wang.

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,760
Dong Wei Wei seems to have found something.

29
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,440
Finish it before she finds out.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,440
Happy Valentine's Day.

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,880
Ah.

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,880
Ah no

33
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,240
It's not true, right?

34
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,360
I'm already married.

35
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,820
This...

36
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,880
Wei Wei.

37
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,480
Kang-woo.

38
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,280
What's the date today?

39
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,320
February 14.

40
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,079
Then why did he...

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,800
No.

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,320
I have to ask Lin Mochen.

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Lin Mochen.

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,160
Lin Mochen.

45
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,520
Impossible.

46
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,040
Kang-woo, did you see it?

47
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,520
There were words on the white board.

48
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,560
It's gone now.

49
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,200
There's no word.

50
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,800
No.

51
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,280
Oh no.

52
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,120
I might be trapped in this place forever.

53
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,880
Wei Wei, I'm here to tell you something.

54
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,450
You found something wrong too, right?

55
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,360
A B.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,060
I've been feeling a bit confused lately.

57
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Because I always dream about things I've never done before.

58
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,840
It feels like time has passed,

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,280
but it never flows.

60
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,920
Yes.

61
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,760
Finally, someone is like me.

62
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,040
I dreamed

63
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,360
I wanted to marry you.

64
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,400
We only met once.

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,880
How could we have so many memories?

66
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,680
Because it's not a dream.

67
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,400
It's all true

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:51,920
Ah.

69
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
I need to ask Lin Mochen.

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,200
Wait.

71
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,040
Sit down.

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,320
You asked so many times. Any result?

73
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,320
He's a total liar.

74
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,040
But he has friends, right?

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,720
That pervert.

76
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,300
What friends does he have?

77
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,640
He must have friends.

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Jack Wang.

79
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
I have an idea.

80
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,600
Yoyo.

81
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,240
Just say it.

82
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,040
I came out behind my boss's back.

83
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,520
Why are you here?

84
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,180
How can I catch you if I don't disguise as Youyou?

85
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,620
Tell me, what's Lin Mochen's secret?

86
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,240
Nothing.

87
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,120
You won't tell me?

88
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,280
I can only tell Lin Mochen

89
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,600
your relationship with Shengyou.

90
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
I have nothing to do with you.

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,560
It's okay.

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,040
Then what is this?

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm fascinated by women.

94
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,380
I wanted to pursue her.

95
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,880
But I've given up now.

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
I've met Yoyo.

97
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,640
She's not that simple.

98
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,080
What did she tell you?

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,000
Tell me Lin Mochen's secret first.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,640
Wait.

101
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,360
Is there a possibility

102
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,040
you came to trick me without knowing anything?

103
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,400
The negotiation failed.

104
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,680
Let's go to Lin Mochen first.

105
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,210
Let's go.

106
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:15,960
Hey.

107
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,640
What's wrong?

108
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,770
I can't tell you his secret.

109
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,280
Or he can kill me.

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
But you can try to get something from him.

111
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,880
He may look tough,

112
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,680
but he can't hold his liquor.

113
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,280
One cup.

114
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,280
I can't drink.

115
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
You can drink.

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,480
Besides, As a boss, you can't drink.

117
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,680
I always drink on my behalf.

118
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,240
If you don't drink,

119
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,720
Then I'll drink Kwon-joo.

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,020
Aren't you going to drink too?

121
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,320
Are you

122
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,360
take the wrong medicine?

123
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,960
Do you want some?

124
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,520
Yes.

125
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,960
I'm a good drinker.

126
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,800
Hey.

127
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,840
Miss Dong.

128
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,240
This is not fair.

129
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm just kidding.

130
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
Hahaha.

131
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,000
How about this?

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,320
Let's play a game.

133
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,600
Truth or Dare.

134
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,720
If you can't answer, drink.

135
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,720
Answer what?

136
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,400
You swear first.

137
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,240
If there is a lie,

138
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,159
the company will go bankrupt.

139
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,240
The girl I love ran away with someone else.

140
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,200
and die alone forever.

141
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,440
You swear first.

142
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,680
Okay.

143
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,560
I swear.

144
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,080
I swear too.

145
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,040
this world will restart regularly, right?

146
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,480
You know the rules, right?

147
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
How can you help me escape?

148
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,159
Lin Mochen, you...

149
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,440
Yes. Stop.

150
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,200
Now it's my turn to ask you a question.

151
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,640
You can ask me anything.

152
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,280
Do you have someone you like?

153
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,960
What?

154
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Let's go. I'll take you home.

155
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,600
No.

156
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,480
When I open my eyes, it's February 14th.

157
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
I can't stand it anymore.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,720
I want to go home with you.

159
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,560
Hey.

160
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,920
Can you be more reserved?

161
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,960
I'm going home with you.

162
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,040
Water.

163
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,120
Waiter.

164
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,559
Come on, help her.

165
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,559
Ah

166
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,679
Be careful Don't pull off your pants

167
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,039
Take off your pants

168
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,840
Hahaha

169
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,320
Hey

170
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,720
Oh.

171
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,280
Why did you bring her here?

172
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,400
Did you ask her to drink with me?

173
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,800
[Laughing]

174
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,080
I...

175
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,680
Hey.

176
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,800
Boss.

177
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Hey.

178
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,400
Boss

179
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,320
I can't help it. I'm in a hurry.

180
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,960
I didn't betray you.

181
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,280
Just send her back.

182
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,000
It's dangerous to stay here.

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,800
It's okay. Just let her sleep.

184
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,600
If she discovers us,

185
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,720
I...

186
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,040
I don't want to lie to her anymore.

187
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,960
No.

188
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,370
Have you forgotten how long you prepared?

189
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,120
It's normal to feel guilty.

190
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,680
But we're almost there.

191
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,120
We can't give up.

192
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm afraid if she finds out,

193
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,240
she can't handle it.

194
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,160
