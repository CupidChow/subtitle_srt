1
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,600
I'm Lin Mochen.

2
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,479
A woman is working with the boss and engineer

3
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
With this city as the background,

4
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,800
1:1 set up a space.

5
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,039
Visual, hearing, smell, touch

6
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,600
All thoughts can be simulated.

7
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,720
and immersive.

8
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
In order to develop this game,

9
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,120
I read dozens of romance novels and sweet dramas.

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,200
I thought the game was perfect.

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,200
until I met Dong Wei Wei.

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,370
Happy Valentine's Day.

13
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
What a surprise.

14
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,120
What's going on

15
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,840
Why are there so many men around my house?

16
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,460
This is for you.

17
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,850
Happy Valentine's Day.

18
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,079
I shouldn't have worn pajamas.

19
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,480
Lazy style is cute too.

20
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,600
Just be yourself

21
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,400
Thank you.

22
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,640
Thank you.

23
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,880
Soy milk is for free.

24
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,120
So sweet.

25
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,800
Are you okay?

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,480
Sorry, I was distracted.

27
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,360
It's okay

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,079
Oh, sorry.

29
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,480
Let me take you to buy a new one.

30
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,160
No, it's okay.

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,240
Goodness.

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,200
I'll be responsible for you.

33
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,960
No, it's just a piece of clothes.

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,280
This is too expensive.

35
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
My pajamas...

36
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,570
I'm glad you like it.

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,960
No.

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Take this dress as a gift for this lady.

39
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,360
No, I bought it for her.

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,090
This is a designer of our brand.

41
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,040
So what?

42
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,640
This is a gift for Wei Wei.

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,640
Wei Wei, it's my honor to wear it.

44
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,640
Greasy. Please understand the situation before you flirt.

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,000
I know what's going on.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
What do I need to know?

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,160
I don't want this dress, okay?

48
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,000
No.

49
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,040
Shake.

50
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,079
So rude.

51
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,400
Who doesn't have many brothers?

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,920
What's wrong with me today?

53
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
My wish came true.

54
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,079
But I think I went too far.

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,800
What bar?

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,080
There are so many people in broad daylight.

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,200
Excuse me.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,680
Let's have a drink.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,200
Gosh, there's a lot of girls today.

60
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,159
Thank you for just now.

61
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,040
It's okay.

62
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,700
You looked confused just now.

63
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,480
Senior.

64
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,680
You're also from a luxurious university.

65
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,480
Yes, I saw you before.

66
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,000
I asked for your phone number.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,240
I was too shy to call.

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,800
So you're a junior.

69
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,200
Which year are you in?

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,880
Two Two

71
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,160
So small.

72
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,120
Really?

73
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,640
I haven't been back to school for a long time.

74
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,000
Is the bowl of mixed noodles still there?

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,480
You'll know if you try it.

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,840
But I remember graduates aren't allowed to go to school.

77
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,640
I have an idea.

78
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
Senior.

79
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,220
Where did you come from? Take a guess.

80
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,320
Yes.

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,760
You look younger.

82
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,700
You're not old anyway.

83
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,400
By the way, where did you say you saw me before?

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,159
I noticed you

85
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,880
I noticed you.

86
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,090
You were climbing the wall, right?

87
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,360
Ah.

88
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,760
Let's go.

90
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,440
Have I seen this person before?

91
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,840
Wei Wei, take a photo for us.

92
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,240
Okay.

93
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,840
Okay.

94
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,280
Are you here alone?

95
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,080
No, I have Lam.

96
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,440
We've been living together for a long time.

97
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
She won't abandon me.

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,680
Lam.

99
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,040
Ah

100
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,040
[Laughing]

101
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,040
Hahaha

102
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
I've been through a series of setbacks,

103
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
Fortunately, my novel has finally signed.

104
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
Party A is a handsome guy.

105
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,600
Wei Wei, you finally meet Bo Le.

106
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,000
Go and see Mr. Lin off.

107
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
It's so awkward.

108
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,400
It's unlucky today.

109
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,760
Don't be superstitious.

110
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,840
Are you okay?

111
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you.

112
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,320
Are you free tonight?

113
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,480
Ah.

114
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,720
Let's have dinner together.

115
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,040
Sure.

116
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,050
See you tonight.

117
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,280
Is this a date? Already?

118
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,680
I don't know if I look good from this angle.

119
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Does it look a little swollen?

120
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,560
Why don't you take it off?

121
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,360
Do you need help?

122
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,240
Is your face okay?

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Hello?

124
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,080
Didn't we agree to submit the manuscript today?

125
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,920
What are you doing?

126
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,880
When will Long Aotian be knocked down?

127
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,280
Long Aotian.

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,280
What a shameful name.

129
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,240
Hello. Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

130
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,640
I'm the frog your friend ordered.

131
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,000
Now I'm going to scream

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,520
Lonely

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,560
Ah

134
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,840
Please. Can you give me a more reliable handsome guy?

135
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,760
Date?

136
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
You can have a good Valentine's Day.

137
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,280
Have we met before?

138
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,240
Why can't I remember?

139
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,300
He's staring at me.

140
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,080
Is he a kidnapper?

141
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
