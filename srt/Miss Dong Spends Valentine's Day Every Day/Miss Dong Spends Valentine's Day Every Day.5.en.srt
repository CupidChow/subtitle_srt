1
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,280
Must we go on a date?

2
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,440
No way.

3
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,759
I won't follow the plot.

4
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,280
I'm going to do the opposite with you today.

5
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,360
Cancel the afternoon negotiation for me.

7
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,280
No, go now.

8
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,740
I like men who do business.

9
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,520
Thank you for thinking for me.

10
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,280
But I just want to be with you now.

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,479
I don't want you to.

12
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,720
Hey, don't cancel it.

13
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,250
Your boss will be back soon.

14
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,920
Hello?

15
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,560
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,600
They only listen to me.

17
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,920
You have no ambition.

18
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,600
It's just a case.

19
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,360
I'm really happy to be with you now.

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm not happy.

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,410
Can you give me another chance?

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,920
Is that okay?

23
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
Don't you think I'm rude?

24
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,760
I like your true personality.

25
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,560
Ah.

26
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Or are you seeing someone else?

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,160
What greasy speech?

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
Don't drink too much and drown your sorrow.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,920
Who is she?

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,960
Young Lady.

31
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,840
We've broken up.

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Stop pestering me.

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,040
I regret it.

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,240
I'm sorry. I'm already in love with someone else.

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,360
No, boss.

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,800
We just met, right?

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,320
Hey.

38
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,360
Come at me if you have any complaints.

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,440
Don't hurt her.

40
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,160
Maybe he thinks he's very handsome now.

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,560
What about you two?

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
I think you really love each other.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,600
I quit.

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,800
[Laughing]

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,280
Don't get me wrong.

46
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,640
It's over between us.

47
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,600
I think

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,060
you should treat her well.

49
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,400
I know you're jealous.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,240
but I'll wait for you.

51
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,520
Why can't you understand me?

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,800
Looks like all of you will die.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,520
Ah!

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,840
Darn it.

55
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,760
It should be over now.

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,840
Hey.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,079
Hey.

58
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,600
Do we have to fall together?

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,610
Why do I keep seeing her these days?

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,000
Is she like me?

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,520
Why does this man look familiar?

62
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
Ah

63
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,320
No way. Again.

64
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
I don't believe

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
Newton's coffin plate can't be pressed.

66
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,640
My date every day is like a martial arts film.

67
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,040
Are you a ghost?

68
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,200
You walk quietly.

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm a perverted stalker.

70
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Dong Wei Wei.

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,720
Dong Wei Wei.

72
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,640
Lin Mochen, you perverted stalker!

73
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
I'll date whoever catches him.

74
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,970
Dong Wei Wei.

75
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,120
Dong Wei Wei.

76
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,720
Wei Wei.

77
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,760
Dong Wei Wei.

78
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,560
Hey, don't chase me.

79
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,080
You can go home now, right?

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,720
Get in.

81
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,040
Dong Wei Wei.

82
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,200
Let's go.

83
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,290
Mr. Lin, the car broke down.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,040
No.

85
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,640
You're a bug, right?

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,880
Why do you break the car when you get in?

87
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,040
You're the unreliable one.

88
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,280
Have you ever seen a stalker reliable?

89
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,800
You...

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,880
What?

91
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,640
Well, this is not a solution.

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,880
Dong Wei Wei.

93
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,800
Dong Wei Wei.

94
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,570
Why are you here?

95
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,520
Over there!

96
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,400
Go after him!

97
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
Okay.

98
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,520
This can't be helped.

99
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,260
What are you doing?

100
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Change seats.

101
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,240
He's quite reliable this time.

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,080
Ah.

103
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,410
I think I'm really going to fall this time.

104
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,920
Dong Wei Wei.

105
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,090

Oh.

108
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,159
By the way, let me ask you.

109
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,960
You girls Do you like flowers and applause?

110
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,740
You're really a pervert stalker.

111
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,040
Are you prejudiced against girls?

112
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,840
Am I?

113
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,240
Hey, do you need my help?

114
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,700
Did you sprain your ankle?

115
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,400
No need.

116
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,240
None of your business.

117
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,560
Oh.

118
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,360
Humph

119
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,960
Ah.

120
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,480
Hey.

121
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,850
What's going on?

122
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,120
I'm fine.

123
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,760
Look at your ankle.

124
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,920
You won't listen, right?

125
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,850
Why are you different from others?

126
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,159
Let's go. I'll take you home.

127
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Thank you.

128
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,480
What happened?

129
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,140
Why should I thank him?

130
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,640
What is this feeling?

131
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,320

Lin Mochen.

134
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,520
I don't think he's a bad guy.

135
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,360
No, no.

136
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
He might be pretending.

137
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,880
I need to calm down.

138
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
Yes, you can't trust him.

139
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,770
