1
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,080
Why did I dream of him again?

2
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,760
Gosh.

3
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,200
Why did Lin Mochen say such cheesy words?

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,880
So,

5
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,640
he didn't deny what I said yesterday.

6
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,479
Did he deny it?

7
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,520
Is he going to confess to me?

8
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
He's here!

9
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,360
Himawari.

10
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,520
Dong Wei Wei.

11
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,080
I have something to tell you.

12
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,880
Was that not a dream?

13
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,600
Yes.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,080
I like Dong Wei Wei.

15
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,840
Okay?

16
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,640
Sure.

17
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,080
I'll get you some roses.

18
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,440
Hey.

19
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,680
No.

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,280
Himawari.

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,079
Have you figured out what to say?

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,520
Yeah.

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,760
What should I say?

24
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,320
Just ask.

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,760
I have nothing to say.

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,640
Do you have someone you like?

27
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
What?

28
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,320
Answer me.

29
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,880
I know the person you like.

30
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,760
Wait.

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,320
You set me up.

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,200
Will you be happy

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,000
will you be happy?

34
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,080
I...

35
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,060
What do you want to tell me?

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,040
If you don't let me,

37
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,680
I'll go in.

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,360
Okay.

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,040
She wrote a lot of novels.

40
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,079
Let's find the confession lines from here.

41
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,840
Love is real.

42
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,320
Memories are real

43
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,480
My heartbeat is real too.

44
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,760
There's no sound in my house.

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,360
Hey.

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
What are you doing?

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
Do you have a remote control?

48
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,170
No. Search if you don't believe me.

49
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,160
Or

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,000
you are a robot?

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,480
You can control the world.

52
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,480
Hey, I...

53
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,520
Wow, the robot is so real now.

54
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm real.

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,840
The sound on the balcony

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,760
I put it up while you were away.

57
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,769
And that balloon

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,459
Jack Wang put it down there

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
Do you believe it now?

60
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,080
Oh.

61
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Does it hurt?

62
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,320
Yes.

63
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,580
The romantic atmosphere is gone.

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,120
That's not right.

65
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,480
You're a straight man.

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,840
suddenly understand romance?

67
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,450
Are you out of your mind?

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,159
Ah.

69
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Spirit piercing.

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,000
One day, you suddenly woke up.

71
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,120
Then,

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
your consciousness entered someone else's body.

73
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,960
Or

74
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
you're not Lin Mochen?

75
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,680
Oh.

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,480
Did you lose your memory?

77
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
That's why you're so nice to me.

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,360
No.

79
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,800
I have to take you to the hospital.

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,280
Oh.

81
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,520
I'm very sober.

82
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,120
I'm not sick.

83
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,640
I don't have a soul either.

84
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,600
I just want to tell you that I like you.

85
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,800
You don't believe me?

86
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,600
I'll take you to a place later.

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,640
Why did you bring me here?

88
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,200
This is where we first met.

89
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,480
How many days have I been trapped on February 14?

90
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,680
I've long forgotten.

91
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,120
I didn't.

92
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,280
I know.

93
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,409
the world is different.

94
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,920
But recently I realized

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,800
no matter how chaotic time and space is,

96
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,320
love is real.

97
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,080
Memories are real

98
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,680
My heartbeat is real too.

99
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,840
Oh, that's the problem.

100
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,770
Your heart beats faster when you get close to him.

101
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,000
Since then...

102
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,800
Yes, I did check

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,080
my heartbeat.

104
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,320
Not only that.

105
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,860
What are you doing?

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,040
Change seats.

107
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,840
Jack Wang recommended

108
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
to buy a very ugly flower.

109
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,760
But once,

110
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,159
when Youyou took you to the hotel,

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,760
I was really worried.

112
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,880
And

113
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,920
when we watch the fireworks,

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,920
Lin Mochen, look.

115
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,960
Should I hold her?

116
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,120
At that time,

117
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,160
if I should hold your hand.

118
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,000
I haven't decided yet.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,240
That day is over.

120
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,720
I knew it. You remember everything.

121
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,800
Do you believe me now?

122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,280
Then...

123
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,880
Then why did you lie to me?

124
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

126
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,760
I just found out how I feel recently.

127
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,400
When?

128
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,720
When we took wedding photos.

129
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,520
Newlyweds.

130
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,840
Let me take a photo for you.

131
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,880
Come closer.

132
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,880
Three, two, one.

133
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,120
Language can lie.

134
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,840
But the movements

135
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,520
and expressions

136
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,159
can't lie.

137
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,440
Let me ask you a question.

138
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,600
Would you be happy

139
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
