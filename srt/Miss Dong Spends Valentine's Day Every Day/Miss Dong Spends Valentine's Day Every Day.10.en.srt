1
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,720
It's not a reality show?

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,080
Keep watching.

3
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,180
This is the result of your brain scan.

4
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,160
I'm afraid there's no progress.

5
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,120
The skew was badly damaged in a car accident.

6
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,600
We think it's the organization that blocks you from sleeping.

7
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
The ability to turn short-term memories into long-term memories.

8
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,240
This disease is known as Gudfeld syndrome.

9
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,240
Did I lose my memory?

10
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,600
Then my memory

11
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,120
stopped on February 14.

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,640
Gather around.

13
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,500
Gather around.

14
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,600
Listen to me.

15
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,880
Dong Wei Wei is coming out soon.

16
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,560
She has no memories of these years.

17
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
So don't let her find out.

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,080
Otherwise, she won't be able to take it.

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,920
Okay.

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,400
What if she finds out?

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Don't worry.

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,480
I've asked all kinds of people to take him to various places.

23
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,960
He won't find out.

24
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,400
Then, Project to protect Dong Wei Wei

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,480
starts now.

26
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,680
Move.

27
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,240
Is it possible that no one can tell me the truth

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
and act with me?

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,200
It seems

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
Lin Mochen is really a good man.

31
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,000
But I have memories of the past few days.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
Don't they know?

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,640
No, I have to tell them.

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,240
Doctor, what's wrong with my brain?

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,960
Have we met before?

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,720
What do you mean?

37
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,440
Did I have a case before this?

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,760
You might have...

39
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,960
Go ahead. I'm prepared.

40
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,440
Dong Wei Wei is in the hospital.

41
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
What? Dong Wei Wei is in the hospital?

42
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,720
I saw it with my own eyes.

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,400
And I think he went because of a headache.

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,040
Could it be...

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,520
All right.

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,360
I know.

47
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,770
I'll be right there.

48
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,000
You may have

49
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,960
with you before.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,880
Ah.

51
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,079
You look disappointed.

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,210
It's good that there's no problem.

53
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,600
Just tell me the truth, Doctor.

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,680
I can really accept the reality.

55
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,840
It's really okay.

56
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,760
Then, are you...

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,320
I've recovered?

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,400
I haven't found your medical record.

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,080
No, no, no.

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,200
I mean a long time ago.

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,399
There might not be my medical record here.

62
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,640
How long is it?

63
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,279
Maybe ten or eight years

64
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,640
I don't know.

65
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,920
Maybe I had a car accident.

66
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,200
Then I lost my memory.

67
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,680
Then my memory stopped before the accident.

68
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,720
My parents and friends might not want me to see this.

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
So they lied to me

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,960
and hid it from me.

71
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,480
and didn't let me come to the hospital.

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
You don't believe me?

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,040
Take your time.

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,760
It's my job to listen to you.

75
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,360
You're so patient.

76
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
It's hot.

77
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,880
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,040
Sorry, sorry.

79
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,220
Did you burn your tongue just now?

80
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,280
Let me see.

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,920
Oh.

82
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,120
Wei Wei.

83
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,600
There's nothing wrong with this.

84
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,200
Excuse me.

85
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,240
No visitors are allowed.

86
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,680
Who is idle?

87
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,080
Besides, you were...

88
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,000
What are you doing?

89
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,080
Are you her family?

90
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,280
No.

91
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,760
Yes.

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,400
You're so rich.

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,159
Did you bribe the hospital?

94
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,800
Bribed the hospital?

95
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,120
Yes.

96
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,040
you led everyone to hide the truth of my memory loss.

97
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,440
But now I know.

98
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,360
And I've recovered.

99
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,620
Why are you crying?

100
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,480
Stop acting.

101
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,120
I can live a normal life now.

102
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Right, doctor?

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,960
What did I do?

104
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,240
Did you watch too many movies?

105
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,680
You still won't admit it?

106
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,200
Admit what?

107
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,600
Miss, I told you

108
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,090
you've never been sick.

109
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,000
Hey.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,240
I just got off work.

111
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,300
I'll take you home.

112
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,960
No need.

113
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,200
Your family is here.

114
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,160
Who's your family?

115
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,120
Liar.

116
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,840
What did I lie to you?

117
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,240
Liar.

118
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,800
What did I lie to you?

119
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,080
Liar.

120
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,210
What did I lie to you?

121
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,960
She was so touched just now.

122
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,480
Tsk

123
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,840
That's hot

124
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
I know.

125
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,800
No matter what happens tomorrow,

126
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,600
or what happens in your life,

127
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,920
I'm happy right now.

128
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,420
Because I love you.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
I'm happy too, PTO.

130
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,220
I'm happy too, PTO.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,600
Yes, find your true love.

132
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,480
This is reliable.

133
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,040
Why didn't I think of that?

134
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,320
The world is full of sweet love stories.

135
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,520
Isn't it a test?

136
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,040
Humph, finding true love

137
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,960
True love

138
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,320
It must be me.

139
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
She's my inspiration muse.

140
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,280
She's my dream girl.

141
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,600
Are you her dream lover?

142
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,090
It can't be that simple.

143
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,840
According to the movie,

144
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,520
there must be a ceremony to prove true love.

145
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,920
Marry him!

146
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,040
Marry him!

147
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,920
Marry him!

148
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,000
No way.

149
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,840
Is it so tacky?

150
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,640
Should I get married?

151
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,120
But in this world,

152
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,680
It's normal to be sweet.

153
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,520
Hey. I don't see that perverted stalker today.

154
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,480
That crazy stalker.

155
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,760
is behind you.

156
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
What can I do for you?

157
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,000
Miss, be gentle.

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,730
Turn around.

159
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,480
Do you have a crush on me?

160
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,440
Did I?

161
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,960
Who told you that?

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,440
You said it yourself.

163
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,120
Does he have any memories of the past?

164
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Why can't I remember?

165
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,760
Stop pretending.

166
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,960
You asked me out alone that day.

167
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,120
Do you have something to tell me?

168
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,880
It's very romantic.

169
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,400
You've already ordered it.

170
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,840
Do you want me to propose in person?

171
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,760
Oh.

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,159
I remember now.

173
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,919
Is it about

174
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
the contract?

175
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,600
Ah.

176
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,840
I heard everything.

177
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,610
You really don't follow the rules.

178
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,720
Forget it.

179
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,160
I guess you're not my true love.

180
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,640
Boss.

181
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,680
This is a great opportunity.

182
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay?

183
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,160
I'm really crazy.

184
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,840
How could my true love be him?

185
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,120
Right? It's you.

186
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,160
Do we know each other?

187
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,120
Yes.

188
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,720
Are you free later?

189
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,600
Of course.

190
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,760
Where are we going?

191
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,920
Marriage.

192
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,800
What?

193
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,800
