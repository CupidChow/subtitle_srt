1
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,920
What is Qixi Festival?

2
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,360
Wow, the runaway bride.

3
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,200
Miss.

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
How can I help you?

5
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,080
I ran away.

6
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,720
Oh, the family arranged a marriage.

7
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,440
You're going to find your first love.

8
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,240
Let's go.

9
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,000
Hello, Lin Mochen.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,460
How is it going over there?

11
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,479
Don't worry.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,240
I will bring him back.

13
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,240
Why aren't you getting married?

14
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,840
I can't give her a better life.

15
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,680
I can't let her suffer with me.

16
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,440
I'll take

17
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,720
your paintings.

18
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
I've been too tired lately.

19
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,720
I didn't even hear the alarm.

20
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,480
What day is it today?

21
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,560
Singles' Day.

22
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,680
Come on.

23
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,280
What's going on

24
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,680
Today is a bachelor festival.

25
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,560
No couple.

26
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,600
No lovers

27
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,880
I didn't show off my affection.

28
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,200
Great.

29
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,800
Louder the music.

30
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,160
[Laughing]

31
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,079
You need to change your clothes.

32
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,860
What's wrong with my clothes?

33
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,540
You can only wear black today.

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,960
Okay, cool.

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,920
[Laughing]

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,160
Cheers.

37
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,480
Come on, cheers.

38
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,360
Why is there no news?

39
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,210
He went to celebrate the festival too.

40
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,080
We have to focus on ourselves today.

41
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,480
Don't care about others.

42
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
That makes sense.

43
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,520
Cheers.

44
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,240
Sorry.

45
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,560
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

46
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,800
Gosh.

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Did he block me?

48
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,400
Forget it.

49
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,340
As long as she's happy.

50
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,200
I'll blow it up.

51
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,440
Four four four.

52
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,920
I'm happy,

53
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,720
No, right?

54
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
But how can we clear the stage?

55
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,480
Lin Mochen's watch is useless.

56
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,320
There's no strategy.

57
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's go out and play.

58
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,600
Let's go.

59
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,360
What are you waiting for?

60
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,640
Hurry up

61
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,720
Wait a minute.

62
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,920
Is it because of

63
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,400
because of the single day?

64
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Hey.

65
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,320
Ouch.

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,360
Vivi.

67
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,360
Are you a traitor among us?

68
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,080
No.

69
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
How is that possible?

70
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,280
Come on, dance.

71
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,880
Why do I keep thinking about him?

72
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,880
How many days have I been trapped in February 14?

73
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
I've long forgotten.

74
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
I didn't.

75
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,680
I know.

76
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,810
the world is different.

77
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,320
But recently I realized

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,200
no matter how chaotic time and space is,

79
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,720
love is real.

80
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,480
Memories are real

81
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,080
and my heartbeat is real.

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,320
Wei Wei, where are you going?

83
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,080
You guys go play.

84
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,040
I'm leaving.

85
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,960
Okay.

86
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,840
Lin Mochen.

87
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
Where are you?

88
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,200
I'll stop pretending.

89
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,160
I just want to see you.

90
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,480
Wei Wei.

91
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,290
What's going on?

92
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,480
Lin Mochen.

93
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Lin Mochen.

94
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,000
I...

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,840
I... What are you talking about, Wei Wei?

96
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,320
I can't say I miss you.

97
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,520
Why can't I hear you?

98
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,720
Ah.

99
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,180
I think my arm is cramping.

100
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,159
Hey.

101
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,880
Wei Wei.

102
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,520
How can the game system control your body?

103
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,360
Wait here.

104
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
I'll go upstairs.

105
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,160
What do you mean?

106
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,840
I don't understand.

107
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,680
Just stand where you are.

108
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,120
I'll be right back.

109
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,000
Hey.

110
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,920
Who's picking up the phone?

111
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,040
The gate is jumping.

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,960
Push it up.

113
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,320
How is it?

114
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,760
See?

115
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,960
By the way,

116
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
What did you want to tell me just now?

117
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
I said

118
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,300
I'll stop pretending.

119
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,400
