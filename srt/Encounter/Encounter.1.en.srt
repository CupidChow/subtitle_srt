1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,850
Encounter

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,190
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,650
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,510
Boyfriend

5
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,960
Yes, I'm Cha Jong Hyeon who keeps promises.

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,300
Please take care of me.

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,620
Cha Soo Hyeon, the daughter of Candidate Cha Jong Hyeon,

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,060
is well-known for her beautiful appearance

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,630
and is as popular as a celebrity.

10
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,160
After winning a victory in this election, Cha Jong Hyeon, the mayor of Seoul, assumed the office.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,380
The marriage of Cha Soo Hyeon and President Jeong Woo Seok, son of Taekyeong Group CEO Jeong Chan Wook,

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,400
has been sensational for powerful political and chaebol families ...

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,690
Living a life as a daughter-in-law of a chaebol family ...

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,660
Cha Soo Hyeon is seeing off her father-in-law.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,280
There has been speculation about the marriage.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,440
The marriage has come to an end after 2 years.

17
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,200
Episode 1

18
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,110
All rooms are fully booked on the opening day.

19
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,220
Considering it's a low season, the reservation rate is pretty amazing.

20
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,280
Not to mention the quality of facilities, the fact that every single piece of furniture is top-notch

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,740
has been appealing to consumers.

22
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,520
The view is magnificent.

23
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,610
It's time to go to work, CEO.

24
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,270
Donghwa Hotel, Sokcho, Opening Plan

25
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,420
Could we stop by the rest area and take a rest?

26
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,600
Would you like to have a cup of tea? If it's because of me, I'm fine.

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,270
I can't stand Secretary Jang suppressing her yawns.

28
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,190
Madam, I'll go buy a refreshing bottle of water.

29
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,380
Instead of water, how about having a bowl of ramen?

30
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,480
Ramen?

31
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,710
What's wrong? Is it a problem?

32
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:15,820
No... I was a bit traumatized by what happened before, and I don't want pictures to be taken again.

33
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,940
But if you want it, I'll buy you a bowl.

34
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,120
I'm joking.

35
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,590
- I'll just stay put, too.
- It's fine. Go ahead.

36
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,290
Okay.

37
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,810
Ramen is perfect for rest area.

38
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,360
Donghwa Hotel

39
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,590
Would you like to go to the hotel, CEO?

40
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,130
I'd like to go to the office building.

41
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,910
This outfit is sent from Hannam-dong.

42
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,430
It's consistent with my taste.

43
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,210
However, the highlight with the buttons is lovely.

44
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,310
Up until what age do I have to work?
It won't be until I'm in my sixties, right?

45
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,840
If Madam is in her sixties, then Chairwoman Kim would be over one hundred.

46
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,730
Even if you eat a lot of good food, being older than 100 years is too much.

47
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,430
She usually likes the situation where she can enjoy things that take people by surprise.

48
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,360
She is such a bad ass.

49
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,820
That word is disrespectful, but I like it.

50
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,860
I do think we should have taken out the clause.

51
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,670
The clause in the divorce agreement about attending the birthday party of your ex-mother-in-law is really nonsensical.

52
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,110
If I tried taking out that clause, she would have never let me go.

53
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,380
That makes sense.

54
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,380
I was relieved that Chairman Jeong passed away, but a much scarier one, your ex-mother-in law, became the chairwoman.

55
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,470
Every single thing is wrong.

56
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,260
Doesn't the car belong to CEO Cha Soo Hyeon?

57
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,160
- Right! Right! Right!
- CEO Cha!

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,770
Go! Go! Go! Quickly take a picture!

59
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,500
CEO, please look at the camera!

60
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,100
Look this way once!

61
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,430
Ah, yes. You did a great job.

62
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,880
Thank you, Chairwoman.

63
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,080
Happy birthday.

64
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,330
Oh, you're here? And how is your father?

65
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,850
Yes.

66
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,940
He must be very busy now that he is a party representative.

67
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,160
Yes, he is.

68
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,630
Okay, give me a second.

69
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,640
That suits you well.

70
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,840
The bag is little too much.

71
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,070
You're here?

72
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,450
It's been a while. Nice to see you.

73
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,730
It's not that nice.

74
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,450
I thought you were such a fool, when you asked for a rundown hotel as alimony.

75
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,810
I hear the news that it's number one in the industry and you're expanding to Cuba?

76
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,550
Thank you. Won't you marry someone again?

77
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,750
You pay me some attention? I'm really grateful.

78
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,110
If she has a new daughter-in-law, she won't be needing to see me anymore.

79
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,180
My mom would probably have two presents. My mom is special.

80
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,260
It's not a joking matter. It'd be great if you would take care of it for me.

81
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,050
If I take care of it, would you be nice to me?

82
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,310
You're still attractive, Cha Soo Hyeon. Your cold face.

83
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,460
You asked for a divorce to be with the woman of your life. You were pathetic.

84
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,650
What nonsense are you saying now, Jeong Woo Seok?

85
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,060
Let's eat. They prepared food for the old lady's birthday pretty well.

86
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,580
Could you move aside? I'm uncomfortable.

87
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,430
Don't you find every corner of this house uncomfortable?

88
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,870
I was being a friend to talk to.

89
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,560
- Don't you go to Namsan tunnel?
- It's stuffy.

90
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,470
It only takes one minute, but you will take a detour?

91
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,050
Driver Nam, have you been to Namsan Tower?

92
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,940
- I went there with Assemblyman Cha in college.
- With my dad?

93
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,820
We went to Namsan Library, but Assemblyman Cha wanted to go out so badly because he said it was stuffy inside.

94
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,240
I insisted that we should study.

95
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,180
- It's been refurbished. Have you been there, CEO?
- No.

96
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,700
Should we stop by to have some fresh air?

97
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,660
No, I've had enough with the photos that were taken today.

98
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,850
- Would there be reporters left?
- SNS by random people is faster these days.

99
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,730
- Could we open windows?
- The air is cold today.

100
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,190
Since you have to travel far tomorrow, you can't get a cold.

101
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,910
- What time is the departure tomorrow?
- It's 9 pm tomorrow.

102
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,250
Let's go!

103
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,580

124
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,920
Scenery is beautiful?

125
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,910
Yes, it's so beautiful.

126
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,360
It's just an old garden.

127
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,370
This garden seems to have been loved by someone a long time ago.

128
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,950
It was a beautiful time. All that was here.

129
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,140
Everything seems to be as it was.

130
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,580
It was so hard to keep up the garden.

131
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,470
It was the garden of my wife.

132
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,820
The love began here and completed here.

133
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,400
- A cola, please.
- Yes.

134
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,460
Thank you.

135
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,880
Um. It's very dangerous to text while driving.

136
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,240
Hey, my love!

137
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,390
- Please! Hang up the—
- Yes, I'm working. I have some clients right now.

138
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,520
How is it going? How fast, boy.

139
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,050
- I'm so sorry, CEO. I speak English well, but
- What did he say?

140
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,030
- it seems he doesn't speak English.
- I'll settle it with him.

141
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,210
After work, I can go with a different driver, can't I?

142
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,390
- I'll check more carefully.
-How long will it take you? How long...

143
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,340
Oh my god!

144
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,310
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

145
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,810
CEO, are you all right?

146
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,340
Secretary Jang, don't you have an international driver's license?

147
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,840
Yes, well... I haven't obtained it yet.

148
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,700
Hey, man! Are you a fool? Didn't you see me turning around the car there?

149
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,750
- I apologize. I didn't mean to...
- Do not apologize. You stepped in the middle of the path.

150
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,900
- Just a minute, man! Just a minute. You stepped in...
- This problem, let's solve it between us please.

151
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,760
The problem will be solved...

152
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,680
- You were talking on your mobile phone.
- I had to dodge you but...

153
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,650
We need to deal with that guy over there first, Secretary Jang.

154
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,040
Ah, yes.

155
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,320
- I'm going to call my boss so that you talk to him.
- Let's talk please...

156
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,040
- I'm going to call my boss.
- Calm down. Look...

157
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,970
Ah, my camera.

158
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,080
- Oh, are you Korean?
- Oh, yes.

159
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,720
I'm so sorry. Our driver caused this accident.

160
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,880
Are you hurt?

161
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,190
- I think the camera is damaged.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

162
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,470
If you let me know what kind, we will replace it.

163
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,350
It's okay. Please be on your way.

164
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,340
We also have our position.

165
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,390
If I let you go like this, it could become complicated later. Please give me your contact information.

166
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,320
I will send you the new product.

167
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,340
It was a gift from when I was born, I don't think it can be replaced.

168
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,060
Ah, well... I'm so sorry.

169
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,310
However, I can't let you go like this.

170
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,020
It looks old. Why don't you get a new one?

171
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,150
Come on! Move it!

172
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:13,620
This place has a lot of traffic. I'm not hurt, so, please. You can be on your way.

173
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,420
I will give you my contact info and be on my way. Please let me know your name and contact info. I will be in touch.

174
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,140
I'll call you, then.

175
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,470
We need to move the car. Please give me a call.

176
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,340
Donghwa Hotel, the partner Company of Havana Hotel,

177
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,260
is the first station brand that has expanded to Central and South America.

178
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,110
And now I present to you, President Cha Soo Hyeon.

179
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:13,550
It is very natural that you have chosen Donghwa as your partner to build the best hotel in Havana.

180
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,920
The reason is because we at Donghwa know

181
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,160
that the historical beauty is the best value of Havana.

182
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,310
It is very exciting that we share this value.

183
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:31,090
Havana Hotel's design will stand out for its classic beauty and modernism at the same time.

184
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,260
- That was great.
- Thank you, Cristian.

185
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,660
It will be completely finished with Havana's colors and the wind of El Malecón.

186
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,500
Thanks to its strategic location...

187
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,660
Have you seen the sunset of El Malecón Beach?

188
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,880
No, not yet.

189
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,780
That is something you should absolutely check out.

190
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,270
The color of the sunset is different every day.

191
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,560
I also proposed to my wife over there.

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,840

♬  And the smell for smelling  ♬

200
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,840
Do you want to dance?

201
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,730
- Let's go dance.
- Me?

202
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,520
No, no, thank you, no.

210
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,660
Did you settle it with the camera guy?

211
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,230
Yes, I gave him my contact information. I told him to contact me if he returned to Korea.

212
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,390
Do your best to settle it so there aren't any issues later.

213
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,360
It looks a little bit complicated, CEO.

214
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,110
The camera is pretty old and he might not accept the new camera of the same kind.

215
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,100
- Why?
- He said he's not interested in the new one of the same kind.

216
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,710
He said it's fine and told me to move the car. He was like bragging about his vintage camera.

217
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,610
He would've accepted my offer, if it were 100,000,000 KRW.

218
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:23,430
He would probably have accepted if he was offered. What a bluffer.

219
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,140
Even if it were 10,000,000 KRW, he would've quickly accepted.

220
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,150
That kind of guy would not accept.

221
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,140
Excuse me?

222
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,180
You can take a rest and dinner will be ready in an hour.

223
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,710
- Dinner will be at a local restaurant.
- I'm going to relax. Have dinner by yourself.

224
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,340
You're going to take a sleeping pill and go to bed, aren't you?

225
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,130
It'd be good for the adjustment, as I'm jet-legged.

226
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,260
The day is still bright.

227
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,760
Don't worry. You should eat, Secretary Jang.

228
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,410
But you should have dinner...

229
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,970
I'm going to have a deep sleep and then will have a quality breakfast.

230
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,300
Yes, I'll get that ready.

231
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,850
You do understand what I meant by a quality breakfast, don't you?

232
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,410
Yes, of course.

233
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,660
Good work today. I'll see you tomorrow.

234
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,370
Yes, ma'am.

235
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,160
What are you doing, Secretary Jang?

236
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,450
I'm in the middle of something.

237
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,150
So what is the 'something'?

238
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,720
- I came to somewhere I could drink.
- Already?

239
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,350
- I was thirsty.
- Alone?

240
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,030
No, I'm going to have some company.

241
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,510
- Hello
- Hello!

242
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,090
Have you ever been to El Malecón Beach?

243
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,630
No.

244
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,390
How about going there with me?

245
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,120
You should go there with a date. Why would I go there with you?

246
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,800
What kind of secretary are you?

247
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,660
I'm a secretary, but

248
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,360
I can't spend the personal time outside work with you.

249
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,060
Aren't you too happy being alone? I'm bored.

250
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,440
It's okay to be bored just for a day.

251
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,790
You're saying it out loud with the resignation letter to submit, right?

252
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,680
You started it. Hey!

253
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,500
I've written millions of resignation letters that you never accepted. Why do you always threaten me?

254
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,310
Because I am too bored.

255
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,050
Oh you're crazy.

256
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,320
You need to hang out with me.

257
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,340
That's what I'm saying. Let me enjoy, Cha Soo Hyeon.

258
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,060
Okay, have fun and return with the economy flight ticket.

259
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,020
You're petty.

260
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,950
Hello?

261
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,490
Oh my god.

262
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,610
Ah, excuse me. I wasn't informed that you needed a car.

263
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,930
It's for personal business. I want to take a taxi.

264
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,610
Where to?

265
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,790
I want to go where I can see the sunset of El Malecón Beach.

266
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,120
Then you should go to Morro Cabaña.

267
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,400
And you know what? That's the perfect place to fall in love!

268
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,730
Take her to Morro Cabaña.

269
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,010
Good luck.

270
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,840
Wait, wait. Wait a minute!

271
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,580
Don't worry, don't worry!

272
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,190
Wait a minute.

273
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,890
Sorry. Sorry, lady. My car is broken.

274
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,340
You should take the ferry from over there.

275
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,770
It will be more faster.

276
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,460
Sorry!

277
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,270
I need to keep an eye on this.

278
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,290
Casa Blanca

279
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,070
- Hello.
- Where is Morro Cabaña?

280
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,420
Up?

281
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,040
- Up?
- Up, up.

282
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,840
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

283
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,840
Thank you, little lady!

284
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,300
CEO! CEO, I called—

285
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,960
I'm sleepy.

286
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,960
Look here, pay attention. Are you okay? Are you sick?

287
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,990
I'm not sick. I'm sleepy.

288
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,990
It's okay.

289
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,040
Excuse me, have you seen a female VIP from Korea?

290
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,070
Oh, that beautiful lady? She took a taxi to go see the sunset

291
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,530
- at El Malecón Beach. Thank you!
- at El Malecón Beach to—

292
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,210
to Morro Cabaña.

293
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,900
Do you have business with me?

294
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,320
Business?

295
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,520
- But, why am I on your shoulder...?
- Ah.

296
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,960
One hour ago, you fell asleep and almost fell...

297
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,430
- Why am I dressed like this?
- What?

298
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,010
My shoe!

299
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,140
I didn't do that.

300
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,630
It fell all the way over there from your foot.

301
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,370
I'm explaining it to you since you might have misunderstood or

302
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,230
have imagine the worst because you are perhaps feeling nervous.

303
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,550
You were so sleepy that you almost fell. And in that instance, I got a hold of you.

304
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,710
So, you can be reassured. Then...

305
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,110
Help me!

306
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:56,250
Please get me my shoes.

307
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,410
It's dangerous, so just stay here for a moment.

308
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,080
He isn't a scammer.

309
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,530
It's pretty.

310
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,380
But first... the shoes.

311
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,200
It's more beautiful that the pictures inside the hotel, right?

312
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,960
Ah, it isn't in your hotel room?

313
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,660
The El Malecón Beach sunset,

314
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,430
you get 200% more feeling if you watch it with this music.

315
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,720
"If I Manage to Kiss You" by Omara Portuondo

316
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:59,010
♬  They say that your caresses  ♬

317
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,750
♬ will never be mine  ♬

318
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,980
♬ That your loving arms  ♬

319
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,790
♬ will never embrace me ♬

320
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:17,070
♬ And I dreamed last night ♬

321
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,700
♬ that you loved me ♬

322
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,730
♫ When before my love... ♫
It's symbol 2. Please mark symbol 2.

323
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,770
It's symbol 2.

324
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,750
Cha Jong Hyeon's daughter is pretty.

325
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,320
Give them a round of applause.
- Oh, you came.

326
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,920
♬ Give me a kiss and forget  ♬

327
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,110
♬ that you kissed me ♬

328
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:42,620
♬ I would give you my life ♬

329
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,610

330

331
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:55,110
♬as I have dreamed ♬

332
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,270
♬ it would be impossible ♬

333
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:04,980
♬ for you to forget me. ♬

334
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,910
♬ Give me a kiss. ♬

335
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,880
I know I've seen her somewhere.

336
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,010
Is she a celebrity?

337
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,700
Hey, hey! Is this Malecón Beach?

338
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,750
Yes, from here to there is all Malecón Beach.

339
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,420
Thank you!

340
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,960
I'll compensate you.

341
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,270
There's nothing to compensate me for.

342
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,140
I owe you.

343
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,770
It's no problem. My shoulder enjoyed it.

344
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,640
Let's just say it was a thrilling incident on my last day in Cuba.

345
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,880
Then...

346
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,080
Excuse me.

347
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,210
Do you have any money?

348
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,050
How much should I have?

349
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,460
Enough for a beer?

350
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:25,210
Why are you smiling? I'm seriously asking you.

351
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,860
No, I...

352
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,820
For you to ask for beer in this situation...

353
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,320
It was cute.

354
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,520
Just sit here and wait. I'll go buy it right away.

355
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,940
Cute?

356
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,530
Is that a good thing?

357
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,490
Good job saving it.

358
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,100
How old is he?

359
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,090
He's like a white grape.

360
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,380
You'll get drunk if you drink like that.

361
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,930
I probably have a higher tolerance than you.

362
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,110
How did you end up broke and sleeping alone?

363
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,670
That was really dangerous.

364
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,210
I came here on a business trip.

365
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,110
I wanted to go to bed early, so I took a sleeping pill.

366
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,730
That photo of the night view...

367
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,760
It must have been a strange day. It got taken by pickpockets.

368
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,820
Wow. You went through a lot today.

369
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,880
Do you remember which lodging house or hotel?

370
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,060
I think you can take a taxi if you go down toward the entrance to Morro Cabaña.

371
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,720
I'll take you there. You don't know the way, right?

372
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,360
Should we slowly go on our way, then?

373
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,940
Sure.

374
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,870
How about walking barefoot?

375
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,120
Here?

376
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,380
The way down is kind of far for me to carry you.

377
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,120
Did I ever ask you to carry me?

378
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,690
I don't think you'll be able to walk in that condition

379
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,970
There are sometimes tourists who walk barefoot.

380
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,430
I didn't see any.

381
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,930
The seniors in my neighborhood go barefoot when they exercise in the mountain behind our houses.

382
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,710
I can't.

383
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,160
If we do it together, you'll find the courage.

384
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,750
It'll also be less lonely than doing it alone.

385
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,560
Really?

386
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,870
What?

387
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,920
That the seniors in your neighborhood go hiking barefoot.

388
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,430
100%. Really.

389
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,420
Let's just say I was cast under a spell.

390
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,180
Like magic.

391
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,020
Are you a student? Or an employee?

392
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,230
I sell fruits.

393
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,010
A fruit vendor...

394
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,190
Fruit vendor?

395
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,000
Right. I'm a fruit vendor.

396
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,620
Your camera looks old.

397
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,660
It does?

398
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,810
It's exactly twenty-eight years old.

399
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,980
But it still works?

400
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,890
I did have to repair it a couple times

401
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,300
It's been functioning well,

402
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,810
but it got a bit damaged today.

403
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,510
You seem to like that model a lot.

404
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,550
Do they not sell it anymore?

405
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,620
No, they do.

406
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,760
It's not like I'm dead set on having this model.

407
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,460
My dad's friend ran a photo studio.

408
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,820
But it ended up closing down, so he gave me this camera.

409
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,780
That's when I was born.

410
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,030
When I was born, he took a lot of pictures.

411
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:34,280
Actually, my dad treasures this camera a lot.

412
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,810
Though he didn't take many pictures of me.

413
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:46,250
According to my dad, he was very busy trying to eat and live.

414
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,270
Once I was in elementary school, I took lots of pictures of my mom and dad.

415
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,780
Why are we here?

416
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,120
At the end of that alley is the main street. The road is too rough and dirty to walk barefoot.

417
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,440
Just wear a pair of these until you get to the hotel.

418
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,500
Sorry, that was rude of me.

419
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,310
Your feet are just too...

420
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:41,460
No, it's not that.

421
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,270
What shoe size are you?

422
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,750
About 230?

423
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,590
Pick one. I'll buy it for you as a gift.

424
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,100
Is the design okay?

425
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,160
No need. I'll compensate you for the shoes and beer debt.

426
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,810
I'll have to diligently write it down, since you said you'd compensate me.

427
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,760
What looks good to you?

428
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,650
Since I only need to wear them until I get to the hotel, let's get any pair and just go.

429
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,420
Anything?

430
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,860
The hardest order in the world...

431
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,450
An-y-thing.

432
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:36,230
These look a bit funny, right?

433
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,770
Anything is fine.

434
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,120
They look good to me.

435
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,620
Where'd she go?

436
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,930
Do you have anymore money?

437
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,010
I have just enough.

438
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,400
How much?

439
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,240
Enough to fill your empty stomach?

440
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,930
Here.

441
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,210
It's better than the hotel food.

442
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,960
Or is it just good because you're hungry?

443
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,140
My taste isn't that one-dimensional.

444
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,210
Salsa Night! Live Traditional Music

445
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,460
Is there any money left over?

446
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,400
Enough to buy two tickets to watch salsa.

447
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,700
What are you doing? Why are you putting it back in?

448
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,320
I'm upset because you're laughing at me when I'm not trying to be funny.

449
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,140
But you laughed a lot before, too.

450
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,440
Because I was cute. I'm also laughing because it's cute.

451
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,110
Did I just hear that is your pocket money?

452
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,570
It's a kid's spending money.

453
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,180
Then what am I supposed to do?

454
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,490
A kid's spending money is funnier than my pocket money. You look so serious.

455
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,710
I'm not laughing.

456
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,380
Do you not want to go see the salsa music?

457
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,410
Make sure you get the receipt, all of them.

458
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,960
Because you need to pay for everything.

459
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,430
Should I drink another cup of coffee?

460
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,270
Yes!

461
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,870
Did we come to the wrong place?

462
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:06,210
There's a salsa performance here?

463
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:26,390
♬  Serve me a drink of rum and drink your beer next to my heart  ♬

464
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,870
♬  You are the waitress of my love  ♬

465
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:37,470
♬ Waitress! Waitress! You are the waitress of my love  ♬

466
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:45,820
♬  Serve me a drink of rum and drink your beer next to my heart  ♬

467
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,960
Two Cuba Libre.
Cuba Libre: A drink of rum, cola, lime juice, and ice.

468
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,400
Give them a round of applause.

469
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,050
♬ Juana, the miraculous  ♬

470
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,160
♬ Juana, the miraculous  ♬

471
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:19,280
♬  She, the one who has a crazy life wherever she walks ♬

♬ Juana, the miraculous  ♬

474
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,060
It's good, right?

475
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,130
Yes!

476
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,620
♬ Juana, the miraculous  ♬

477

Let's go!

♬  Black woman, you delicious and tasty ♬

483
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,030
No.

484
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:53,150
♬  She knows how to hold liquor  ♬

485

♫ My heart beats loudly every time  ♫

501
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,280
♫ It's a beautiful day ♫

502
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:43,690
♫ A beautiful day, a day like a drawing

503
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:47,430
♫ A day like a movie  ♫

504
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:54,340
♬  That's why everyday is a beautiful day to me  ♬

505
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:03,530
♫ It's a beautiful day. It's beautiful ♫

506
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,290
Thank you for today.

507
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,930
It was fun, thanks to you.

508
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:24,300
Contact me when you go back to Korea. I'll treat you.

509
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,910
No.

510
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:30,720
Just think of it as a brotherhood extended from a foreign country.

511
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,180
You seem like a person of the old times. "Brotherhood" is a word that my father uses.

512
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,480
You think so?

513
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,370
I hear that I'm an "adult-like child" quite often.

514
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:43,820
Don't make me keep asking and just give me your contact info.

515
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,980
I'm really fine.

516
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:52,220
I did it with good intentions, but if I give you my number, you'll think I have an ulterior motive.

517
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,490
Ulterior motive?

518
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:59,910
In order to get a pretty girl's number... my hidden card.

519
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:48,160
Excuse me, but how long will you be here?

520
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:56,420
Maybe, if you have time tomorrow morning,

521
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:00,520
buy me breakfast at that cafe.

522
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:07,320
If you buy me breakfast as compensation, it will be perfect.

523
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,200
I have something I want to ask you, too.

524
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,830
Then ask me now.

525
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,890
I'll ask you tomorrow.

526
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:18,690
After refining my question.

527
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,480
How's tomorrow at 9?

528
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:32,570
I might not be able to make it out. Because I don't exactly know tomorrow's schedule.

529
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,400
I'll wait for half an hour, and if you don't come, that's fine.

530
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,410
Don't be too burdened.

531
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,390
Okay.

532
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,080
Hotel Havana, please.

533
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,290
- Thanks.
- To you.

534
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,520
Her shoes.

535
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,090
It's fortunate that I'll see her tomorrow.

536
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,720
Thank you.

537
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,510
Hey!

538
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,500
Are you really going to do this?

539
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,890
Someone's heart burst and she died looking for this bitch!

540
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:18,890
You were looking for me?

541
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,540
Why the heck didn't you answer your phone?

542
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,820
I lost it.

543
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:26,050
Being soft-hearted, I came back to play with you. The sleeping pill container was open and there was no one there!

544
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,300
I also play well by myself, Secretary Jang.

545
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,920
I didn't even imagine that you would be running around all over Havana.

546
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,740
What exactly are those shoes you are wearing?

547
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,030
My shoes!

548
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,020
Is laughter coming out?

549
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:46,640
Mi Jin, I guess I'm Cinderella.

550
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,200
Get a hold of yourself!

551
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:07,360
There.

552
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,920
What's the problem?

553
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,500
The contract needs to be re-signed. There is a missing clause.

554
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,930
Which clause?

555
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:05,670
The condition that we would keep the garden space exactly how it is.

556
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,610
Didn't we say that we will keep the garden as is?

557
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:13,140
Yes, it was handled verbally. Now that the time has come, he wants it to be part of the contract.

558
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,630
Because the hotel landowner made a complaint.

559
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:18,080
How long will this take?

560
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,070
I don't think it will take long.

561
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,830
The employee has said to come here.

562
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,360
We still have a lot of time until boarding.

563
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,930
Please confirm where he is right now.

564
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,460
Closed. Please call again.

565
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,510
Did I come too soon?

566
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,360
How much longer do we have to wait?

567
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:00,570
He did say that he's on his way, but I'll confirm again.

568

601
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,160
Thank you.

602
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,070
Departure

603
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,800
I couldn't keep my promise. I'm sorry.

604
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,560
I'm relieved I was able to meet you here, then.

605
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,740
Urgent business suddenly arose.

606
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,770
It's okay.

607
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:55,370
I'm also sorry that I knew about your camera, but didn't say anything about it.

608
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:01,390
Oh, I see you were there at that time.

609
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:05,380
It wasn't badly damaged. Please don't worry.

610
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,130
My secretary is going to look for another seat.

611
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:13,610
Think of it as my compensation and go on a business class seat.

612
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,670
No, I will go to my original seat.

613
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:20,730
I didn't even buy you breakfast. Please give me a chance to compensate.

614
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:26,600
I'm really okay. I didn't even help much to be compensated.

615
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:33,400
In the worst scenario yesterday, because of your kindness, I came safely here.

616
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:38,200
If that's the case, how about accepting my kindness as well?

617
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:51,610
In order to prepare for this trip, I worked a part-time job.

618
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,620
And this was a vacation that I've saved up for a year for.

619
01:00:54,620 --> 01:01:00,470
To fit my budget, wondering how far I can travel. I planned over a month long schedule.

620
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:06,530
And because of you, I'm in the process of ending my 20s with a happy journey.

621
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:12,020
It is a tedious thing to sit in an economy seat for 17 hours,

622
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:16,060
but that process is also one part of my trip.

623
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:23,780
It's just my desire to complete my unfinished backpacking trip well as planned.

624
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:29,630
Is that a good enough answer?

625
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,220
Okay.

626
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:39,820
Then I'll consider that I've paid my debt by good intentions.

627
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,680
Then.

628
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:22,210
Two hours earlier

629
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,330
Jang Mi Jin

630
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:35,670
Donghwa Hotel?

631
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,460
Donghwa Hotel

632
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,250
Donghwa Hotel will open its first hotel in Cuba.

633
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:50,480
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon personally departs to Cuba.

634
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,510
About that camera.

635
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:59,940
Although the model is 28 years old, it's still in production so I will order one.

636
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,270
And because 28 years is the time it was given to him is important,

637
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:05,510
make sure it's handled discretely.

638
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,370
How do you know that it's been that long?

639
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:10,840
It's just an intuition, an intuition.

640
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,940
I understand.

641
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,180
Donghwa Hotel CEO Cha Soo Hyeon departs to Cuba.

642
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:36,870
Yes, hello.

643
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:39,240
Yes, hello. This is Kim Jin Hyeok, right?

644
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,140
Yes, you're right.

645
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,650
This is Donghwa Hotel.

646
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:45,790
Yes.

647
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:49,710
You've passed the final round of the new employee interview.

648
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,890
♫  One time  ♫

649
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:08,840
Kim Jin Hyeok?

01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,440
Hello?
♫ Once, a brief moment of the day ♫

651
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,330
♫  Could it have been then?  ♫

652
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:22,140
♫  An unexplainable feeling  ♫

653
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:28,200
♫ When I'm with you, that's what I think  ♫

654

♫  That's the moment right now we're together  ♫

655
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:42,210

656
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:50,900
♫ It's beautiful time. My heart beats loudly every time ♫

Encounter
~ Preview ~

661
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:15,440
Mom suddenly called me.

662
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,010
Oh, Madam seems to miss her daughter a lot.

663
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:21,110
There's no way.

664
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,440
I have good news.

665
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,960
You really met a woman?

666
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,640
Ice Princess?

667
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,980
It's not funny.

668
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,980
I was so worried about you.

669
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:36,170
Are you concerned because I am the boss?

670
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,320
Not at all.

671
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:46,250
♫ Until now stay like this ♫

I'm sorry, but this is the seat I always sit in

675
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,870
