1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,590
Encounter

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,000
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,020
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,140
Boyfriend

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,670
What were you thinking about here?

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,940
Thoughts of you.

7
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,670
It looked like you were reading.

8
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,860
If making waves is the ocean's work,

9
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,560
thinking of you is my work.

10
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:15,330
I think it's a blessing that we have writers in this world

11
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,740
because they can express a big feeling in just a few sentences.

12
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,250
It seems like it was written by a mother thinking about her daughter.

13
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:33,030
The mother in the book and me, too. Being concerned about someone is the same.

14
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,210
Episode 10

15
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,170
I apologize to you, Guest.

16
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,750
There is an event today, so it will be difficult to serve you.

17
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,370
Our Italian restaurant has delicious food and a great view.

18
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,310
Would it be all right to have you go there?

19
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,790
- Is that all right with you?
- Yes.

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,570
The CEO did say to open the restaurant to our customers, though.

21
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,350
Hmmm... Things will get noisy again.

22
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,080
Since this is our territory, we have to protect her, right?

23
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,110
This feels a bit awkward.

24
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,980
There is not a soul here.

25
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,860
So you came directly from Teacher Lee's place?

26
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,030
Yes.

27
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,680
She said, while talking about her late husband,

28
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,680
"Will I have to die to be able to see him again?"

29
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,840
"Looking at each other when it is possible, that is a successful life."

30
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,590
She tosses her words around, but

31
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,440
her words have a deep meaning when you listen to them.

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,520
Were you spending your time by the breakwater every day?

33
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,350
I went to the beach where we played together in the sand.

34
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,730
And I went to the bench where we drank coffee together.

35
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,070
Me too. I went to the Hongje-dong playground.

36
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,890
That place will be gone soon.

37
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,170
Why?

38
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,590
I heard the old lady who owned the land has passed away, so her kids put the land on the market for a quick sale.

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
- You must be sad.
- Of course, I'm sad.

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,740
That playground and I shared time together.

41
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,650
Well, the world constantly changes.

42
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,680
We should make one more visit and take some photos before it disappears.

43
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,950
Alright. Let's go together when I come to Seoul on my day off.

44
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,780
Alright.

45
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,650
Weren't you disappointed when I said to take some time?

46
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,250
I wasn't disappointed in your words.

47
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,610
I was disappointed by something else.

48
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,750
What were you disappointed in?

49
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,440
We promised to endure with our good memories.

50
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,250
Yet you were worried that I wouldn't be able to do that.

51
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,310
That's what I was disappointed in.

52
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,850
I was bombarded with texts, and

53
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,930
I was the current issue among my classmates.

54
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,490
And my family is worried about me.

55
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,830
A storm of many different responses was raging towards me.

56
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,080
"So, do I want to hide?"

57
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,380
"Am I hesitant for a moment because I am perplexed?"

58
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,430
I had no intention to do any of that.

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,570
Although I had no solution, my willingness to resolve it was very strong.

60
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,490
"Did I look too weak to her?"

61
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,860
That's what I thought.

62
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,710
So I did wrong.

63
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,320
That's why I came running to you.

64
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,970
Please forgive me just for this time.

65
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,150
If you ask with that pretty face, I have to forgive you.

66
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,300
So I'll pay for the meal.

67
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,230
Really?

68
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,640
Eat a lot, okay? A lot.

69
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,920
I'd better eat a lot.

70
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,850
How have you been, Manager Nam?

71
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,330
Yes, I've been doing fine.

72
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,450
Yes. Actually...

73
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,330
CEO came here.

74
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,260
I'm worried about her returning.

75
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,420
I wanted to bring her back, but I have to work tonight.

76
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,010
Thank you.

77
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,250
Call me when you arrive.

78
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,590
Yes.

79
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,540
Bye.

80
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,630
Please have a seat.

81
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,870
It's a relief that we were able to coordinate our schedules.

82
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,450
Coming all the way to visit me unplanned like this, you almost made the trip in vain.

83
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,590
If you were not here, I would have just had a glass a wine.

84
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,610
I thought I should greet you, if you are here.

85
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,490
Isn't it awkward for us to meet each other because of the articles coming out about Cha Soo Hyeon?

86
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,630
Chairwoman, I truly am sorry.

87
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,690
I went all the way to Sokcho to see him to address the issue.

88
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,040
She will regain her common sense.

89
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,220
What good is it to talk to someone else's precious son?

90
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,090
Excuse me?

91
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,260
Isn't this because of your daughter?

92
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,180
Yes... That's correct.

93
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,980
I scolded Soo Hyeon too. Chairwoman, generously—

94
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,350
How much more generous do I need to be?

95
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,540
We should stop having this kind of conversation. I am already not interested.

96
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,460
- Chairwoman—
- My son CEO Jeong

97
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,400
is now meeting suitable potential partners whom I've selected one by one.

98
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,850
From now on, I will decline meeting you like this.

99
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,130
You should get up.

100
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:29,960
I will do everything to make sure to bring Soo Hyeon back to her place.

101
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,690
I beg of you. The election is just around the corner. Please, Chairwoman—

102
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,420
Exactly. You will soon be the hostess of the Blue House ("First Lady").

103
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:44,930
Acting like this, my goodness. Without Taegyeong, I can't guarantee that

104
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,410
you will be placed at the Blue House though.

105
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,350
Chairwoman, Soo Hyeon has grown up sheltered. She's immature.

106
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,700
It's all my fault.

107
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,220
I will make sure nothing will make you feel uncomfortable in the future.

108
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,120
I don't think you are leaving anytime soon, so...

109
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,990
I will leave first.

110
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,600
Calm down a bit before you leave. Goodbye.

111
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,170
Donghwa Resort Sokcho

112
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,080
Are you two going to be like this behind my back?

113
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,750
Manager Nam must be tired.

114
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,500
I asked him to come, to put my heart at ease.

115
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,190
I enjoyed eating squid and hot dogs and resting on my way here by express bus.

116
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,790
Go back safely, you two.

117
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,090
I'm the best driver. What is there to worry about?

118
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,550
Yes.

119
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,660
Take a rest on the way.

120
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,900
I'm leaving.

121
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,400
I come here a lot now. It feels like my second home.

122
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,280
When I have a day off, I'll treat you to a delicious meal.

123
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,980
Sounds good. Let's grab some soju later. I'm leaving.

124
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,280
Drive safely.

125
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,510
Go.

126
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,240
I'm sorry. I will bring your food right out.

127
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,590
- Owner.
- Yes.

128
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,000
- It's so good. We will have one more dish.
- Thank you.

129
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,340
Oh?

130
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,620
Why were you looking for me?

131
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,960
What? I was?

132
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,950
I was told to come here. Kim Jin Hyeok's brother called.

133
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,910
He said that you wanted me here.

134
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,210
Ah, Jin Myeong told me he won't be able to come to work today.

135
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,660
So I told him to find a part-timer and take a day off.

136
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,300
- Did you come to work part-time?
- Work part-time? Me?

137
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,210
Just a moment. I have to cook some whelks right now.

138
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,870
- Ah—
- Excuse me.

139
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,270
Excuse me.

140
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,510
Excuse me. Here!

141
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,890
Yes.

142
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,920
Well, one more beer please.

143
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,340
I will refill this popcorn bowl first.

144
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,940
- Would you like an apron?
- What is he saying?

145
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,600
Here you go.

146
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,140
Soo Hyeon.

147
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,580
Yes?

148
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,280
It's difficult, right?

149
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,040
It's bearable.

150
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,030
Want me to tell you a sad story?

151
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,410
There was a girl I liked a long time ago.

152
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,300
- Really?
- Really.

153
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,810
I don't think she disliked me,

154
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,610
but I couldn't confess my feelings.

155
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,840
Why?

156
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,350
Well, compared to where I stood, she was out of my league.

157
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,450
She was gorgeous. She shined even from afar.

158
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,990
I don't know if others noticed that, too. But in my eyes, she was incredibly beautiful.

159
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,040
What's so bad about you?

160
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,420
My face is big.

161
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,770
You're killing me.

162
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,420
I also went to prison.

163
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,920
It's not like you stole or assaulted somebody.

164
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,770
It was just an offensive remark you wrote in an article.

165
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,610
But still, an ex-convict is an ex-convict.

166
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,990
It's only because of you that I'm able to work and eat.

167
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,750
Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing anything.

168
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,800
Ahjusshi, if you say it like that, I'll cry.

169
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,030
I didn't say it to make you cry.

170
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,270
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have any friends.

171
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,170
Secretary Jang. You brought Mi Jin to me, too.

172
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,930
Even if Mom didn't let me play with the other kids,

173
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,770
you took us to concerts without her knowing.

174
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,370
When Mom and Dad weren't home, you threw us pajama parties.

175
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,230
That's because Mi Jin wanted to come and have them.

176
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,810
Anyway, don't say things like you aren't qualified.

177
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,390
Then Dad's investment becomes meaningless.

178
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,760
You're right, Soo Hyeon.

179
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:55,260
So how did things work out with that girl?

180
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,510
I couldn't confess to her.

181
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,840
"I really like you. Do you want to live with me?"

182
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,980
I thought I'd have the chance to tell her that someday.

183
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,430
But she brought her fiancé over.

184
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,860
So,

185
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,880
I just congratulated her. Sad, isn't it?

186
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,970
That's disappointing.

187
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,470
It's all in the past, but it keeps coming across my mind recently.

188
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,500
Seeing you and Jin Hyeok together.

189
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,690
Just think about yourself.

190
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,850
"How will having these feelings affect the company?"

191
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,190
"And what about Mom and Dad?"

192
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,930
Why are you wasting time thinking about that kind of stuff?

193
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,440
It's okay to be selfish about it. It's your life.

194
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,100
I'm worried about him.

195
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,510
That's also Jin Hyeok's life.

196
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,540
It's the life he chose to follow.

197
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,690
I don't like that his family is having a hard time.

198
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,470
That, too. No parents can say no to the path their child

199
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,720
has already chosen to follow.

200
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,050
Your feelings and his are the most important.

201
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,800
Thank you, Ahjusshi.

202
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,520
For what?

203
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,120
For telling me the sad story.

204
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,760
Keep it a secret, okay?

205
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,400
Don't go around spreading it to others.

206
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,590
I won't tell Department Head Kim.

207
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,070
- Why are you talking about Seon Joo?
- She just came to mind.

208
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,650
What mind? What mind?

209
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,500
You are matching the puzzle pieces oddly. You can't do that!

210
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,320
I keep thinking of the past.

211
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,780
I'm reminded of your big face that stared at Seon Joo.

212
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,470
What? No, that's because my eyes are small.

213
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,910
I can't see well.

214
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,100
I'm going to sleep.

215
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,750
Good work.

216
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,050
Want some beer?

217
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,230
Sure.

218
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,490
I can't quit drinking with this good stuff.

219
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,950
You're planning to quit?

220
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,060
I've already caused trouble in the new year, so I was planning to control myself a bit.

221
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,410
You shouldn't date men if they judge you for making mistakes because of some drinks.

222
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,030
Mind your own business.

223
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,200
Here, your paycheck.

224
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,330
Oh, it's quite a lot.

225
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,420
I put in a little more because you're so admirable.

226
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,510
I'm not sure if you'll ever be able to understand this ocean-like owner's mind.

227
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,000
Men have called me attractive,

228
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,280
but admirable is novel.

229
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,040
If I say that you are attractive, you are going to say "you should know your place."

230
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,190
What are you trying to say?

231
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,930
Anyway, I couldn't find the right timing to tell you,

232
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:18,940
but I'm sorry... about what I said to you.

233
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,240
I'm sorry. I went too far.

234
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,540
If you don't feel like dating, then come here to grab some drinks from time to time.

235
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,280
If I have time, I'll drink with you.

236
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,630
Is this how you increase your sales?

237
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,810
I don't accept beer money from attractive women.

238
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,940
Stop flirting. You're not my style.

239
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,320
The beer money.

240
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,280
What's with him? Trying to flirt with me?

241
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,750
Weird guy.

242
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,720
Stop pounding.

243
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,260
Did you get there safely?

244
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,780
Manager Nam came to get me, so I had a nice ride back. Are you at the hotel?

245
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,250
- Where are you?
- Home.

246
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,350
- Then why didn't you accept my video call?
- What?

247
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,150
I thought you were busy outside doing something, but you were home?

248
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,150
Wow, I'm hurt.

249
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:14,090
It's not like that. It's just that I've never done a video call before.

250
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,640
Oh, okay. So you didn't pick up because it was new to you.

251
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,890
You're so cute.

252
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,230
I've done group calls during meetings,

253
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,530
but this is one-on-one, so it's kind of awkward.

254
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,420
What's awkward? Hang up and I'll video call you. You must answer.

255
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,310
Just this is fine with me—

256
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,910
Hello?

257
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,200
♫  I keep thinking.  ♫

258
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,280
♫  Why is my heart pounding so?  ♫

259
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,670
Hello!
♫  Why am I excited like always getting sentimental in the fall?  ♫

260
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,930
It feels more real when we can see each other's faces. Don't you think?
♫  Also not understanding I am being drawn in more  ♫

261
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,490
It's not bad.
♫  Gradually step by step to closing the distance  ♫

262
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,580
So our first video call
♫  Gradually step by step to closing the distance  ♫

263
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,990
wasn't bad. Okay.
♫  Seeing you my feeling also is slowly growing  ♫

264
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,960
I'm just saying that because it's awkward.
♫  Seeing you my feeling also is slowly growing  ♫

265
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,770
So long-distance relationships have this aspect to them.
♫  Stop playing hide and seek and come to me now  ♫

266
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,180
This is okay, too. Right?
- ♫  Stop playing hide and seek and come to me now  ♫

267
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,820
Yeah, it's intimate in its own way.
♫  I matched you, the last piece in the puzzle  ♫

268
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,250
Then let's video call each other before bed from now on.
♫  You ride the wind and come to me  ♫

269
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,540
I'll think about it.

270
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,150
What do you mean you'll think about it? Just looking at other couples,
♫  Sweeter than the scent of spring  ♫

271
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,790
they video call each other several times a day.
♫ 
Sweeter than the scent of spring  ♫

272
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,560
Just give me some time to process all of this. Right now,
♫  Whisper love  ♫

273
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
it's super awkward.
♫  It’s been waiting for love  ♫

274
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,610
I don't feel awkward at all.
♫  It’s been waiting for love  ♫

275
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,600
See? I think I like you more than you like me.
♫  Waiting for love waiting for love waiting for love  ♫

276
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,770
I mean, how can you tell with a mere video call? Can this be a measurement?

277
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,230
It could be because I don't know much about this. And also, this is the first time in my life that I'm doing this.

278
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,240
You're upset. I'm in trouble.

279
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,970
It's not like that.

280
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,630
I know.

281
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,650
I will just say you are not upset, so put your pretty face closer.

282
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,480
I video called because I missed you. Your already small face is even smaller.

283
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,440
You should at least show this much.
♫  The person who makes me breathe when I'm tired  ♫

284
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,340
Our nostrils look huge.
♫  The person who makes me breathe when I'm tired  ♫

285
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,060
Then is a forty-five degree angle better?
♫  No one in the world can make my heart pound harder  ♫

286
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,340
You're attractive from every angle.
♫  You are the only one who can be at my side  ♫

287
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,400
Awesome, guess I'll have to write a diary entry today.
♫  You fill in for me the last piece  ♫

288
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,090
Did you know that's the first time you've called me attractive?
♫  The person who makes me breathe when I'm tired  ♫

289
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,190
Really?
♫  The person who makes me breathe when I'm tired  ♫

290
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,990
But I was always thinking that.
♫  You  ♫

291
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,470
Maybe, but I'm always thinking about you and calling you cute and pretty.
♫  ride the wind and come to me  ♫

292
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,970
I express my feelings whenever I can.

293
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,670
What's good to keep it to yourself?

294
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,630
You have to express it and make each other feel good.

295
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,710
You wanted to hear those words that badly? I feel like I'm getting scolded.
♫  Whisper love  ♫

296
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,330
Really. Completely. Terribly..
♫  It’s been waiting for love  ♫

297
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,690
You're cool. Super cool. The coolest guy in the world.
♫  Waiting for love waiting for love waiting for love  ♫

298
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,680
Kim Jin Hyeok is so cool that I can't breathe.
♫  Oh It’s been waiting for love waiting for love waiting for love  ♫

299
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,360
He's the coolest guy in the world.
♫  Oh It’s been waiting for love waiting for love waiting for love  ♫

300
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,240
That was nice to hear.
♫  Even your flaws are love to me  ♫

301
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,260
Especially, you calling me Jin Hyeok is strangely flattering.

302
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,720
♫ Always, I've been waiting for love  ♫

303
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,360
♫ Waiting for love  ♫

304
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,080
You're exhausted today, aren't you?

305
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,610
No, not at all.

306
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,300
Do you still take sleeping pills?

307
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,470
I could put you to sleep right away if I were there.

308
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,070
I'm a human sleeping pill.

309
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,880
Hongje-dong human sleeping pill.

310
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,180
Try not to take them if you can.

311
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,130
I've reduced my dosage a lot.

312
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,050
- I think it's all because of you.
- Oh, yes.

313
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,560
Want me to sing for you until you fall asleep?

314
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,710
I'll hang up when I see you're asleep.

315
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,630
Oh, I like that idea. It's original.

316
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,150
No, it's not. I don't want you to see me falling asleep.

317
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,010
I'm watching you do that as we speak.

318
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,940
No, can't you see?

319
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,300
I was working.

320
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,140
Oh, I see.

321
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,190
You put a sweater over pajamas so quickly that you put it on backwards.

322
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,020
I guess you focus better like that.

323
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,680
Every moment is special

324
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,200
I don't think this video chat is for me. I don't like it.

325
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,460
I love it though.

326
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,250
I'm going to hang up now.

327
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,100
Ah, wait, wait!

328
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,690
Thank you.

329
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,270
Thank you for coming all the way here to see me because you missed me.

330
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,610
T-h-a-n-k you.

331
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,930
♫ When love shines in the two eyes looking at me ♫

332
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,030
What are you thanking me for?

333
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,910
You always did that for me, Jin Hyeok.

334
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,450
In that sense, let's video-chat once a day, everyday.

335
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,460
We will see.

336
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,480
Ah, really. You are too much.

337
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,520
I mean, we're living in this IT world and we can't video-chat as much as we want to?

338
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,760
Are you this type of person? I'm a little taken aback.

339
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,350
I got goosebumps here. Can you see?

340
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,160
I can't see anything.

341
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,940
What do you mean by "this type"?

342
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,460
It's good. It's like an obsession.

343
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,130
You've become slyer than ever.

344
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,700
♫ I belong to you ♫

345
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,130
How do you feel now? Does video chatting feel a bit more comfortable?

346
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,270
Make yourself comfortable.

347
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,150
Alright.

348
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,320
Do I look comfortable now?

349
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,210
♬  I belong to you  ♬

350
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,870
Right, but... When you left earlier...

351
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,680
With the manager...

352
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,750
Should I call it a conversation? We talked for a long time.

353
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,560
♬  Always at a distance within my reach  ♬

354
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:01,420
♬  So you can feel that I'm by you  ♬

355
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,030
♬  I want do to that for you  ♬

356
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:10,600
♬  I know I belong to you  ♬

357
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,450
Good night.

358
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,710
Have a sweet dream.

359
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:28,560
♬  Now, I belong to you  ♬

360
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:36,290
♬  My feelings for you grow more and more intense  ♬

361
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,070
Donghwa Hotel

362
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,030
Tourism and Culture

363
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,160
Donghwa Hotel is on today's tour list.

364
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,170
They never put an advertising article.

365
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,520
But whoa, Kim Jin Hyeok did his job right in Sokcho.

366
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,850
Picked by Tour List
The hotel & resort you must visit this year in Asia

367
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,030
They must have found it appealing because of the hotel's reputation.

368
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,970
Purchase this magazine in bulk and deliver them to every department. I will report this to CEO.
"Warmth at an unfamiliar place. Korea's Sokcho Donghwa Hotel"

369
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,780
Our department head can't stop smiling.

370
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,530
Of course I can't. Isn't it our dream to be on this tour list?

371
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,020
- Assistant Manager Park.
- Yes.

372
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,250
Hey, Kim Jin Hyeok.

373
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,640
At this rate, you will get promoted and become my boss.

374
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,210
It's nothing like that. It was just a coincidence.

375
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,200
Hey, can you send the picture to my parents?

376
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,210
It's a bit embarrassing for me to do it, you know.

377
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,480
Mr. Kim Jin Hyeok.

378
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,700
Bye, Hye In. My manager is here.

379
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,140
Ah, a lucky charm entered our hotel. A lucky charm.

380
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,210
I'm flattered. I really didn't know who she was.

381
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:14,670
I was curious, why our CEO thinks highly of you. Now I see.

382
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,500
I'm getting so many calls today.

383
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,890
Oh, Department Head Park. Ayoo, don't mention it.

384
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,420
I always do a good job training my staff.

385
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,000
Great.

386
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,420
That's it?

387
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,100
Send him a flower basket as a gift.

388
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,650
We always do that.

389
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,510
Something like this. It's something so difficult

390
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,740
to achieve. Even my team's overseas department puts a lot of effort for a year.

391
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,450
There is no precedent, so...

392
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,010
How should we reward him then?

393
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,410
Please send him back to my team.

394
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,490
The end-of-year party and now this...

395
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,490
I need Mr. Kim Jin Hyeok, CEO.

396
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,550
A bonus vacation, prize money, hotel certificates...

397
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,890
Please proceed with that.

398
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,750
Ms. CEO, this is your chance.

399
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,780
This is your chance to bring him back to headquarters.

400
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,950
He wouldn't want that.

401
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,250
And that good deed will lose its value.

402
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:35,890
Alright. I understand what you mean, ma'am.

403
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,210
Warmth at an unfamiliar place
Korea's Sokcho Donghwa Hotel

404
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,560
You were great.

405
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,360
What should I write so it can grab my Cha Soo Hyeon's heart?

406
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,410
Come in.

407
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,140
The flower basket is ready, Sir.

408
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,550
Alright.

409
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,490
What should I do if she rejects the basket?

410
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,090
Why do you think that far?

411
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,680
I'm worried that you might be hurt, so...

412
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,530
I'm ready to be rejected about 100 times.

413
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,970
If I get hurt, should I go exercise?

414
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,580
It's better than drinking, right?

415
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,050
Of course it is.

416
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,310
- Right, Secretary Kim.
- Yes, CEO.

417
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,290
Are you good at writing?

418
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,510
What kind of writing?

419
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,280
Well, just... Something that will complement the flower basket.

420
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,950
"Whether you are the flower, or the flower is you,

421
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,530
I can't tell. I'm sending my heart."

422
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,020
Alright, go back to work.

423
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,330
Yes, Sir.

424
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,460
"Are you the flower? Or is the flower you?"

425
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,160
"I'm sending my heart, that cannot distinguish the two."

426
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:45,220
- What are you taking pictures for?
- Because it's not something that happens frequently in your office.

427
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,420
You should've returned them.

428
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,240
Why did you bring them in here, Secretary Jang?

429
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,700
You weren't here. I didn't know what to do.

430
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,970
It happened all of sudden.

431
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,980
They are really pretty, too.

432
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,540
Why all these?

433
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,130
I'm sending some things that resemble you.

434
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,020
Please take care of these.

435
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,330
Take care... Alright.

436
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,650
How should I do it? There are too many...

437
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,140
Let's take them to your house, Secretary Jang.

438
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,230
My house.

439
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,180
If I take them all to my house, where should I lie down then?

440
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,470
Jeong Woo Seok

441
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,030
Congratulations for getting published on the tour list.

442
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,510
I heard it is one of the pickiest magazines.

443
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,100
Mr. Jeong Woo Seok.

444
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,430
I'm at the Sky Lounge. Let's meet for a moment.

445
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,350
I have many meetings. Don't wait for me.

446
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:48,900
And... Don't do this ever again. Do me this favor.

447
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,450
I will wait for you. Take your time.

448
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,750
I think he's still waiting. It's been three hours already.

449
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,790
Tell the Overseas Strategy Team to come in.

450
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,590
I need to confirm some documents sent from Cuba.

451
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,130
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,850
Should I just go tell him that you can't come?

453
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,980
That you have so many meetings. You are busy.

454
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,860
Please give the Overseas Strategy Team a call for me.

455
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,340
Yes, ma'am.

456
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,970
Ahjussi!

457
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,690
I thought you went abroad.

458
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,750
You only come for the whelk dishes.

459
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,930
That's why I came to have some fruits.

460
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,240
This is a really famous magazine. They are really picky, you know?

461
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,650
Jin Hyeok made it to such a magazine.

462
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,220
It's awesome, isn't it?

463
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,490
if you receive a salary, you should work.

464
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,410
Something like this comes along with work.

465
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,780
Do you want some dried persimmons?

466
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,980
I've got some good ones.

467
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,080
Yes, please. I'm hungry.

468
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,370
Wow...

469
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,350
This might be your chance, Jin Tae.

470
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,890
No, Assistant Manager Kim.

471
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:05,240
This might put the Donghwa Hotel in a difficult position.

472
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,230
CEO Cha will collapse.

473
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,150
Well, let's say you are lucky enough to stay at this hotel until your retirement.

474
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:17,630
That means, you will be a managing director.

475
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:22,370
This is my gift, after calculating the salaries and everything, and you are saying you won't take it?

476
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,580
I might have to take the legal responsibility.

477
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,920
Taegyeong will support you with the best attorney.

478
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,110
If I were the manager of the Overseas Strategy Team, I would've already said yes to this.

479
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,220
I'm not doing this myself because this is not something that my Public Relations Team does.

480
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,650
Handle this and submit a resignation letter.

481
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:43,680
Everything will be set once you're back from a family trip abroad for a month.

482
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,900
Right. The legal responsibility.

483
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,260
There should be someone present for you to be blamed.

484
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,490
When CEO Cha is kicked out of her position, what gives her the right to ask you for the legal responsibility?

485
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:57,020
Do you think I would?

486
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,640
Overall cancellation?

487
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,050
We've explained that we sent the wrong blueprint by accident but they won't change their mind.

488
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,290
It was awkward for us because it was done by e-mail, wrongfully sent by one of our employees.

489
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,290
Assistant Manager Kim submitted a resignation letter, saying he will take the responsibility. He disappeared.

490
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:24,140
His phone is off. No one's home either.

491
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,950
I received the e-mail he sent to Cuba and examined it myself.

492
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,070
He did that very deliberately.

493
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,890
"Donghwa does not intend to maintain the garden."

494
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,020
"It's unproductive and undeveloped."

495
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,360
"Instead of the garden that displays Cuba's stagnant economy, we're planning to install a luxurious pool."

496
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,520
"If you reject this proposal, then

497
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,690
we will re-consider the completion of the Donghwa Hotel."

498
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:52,580
Tell them it's not Donghwa's position.. Say we will send them a letter of apology.

499
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,380
We already did, so will be useless. It seems like it severely damaged their pride.

500
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,930
Also, the landowner said he would never sell the land.

501
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:06,650
His only condition was keeping the garden, but this happened.

502
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,690
Please check the owner's contact information, and I'll go.

503
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,510
CEO.

504
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,980
We've done everything already.

505
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,310
We've tried everything possible to get his contact number.

506
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:22,280
I'm planning to go to Cuba myself, but it seems like the Cuba hotel's officials are opposed.

507
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,540
When the article was published, many European hotels contacted them as though they were anticipating this.

508
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,790
No one will leave alone a land with the most beautiful view of the Caribbean.

509
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,850
There is an emergency board meeting right now. You should attend.

510
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,130
Our stock price has been halved. Does this make sense at all?

511
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,090
Donghwa Hotel is collapsing in an instant.

512
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,920
It's just temporary.

513
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,260
Don't mislead us.

514
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,460
Are you serious? How can you say it's temporary

515
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,900
when it is such a traumatic event?

516
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,380
This is why we need a professional CEO.

517
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,700
Our CEO majored in journalism. How much would she know about business?

518
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,950
The scale of the hotel is growing.

519
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:22,350
Honestly, Taegyeong has already... filed a lawsuit against the Donghwa Hotel.

520
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,480
Taegyeong's lawsuit hasn't been served on our legal team yet.

521
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,320
Your networking is quite impressive, Director Choi.

522
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:37,010
You all must have been taken aback. It was some employee's malicious act.

523
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,700
The Overseas Strategy Team is moving swiftly to mitigate the situation.

524
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,850
It's going to expand to a big setback, CEO. The analysis of domestic stock is negative

525
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,620
and the analysis of foreign stock is just as negative.

526
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,440
It will all settle down once the Cuba project is back to where it was.

527
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,730
I trust your affection towards this hotel.

528
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,710
More than encouraging me, I hope you will support me through patience.

529
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:06,180
I don't think it is an accident that this happened when the head is so busy with her personal life.

530
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:12,470
Since I majored in journalism, I tend to look at situations that I'm curious about from the journalist's perspective.

531
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,970
I am planning to find out who's behind Assistant Manager Kim Jin Tae, who committed this crime and then disappeared.

532
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:21,190
I hope you will wait for that too.

533
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,750
Directors.

534
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,240
Oh, Hye In. Can you talk right now?

535
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,230
Yeah, you saw the news, too, right? It's chaotic here as well.

536
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,530
What happened? Is it true that everything's cancelled?

537
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,030
There was a board meeting. It's hectic.

538
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,260
Why all of a sudden?

539
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,310
One employee sent an e-mail to Cuba.

540
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,720
They say that we were originally going to keep the garden but

541
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,960
he switched the blueprint, saying that we will demolish the garden and install a pool.

542
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,830
But the landowner had requested keeping the garden. That was the most important condition.

543
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,060
Was that his wife's will?

544
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,150
Well... There must have been an important emotion attached to it.

545
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,070
But that employee messed with it.

546
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,370
Garden? Garden...

547
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,950
It was a beautiful time.

548
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,190
All that was here.

549
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:41,630
It was so hard to keep all intact.

550
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,100
It was the garden of my wife.

551
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,530
To the landowner, keeping the garden was the most important condition.

552
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,780
Was that his wife's will?

553
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,180
Take a few days off?

554
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,170
Yes. I should've told you in advance, but something urgent came up.

555
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:11,030
In any case, you've got some bonus vacation days from headquarters. Let's say you are using them now.

556
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,620
Trip.com

557
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,900
Flight

558
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,990
This person... He's helping my mother, right?

559
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,190
Yes, Sir. He's called Manager Jo.

560
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,530
I think he's been handling Chairwoman's private tasks.

561
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,160
Who is this person?

562
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,900
Assistant Manager Kim Jin Tae.

563
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,680
He is the one who sent the troublesome e-mail to Cuba.

564
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,310
He's disappeared without a trace.

565
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:53,410
once you're back from a family trip abroad for a month.

566
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,170
Keep your eyes on Director Choi.

567
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,690
Yes, CEO.

568
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,870
Will the Donghwa's overseas expansion to Cuba fall apart?

569
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,740
Oh, Myeong Sik. I was curious how Soo Hyeon is doing.

570
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,490
I haven't seen her yet. She's been constantly in meetings.

571
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,610
But Hyungnim, I think this will be a serious one.

572
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,800
According to Secretary Jang, it seems like we will get a lawsuit from Taegyeong soon.

573
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,580
Pushing hard with the divorce agreement. Talking over the hotel ownership. That nonsense...

574
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,140
Alright. Goodbye.

575
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,040
Sokcho <-> Seoul

576
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,210
When did you arrive?

577
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,390
Early morning.

578
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,050
I've been quiet. Didn't want to wake you up.

579
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,900
You don't ever show up but when you do, you come like a burglar at night.

580
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,790
But it's still good to see you.

581
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,580
Why pack your summer clothes?

582
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,100
Ah, I'm going on a business trip to Cuba.

583
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,340
What is this? Are we already saying goodbye again?

584
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,200
I will stop by home on my way back to Sokcho.

585
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,230
You must be so busy. What if you get sick?

586
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:46,590
I eat and rest well. Are you heading to the market?

587
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,120
Yeah.

588
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,850
Should I wake up Mom? Do you want to eat something?

589
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:54,720
No, I have some time. When Mom wakes up, I will have breakfast before I go.

590
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,970
Pack your stuff.

591
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,020
You looked good in the photo.

592
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,640
Because I'm good-looking.

593
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,260
It's because you take after me.

594
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,800
Right.

595
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:20,960
You haven't been able to contact the land-owner yet?

596
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,980
It seems like he has made up his mind. Also, the hotel officials say

597
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,580
they cannot share his personal information.

598
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,550
I think I should go there myself.

599
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,860
I should stop the hotel officials from being swayed.

600
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,360
I can't let a European hotel take the hotel.

601
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,870
I will update you when I arrive in Cuba.

602
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,920
Boarding time 14:40
To Havana

603
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,500
Jin Hyeok

604
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:21,030
Secretary Jang, please book a flight to Cuba.

605
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,490
Jin Hyeok

606
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,500
If a wave is the ocean's work, thinking of you is my work.

607
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,090
So I will do my work.

608
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,600
Cheer up.

609
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,480
Jin Hyeok

610
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,350
The phone is off. Please leave a message ...

611
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,160
I checked the flight schedules. If you travel on the flight arriving soonest, it will arrive on a holiday.

612
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,080
It will be impossible to hold any meetings.

613
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,390
I can't do anything else. Please book me that one.

614
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

615
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,400
Okay.

616
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,140
Thank you.

617
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,210
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

618
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,000
I got a late call from my boss.

619
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,240
We're just a cooperative company and it's hard for us to convince the landowner of the hotel.

620
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,220
He has already made up his mind.

621
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,620
Could I at least have his contact details?

622
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,520
I'm afraid that's not possible.

623
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,030
Could you please pass this letter onto him then?

624
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:21,760
He has no intention of meeting us in person as he's not happy with our company as well.

625
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,780
What's so important about that garden?

626
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,470
I''m afraid we can't help you anymore.

627
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:53,280
Bacardi Building

628
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,680
On vacation?

629
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,410
I called the Sokcho hotel. I was told that he is on vacation for a few days.

630
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,790
He must have heard about the Cuba hotel news.

631
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,740
He hasn't been in touch, has he?

632
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,210
Hello?

633
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,160
Is there anybody there?

634
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,060
Here...

635
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,030
I'll just sleep here.

636
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,530
Among those many stars...

637
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,470
Among those many stars...

638
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,820
One star looks down at me.

639
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,630
One star looks down at me.

640
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,980
Among these many people.

641
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,090
Among these many people.

642
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,340
I stare at that one star.

643
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,530
I stare at that one star.

644
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,650
In that way I am one and you are one who is cherished

645
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:44,930
Somewhere what will be become and will we meet again?

646
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,190
I'm sleepy.

647
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,000
Excuse me. Do you have any money?

648
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,740
Why are you smiling? I'm seriously asking you.

649
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:04,500
No, I... For you to ask for beer in this situation...

650
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,520
It was cute.

651
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,120
Is there any money left over?

652
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,530
Enough to buy two tickets to watch salsa.

653
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,750
What are you doing? Why are you putting it back in?

654
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,840
I'm upset because you're laughing at me when I'm not trying to be funny.

655
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,070
But you laughed a lot before, too.

656
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:28,170
Because I was cute. I'm also laughing because it's cute.

657
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,590
Have we met before?

658
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:45,680
I understand why this garden is precious.

659
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,800
Because there is an old playground where I'm from.

660
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,150
Unfortunately, that playground will be gone soon.

661
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:01,220
My childhood, my friends, and my family...

662
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,160
Even my memories with my dearest lady.

663
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,790
The playground with all these precious memories will be gone.

664
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:12,070
So I understand your anger.

665
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:17,060
I came here again hoping that you would forgive this misunderstanding.

666
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:23,050
Donghwa Hotel and the CEO sincerely want to protect this garden.

667
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,170
You speak Spanish so well?

668
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:30,290
This is very well-written.

669
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:38,650
You should be glad that I was an English teacher.

670
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,390
Glad to hear that.

671
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,310
Did you just sleep here?

672
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:45,630
Well... Yes.

673
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,990
I have a question for you.

674
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:55,550
But you should think very carefully before you answer it.

675
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:59,440
Because that might change my mind.

676
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,650
Go ahead.

677
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:06,140
So your point in this paper,

678
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:11,260
in this letter, is that you love the CEO?

679
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:18,380
Well... That's my personal reason for why a hotel business should go on.

680
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,040
And Donghwa Hotel greatly appreciates this garden.

681
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,630
So you mean no?

682
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,470
You don't love her?

683
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,540
I miss her more than anything.

684
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,910
Well... It's time for breakfast.

685
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,610
Stop staying here.

686
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,290
Tourism and Culture

687
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,710
Hotels and Resorts in Asia
Recommendations for tourists this year

688
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,160
Is this you, right?

689
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:49,340
How did you...?

690
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,720
After my wife has gone,

691
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,560
traveling was not for me anymore.

692
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:01,620
While reading this magazine, it became one of my hobbies.

693
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:07,490
And you look much better in person than in your picture.

694
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:15,850
Don't wait here anymore.

695
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:19,960
I'll give you an answer tomorrow morning.

696
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,090
Take it.

697
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,400
Goodbye.

698
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,460
I'm hungry.

699
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,500
Soo Hyeon, I heard this from Lee Dae Chan.

700
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,430
Kim Jin Hyeok said he was traveling to Cuba.

701
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:23,120
He might be on something. I thought you should know.

702
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,700
The phone is powered off, so you'll be directed to the voice mailbox.

703
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,460
You will be charged after the beep.

704
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,670
Where are you?

705
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:53,690
♫ The morning sunrise, it takes me away ♫

706
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:59,730
♫ As I am staring at the light you hold ♫

707
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:02,280
♫ The feeling of adore  ♫

708
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,260
♫  Oh take me on to you  ♫

709
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,180
♫  I can’t hide anywhere  ♫

710
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,080
♫ I followed to your dream ♫

711
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:22,330
♫  Is this what they have been calling love? ♫

712
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:25,330
♫  And it just goes on  ♫

713
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:30,390
♫  Oh take me on to you  ♫

714
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:40,020
♫  You’re my flower and I’m your bee ♫

715
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:45,060
♫  You know you keep me alive ♫

716
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:51,020
♫  You’re my reasons for everything I do  ♫

717
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:57,110
Maybe, if you have time tomorrow morning, buy me breakfast at that café.

718
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,960
How's tomorrow at 9?

719
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,800
I might not be able to make it out because I don't exactly know tomorrow's schedule.

720
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,680
I'll wait for half an hour, and if you don't come, that's fine.

721
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,200
Don't be too burdened.

722
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:14,910
♫  Oh take me on into your arms ♫

723
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:19,490
♫  I'll go wherever world you’re on ♫

724
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:21,370
I wanted to ask you this if I saw you again.

725
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:24,170
Whether you have a boyfriend.

726
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,890
Do you have any money?

727
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:14,070
♫  If feels very small the tremor in your eyes ♫

728
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,990
♫  Even now ♫

729
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:22,890
Do you have any money?

730
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:25,850
How much should I have?

731
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,260
♫  If you're too close,  ♫

732
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,050
Just enough for a bun and a cup of coffee?

733
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:33,880
♫  If you're too far away, I'm afraid it will be cold ♫

734
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,170
You will compensate me later, right?

735
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,510
♫  We are watching. ♫

736
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:39,030
My pay day is soon.

737
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:42,140
♫ From so far away  ♫

738
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:45,820
♫  It's as though we are waiting ♫

739
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:49,350
♫ Don’t hesitate love ♫

740
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:54,290
♫ Don’t hesitate love ♫

741
01:00:55,670 --> 01:01:02,220
♫  So that at this moment now everything won't pass by ♫

742
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:06,100
♫ Don't leave me alone anymore ♫
Closed

743
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,210
♫ Don’t hesitate love ♫

744
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:14,310
♫  Please tell me so I can hear ♫

745
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,860
It's too bad. We should just leave.

746
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,790
Wait a moment.

747
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,490
Come on up.

748
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,330
Let's go.

749
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:35,170
By the way, you've really met him?

750
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,680
Yes.

751
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:40,030
But I'm not sure how it will turn out.

752
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:46,650
I was told that he would give me an answer by tomorrow morning. I hope it works.

753
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,150
You did your best, Jin Hyeok.

754
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,730
I wish our genuine feelings will be understood.

755
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,360
I hope so, too.

756
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:07,360
Thanks to you, we've met here again.

757
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,820
It's really like magic.

758
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:16,260
You saw my note.

759
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,530
Yes.

760
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,240
Now, I'm finally relieved.

761
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,020
I proved that I liked you first.

762
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,570
Yes?

763
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,550
Yes.

764
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:48,100
Is that so?

765
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,670
Yes.

766
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,720
Yes, I understand.

767
01:03:56,210 --> 01:04:00,610
Grandpa Samuel gave a huge present.

768
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:05,860
No way.

769
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:09,340
How did you persuade him?

770
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,690
You must be an alchemist.

771
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:16,450
Grandpa Samuel, thank you!

772
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:18,140
Jin Hyeok, shh!

773
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,550
Be quiet!

774
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,490
Cha Soo Hyeon.

775
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,270
Soo Hyeon.

776
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:12,430
Did you decide to call me that from now on?

777
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:15,440
It's not bad.

778
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,030
I love you.

779
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:05,490
♬  They say that your caresses will never be mine  ♬

780
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:15,310
♬ That your loving arms will never embrace me ♬

781
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:23,200
♬ And I dreamed last night that you loved me ♬

782
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:31,290
♬  And even if I die later, I want to kiss you ♬

783
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:41,280
♬ Give me a kiss and forget that you have kissed me ♬

784
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:49,820
♬ I would give you my life, if you asked for it ♬

785
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:58,330
