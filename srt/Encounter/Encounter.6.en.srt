1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,470
Encounter

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,500
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,490
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,850
Boyfriend

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,050
These feelings... to find out if they're feelings of liking someone...

6
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,540
How about we allow the certainty and doubt to fight it out?

7
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:58,520
How about we say we met here again in a "some" relationship?

8
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,480
("Some": a relationship which has not yet developed into a commitment)

9
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,690
All right.

10
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,390
Let's say we are meeting again in a some relationship. Let's do that.

11
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes. Then what should we, who are now in a some relationship, do next?

12
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,640
So suddenly... I don't know.

13
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,060
We should do something romantic.

14
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,250
I'll give you a ride on a bicycle.

15
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,580
A bicycle?

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,550
Because your hands are cold.

17
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,100
Here.

18
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,700
Your hands are like a baby's hands.

19
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,010
They're cute.

20
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,790
If you keep calling me cute, I'll think that it's true.

21
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,830
It is true, though.

22
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,390
Alright, here.

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,130
Get on. It's not as amazing as your killer car,

24
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,220
but it's fun in its own way.

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,920
Your grudges are no joke either.

26
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,970
Alright.

27
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,110
Hold on tight. I'm going!

28
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,870
Off we go!

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,760
♫ If you're too close, it's hot and ♫

30
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,430
You must be heavier than you look.

31
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,920
Don't you know that my bike is so delicate?

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,540
Your grudges are no joke, Kim Jin Hyeok.

33
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,170
I'm just joking.

34

Tous les Jours Cafe

00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,770
Let's go drink something warm.

43
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,670
Here is your coffee.

44
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,890
Please give us one of these, too.

45
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,680
Why did you get cake?

46
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,430
Today is a special day.

47
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,910
It's the occasion of the first day of our some relationship.

48
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,550
It's already Christmas season.

49
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,770
Let's each take one of these in commemoration of the occasion of our first day.

50
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,910
CEO.

51
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,210
Yes?

52
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,590
Why aren't you putting it on?

53
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,230
Do you not like the color of the lipstick that I bought you?

54
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,520
It's bright and nice, but I think it will be better in the spring.

55
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,750
The poet Rilke once said, that even in a cold city,

56
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,430
only people who walk hand in hand side by side

57
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,880
can see the spring.

58
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,630
We rode a bike together and are drinking coffee side by side.

59
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,280
It's already spring for us.

Episode 6

82
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,570
What an honor that you would call me, CEO Jeong.

83
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,670
What do you mean, an honor? Don't mention it.

84
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,630
My mother seems to trust you, so I should do the same.

85
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:01,180
Aigoo. Those words could cause a huge problem if someone heard them.

86
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,310
I brought you here because there's something I want to confirm with you in person.

87
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,220
What is it?

88
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,750
I heard that there was a small commotion at the company.

89
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,220
The aftermath is too big to call it a small commotion.

90
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,760
- You've heard a rough rundown, right?
- Yes.

91
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,200
Perhaps because she is soft-hearted,

92
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,550
she couldn't cut off that indiscrete employee's foolishness with a single stroke.

93
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,150
I think this happened because of that.

94
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,690
CEO Cha seems to be cold on the outside,

95
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,080
but she's a soft-hearted person. Isn't she?

96
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,540
If it is as you say, if left alone, how far will that guy go fooling around at piggyback with CEO Cha?

97
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,770
I'm concerned about that.

98
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:51,180
But, you know, why did you have to choose a lobby crowded with employees

99
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,520
to make her explain the issue, Director Choi?

100
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,550
I asked you here because I was curious about that.

101
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,140
Well, it's because CEO Cha kept avoiding me.

102
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,910
You just referred to CEO Cha without adding -nim. (honorific)

103
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,230
Ah, is that so?

104
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,790
I guess I was a little flustered because you asked me so suddenly.

105
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,260
When it comes to a business,

106
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,850
allowing the eldest son to inherit it is the usual practice.

107
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:30,620
A hotel is the face of the business, and serves a necessary function to a large enterprise.

108
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,250
If the CEO of Donghwa Hotel is expelled,

109
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,890
then who naturally becomes the next CEO?

110
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,140
It would be you, CEO Jeong.

111
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,740
I'm not really interested.

112
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,850
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon is the one who made Donghwa Hotel what it is today.

113
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:52,080
Trying to take that position isn't good business ethics or manly.

114
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,340
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

115
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm saying that Donghwa Hotel's CEO position isn't for me

116
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,550
or you, Director Choi.

117
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,770
It seems like you're misunderstanding something.

118
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,410
I'm just a director.

119
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,590
I'm glad to hear that.

120
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,370
Hey!

121
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,950
Have the airline celeb pictures been developed?

122
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,900
Yes, I confirmed it.

123
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,390
Confirm the list of reporters who have been invited.

124
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,790
- I confirmed that already.
- Sounds good.

125
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,960
You are in communication with the caterers in Sokcho?

126
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,930
Yes, the menu is fixed. I just have to confirm the number of people attending.

127
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,460
- The VIP Celeb protocol plan should be communicated in advance.
- Yes.

128
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,960
Alright then, let's see.

129
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,990
How about the new employee Kim Jin Hyeok organize the celebrity side?

130
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,060
It will be a lot of work because it's a large event.

131
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,810
It will be the hardest task out of all of them.

132
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,400
No, work is best learned as you do it.

133
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,700
If you give me the opportunity, I'll work hard.

134
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,100
Okay, then. You give him some support, Eun Jin.

135
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,330
Yes, I will.

136
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,230
Yes, Teacher. Hello.

137
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,310
Yes, I'm at work.

138
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,140
I've got a little time. Please speak.

139
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,420
Ah, really? I'd love to.

140
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,600
Donghwa Hotel's Sokcho Opening Plan

141
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,230
CONTENTS

142
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,320
Do you have time this evening?

143
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,080
Teacher Lee said that she had some good tea come in and invited us to come drink some.

144
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,350
I was wondering if you could go with me.

145
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,450
I have something scheduled today, so it'll be difficult.

146
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,720
That's disappointing.

147
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,040
Then let's make sure we go together when you have time.

148
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,580
Hyung.

149
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,460
My brother and his company's CEO...

150
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,980
I hope that things go well for them.

151
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,430
He should stick to his own kind; otherwise he's gonna suffer.

152
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:02,180
Hyung, does that matter when it comes to love? Feel! Boom! That's it.

153
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,570
Well, Jin Hyeok is handsome. Of course she'd fall for him.

154
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,450
Well, that CEO is extremely beautiful.

155
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,490
Hey, I thought she was an actress or something.

156
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,310
She is really pretty, isn't she?

157
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,390
But that woman who calls herself a friend, who is always with her.

158
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,320
Yeah.

159
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,540
Why is she like that? Goodness.

160
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,070
She's much better than you. Her face is kind of cute, too, right?

161
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,300
- Hey, I'm holding a knife.
- Okay.

162
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,620
What rare confidence. Hyung, Hyung, come here and see this.

163
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,910
Hyung! Hyung! Stop that and look at this. Come here.

164
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,010
Aigoo. No matter how much I think about it, you're a terrible part-time worker.

165
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,970
I'm over here crying and chopping onions and you're just sitting there looking at your phone.

166
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,500
- There you go again!
- Let me see what you're talking about.

167
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,790
I've found my future sister-in-law. Take a look.

168
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,040
I think grades are very important.
[Jang Mi Jin. Age: 35 Years Old. Residence: Seoul. Job: Secretary]

169
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,170
I don't want just anyone to talk to me.

170
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,630
I don't want just anyone to talk to me?

171
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,140
Wow, how could someone be so annoying?

172
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,500
Hyung, this isn't annoying.

173
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,580
This makes her look like she's got it going on.

174
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,910
She's oozing with confidence. It's dazzling.

175
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,400
Aigoo, I hate it. Not my style.

176
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,420
Why are you so snappy today? You've been chopping those onions snappily too.

177
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,490
What is it?

178
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,690
What is it? A new chat?

179
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,330
Mr. Franchise CEO and new member.

180
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,320
Hello. The moment that I saw your profile, my heart thumped

181
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,180
for some reason, so I'm sending this carefully.

182
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,660
Thank you.

183
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,040
So it seems you work as a secretary.

184
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,260
To be precise, I'm the head secretary.

185
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,410
Ah, that woman. Man, she's strange.

186
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,020
What are you saying is strange all of a sudden?

187
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,320
Wow, you have a really cool job.

188
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,010
- Secretary Jang.
- Yeah?

189
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,820
- Have a glass.
- Ah, thank you.

190
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,710
It's so smooth!

191
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,800
That woman is strange.

192
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,990
Ah, she's strange.

193
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,110
It appears that it's difficult getting feedback from the actors.

194
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,920
I predicted that it would happen.

195
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,620
I'll look some more for places that aren't wary of Taegyeong Group.

196
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Let's work towards internal stability. Please pay special attention to the group members.

197
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,920
Yes. And I...

198
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,110
I haven't sent Chairwoman Kim's side invitations yet. What would you like me to do?

199
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,250
Send them.

200
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,340
Then to CEO Jeong Woo Seok as well?

201
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,990
Go ahead and send it. Work is work.

202
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,000
Alright.

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,700
- CEO Cha is inside, isn't she?
- Wait, Mother—

204
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,850
- Move!
- I'll take you inside once her meeting is over.

205
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,600
Then I'll go ahead as you requested.

206
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,490
Stand right there. I won't be long.

207
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,390
The hotel... Yes, the hotel that you love.

208
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,470
What do you want to say?

209
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,760
What is the best atmosphere for the building? What trees shall be used for the landscaping?

210
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,960
Should I make the lobby more elegant? Or would a more public space be better?

211
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,000
I have a meeting.

212
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,740
What about the outdoor pool? What about the garden?

213
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,050
The furniture? The shape of the windows? What about the tea sets?

214
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:52,060
It's already all inside your head. You can picture it even before it is built.

215
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,260
From the moment your father rose from the position of trustworthy anchorman to assemblyman,

216
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,410
I've kept it in my head.

217
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,850
At the very least, I should be the wife of a prime minister.

218
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,980
While I'm at it, I could even become First Lady. I would even stake my life on it.

219
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,900
I don't plan to let anything mess up this perfect picture.

220
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,350
Even if it's my child.

221
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:29,000
It won't be long now. You were expelled from Taegyeong, so I won't put you on the election stage.

222
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,590
In exchange, just breathe and keep quiet.

223
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,490
Don't create gossip with some young boy and stay quiet as a mouse, as if you were dead.

224
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,910
You understand, right?

225
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,230
You're a parent.

226
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,590
We're mother and daughter, aren't we?

227
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,220
Are relationships important? Worth is important to me.

228
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,980
Live as a useful child.

229
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,790
Since Kim Jin Hyeok stepped forward, we lost the chance to screw Cha Soo Hyeon over.

230
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:18,390
So about that, include this person on the roster of invited reporters.

231
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,160
Yes, sir.

232
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,970
Cha Soo Hyeon should explain in person in front of the board of directors.

233
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,900
We need to make her suffer for playing around with a company new hire.

234
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,350
Separately invite the major shareholders to be there as well.

235
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:41,330
But then, Department Head Kim would want Asssemblyman Cha Jong Hyeon to enter the Blue House.

236
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,630
If that person's daughter becomes a laughing stock, then...

237
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,350
Stop sounding so frustrating. What do I care what happens to Assemblyman Cha, Chief Lee?

238
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,690
What's important to us is that Donghwa Hotel's CEO position becomes empty.

239
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,220
I mean, to be honest, whether or not CEO Kim wants to grow Taegyeong with Assemblyman Cha on her back...

240
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,320
That's their world.

241
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,000
I understand what you mean.

242
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
CEO Cha has to come down from her position for me to survive and for you to become department head and director.

243
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:14,120
If Chairwoman Kim gets wind of this, it's the end for us. So be careful.

244
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,160
I'll keep that in mind.

245
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,490
Are relationships important? Worth is important to me.

246
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,440
Live as a useful child.

247
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,090
CEO, I don't know what's going on,

248
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,130
but be strong.

249
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,910
Look at that. I told you that you'd be prettier than a model.

250
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,400
It's spring.

251
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,050
Yes, Sunbaenim.

252
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,070
We've already notified them, but they have all declined.

253
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,180
So I'm going to them to ask them in person.

254
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll call you again after I've made about five visits.

255
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,870
Yes, I understand.

256
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,520
If you had let us know, we could have gone to you.

257
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,860
A busy CEO like you came all the way here.

258
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,390
I'm glad to get some fresh air, too.

259
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,450
- This is the window-side, correct?
- Yes.

260
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,670
What if we make it a window wall?

261
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,460
It would be refreshing and nice, but

262
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,960
it has such strong sunlight.

263
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,300
There may be too much light.

264
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,220
I guess that would be possible.

265
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,420
Then let's go with the window wall, and to make it less stifling,

266
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,030
how about we hang some corded curtains?

267
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,370
We'll look into it.

268
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,720
Right, about the garden...

269
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,630
Yes?

270
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,220
It's good that it's in the center of the hotel, but instead of an old garden...

271
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,460
why don't we get rid of it and add an outdoor pool?

272
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,990
I hope you won't touch a single clump of grass on that garden.

273
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,670
I believe that garden is the essence of this hotel.

274
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,680
You can feel the passage of time.

275
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,660
Yes,

276
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,910
we'll do that.

277
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,120
Manager Nam, I need to stop by the tailor shop.

278
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,430
Yes, I understand.

279
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,280
It took some time. You were waiting long, weren't you?

280
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,610
It's all right.

281
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,650
Would you like some tea?

282
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,360
No, thank you.

283
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,900
Some new ties came in.

284
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,260
The response has been good, CEO.

285
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,990
The colors are nice.

286
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,650
Would you like me to recommend something that would suit your father?

287
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,460
The ones on this side are nice and sophisticated.

288
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,990
Many young men in their 20s wear them.

289
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,810
Please wrap one of these for me.

290
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,220
Yes, I'll get it ready right away.

291
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,380
I'd like to wear it this weekend.

292
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,910
The entrance is a little chilly.

293
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,460
I don't know how many times I called Italy.

294
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,720
That looks wonderful on you, CEO. Something good must be happening this weekend.

295
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,210
I need to impress a woman. Do I look okay?

296
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,440
You'd catch the eyes of all women even if you went out in jogging shorts.

297
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,640
- She's a picky woman, though.
- No matter how picky she is, you're CEO Jeong.

298
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,090
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

299
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,060
We meet here.

300
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,430
I'm on my way out.

301
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,950
Soo Hyeon,

302
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,890
were you listening?

303
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,560
No.

304
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,610
She could hear everything, CEO.

305
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,200
Is that so?

306
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,600
What did she buy?

307
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,850
She picked up a cardigan she had ordered for her father.

308
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,580
And while waiting, she bought a tie.

309
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,550
Did it seem like something for a man in his late 30s?

310
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,280
I think it was a gift for her father.

311
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,060
But... as for the tie,

312
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,610
she chose a young pattern.

313
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,440
You should have come with that person from last time.

314
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,630
I was planning to, but she was busy.

315
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,600
What is your relationship?

316
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,420
We're in a 'some' relationship.

317
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,170
Wow.

318
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:11,110
I didn't recognize her last time,

319
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,580
but isn't she your company's CEO?

320
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,610
You're right.

321
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,270
Then what do you mean by 'some?'

322
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,060
It's true though.

323
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,250
I'm happy to hear my Jin Hyeok is smitten by a woman.

324
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,750
But if it's the CEO of Donghwa Hotel,

325
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,900
do you think you can handle it?

326
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,030
She's living a suffocating life.

327
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,600
What if it suffocates you as well?

328
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,820
I intend to go through it with her.

329
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,600
People are going to get the wrong idea about you, because she owns a lot.

330
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,250
I don't care if people misunderstand me.

331
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,120
Because she laughs once in a while,

332
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,100
that makes me really happy.

333
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,420
You're not in a 'some' relationship.

334
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,760
You're head over heels.

335
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,960
Hey.

336
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,500
You're not taking it to your father today, are you? The atomosphere is ...

337
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,960
It must be quite noisy.

338
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,800
You know, it's hard to be born with such a pretty face.

339
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,650
How is it that you never smile with it?

340
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,630
I really don't want to drive today.

341
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,980
Should I then?

342
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,930
What's Kim Jin Hyeok doing? Let's call him and get some soju.

343
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,510
- Pardon?
- Do you honestly not like Kim Jin Hyeok?

344
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,530
Not at all?

345
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,290
I'm not suggesting you two do anything.

346
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,160
But you know those people you meet occasionally for a good time.

347
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,630
You can meet up for a meal or some tea.

348
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,970
Why is it that you upset me like this?

349
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,790
You haven't vented like this in a while.

350
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,640
Whatever.

351
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,860
Seon Joo

352
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,520
Just answer it.

353
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,130
It's Seon Joo, I mean Department Head Kim. She probably just wants to go drinking.

354
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,190
Go and have a drink. She's working hard for the hotel opening.

355
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,430
- Cheer her up for me.
- Just worry about yourself.

356
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,890
Does the CEO not work hard?

357
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:47,230
You ignore those around you who can cheer you on, and all alone,

358
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,100
you go from office to car, to home, to office, to meetings. Aren't you tired of it?

359
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,430
Well, it's a daily thing.

360
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,910
Time is going to pass you by, Soo Hyeon.

361
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,100
When you look back, it makes you tear up with regret.

362
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,120
Time is something that just slips through your fingers.

363
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,800
I finished earlier than I expected.

364
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,930
I was wishing so hard for you to finish early.

365
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,190
My wish came true.

366
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,380
Why wish for something so small?

367
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,990
It's today's wish. Tomorrow will have its own wishes.

368
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,900
I think I came too late.

369
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,160
Let's go back inside.

370
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,980
Teacher went up to give a massage, so we'll have to wait a little.

371
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,480
I'll brew the tea.

372
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,300
No, it's okay.

373
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,620
Should we take a walk?

374
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,850
Sounds good.

375
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,490
Just a moment.

376
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,740
- I'm fine though.
- You'll catch cold.

377
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,970
Isn't it warm?

378
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,070
Yes. It smells nice.

379
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,820
Does my family use good fabric softener?

380
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,980
You're busy with the hotel opening coming up, aren't you?

381
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,420
There's no question.

382
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,370
How do you feel? It's your first time with this.

383
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,940
I find it exciting.

384
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,780
Isn't it difficult having to invite celebs?

385
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,010
Not at all.

386
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,140
It will all turn out well.

387
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,690
I haven't worked very long yet.

388
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,460
But while doing my work,

389
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,960
I've wondered, how did you make such a great hotel in this short time?

390
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,690
I think of you often.

391
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:29,450
It makes me feel good hearing that you think of me often.

392
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,320
I just poured everything into it.

393
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,100
I needed manpower,

394
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,620
and I needed a manual of the best hotel in the world.

395
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,460
So I brought over Department Head Kim, who was successful.

396
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,600
I gathered all the chefs, Manager Nam, the directors,

397
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,250
and took everyone on a tour of world-class hotels around the world.

398
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,090
Everyone to all those places?

399
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,630
It's a hotel I received as my divorce settlement,

400
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,890
but it was everything to me.

401
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,900
After I was deprived of all the money I would have received as alimony, except for the hotel,

402
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,650
I visited each country's hotels.

403
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:07,350
Then I got loans and renovated the hotel.

404
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,580
The things I learned during those tours,

405
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,770
I poured everything into Donghwa Hotel.

406
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,190
I'm very grateful to everyone who helped me along the way.

407
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,980
If it weren't for them,

408
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,790
I wouldn't have made it this far.

409
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,800
When I listen to these things, you seem to be very determined and bold, but

410
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,760
why are you always hesitant around me?

411
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,520
You acknowledge that it's true, right?

412
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,660
I'm not sure.

413
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,620
♫ When love shines  ♫

414
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,940
♫ in the two eyes looking at me ♫

415
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,700

426
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,420
Because I bought my dad a present, I got this as a gift with purchase.

427
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,540
They don't have neckties with zippers attached.

428
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,600
I don't know if you would like the color.

429
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,650
Thank you, CEO.

430
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,340
This is the first time that I've received a necktie present.

431
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,580
Besides my dad, this is also my first time.

432
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,850
Giving someone a necktie present.

433
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,280

434

446
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,520
Yes.

447
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,550
Seeing that you are craving spicy foods, you have something troubling you again, huh?

448
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,620
My husband says that whenever I eat spicy foods, I look like I have hot blood.

449
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,150
He said you can tell a person's temperament by seeing what they eat. You, my aged oppa, treat me better.

450
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,130
- What is "aged oppa"?
- Then are you a youth?

451
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,450
At this age, I'm still pretty great.

452
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,800
I'm getting divorced.

453
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,160
Did you find out something?

454
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,330
I saw a picture.

455
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,630
It isn't some woman that he knows? Did you confirm for sure?

456
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,140
My face was burning with heat.

457
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,300
I never knew that he had that side to him.

458
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,130
Perverted guy.

459
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,450
Stop drinking, you'll ruin your insides.

460
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,660
I just got started!

461
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,220
Get up.

462
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,440
- Hey, where is that guy? Lead the way.
- You are going to beat him up?

463
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,220
If your oppa was here, he would have been beaten to death already.

464
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,480
My oppa was weak. He couldn't kill anyone.

465
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,940
He left us early because he couldn't take it, after all.

466
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,610
Jeong Pyo wasn't weak.

467
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,650
Jeong Pyo was strong. I'm the weak one.

468
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,400
Rather than live a contemptible existence, he had the courage to leave the world saying "screw you." How is that weak?

469
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,880
Why do you make such a serious comment? Making me embarrassed.

470
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,210
Don't ever think of Jeong Pyo that way.

471
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,180
Your oppa is a bigger person than I am.

472
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,410
Ah, stop! The issue here is my divorce.

473
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,370
So, get up! So I can beat him up.

474
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,460
Don't get angry.

475
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,460
That makes you the loser. This is nothing that is worth getting angry about.

476
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,050
Then, what about Ji Woo?

477
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,460
Yes, I'm worried about our daughter.

478
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,910
I'll figure out how to explain it to her.

479
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,340
Nice shot! Did you come here to exercise?

480
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,270
Yes.

481
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:01,530
I also have to come here often, but I don't have much time.

482
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,060
You are very busy, right? You have the Sokcho hotel opening too.

483
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,770
As for the hosting, the employees are doing well preparing for it.

484
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:12,760
However, we are anxious about the promotion. Since there is the Taegyeong Group,

485
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,720
the celebrities are not responding to our invitations.

486
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,430
It seems that they all have their own reasons.

487
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,470
It's a pity.

488
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,080
Thank you.

489
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:40,460
That person came again. I told him not to come.

490
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,020
The actor says that it will be hard because the event conflicts with the filming schedule.

491
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,010
Ah, yes.

492
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:14,420
If perhaps the schedule changes, please let him know that I am awaiting his call.

493
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,370
Yes. Goodbye.

494
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,150
I am thinking of going there one more time.

495
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:36,430
I wonder if going there would solve anything. Since it's obvious they are avoiding contact.

496
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,620
But I think I should still try everything until the end.

497
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,320
I am going to interrupt your work for just a second.

498
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,430
Hello. How did you...?

499
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,610
Should I give you a cup of tea?

500
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,720
No, I can't take too much of your time.

501
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,020
I heard that the celebrities are giving a hard time to you, the Public Relations department.

502
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,050
I know it's presumptuous, but I wanted to be of some help, if I can.

503
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:16,700
Give me the invitation list. I can't guarantee the results, but I think I can help.

504
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,550
That's something that we need to do...

505
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,980
It's an honor to meet you.

506
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,950
Section Chief Lee.

507
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,620
Luckily, these are names of people that I am friends with.

508
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,970
It will be resolved by today.

509
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,660
Then, work hard.

510
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,350
Who is that person?

511
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,600
You really do not know?

512
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,960
Even though you are in that kind of relationship with CEO Cha?

513
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,830
Goo Eun Jin, what kind of relationship is that?

514
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:26,530
Just a ramen-eating relationship.

515
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,050
CEO Cha's ex-husband.

516
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,750
What?

517
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,130
What? Why are you being like this again?

518
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,360
If someone like CEO Jeong makes a single call,

519
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,410
it's totally over.

520
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,200
Otherwise, it wouldn't be taken care of, no matter how much the small fry struggles.

521
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,340
- Section Chief Lee.
- Yes, Department Head.

522
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,310
I didn't tell you to hand over the list.

523
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:03,440
We don't have a lot of time. To move in a direction that would get us progress...

524
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,470
From now on, don't act without my permission.

525
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,280
Yes.

526
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,310
How is it? Does it suit me?

527
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,340
It's great.

528
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,110
Since the weather is cold, dress warmly.

529
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,520
You are so busy. Why do you concern yourself over me?

530
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,810
This amount of time is alright.

531
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,290
How are you doing?

532
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,250
You heard from Mom?

533
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,460
Your mom only gets mad. She doesn't tell me any information.

534
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,750
- I heard the general news from Manager Nam.
- Does it worry you?

535
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,100
Concern...

536
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,150
Of course, it does. It's concerning my daughter.

537
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,380
Are you alright?

538
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,150
Yes.

539
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,690
- Soo Hyeon.
- Yes.

540
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,920
Don't misunderstand me. But just listen carefully.

541
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,400
To me, it's like this.

542
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,160
Whether it's the hotel lobby incident or the news article,

543
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,820
if this is something important for your life, then of course, I have to watch over it.

544
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,860
But if it's just something that is going to pass,

545
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,470
having people bandy your name about

546
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,270
makes my heart ache.

547
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,540
I'm used to people having interest in me.

548
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,430
Of course.

549
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,090
It's my fault.

550
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,640
I don't mean it like that, Dad.

551
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:44,070
The merging of parties is giving you a headache, isn't it?

552
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,550
- Did your mother say that?
- I saw it in the news article.

553
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:52,310
It will be resolved soon. Your hotel opening is this weekend, right?

554
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,560
Can you come?

555
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,640
If a politician goes to such a happy event like that,

556
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,860
the atmosphere will only get ruined.

557
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,940
I'll go if you ever have more free time.

558
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,100
What's wrong?

559
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,780
How do you feel meeting CEO Jeong?

560
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,770
What is the reason for your question?

561
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,940
It's nothing to laugh about, Jin Hyeok.

562
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,020
I'm worried thinking that you're the only one who doesn't know.

563
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,580
What?

564
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,240
CEO Jeong Woo Seok and his mother Chairwoman Kim,

565
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,390
I heard that they're really scary.

566
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,650
It surprises me every time when I hear things from my sunbaes.

567
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,850
Really? What does that have to do with me?

568
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,910
Why does it not matter with you?

569
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,530
Did you not realize he was staring you down?

570
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,790
Did he?

571
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:46,680
I wish you wouldn't get involved with the CEO again.

572
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,000
- Are you worrying about me?
- Jin Hyeok. Obviously.

573
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,820
Don't worry.

574
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:57,240
No matter how strong and scary those people can be, I'm just me.

575
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,750
Are you saying this trusting in the CEO?

576
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:02,990
Jo Hye In, these questions of yours are beginning to bother me.

577
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:07,680
I don't care if you get angry with me. I don't want to see you get hurt.

578
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:11,360
If you constantly get noticed by them...

579
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,770
I'm pretty sure things will get more difficult for the CEO, too.

580
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,970
There is a rumor that they are keeping their eyes on this hotel.

581
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,670
Those people can even take the hotel away from CEO Cha.

582
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:26,360
If that were to happen, would the CEO still be able to support you?

583
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,250
Thank you for worrying about me.

584
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,030
Let's head back in.

585
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,610
Jin Hyeok.

586
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,810
But if it's just something that is going to pass,

587
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:00,460
having people bandy your name about

588
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,840
makes my heart ache.

589
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,590
It will be settled by today.

590
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:42,070
It's a hotel I received as my divorce settlement, but it was everything to me.

591
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,520
I poured everything I learned from those tours into Donghwa Hotel.

592
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,500
I'm extremely grateful to everyone who helped along the way.

593
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,760
Those people could take the hotel away from CEO Cha.

594
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,180
Lift it just a little higher.

595
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,040
Yes, a little more.

596
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,400
There, that's good.

597
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,360
Donghwa Hotel Sokcho
Grand opening ceremony

598
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,840
Darling, take a test photo.

599
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,600
I'm taking it now.

600
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,410
Please check the count on the other side as well.

601
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,360
What are you doing?

602
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,080
Get up. Even if we leave now, we'll arrive later than Chairwoman Kim.

603
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,830
It was difficult to arrange this.

604
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,670
Before this sight of you gets out in the open,

605
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,890
get up.

606
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,690
Look this way!

607
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:29,860
Please look here!

608
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,910
Look here!

609
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,570
Please look here.

610
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,360
This way, too.

611
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:56,960
I don't see her.

612
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,310
She must be the most frenzied one here.

613
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,660
Or she just doesn't have manners.

614
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,790
Taegyeong Group Vice President
Jang Woo Seok

615
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,330
You're busy, right?

616
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:16,510
Oh, Manager Nam! I'm a little nervous since this is my first big event.

617
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:18,590
Don't be nervous. Just have fun.

618
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,490
- Have you seen CEO?
- No, I haven't.

619
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,550
Where is she? We have to start the ribbon cutting.

620
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:23,920
I'll look for her.

621
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,650
Jin Hyeok, check the room tour one last time. I can't move from here.

622
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,530
Yes, I understand.

623
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:54,350
CEO, here you are. Secretary Jang is looking for you.

624
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,580
We talked on the phone. Take good care of things today.

625
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,030
I'll do my best. Don't worry.

626
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:07,480
You didn't like the tie? Since it's a freebie?

627
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,110
It wasn't a freebie though.

628
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:14,560
Well, I have it right here.

629
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,080
But I can't tie it myself.

630
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,810
I either make it too long or too short.

631
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:22,530
I still need to practice some more.

632
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,770
Take that one off.

633
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,460
Stop smiling.

634
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,030
I want to, but I can't help it.

635
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,680
Thank you.

636
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,330
Are the room tours ready?

637
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:50,200
Yes, Kim Jin Hyeok is preparing it now.

638
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,420
Then, beginning now,

639
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:56,160
we'll have the ribbon cutting to commemorate the opening of Sokcho Donghwa Hotel.

640
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,790
One, two, three!

641
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:59,940
Please start cutting!

642
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:17,590
As you can see, besides those "mountain-view" rooms on the opposite side,

643
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:21,130
you can have a beautiful view of the ocean from all the other rooms. That is the biggest advantage.

644
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:26,040
Moreover, all the furniture and bedding are eco-friendly.

645
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,700
Since there will be many guests who come with their children,

646
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,770
we emphasized the eco-friendly aspects.

647
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,040
We met in Seoul, didn't we?

648
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,020
Yes, hello.

649
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,790
Your tie is exceptional.

650
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:56,280
It's sophisticated yet casual. It's very nice.

651
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:02,600
I received it as a gift. My personal taste isn't this impressive.

652
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:08,760
The taste of whoever gifted it is outstanding.

653
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:30,790
I'm hoping that news of the merging of the parties would naturally go out this month, Assemblyman Cha.

654
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:36,600
If it's news about the impossibility of merging parties, I could do it right now.

655
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,760
If you insist on having more power struggles, it'll only make things worse.

656
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,390
Is this even a matter to have power struggles about?

657
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:48,940
It's just that the two parties have different beliefs.

658
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:54,580
I guess your beliefs were similar to Taegyeong's.

659
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:58,260
We took this path together based on a promise.

660
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:02,460
But if you are looking at a different path with all these talks over "beliefs,"

661
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,440
how should we react?

662
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:10,530
Taegyeong has many documents and evidence related to you.

663
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,370
Did you run the campaign ...

664
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,930
all by yourself?

665
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,010
You should consider Soo Hyeon as well.

666
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,530
You've heard about that ugly scandal, haven't you?

667
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:25,950
Those disgraceful stories are surfacing because we have left her alone.

668
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:32,790
Both Soo Hyeon and you should return to your rightful places now.

669
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,980
Thank you for calling my daughter's name in such a warm way.

670
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,990
But why don't you reset the manner of addressing her?

671
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,220
Cha Soo Hyeon is the CEO of the Donghwa hotel, and on top of that,

672
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:51,460
she is living very diligently.

673
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,490
I've never considered Soo Hyeon as a complete stranger.

674
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:58,230
Being warm towards family, is that strange?

675
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,870
She's not in your family though. It's already been several years.

676
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:07,720
Definitely, once again, she will return to the place

677
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,000
where we eat breakfast together in the morning.

678
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,160
I'm not so sure.

679
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,530
At this point, I will take my leave.

680
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:19,410
Today's event is to congratulate CEO Cha, so excuse me.

681
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,710
- Director Choi.
- Yes.

682
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,090
Should we take a thorough look at him?

683
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:39,190
Yes. Kim Jin Hyeok.

684
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,970
You look better in person.

685
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:55,880
Please introduce yourself. This is the chairwoman of Donghwa's mother company, Taegyeong Group.

686
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:03,890
You're young.

687
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:09,630
Was our Soo Hyeon lonely?

688
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,180
I will move along since there's a lot left to be taken care of. Please excuse me.

689
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,440
Stop right there.

690
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,820
I haven't told you to leave yet.

691
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:35,030
Is it that the staff training is terrible, or are you being rude because you have the CEO's support?

692
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,200
I thought I studied everything,

693
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,630
but it appears that I've missed some things in the manual regarding assisting a VIP guest.

694
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,270
I apologize for making you feel unpleasant.

695
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:56,350
Hey, Soo Hyeon.

696
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:02,390
With these skills, I can tell why my Soo Hyeon might have fallen for you.

697
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:07,060
I believe the manual for assisting a VIP guest can be found in the company training materials.

698
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:13,430
The manual for seducing wealthy, lonely women... Where can that be?

699
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:17,450
Let's go.

700
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,160
Let's go, let's go.

701
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,880
I don't need such a manual.

702
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,360
Should I escort you to your seat?

703
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,130
Director Choi.

704
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,430
Yes, Chairwoman.

705
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:32,990
The expression, "the dog chasing the chicken can only look up the roof (you are barking up the wrong tree)," is outdated, you know.

706
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:36,390
Do you know what happens to those dogs these days?

707
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:39,420
Well, I'm not sure...

708
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:45,800
The dog that bites off more than he can chew, he will not only lose his own food bowl,

709
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,380
but he will also starve to death, you see.

710
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,700
You were here.

711
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,640
President Jeon is looking for you. Let's go.

712
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,070
My CEO Jeong, have you spent some time with Soo Hyeon?

713
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,760
I wonder if my daughter-in-law has been fed yet.

714
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,770
Why don't you come back after the meeting with President Jeon?

715
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:16,380
There's still some time till the ceremony. I will escort you.

716
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:05,040
If I got as close to them as I wanted, I had to distance myself again.

717
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,870
So from some point, I started to say to myself "all of them were nothing special anyway."

718
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,950
I learned to do that.

719
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,960
I think you are screaming for help.

720
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,740
Look here, Kim Jin Hyeok! What do you know about me that you are making such mindless remarks?

721
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:24,940
I'm good at restraining myself, but here I am.

722
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:30,200
You must have been shocked with the news, right? It's nothing new to me, so...

723
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:51,950
Are you alright?

724
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,730
Huh? About what?

725
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,440
I saw everything.

726
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:07,020
Do you want to go somewhere and take some rest? I will work at the banquet hall.

727
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,400
You, as you are now...

728
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,660
So, this is how it was for her.

729
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,040
I've never heard these things in my life, but

730
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,620
that person...

731
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,060
such harsh words ...

732
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,700
such an unbelievable attitude...

733
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,360
How much has she suffered?

734
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:00,950
Which areas did you focus on, Ms. CEO?

735
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:04,370
Nature and healing.

736
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:10,010
When you think of "Sokcho", the word "rest" comes up naturally.

737
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:14,550
I'd like everyone who stays at our hotel to experience that kind of rest and healing alongside with nature.

738
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,660
I look forward to that.

739
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:19,330
I know that you are working on a project to run a hotel in Cuba.

740
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,620
When would it be finished?

741
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:26,130
Its blueprint has been finished, so it's time to move on to the construction phase.

742
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:31,470
We are planning to launch the hotel at the end of next year with an end-of-the-year party.

743
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:35,860
Lastly, we will have a closing speech from the CEO.

744
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:39,760
To all of you that gathered here today to celebrate with us,

745
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,260
I would like to give my sincere thanks again.

746
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:46,440
I hope you will have a wonderful time.

747
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,630
Then, we will—

748
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:52,580
I have one more question for you, CEO Cha Soo Hyeon.

749
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,430
There was a recent article about a romantic rumor.

750
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:03,680
Who that person is, and whether it is really a romance or not,

751
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,830
you haven't made an official statement yet.

752
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:18,420
That's not something to be mentioned at an occasion like this.

753
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,420
Well, then...

754
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:25,720
There is a rumor that you are a victim of one-sided stalking. Is that true?

755
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:44,360
What kind of relationship is it exactly?

756
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:02,740
How can we define our relationship?

757
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,420
What kind of relationship?

758
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:22,700
We are in a 'some' relationship.

At first, I planned to run to the Han River.

01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,870

I've lived my whole life thinking that doing what I want was a luxury.

01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:33,330
For the first time, I will take ownership of my life.
