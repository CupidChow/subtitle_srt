1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,520
Encounter

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,480
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,090
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,030
Boyfriend

5
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,550
Is there a particular reason you like the Namsan library?

6
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,620
I like the path to the library. It changes with the seasons.

7
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,040
These days, there's a proliferation of VRs and games must have become more fun,

8
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,130
but yet, you find novels and poetry more interesting?

9
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,090
You wrote that books are something to feel thankful for. What is your reasoning?

10
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,340
With games, you have to play them continuously, but a book,
[ I made your name and ate for a few days by Park Jun ]

11
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,410
even if you take a break, it waits for you right where you left it. So I'm thankful for them.

12
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,720
You've had many part-time jobs. What type of part-time jobs have you had?

13
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,210
Delivery, food service, and I've worked a lot in construction.

14
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,350
Isn't working in the fruit business less difficult?

15
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,710
My father told me that earning money doing labor with your body stays with you a long time,

16
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,590
but I wanted to know what that meant.

17
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,680
Your major is hotel management, but you seem to be more interested in humanities.

18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,500
Whether management or economy, if you are rooted in humanities, I believe it can be enriching.

19
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,660
Since they are both jobs that people undertake.

20
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,320
Donghwa Hotel

21
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,080
And the reason you want to work for Donghwa Hotel?

22
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,660
The word "hotel" gives me a sense of excitement.

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,250
But if it's Donghwa Hotel,
Donghwa Hotel New Employee Interview

24
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,110
I believe that excitement will be at another level.

25
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,700
Episode 2

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,680
So she is Donghwa Hotel's CEO.

27
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,740
Jang Soo Fruits

28
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,660
What would you like? All the fruits are good today.

29
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,760
How much is a basketful of apples?

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,390
This one is 12,000 won.

31
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,840
Huh? Why is it more expensive than over there?

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,990
Mother, the color is different since it was just harvested.

33
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,720
You know, just like not all beef is the same, Mother.

34
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,010
Why would they price Korean beef differently?

35
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,090
Because the quality and variety are completely different.

36
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,000
If you were to compare these to Korean beef, they're the top tier.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,620
Oh, you are the top tier. Give me a basketful.

38
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,080
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

39
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,090
These are amazingly delicious. If not, just bring them back.

40
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,880
And this is my treat as the top tier guy.

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,860
- Omo, you're so great at selling!
- Thank you.

42
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,980
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,860
- Come back!
- Thank you!

44
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,560
I think I'm better at selling, right?

45
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,650
- You came straight here?
- Jin Hyeok!

46
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,590
Oh, Mom! Oh, it's food? I'm so hungry.

47
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,210
You're more glad to see this food than your mom?

48
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,590
Of course, that's not true. Traveling overseas makes you miss home cooked meals.

49
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,740
True. That's why I came straight here since I missed you both.

50
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,890
Oh, my kid. You came back thinner. You've lost weight.

51
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,900
- Let's hurry and go in.
- Let's go in.

52
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,210
Honey, Honey, come in, huh?

53
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,200
- Come sit. Come on.
- It looks delicious.

54
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,530
- It's my first home-cooked meal in a while.
- You were hungry. Let's eat.

55
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,200
Oh, I have good news.

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,130
Did you get yourself a Cuban girlfriend?

57
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,950
That is better news, but sadly, it's not that.

58
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,800
I got a job.

59
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,970
Omo, really? Where, where? Which company?

60
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,890
Donghwa Hotel.

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,800
You were worried about the stiff competition and thought you wouldn't get in.

62
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,240
That's great!

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,510
Both of you, get ready to travel to Cuba with the money that your son is going to earn.

64
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,920
- Cuba was really nice.
- Yeah?

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,710
Wherever you send me, I'll go.

66
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:47,590
Hurry up and eat. You worked so hard, my son.

67
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,960
But wait, a lunchbox won't do.

68
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,600
Honey, let's get some meat.

69
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,520
- Meat is good.
- Thank you for the meal!

70
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,300
Oh, eat first.

71
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,210
- Where are you going?
- My Jin Hyeok got a job!

72
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,660
- He did well!
- He got a job! I'll pass around some rice cakes later!

73
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,300
Oh, it's great.

74
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,790
Chan's Whelks

75
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,780
Here, here. Chan's whelks have arrived.

76
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,550
Wow, let's toast.

77
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,410
Cheers!

78
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,610
- Congrats on your new job.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,700
- Hurry up and treat us to a nice meal.
- When I get paid.

80
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,910
Today, Hye In will pay.

81
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,770
- Present.
- That's right. My present that's flown from Cuba.

82
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,420
There aren't any.

83
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,430
What? Did you say you got nothing?

84
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,950
I spent the pocket money I saved for your presents.

85
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,820
Oh, you spent it on a woman, didn't you?

86
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,130
- Really? You met someone?
- What are you talking about? It's not like that.

87
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,740
Anyway, I'm not jobless anymore, so don't call me to help you out when you're busy.

88
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,860
Yes, I understand.

89
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,820
Since you now have a job, how about pushing ahead with our marriage?

90
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,690
There you go again. What marriage among friends?

91
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,760
That's right. Marry me instead.

92
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,960
What are you talking about? You want me to die old alone?

93
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,210
- Why don't you go on dates?
- That's right.

94
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,340
I'm still fine. I'm really popular at my company.

95
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,000
Hey, Jin Hyeok, when you get settled at your company, go visit her.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,650
See if she's that's popular there.

97
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,420
I don't need to go. It's clear as day without even confirming it.

98
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,110
Hey, you're now my junior. Do well. I'm a scary senior.

99
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,800
- I will.
- You are scary.

100
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,670
I'm so scared. I'm sorry.

101
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,630
Hey, then introduce me to someone.

102
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,480
Here you go, Hyung.

103
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,740
- Cheers.
- Congratulations!

104
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,660
- Congrats!
- Cheers!

105
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,560
You're starting training next week?

106
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,960
Yeah. Looks like it.

107
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,350
I'm nervous.

108
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,760
Why? Finish up the training well.

109
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,790
But you don't know which department yet?

110
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,480
As long as it's not PR. You'd make it hard for me.

111
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,500
It's no joke. I'll pray before bed that you're in PR department.

112
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,320
- Hey, the CEO of Donghwa Hotel ...
- CEO Cha Soo Hyeon?

113
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,010
Is she the type who has a lot of curiosity?

114
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,550
Curiosity? That's too general.

115
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,620
So, someone who would travel here and there on her own without an assistant.

116
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,250
How would I know that?

117
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,610
Right?

118
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,180
But I don't think she would.

119
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,160
Why?

120
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,830
Just because. The ice princess going around on her own out of curiosity?

121
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,400
I don't feel like she would.

122
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
- Ice princess?
- She never smiles.

123
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,990
But then again, what would she smile about? She has no personal life.

124
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,060
Why not?

125
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,010
It's possible you wouldn't know about her life since you're not interested in other people's lives.

126
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,650
Do you know that her dad is Cha Jong Hyeon?

127
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,320
The Cha Jong Heyon who was the mayor of Seoul?

128
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,060
Yeah. She used to appear in public when he was active in politics.

129
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,430
Then she became the daughter-in-law of Taegyeong Group.

130
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,190
I heard the settlement she got in the divorce from her cheating husband was Donghwa Hotel.

131
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,980
She was just on the news the other day. Showing up at her ex-in-law's event.

132
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,360
Seeing that, her life can't be good.

133
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,630
It's embarrassing. You can't say she's divorced or not divorced.

134
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,190
Anyway, chaebols are strange.

135
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,210
Stop talking about a princess from another realm you'll never bump into,

136
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,130
and let's talk about me.

137
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,240
About you? Something about you...

138
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,260
Our Hye In, when will you become pretty?

139
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,230
You deserve a good punch.

140
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,610
Okay, okay.

141
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,110
Hey, please stop!

142
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,310
Donghwa Hotel

143
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,900
What scent is this? It seems like lavender.

144
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,160
Yes, it's a fresh scent that combines lavender and many different herbs.

145
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,480
- Isn't rose another compatible fragrance?
- Yes, ma'am.

146
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,130
I'm wondering if lavender and herb scent would go with a rose scent.

147
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,040
- I don't think it'll create synergy.
- Yes, we will correct it.

148
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,220
Could the hand towels be a little thinner?

149
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,900
I don't think there's any difference from the shower towels.

150
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,590
That's true, but it has to have good absorption.

151
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,760
If they are any thinner, they will be gauze and not towels.

152
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,300
I think it would be hard to dry your hands completely after washing them.

153
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,560
- This would be absorbent enough, right?
- Yes.

154
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,150
It's a hand towel I used at a hotel during my last trip.

155
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,910
I brought one back with me.

156
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,570
There's embroidery, so it's pretty and has class.

157
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,330
I think we could make something just as good in Korea.

158
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,340
I will look into it.

159
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,130
Do you want to take a look at the draft of the welcome speech for the new hires?

160
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,060
Since it's the CEO's welcome speech, it's best that I write it. I'll prepare it.

161
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,620
Since you've always done it yourself, I figured you would this time, too.

162
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,590
But they keep insisting on sending me a draft.

163
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,770
- You're here, CEO?
- You wrapped up Mother's 80th birthday well?

164
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,280
Thank you for thinking of us in such detail.

165
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,520
My mother was so happy when she saw the

166
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,090
flowers and the present you sent.

167
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,250
Sending a present over is the easiest thing to do.

168
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,680
So I'm grateful that you are thanking me for it.

169
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,520
- About this space over here.
- Yes, CEO.

170
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,110
I think there are more tables than you had before?

171
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,380
Ah. We brought out more tables.

172
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,190
- That implies that you expect more guests.
- That's right.

173
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,120
Then did you lower the cost of the buffet?

174
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,370
- Pardon?
- The price we have set right now is

175
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,760
for people to enjoy dining out in a spacious environment.

176
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,620
But since you've made the space smaller,

177
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,480
there should be a difference in the price as well.

178
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,170
I will take out the tables then.

179
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,780
Let's think about the value of the brand, not sales, Manager.

180
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,510
Yes, CEO.

181
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,060
One look at his face, and it seems like you've drained him completely.

182
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,320
No way. I was very calm and friendly

183
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,870
while giving him my opinion.

184
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,860
You have more expertise than us experts, so you make us break into sweat.

185
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,630
I have a draft of the proposal for the guide for VIP customers.

186
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,590
Havana

187
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,460
One month later

188
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,140
Donghwa Hotel

189
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,530
No. I can't.

190
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,100
- I'll see you later.
- Yes, CEO. Work hard.

191
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,360
Kim Jin Hyeok. You and that woman...

192
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,770
I saved her life last time. Why am I avoiding her?

193
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,900
You know that after the company video, the next item on the agenda would be to meet the CEO, right?

194
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,680
- Yes, that's right.
- Okay.

195
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,500
Donghwa Hotel Reception for New Employees
Welcome to Our Future! Our Talent!

196
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,510
Amazing.

197
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,910
Amazing!

198
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:42,140
Next, let us give a warm congratulatory welcome to the CEO of Donghwa Hotel, Cha Soo Hyeon.

199
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,060
First, to the people who have joined hands with Donghwa Hotel,

200
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,080
I would like to express my sincere gratitude.

201
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,600
Donghwa Hotel respects the value of all of you.

202
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,160
While everyone becomes members of the Donghwa family

203
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,830
we also look forward to making Dongwha's value here

204
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,760
even more valuable.

205
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,810
Our Donghwa ...

206
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,020
Hi.

207
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,460
Dongwha sincerely,

208
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,050
sincerely welcomes all of you.

209
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,840
Secretary Jang, may I see you for a moment?

210
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,170
Bring me the résumés and letter of introduction of all of the new employees.

211
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,660
You are going to review them?

212
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,250
- Yes.
- Why?

213
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,150
No— I think I saw the person you are curious about.

214
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,010
Bring them, please.

215
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,640
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,880
A few minutes ago ... where did it go?

217
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,840
Hey, everyone. This is our new team member, Kim Jin Hyeok.

218
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,560
He's the best looking of all the new hires. Jo Hye In, I heard you two are friends?

219
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,860
Yes.

220
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,950
Hello, I'm Kim Jin Hyeok.

221
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,680
Within two weeks of your compliment on my looks I will learn diligently.

222
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,610
Please look after me.

223
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,660
This is Section Chief Lee Jin Ho.

224
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,920
Please look after me, Section Chief.

225
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,830
Well, you have to do well. What's the point in asking us to look after you?

226
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,400
Of course! I'll do my best.

227
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,830
You will receive your assignments and assistance from Assistant Manager Park Han Gil.

228
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,070
Please look favorably on me, Assistant Manager Park.

229
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,600
Being handsome won't get you anything from me.

230
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,760
This is where you will sit.

231
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,650
Thank you.

232
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,120
New employees, we sincerely welcome you to the Donghwa Family.

233
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,680
Hi.

234
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,250
Twenty-nine?

235
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,710
He's young.

236
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,080
I am the son of a fruit vendor.

237
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,880
Since I was born, my father has run a fruit store.

238
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,310
Thank you! Enjoy.

239
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,700
Although you may think I grew up eating plenty of fruit,

240
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,500
actually, the vendor's son can't eat fine fruit.

241
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,650
We only get to eat the bruised or slightly spoiled unsalable fruit.

242
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,420
I sell fruit.

243
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,010
So you're a fruit vendor.

244
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,720
Fruit vendor? That's right. I'm a fruit vendor.

245
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,950
He was a fruit vendor.

246
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,220
Here, this is our team chart.

247
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,140
I didn't get to introduce myself earlier. I'm Goo Eun Jin.

248
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,170
Please look over me.

249
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,100
The boss deliberately didn't introduce her to you, so don't get so close.

250
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,710
♫  The feeling of the dawn will take me on to you  ♫

251
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,900
All the grandmothers and grandfathers in Hongje-dong are like family to me.

252
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,130
They know all about me.

253
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,420
I thought about what brings them physical and mental health.

254
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,200
I think they were encouraged from walking up and down the mountain barefoot

255
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
- That was true.
 - Is that true?

256
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,110
- What?
- The people in that neighborhood walking in the hills barefoot.

257
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,550
100% the truth.

258
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,760
There was an old playground in my neighborhood.

259
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,800
When I was young, I would hide there from my parents

260
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,970
until I heard my mother calling me home.

261
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,620
Even now, on days when I'm feeling things are complicated or I'm feeling good,

262
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,050
I spend time there sitting on the swing.

263
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,170
Choose copy and press the button.

264
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,810
Thank you, Sunbaenim.

265
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,470
Even at my age, sitting for a while on the swing,

266
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,170
comfort, relaxation, acknowledgement of difficulties, all of these

267
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,020
I am sure my joining Donghwa Hotel will be something

268
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,950
radiating enormous synergy.

269
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,600
Hongje-dong playground?

270
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,350
Who do you think he's talking to to make that expression?

271
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,030
My judgment tell me it's definitely his girlfriend.

272
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,570
Your judgments have been wrong every time.

273
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,560
It's a 100% when it comes to relationships. It's his girlfriend. For sure his girlfriend.

274
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,550
From his expression, he's been in a relationship for

275
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,000
35 days.

276
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,750
- Secretary Jang.
- Yes, CEO?

277
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,960
If I ask about someone's phone conversation,

278
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,310
is it weird?

279
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,430
Can I speak informally?

280
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,650
Don't.

281
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,880
- Let's wrap things up.
- Okay.

282
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,380
We have a new family member. Shall we go out for a drink?

283
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,590
I have something to do. Let's do it next time.

284
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,960
- Great work today!
- Great work everyone.

285
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,110
♬ They say that your caresses ♬

286
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:59,070
♬ will never be mine ♬

287
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,150
♬ that your loving arms ♬

288
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,390
♬ will never embrace me ♬

289
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,460
Have you even been to Hongje-dong?

290
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,160
Of course. My friend has been living there for ten years.

291
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,050
I heard that a playground there has been in the same spot for thirty years.

292
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,160
Do you think they can't develop that neighborhood?

293
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,910
If that's so, the neighborhood must be graceful.

294
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,520
In Cuba, there was an impressive garden.

295
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,960
It was the favorite garden of the landowner's wife.

296
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,060
And through the passage of time she remains there.

297
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,720
The fact that an old playground like that exists in Korea...

298
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,520
I was wondering if it's true.

299
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,750
Did you read an article on it somewhere?

300
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,470
No.

301
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,710
Someone said that.

302
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,310
Would you like to drop by for a bit?

303
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,440
No, it's not necessary.

304
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,720
(Cuban song "Si llego a besarte" by Omara Portuondo)

305
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:36,760
♬ Give me a kiss ... ♬

306
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,860
CEO?

307
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,060
I thought you resembled the CEO,

308
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,050
but you really are!

309
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,010
In Kim Jin Hyeok's new employee letter of introduction ... ah ...

310
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,390
I saw your name on the letter. Your story about the playground here was very impressive.

311
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,840
It stuck with my memory.

312
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,390
I can't sleep if I'm curious about something.

313
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,640
Ah, this playground?

314
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,860
Because I love this playground, I diligently composed the story.

315
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,570
I was very worried.

316
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:53,020
When I found out that a friend-like person whom I met on the opposite side of the world

317
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,750
was the CEO of the company I work for,

318
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,980
I was very surprised.

319
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,400
It was a bit shocking for me too.

320
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,480
I worried that you might think I helped you knowing who you were.

321
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,410
I was afraid that your good memory would turn out to be a planned meeting,

322
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:14,420
and you might misunderstand and get the wrong idea.

323
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,330
I was very worried.

324
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,220
You should let go of those types of worries.

325
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,870
I know at the very least that you're not that type of person.

326
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,800
You must be going home.

327
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,150
Then goodbye.

328
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,540
Ah, CEO!

329
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,350
Among the photos I took back there, you are in one of the photos.

330
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,760
I didn't take it on purpose; it was shot by accident.

331
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,270
Here.

332
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,160
Do you want to look at these for a moment?

333
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,440
To mark your first visit to Hongje-dong.

334
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,260
Right now?

335
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,940
Yes. Oh, right. I don't have a viewing box.

336
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,960
There is a viewing box. If you go down the street a little, there is one. Let's go down and--

337
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:29,590
I'm sorry. I got too excited thinking about Cuba

338
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,040
and forgot for a second.

339
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,310
I'm sorry, CEO.

340
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,290
Where do we need to go?

341
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,230
This way.

342
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,520
Is that a Hongje-dong resident? Who is that guy?

343
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,830
Loupe. You use it like this.

344
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:23,810
You place loupe here over the negative of the photo of you.

345
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,850
Place your eye here

346
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,350
like this.

347
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,010
Wow. No matter how much I look, it's a masterpiece.

348
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,180
Do you want to look?

349
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,240
Isn't it worse than the real thing?

350
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,890
I'll show it to you again after printing it out. If it doesn't do you justice, I'm in trouble.

351
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,360
I didn't take the photo properly.

352
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,180
Do you have money?

353
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,660
Yes. I do have money.

354
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,170
The machine doesn't take cards.

355
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,400
- You want to try this machine?
- Yes. It's my first time.

356
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,520
This becomes very addicting.

357
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,410
Then I will show you how to do it. Watch.

358
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,870
I can do this very well.

359
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:43,590
You have to get a feeling for the doll's weight.

360
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,510
For dolls with bigger heads, getting the body will make it slip out.

361
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,520
Like this.

362
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,130
Practice round.

363
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,380
Should I try it once?

364
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,010
Sure.

365
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,410
Oh!

366
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,240
I discovered another talent!

367
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,560
Usually I win every time.

368
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,710
But I'm just nervous because you're next to me.

369
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,330
Truly.

370
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,000
Ah, so you were nervous because I'm your boss?

371
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,500
A pretty woman...

372
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:16,850
Yes, because you are my top boss.

373
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,000
This doll that a pretty woman has gotten for her first time... I’ll give it to you as a souvenir.

374
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,100
I'll go now.

375
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,850
Thank you for the doll.

376
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,940
Who did you have a phone call with at around 12:42 pm today?

377
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,380
Excuse me?

378
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,900
Today...

379
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,280
A girl I like.

380
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,780
I see. You looked happy.

381
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,310
Then.

382
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,000
Around 12:42?

383
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,240
Amazing.

384
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,520
It's strange.

385
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,740
When I'm with her,

386
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,430
it's strange.

387
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,810
But who is that friend?

388
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,290
He is a newbie at the company.

389
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,250
Ah, a newbie?

390
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,840
The company waters keep becoming more fresh by the day. (People are better than before.) It's great.

391
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,870
Did you change your water filter?

392
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,810
How could you talk about filters when I'm saying the water is fresh?

393
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,500
The water that you've dirtied all up like this,

394
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,160
the fresh new hires come in and clean up.

395
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,550
They filter it like this,

396
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,400
and make it fresh and clean is what I mean.

397
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,250
A new hire came into our team, and the office atmosphere is just...

398
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,350
It's SHINee, shiny.

399
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,770
Hey, people are all the same.

400
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,830
Come over to our office sometime. I will show you the difference in person.

401
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,130
I was shiny, too, once!

402
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,310
I've seen you grow up. Don't lie.

403
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,340
I'm the living witness to how you've always been consistently dull and drab.

404
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,970
In your 20s or 50s, how could you be this dull?

405
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,890
All reporters are all the same. Going without sleep and writing everyday and reporting.

406
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,930
It's been 30 years since you've given up being a reporter! Why are you still dull then?

407
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,150
Ah, it'll be better to go and get some sleep.

408
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,540
I'm not done drinking.

409
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,840
Then finish up before you go.

410
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,740
Sit down! If I drink alone, it makes me look like something happened to me.

411
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,720
♫ The morning sunrise takes me away ♫

412
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,490
I wonder where my shoes are...

413
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,950
♫ As I'm staring at the light you hold ♫

414
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:34,720
♫  The feeling of adore. Oh take me on to you  ♫

415
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,160
♫ You're my flower and I'm your bee, ♫

416
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:50,640
♫ You know you keep me alive. ♫

417
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,670
♫ You're my reasons for everything I do ♫

418
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:00,590
♫ The other half of me ♫

419
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:07,760
♫ Oh, take me on, down a river. ♫

420
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,660
♫ I'll go wherever it leads to you. ♫

421
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:19,100
♫ Oh, take me on, into your arms. ♫

422
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,910
♫ I'll go wherever world you're on. ♫

423
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,060
Department head, here's some coffee.

424
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,950
Thank you.

425
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,770
He does look like a nice person.

426
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,340
Right, dear?

427
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,420
Well, I've known him a long time.

428
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,030
Since when have you been friends?

429
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,920
Since middle school. We grew up in the same neighborhood.

430
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,230
But not now?

431
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,610
Yes, I moved away.

432
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,890
With that face, the personality doesn't have to be so great.

433
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,890
But it seems like his personality is good, too.

434
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,020
He's nice, right?

435
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,290
I've never seen him argue with anyone now that I think about it.

436
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:27,600
But he's pretty stubborn. Once his mind is set on something, that's the only answer.

437
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,160
Then I'm the answer.

438
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,760
Excuse me?

439
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,680
What brings you back to the Banpo house suddenly?

440
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,330
My mom suddenly called me.

441
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:49,100
It seems madam misses her daughter very much.

442
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,290
There's no way that's true.

443
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,610
You haven't seen her in a while since you've been busy with the hotel in Cuba, right?

444
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,750
Since Assemblyman Cha is going to be there, have a nice, cozy time.

445
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,220
Ajusshi.

446
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,300
Yes?

447
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,890
Has our family ever been cozy?

448
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,070
You were in Cuba?

449
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,650
Yes. There was an event.

450
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:17,290
With the Sockcho hotel happening alongside it, you must be even busier. Be sure to watch your health.

451
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,400
Yes, I'm eating and sleeping well.

452
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,430
Don't worry.

453
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:26,030
How busy could she possibly be after being chucked just a hotel business to run?

454
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,880
The way you express things...

455
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,780
I need to go soon.

456
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,760
Did the something happen on the president's birthday?

457
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,810
No.

458
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:38,570
Think about it. Did nothing really happen?

459
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,220
No.

460
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,180
Then why is she asking to see me again?

461
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,390
Bothersome...

462
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,600
- Who?
- Your mother-in-law.

463
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,500
How long has it been since I got divorced? Let's be clear how you refer to her.

464
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,090
Even so.

465
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,660
Son-in-law Jeong acted like he was about to get married and kicked you out.

466
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,990
He's still taking his time...

467
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,730
He's not Son-in-law Jeong.

468
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:05,820
It's because I'm not as cold as you, so I have some affection left. Why?

469
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,700
I'll be going now.

470
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,130
Aright, drive safely.

471
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,430
Are you sure you didn't do anything that might have offended them?

472
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,730
Mom, in all my years, have I ever done anything to invite scrutiny?

473
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,600
When Dad got into politics, I wasn't even able to yawn comfortably once

474
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,480
And then I got sold off to that family. Never mind a yawn, I couldn't even breathe loudly.

475
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,060
And even now, I'm just—

476
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:38,820
Sorry, Dad. I'm not criticizing you or politics.

477
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,630
All right. Go and rest.

478
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,320
I will.

479
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,630
Who would ever like her when she's so prickly?

480
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,440
What reason is there to put down Son-in-law Jeong?!

481
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,850
Are you going to keep it up?

482
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,250
Yes.

483
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,560
What brings you here? I would have come to you.

484
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,100
Since it's not about work.

485
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,660
Is something the matter?

486
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,720
- Son.
- Yes, Mother?

487
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,530
Aren't you going to get remarried?

488
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,510
I'm seeing someone. We're still getting to know each other, so--

489
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,170
Did you say her name was Soo Ah?

490
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,840
Not that girl. Her family is too sub-par.

491
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,860
I'll take my time and--

492
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,990
Rather than her, the daughter of the candidate who almost made his way into the Blue House, Cha Soo Hyeon would be better.

493
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,730
Mother...

494
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,050
I have an important appointment.

495
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,050
Let's discuss this later.

496
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,630
There was something I needed to discuss with you.

497
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,310
Please, tell me.

498
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,690
It's about the kids.

499
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,990
What do you think about having them remarry?

500
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,840
I also was talking about Soo Hyeon and Son-in-law Jeong.

501
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,370
I guess we think alike.

502
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,750
You can leave early today. I have a lot of things that must be done.

503
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,360
It's alright. Take your time finishing up your business.

504
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,970
I feel anxious knowing you're waiting for me.

505
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,530
Then I'll have some beer at home. I'll leave the car then.

506
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,630
Great work today!

507
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,690
Please take care of me.

508
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,370
You've done great work today! Department Head, great work today.

509
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,560
I don't usually drink during company get-togethers,

510
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,450
but since I want to welcome you especially, I'll make you a drink.

511
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,980
You're mixing drinks for a new hire, when you don't even do it for the Department Head.

512
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,970
Department Head, I simply can't understand this.

513
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,090
Just look in the mirror, then you'll understand.

514
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,920
Why do you keep saying those things to me, Eun Jin?

515
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,420
Golden Ratio.

516
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,250
Kim Jin Hyeok isn't good with drinking...

517
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,660
Thank you, Sunbaenim!

518
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,630
It's okay.

519
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,580
He's good at drinking.

520
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,620
Wow.

521
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,300
- It really is golden ratio.
- It's good, right?

522
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:05,380
Give it here. Mister Jin Hyeok, now you need to taste a man's ratio.

523
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,780
- Yes.
- I'll give you this like a man.

524
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,760
Assistant Manager Park always cares for juniors.

525
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,200
- Give it here. I'll make you one just like it.
- Huh?

526
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,360
She's asking for your glass.

527
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,990
Since today is Kim Jin Hyeok's special day, I was...

528
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,200
Department Head, you are truly of the new generation.

529
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,590
If you give me too much...

530
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,620
- You should set the example for him.
- It must be really good.

531
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,990
Thank you for the drink.

532
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,010
Tastes good!

533
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,600
- Shall we fill our glasses?
- Yes.

534
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,860
Just this much.

535
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,880
Thank you.

536
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,920
Then, to a new Jin Hyeok.

537
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,730
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

538
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,470
Assistant Manager Park,

539
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,480
- Cheers!
- Please look after me.

540
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,550
- Don't drink too much.
- Don't worry.

541
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,450
Sunbaenim!

542
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,710
He keeps pulling them out of his bag.

543
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,920
Park Sunbaenim. No, Section Chief.

544
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,890
Department Head.

545
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,610
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

546
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,850
- Enjoy!
- Thanks.

547
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:11,160
When did you prepare all these? You really are good-looking.

548
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,240
Thank you!

549
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,810
Tomorrow, we must take it easy! Easy!

550
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,020
Easy, easy.

551
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,470
Assistant Manager Park!

552
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:24,350
Please get up. You should drink this.

553
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,870
Really...

554
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:33,590
Then... Since you have to take it easy ...

555
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,710
Drink this.

556
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,420
How gross.

557
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,280
Record that. How far gone he is.

558
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,830
One more sip!

559
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:49,850
What's the point of bringing up old history?

560
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,210
Let's call it a night.

561
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,130
We drank a lot.

562
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,180
We will get up.

563
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,360
Shall we go for Round 3?

564
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,300
Of course we should, round 3.

565
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,950
Assistant Manager Park, let me lend you a hand!

566
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,190
Upsy-daisy!

567
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:11,260
Just a minute. Some for me, some for you.

568
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,760
Thank you!

569
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,870
I enjoyed the food!

570
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,660
- I'll give you a lot.
- I will not eat much.

571
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,900
Aren't you going to call it a day? It's pretty late.

572
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:40,750
Let's go. I need to go for you to be able to.

573
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,950
Please schedule the Cuba Hotel planning meeting. I have something to fix.

574
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,770
Yes, I'll contact them.

575
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,630
Taxi! Taxi!

576
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,680
Right here!

577
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,020
Go home safely!

578
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,360
Drive safely!

579
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,600
Goodbye!

580
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,430
- I'll take you home. Let's go.
- Ay hey!

581
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:05,010
You're the opposite direction. You can just go, go.

582
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,860
No, no! You're really drunk. Let's go.

583
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:11,210
Call you "senior" at work, right? Senior Jeong.

584
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:11,990
I said let's go together.

585
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,750
It's okay, it's okay!

586
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,520
Driver, please drive safely!

587
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,770
Go home safely!

588
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,560
It's our hotel.

589
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,660
Is he drunk?

590
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,180
Ah, so cold.

591
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,820
It's raining...

592
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,330
The rain is coming...

593
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,980
CEO, you're leaving work late today.

594
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,880
As expected from the owner.

595
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,240
It seems you're quite drunk. I'm still holding a grudge against you for turning down my offer of the business-class seats.

596
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,360
Get in, this time.

597
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,770
Okay!

598
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,070
- Did you have a team dinner?
- Yes!

599
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,810
It was so delicious!

600
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:18,710
They all drink a lot.

601
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,780
Where is this?

602
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,430
That's... a zipper on your necktie?

603
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,320
Yes, they sell these kinds.

604
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,820
I don't know how to tie a tie, so it's a lifesaver.

605
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,350
Would you like to try? It's very simple.

606
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,330
Just zip up or down.

607
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,910
Isn't it great?

608
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:44,700
- I wanted to ask you something.
- Yes!

609
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,630
Is that still the only suit you own?

610
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,700
It's because we run into each other only when I'm wearing this suit!

611
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,680
I bought this at my mom's friend's suit store.

612
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,820
It was buy one get one.

613
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:02,210
I have an even nicer gray... you know, gray? Gray.

614
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:05,550
This is navy.

615
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,010
Of course, they both look good on me.

616
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,430
Men should wear suits, right?

617
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,670
Right?

618
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,350
It's the playground.

619
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,570
Thank you, CEO. It was a super comfortable ride home.

620
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:51,240
I'm repaying you for Cuba. Don't feel any pressure.

621
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,420
This is good. You have to drive back, and the rain stopped.

622
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,770
I think you might fall asleep driving back.

623
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,360
Chew this as you go. It's the best when you're drowsy.

624
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,550
The squid is seasoned perfectly, so it's delicious.

625
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:23,770
You're supposed to eat this before bed. But just because it's you, CEO. Ahhh!

626
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,210
No... give it here. Right here. I'll eat it on the way.

627
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,590
Place it here.

628
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,380
I must be dirty.

629
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,950
My hands are dirty and my pocket is dirty.

630
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,260
And the hands that ripped all these apart are, again, dirty.

631
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,690
I'm not very fond of squid.

632
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:52,470
I watched the salsa dance at that place three times, but I went there again just to show you.

633
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,280
I almost memorized the dance, and almost went out and danced!

634
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,400
Oh, I did go out and dance.

635
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,350
Give it to me, I'll eat it.

636
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:08,240
If you touch this, the steering wheel will smell like squid.

637
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,920
If you say, ahhh, I'll pop it right in.

638
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:26,090
Now, then, I'll get going.

639
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,770
Your car is amazing. A legendary comfort level.

640
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,270
How much are you? Awesome.

641
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,370
♫ So much. Super. The car. ♫

642
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,750
Off you go!

643
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,250
Goodbye!

644
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:20,390
Jin Hyeok, hurry up! The sun is up! Come quickly.

645
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:23,300
Hurry up, the sun is up.

646
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,460
You got home on the bus that drunk?

647
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,320
No, I took a cab...

648
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:33,860
CEO... okay!

649
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,780
Zip! Zip.

650
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,970
I must be dirty. Pop right in!

651
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,390
What?

652
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:45,250
What's wrong with him?

653
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,490
Jin Hyeok!

654
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,750
This could be my last day heading to work.

655
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,470
That ... alcohol, really ...

656
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,560
Oh... my insides.

657
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,010
Assistant Manager Park, you were able to work today

658
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:10,040
because Jin Hyeok spoon fed you when you were too drunk.

659
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,430
Do you even remember?

660
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,000
We drank too much.

661
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,490
Jin Hyeok, are you okay?

662
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:20,920
Pardon?

663
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,520
Jin Hyeok, is something concerning you?

664
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,720
You didn't make any errors at yesterday's meeting. Why look so down?

665
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,660
It's not that. My stomach is unsettled.

666
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:31,850
Will you be okay with the CEO's interview in that condition?

667
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:34,610
Pardon? CEO's interview?

668
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,670
Didn't Assistant Manager Park tell you yesterday?

669
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:40,760
It's normal in our company for new hires to have a CEO interview.

670
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,920
I asked him to join us for round 3 last night to tell him that.

671
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,660
But Kim Jin Hyeok turned it down.

672
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,120
Uh, yeah.

673
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,420
Yes, this is the PR department.

674
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,250
Oh?

675
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,360
Yes. Yes.

676
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,090
The interview.

677
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,230
The interview.

678
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:21,950
Yes?

679
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,890
CEO, Kim Jin Hyeok is here.

680
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,160
Have him come in.

681
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,410
Are you getting acclimated to the company?

682
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,370
Yes.

683
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:53,500
Everyone is friendly and helpful, so I'm able to quickly adapt.

684
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:58,520
Am I making you uncomfortable? You're different from last night.

685
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:06,320
CEO, last night I was too drunk. I apologize.

686
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,930
No need to apologize. You must feel ill.

687
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,500
Not at all. I'm fine.

688
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:19,000
Take this. It will help with the hangover. You'll feel better immediately.

689
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,260
No, thank you. My condition is fine.

690
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,630
You gave me a squid from an unknown source.

691
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:30,160
And I'm giving you a domestic hangover remedy.

692
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,640
We've become good friends this way.

693
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,990
Friends? How could I become your friend?

694
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,270
Should I open it for you? It is very effective.

695
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,550
No, thank you. I can...

696
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:54,240
That suit must be that gray suit.

697
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,620
Kim Jin Hyeok, who looks good in anything.

698
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:05,400
Does that necktie have a zipper as well?

699
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,340
Ye-yes.

700
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:21,860
I'm not sure how to apologize...

701
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,830
There's no need to apologize.

702
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:29,340
But if you still feel uneasy about it, just do me one favor.

703
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,570
Yes, just say the word.

704
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,230
Go eat ramen with me.

705
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:39,060
I've always wanted to eat ramen at a rest stop.

706
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,330
Ramen?

707
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,480
How about this weekend?

708
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,850
Would you like to try driving "How much are you? Awesome" car too?

709
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,630
"Legendary comfort level"?

710
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,830
How did the interview go?

711
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,900
You didn't fail, right?

712
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,120
I don't know. I can't remember.

713
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,390
Why is "My Way Kim Jin Hyeok" like this?

714
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,020
How can I make up for this?

715
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,760
Do you know this?

716
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,220
Today is four years since we started seeing each other.

717
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,900
Is it?

718
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:41,260
Is there still more to be done?

719
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,630
What are you speaking about?

720
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,150
Like this.

721
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:51,290
That we are doing.

722
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,190
Does this mean I'm going to work?

723
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:23,230
Do I have to wear a suit?

724
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:39,830
Hello!

725
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:41,710
Get inside.

726
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:45,700
Yes.

727
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:06,820
In movies, typically in situations like this, don't they usually eat dried squid while they go?

728
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,170
You don't have dried squid in your pocket today?

729
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:14,100
Even if I get fired, I want to say this first.

730
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,210
CEO, your grudge is no joke!

731
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:38,080
♫ I keep thinking. ♫

732
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,680
♫  Why does my heart keep pounding so?

733
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,960
Shall we go?

734
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,000
I'll buy. They should accept a card.

735
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,050
Yes.

736
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:51,980
♫ Also not understanding I am being drawn in more  ♫

737
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:57,050
♫ Little by little, step by step, to closing the distance ♫

738
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:02,030
♫ Seeing you my feeling also is slowly growing ♫

739
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:07,280
♫ Quit playing hide-and-seek and come to me now ♫

740
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,480
♫ I matched you, the last piece in the puzzle ♫

741
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,780
Eat well.

742
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:18,820
♫ You, ride this wind and come to me ♫

743
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:24,000
♫ Sweeter than the scent of spring ♫

744
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,580
Do you perhaps know about slurping noodles?

745
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,760
- Slurping?
- Yes.

746
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,760
Grabbing a bunch of noodle like this and slurping it all in one mouthful.

747
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,270
It's essential to eat it like this. Look.

748
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:39,760
Won't you be very embarrassed if you fail like you did with the claw machine?

749
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,430
I'm a total expert at this.

750
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:46,370
♫ Oh, it's been waiting for love, waiting for love, waiting for love  ♫

751
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:47,940
♫ Oh, it's been waiting for love  ♫

752
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,330
That sucks.

753
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:56,410
♫ Even your flaws are love to me ♫

754
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:58,600
♫ Oh, it's been waiting for love, waiting for love  ♫

755
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,060
One more time.

756
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:17,670
I'll drive the way back. Driving back and forth is tiring.

757
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:18,950
This is fine.

758
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:22,600
I'll do it. It seems like you have to look through work emails too.

759
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,640
Go comfortably.

760
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,340
You can adjust the side mirrors with this button.

761
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,890
Is the seat height okay?

762
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,100
No.

763
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,760
That button...

764
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,330
It's not there.

765
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:56,430
You can adjust it with this button.

766
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:31,220
I feel bad that you spent your entire day off like this.

767
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:33,320
Because of you, I got to go out for fresh air. It was nice.

768
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,770
If you want to do anything else, please let me know.

769
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:38,520
I would gladly join you.

770
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,600
I'm a bit strange, right?

771
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,730
A person, who is your company's CEO pesters you to go eat ramen.

772
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:49,040
When tomorrow comes, I might even regret it.

773
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:59,100
CEO, I thought about this on the way back.

774
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:05,380
If I was another company employee and if I had no connection to you in society, how would it have been...

775
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,250
I wondered about that.

776
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:13,680
Then like in Cuba, I can make you happy without any ulterior motives.

777
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,700
I had those thoughts.

778
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,910
It concerns you because I'm your superior, right?

779
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:24,200
It's awkward because I'm your employee, right?

780
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:27,220
Not so much.

781
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,500
Not at all for me.

782
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,660
Just a second.

783
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,420
Your cell phone, for a second.

784
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,380
Thank you.

785
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:59,600
This is my number.

786
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,710
Because you might be anxious if I know your number.

787
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:05,360
Mine's an unimportant number, so I don't mind.

788
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:10,410
Instead, just don't give my number to voice phishing.

789
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:18,220
I don't think your girlfriend would like this stuff very much.

790
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,440
My girlfriend?

791
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,400
I don't have anyone that I'm seeing.

792
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,840
Last time, you said that you were talking on the phone with a woman that you liked...

793
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:40,240
That? Ah... I was talking with my mother.

794
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:46,850
No... you talk with your mom with such a happy expression?

795
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:49,340
You must be a momma's boy.

796
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,270
Since she said to come home right away because she's making Korean beef sirloin.

797
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:57,150
If it's Korean beef sirloin, it makes me excited.

798
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:04,050
So you are the type to be excited about Korean beef sirloin... Ah.

799
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:10,240
CEO, you are really cute...

800
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,200
I'm sorry.

801
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,580
It's better than saying that I look old.

802
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:26,980
I'll get going now.

803
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,510
Yes!

804
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:47,220
Get home safely.

805
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,980
Hongje Ro 89th Road

806
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,290
"Unimportant number?"

807
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,300
Taegyeong Group

808
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:49,690
Getting the deal to construct the Cuban Hotel was impressive.

809
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:51,600
There were some highly qualified competitors,

810
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,420
but Donghwa got the deal.

811
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:58,620
I think it's because Cuba and I wanted the same thing.

812
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:03,970
A love of all things that's been with us for a long time.

813
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:06,270
Secretary Jang

814
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:17,970
Sorry, I think this is urgent. Sorry.

815
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:22,340
I'm in a meeting. Is this an urgent matter?

816
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:25,100
Did you see the link I sent through message?

817
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,900
No, I told you that I was in a meeting.

818
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:32,720
Quickly look at it. I'll call you again. Quickly, Soo Hyeon.

819
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,320
Our CEO's name is on the top of the search list.

820
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,040
Why is that?

821
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,340
[Exclusive] CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's Rest Stop Date

822
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:56,970
What is this?

823
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,540
What is this?

824
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:18,370
[Exclusive] CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's Rest Stop Date

825
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:38,700
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's Rest Stop date

826
01:08:55,580 --> 01:09:01,210
♫ Once, a brief moment of the day ♫

827
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:08,580
♫ Could it have been then? Was that when I felt it? ♫

828
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:14,440
♫ An unexplainable feeling ♫

829
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:20,520
♫ When I'm with you, that's what I think ♫

830
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:26,970
♫  That's the moment right now we're together  ♫

831
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:34,480
♫ Everyday is beautiful to me ♫

832
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:39,850
♫ It's beautiful time  ♫

833
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:43,150
♫ My heart beats loudly every time ♫

834
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:45,210
♫ It's beautiful day  ♫

835
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:48,520
Encounter
~ Preview ~

836
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,350
I'm not having fun that I met a whole new world.

837
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:55,430
I'm not going to be sold off by my mom twice.

838
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:59,440
♫ Makes me forget everything ♫

839
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,610
Madam, you need to go to the sea.

840
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:05,320
Are you a monster? Why are you making a kind and sincere person into a stalker?

841
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:09,240
Is seeing a friend also something that has to be ended?

842
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,540
Growing distant again, it's as painful as ever.

843
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:16,980
That's why I am going to stop it.

844
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,240
♫ Out of everything which passes here ♫

845
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,980
♫ You're the only one seeing me coming and going ♫
