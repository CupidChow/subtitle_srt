1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,360
Encounter

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,550
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,970
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,870
Boyfriend

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,880
I would like for my family to continue living quietly and happily,

6
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,020
as we do now.

7
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,810
I'm worried that my child will just get hurt

8
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,400
and will be talked about by people for a long time.

9
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,380
I'm scared to death.

10
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,650
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

11
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,740
Please, please. With our Jin Hyeok...

12
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,720
Please break up with our Jin Hyeok.

13
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,680
Episode 14

14
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,770
Donghwa Hotel

15
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,170
Here. This is what you asked for.

16
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,840
How long will these flowers last without withering?

17
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,920
Um, they said that they would last for about five years.

18
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,280
Who gave the bouquet to you? Did a friend of yours whom I don't know get married?

19
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,280
What other friends do I have besides you?

20
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,240
Thank you.

21
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,070
Yes.

22
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,520
This is good.

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,440
Thank you.

24
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,850
Jin Hyeok, do you have some time this evening?

25
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,480
Were you surprised?

26
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,350
Yes.

27
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,950
A little.

28
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,390
Don't be nervous. I just got in touch with you to have a meal with you once.

29
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,290
Alright.

30
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,420
With CEO Cha... Or rather...

31
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,120
How are things with our Soo Hyeon?

32
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,360
- What do you mean?
- Well, a lot of difficult things happened.

33
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,510
I'm just asking if you're still dating well.

34
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,460
CEO Cha doesn't talk much, so that's why I'm asking you.

35
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,270
I treasure CEO very greatly.

36
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:47,360
She's the person who let me know what it's like to love someone for the first time.

37
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,770
So I want to take responsibility for that love.

38
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,310
There's a task that I've been hesitating to carry out since a long time ago.

39
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,310
It's not that I was hesitating, it's that I couldn't do it. Because I was being cowardly.

40
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:12,190
But my worst anxiety is that Soo Hyeon will be left all alone.

41
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,590
Then I would not be able to help her.

42
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,880
But now it's time for me to do that task.

43
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm very happy that she's with you, Jin Hyeok.

44
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,100
Please take care of Soo Hyeon.

45
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,150
I'm asking you to become a reliable fence around her.

46
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,040
Please watch over us.

47
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,790
So that the CEO is not left on her own and lonely,

48
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,030
I will always be by her side.

49
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,700
Alright.

50
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,790
Leather crafting.

51
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,460
Um, I don't have the kind of face that needs to go this far to maintain it.

52
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,420
Don't you see the wrinkles around your eyes?

53
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,890
I'm worrying about it because I have such a big heart.

54
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,590
But you came all the way here on the weekend instead of resting. Is it alright if my heart flutters?

55
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,590
Ah, you're overdoing it, seriously.

56
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,070
I came because I also had something to ask you.

57
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,040
What is it?

58
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,310
Do you know what Kim Jin Hyeok's mother wrote in the note that she sent?

59
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,640
Hey, it would be unfair for me to look at that.

60
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,970
Why?

61
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,920
- I think that it's the cause, but she won't tell me. It's so frustrating.
- The cause?

62
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,640
What is it?

63
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,280
CEO Cha doesn't look good at all these days.

64
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,230
She didn't look that bad even when she was being harassed by Taegyeong Group. What could it be?

65
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,950
Ah, really?

66
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,310
Oh, Secretary Jang— No, it's Noona Jang Mi Jin!

67
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,230
Hey.

68
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,530
What's that?

69
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,790
- Jin Myeong.
- Yeah?

70
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,140
Is there nothing going on at home right now? Are your father and mother doing well?

71
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,300
Yeah, everyone's doing fine.

72
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,710
Ah, but our mom is acting weird these days.

73
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,400
She asked me if it was hard to buy groceries online out of nowhere.

74
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,260
She must be tired of going to the marketplace.

75
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,310
Ah, that's right. I have to be off for a day to go to a class reunion.

76
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,740
It would be nice if Noona Jang Mi Jin could come help that day, wouldn't it?

77
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,150
- Yeah.
- Why would I?

78
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,910
Wasting manpower is not the way to go.

79
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,530
What? They said that she's the goddess of serving. A goddess.

80
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,450
Oh, oh, that's right.

81
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,340
- They say she's totally flying around.
- Jeez.

82
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,360
Jeez. When is it?

83
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,850
Yes! Thank you!

84
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,640
Kim Jeong Pyo

85
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,990
It's been such a long time, Jeong Pyo.

86
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,090
Jeong Pyo.

87
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,430
After the mayoral election

88
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,410
I couldn't bring myself to come.

89
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:58,940
At first, I rationalized saying that couldn't I at least do that for a good cause.

90
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,320
But they say the smallest difference in perspective

91
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,940
will later make us run off the track.

92
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,750
Furthermore, I would be more ashamed that you saw it.

93
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,240
I don't think I'll be able to come again for a while.

94
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,430
I'm going to take care of things well and come back to see you later.

95
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,140
Oh, you're here?

96
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,480
I didn't know that you'd come, Ahjussi.

97
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,930
It's good to see you here, Hyungnim.

98
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,330
Thank you.

99
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,080
Yes, please enjoy.

100
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,570
Hey, today I have to have a drink. Will you drive? I will have just one.

101
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,020
Call a substitute driver.

102
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,320
Weren't you coming by yourself without us knowing, Assemblyman?

103
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,680
You always used to come with us to my older brother's memorial,

104
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,700
but then you stopped coming at some point.

105
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,960
You should call him by just one nickname.

106
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,910
It's like there are four of us eating. Is he "ahjussi"? Is he "assemblyman"?

107
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,880
Just leave it alone. Anyway I soon won't be able to hear "assemblyman".

108
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,840
What?

109
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,830
What are you saying? Ah, if you go to the Blue House, you'll be changing title.

110
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,080
People can hear you, this girl.

111
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,100
I came to give Jeong Pyo a report.

112
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,320
What report?

113
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,820
Shall we have a glass of rice wine?

114
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,830
I'd be thankful, of course.

115
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,030
- Please give us a bottle of rice wine!
- Yes!

116
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,360
This broth tastes good.

117
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,020
Um, I came because I wanted to make a case for the camera.

118
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,550
- Ah, it's your first time making one, right?
- Yes.

119
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,320
Alright, then let's go over here and look at the leathers first.

120
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,700
Which type of leather would you like?

121
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,400
What would be good?

122
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,740
You said that we should get some alcohol, so I thought you were talking about wine.

123
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,360
But wow. You're even eating chicken gizzards.

124
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,160
Ah, you're acting so natural. I guess you've been to food stalls a few times.

125
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,910
Food stalls have their own charm.

126
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:39,350
They do. I'm around whelks at day and food stalls at night. Wow, I can't believe it.

127
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,370
What's wrong? Tell me truthfully.

128
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,590
There's nothing much going on. Not yet.

129
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,990
Not yet? There's nothing going on yet,

130
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,180
but you think that something will happen in the future. Is that what you're saying right now?

131
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:01,330
No, it's just that, well... Something that I have to worry about has happened.

132
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,770
- You met Kim Jin Hyeok's mother, didn't you?
- No.

133
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,600
Ridiculous. You think I didn't know?

134
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,710
What is it? Did she ask you to break up?

135
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,670
I told you, that's not it.

136
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,340
Then why are you acting like that? What are you worried about?

137
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Because I'm wondering if it's alright for me to keep on dating this person.

138
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,570
Hey, to be honest...

139
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,430
At first, I was really worried when I saw you and Kim Jin Hyeok getting close to each other.

140
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,380
But after watching from beside you, I ended up acknowledging your relationship.

141
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,450
This should be the happiest time for you, so why are you having those kinds of thoughts?

142
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,570
Because I feel like I don't fit.

143
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,080
With whom? With Kim Jin Hyeok?

144
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,430
With his family.

145
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,970
Hey.

146
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,590
That's a disease. Being considerate of others is a serious disease. Why would you?

147
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,700
It's fine if the two of you are happy. Why would you go so far as to worry about the family?

148
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,060
Jin Hyeok is experiencing all of this for the first time.

149
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,540
I've been married and all the people in the world know me.

150
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:28,110
It feels like there's a limit to how much more we can dream.

151
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,990
Kim Jin Hyeok isn't the type of person to worry about things like that.

152
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,230
I'm the one who's worried about it.

153
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,150
This is driving me crazy, seriously.

154
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,070
Hey.

155
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,250
This is also your first time experiencing this.

156
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,030
This is also

157
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,680
your first love.

158
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,900
I really don't want to break up with him, Mi Jin.

159
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,700
That's why I'm saying don't break up. Just think of you and him.

160
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,700
But I can't do that.

161
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,500
I want to pretend that I don't know about it, but my heart keeps dropping to the ground.

162
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:49,300
Soo Hyeon, think of everything that you've endured until now. You made it through even worse,

163
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,980
You thought that you would fall over and die so many times dealing with that, but you overcame it all.

164
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,070
Why are you having those thoughts now? Don't think like that.

165
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,620
I'm so worried.

166
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,580
Jin Hyeok made the choice.

167
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,820
He made the choice to endure through

168
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,170
my life that is full of events that defy common sense.

169
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:16,660
But what sin did his family commit that, because of me...?

170
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,730
Alright. I understand how you feel.

171
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,080
But nothing's even happened yet. Why are you already getting scared in advance?

172
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,320
With this kind of lifestyle,

173
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,480
once it starts, it crashes over you.

174
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,950
It doesn't give you room to even turn around.

175
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,070
So I can't pretend that I don't know anything.

176
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:44,670
Soo Hyeon, let's go... And talk about this with Kim Jin Hyeok. Okay?

177
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,310
You know what kind of person he is.

178
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,680
He'll tell me not to worry

179
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,580
and suffer all on his own.

180
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,770
I'm the only one who can decide

181
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,530
whether we'll continue dating or not.

182
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,290
Well, just know this.

183
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,650
Kim Jin Hyeok is a better person than me.

184
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,440
I just watched you from the sidelines.

185
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,190
He's the person who will hold you, carry you,

186
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:23,220
and go with you to the end. There's no one else like that.

187
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,440
You just hold it like this,

188
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,780
add light pressure, and push it forward like this. Make sure you don't add too much pressure.

189
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,860
- This is good, right?
- Yes.

190
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,660
Yes, that's good.

191
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,800
Do you want to try it right here?

192
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,570
Let me practice a little more.

193
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,230
Jin Hyeok.

194
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,230
Yes, Jin Hyeok?

195
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,580
Today's your day off.

196
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,580
- Yes.
- Oh?

197
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,010
But you haven't called me yet.

198
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,660
Ah, because I have to visit the countryside today.

199
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,480
Are you going with Manager Nam?

200
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,400
It's something personal.

201
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,240
Wow. Seriously.

202
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,340
I mean, you should have contacted me even more so.

203
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,530
What are you doing leaving your boyfriend behind? I can drive for you and help you with your work. Right?

204
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,260
And we can go on a date while we're at it.

205
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,510
Because I'm coming right back and it's not that far away.

206
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,920
Whether it's close or far away, you should think about doing everything together.

207
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,860
Ah, you're way too independent.

208
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,680
I did it so you could get some rest.

209
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,350
How is it resting when I can't even see my girlfriend?

210
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,310
Soo Hyeon.

211
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,600
Sorry, the call took a while.

212
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,210
Do you like this painting?

213
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,650
The color is pretty.

214
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,850
The weather's nice. Do you want to go outside and take a walk?

215
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,460
Alright.

216
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,460
Ms. Writer, you're here?

217
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,360
I'm calculating my annual leave these days.

218
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,790
Your annual leave?

219
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,490
I found out that I have a lot of hours if I add in my summer vacation hours.

220
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,070
Our company has great employee benefits,

221
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,800
so I heard that they don't mind even if you use it all at once.

222
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,380
- That woman is like that.
- That's right.

223
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,120
What do you think about us taking about ten days off

224
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,740
and walk the Camino de Santiago this year?

225
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:50,400
I'm guessing the company would be in trouble if you took a long vacation.

226
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,700
Think it over.

227
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:01,880
I'll look into which route is best for walking.

228
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,440
I heard that friends who go there end up fighting a lot.

229
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,060
They get tired as they walk.

230
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,830
Well, that wouldn't happen with us.

231
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,710
Well, I'll just carry you on my back if you get tired.

232
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,920
It would be nice if it were about ten days long.

233
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,200
Because it will be hot and crowded when it's vacation time, right?

234
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,860
Yes, hello? Yes, Teacher Lee.

235
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,810
Yes, that's right. I'm with the CEO. What? You want her to come alone?

236
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,670
Yes. I'll be sure to call you.

237
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,350
Teacher Lee told you to come over alone once.

238
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,820
- Why?
- She said that she needed to badmouth me.

239
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:13,910
I mean, even if there's something good you can say about me, it would be hard to find something to badmouth me about. Right?

240
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,600
Anyway, don't go alone.

241
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,360
She knows too much of my black history.

242
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,330
Stop by there one time later on. She listens really well if you're worried about something.

243
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,180
But, you'll see her say

244
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,800
that she doesn't have any poor solutions.

245
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:28,180
♫  When the door opens, you whom I love comes to me  ♫

246
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:35,300
♫  A fairy tale which kisses beautifully ♫

247
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:43,080
♫  When night falls, where there is just the two of us ♫

248
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,460
♫  A fairy tale where I dance holding you ♫

249
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:55,610
♫  While I spend such a day with you ♫

250
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:04,300
♫  I don't want to wake up from that fairytale-like dream ♫

251
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:13,940
♫ I don't want to wake up and leave from here ♫

252
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:21,660
♫  I want to dream and hold you a little longer ♫

253
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:28,100
♫ If I wake up it seems these many stories  ♫

254
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:35,040
♫  will all disappear. While I'm thinking that. ♫

255
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:42,920
♫  Sometimes I imagine I'm somewhere you're not ♫

256
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:50,100
♫ I'm scared as though my body will freeze up. ♫

257
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,760
♫  There is no such day for me. ♫

258
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,560
♫  My day on which you abandon me ♫

259
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:12,280
We should have eaten at home. Should we tell Dad to come, too?

260
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,340
Do you like Dad more than me?

261
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,550
I like my husband and my sons. Who would I like more?

262
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,150
- I feel comfortable when I eat chicken with you, Mom.
- Why?

263
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,790
Look. You only like the dry pieces.

264
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,960
Even if I eat all of the drumsticks, I don't feel guilty at all.

265
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,080
Ah, I guess that's why people like eating chicken with me.
- Yeah.

266
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,990
One hundred percent!

267
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,850
- Mom.
- Huh?

268
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:58,150
- The CEO came to our house that time.
- Yeah.

269
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,330
What did you think?

270
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,350
What do you mean, what did I think?

271
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,110
I just thought that I should treat her well since she was a guest.

272
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,930
You know that she's not just a guest.

273
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,050
When it comes to you and her,

274
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,410
I worry first.

275
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:29,650
That's right. Of course you're really worried. Because we're so different.

276
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:35,500
Jin Hyeok. Wouldn't a relationship with too many differences

277
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,430
be difficult?

278
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,050
I didn't know that I'd end up liking someone this much.

279
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:57,160
At first, I thought that it was just a coincidence.

280
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,060
But the more time passed,

281
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,400
I came to think that we weren't just a passing coincidence.

282
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,370
I want you to like her too, Mom.

283
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,690
She's a good person.

284
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,850
I think that she's making me into a great man.

285
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,970
Jin Hyeok.

286
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:30,080
She is... That kind of person, Mom.

287
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,070
To be honest, I...

288
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,330
Because you're still young,

289
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,200
I don't want you to set yourself a path to walk on.

290
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,420
The world is large, and you've got a lot of time.

291
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:51,310
Mom. There are only two women that I love in this whole wide world.

292
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,860
You and her.

293
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,040
You're going to ask me who I love more, aren't you?

294
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,810
I love you both exactly the same.

295
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,710
It's just a different kind of love.

296
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,160
My love for you and my love for her.

297
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,180
That's right, it's different. It's different, Jin Hyeok.

298
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,210
Because I'm your mother, I won't change. But that person—

299
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,680
She won't change either.

300
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,650
I think the time that she could have

301
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,460
has all passed already.

302
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,470
Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

303
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,710
It's nice that you came so quickly.

304
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,460
I asked you to come over so I can badmouth Jin Hyeok, and you came right away.

305
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,150
Does Jin Hyeok not listen to you well?

306
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,030
No. Not at all.

307
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:27,320
What do you think? Since you visited Jin Hyeok's house,

308
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,990
it feels like you're closer. Doesn't it?

309
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,070
Yes.

310
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:40,790
But then why do you look like that? Is something wrong?

311
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,740
Teacher.

312
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,130
Yes.

313
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:54,550
Would you be a bamboo forest for me tonight?

314
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,770
Of course. Don't worry about anything and

315
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,040
shout "The king has donkey ears!"
(referring to a famous traditional tale)

316
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,620
Tell me. I'll keep it a secret from Jin Hyeok.

317
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,960
The amount of days that I laugh has increased

318
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,140
ever since I met him.

319
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,560
This is my first time being this happy.

320
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:31,250
Jin Hyeok is that kind of person.

321
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,740
Um... Jin Hyeok's mom came to see me.

322
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,730
You must have been surprised.

323
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,540
No.

324
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,100
I just thought, "What was supposed to come, has come".

325
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:59,180
The very first thing that I worried about was Jin Hyeok's parents.

326
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:08,910
One day, Jin Hyeok suggested that we begin a "some" relationship.

327
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,170
I felt so happy hearing that.

328
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,980
But back then, while that was happening,

329
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,210
I became worried.

330
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,320
I thought, "Is it alright for me to do this?"

331
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:28,300
"Will his parents welcome me?"

332
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,240
Why did I worry about that first?

333
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,850
It wasn't about the hotel.

334
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,310
It wasn't even about the worries that suffocate me.

335
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,620
I was worried about whether Jin Hyeok's parents would like me.

336
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,710
To be honest, I guess I was the most scared of this.

337
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,250
If the ordinary happiness of Jin Hyeok's family

338
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:08,000
would be shaken because of me, there would be no answer for that.

339
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,980
But should I be persistent?

340
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,490
Should I apologize, ask them to forgive me, and beg them?

341
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,020
Wouldn't that be enough?

342
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:34,310
I already know.

343
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,000
I know very well

344
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,840
how exhausting and uncomfortable it is

345
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,340
to live a life where you're thrown in front of the gaze of others.

346
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,380
So,

347
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,930
I know that we can't continue.

348
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,840
CEO Jeong Woo Seok

349
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,580
Cha Jong Hyeon gives up running for the presidency. "We support Hancheon Party's Lee Cheong Wook!"

350
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,540
Today, Representative Cha Jong Hyeon of Moonhwa Party announced a merger with Hancheon Party.

351
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,280
Representative Cha Jong Hyeon declared his support for Representative Lee Cheong Wook of Hancheon Party.

352
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,790
Practically, he gave up being a presidential election candidate.

353
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,710
As a result, Representative Lee Cheong Wook...

354
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,000
has become a strong candidate in the presidential election.

355
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,580
Cha Jong Hyeon gives up running for President. "We support Hancheon Party's Lee Cheong Wook!"

356
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,560
I guess you just need to organize the hotel well.

357
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,060
Status of Donghwa Hotel Shareholdings
Kim Hwa Jin 17.68%, Cha Soo Hyeon 26.42%, Jeong Woo Seok 37.29%, Others 4.80%

358
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,290
CEO Jeong Woo Seok

359
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,640
I can trust that you are going to handle things in the way that I'm thinking, correct?

360
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,500
If you are going to be overzealous, I won't go easy on you, even if you're my son.

361
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,300
You dare to stab me in the back?

362
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,720
Before I abandoned you, Cha Jong Hyeon, you dared...

363
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,300
to abandon Taegyeong Group?

364
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:16,800
I will not just stand by and do nothing while you do this.

365
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,700
Are you crazy! What are you doing?!

366
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,800
You were really shocked, weren't you? I'm sorry for not being able to inform you in advance.

367
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,720
Of course you didn't inform me beforehand.

368
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,080
Because I knew that you'd act like this.

369
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,330
How could you do this?

370
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,620
How could you do this to me?!

371
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,710
My dream. Was it nothing to you?

372
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,990
Is it alright for you to throw away like that the dreams I've spent my whole life chasing?

373
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:54,460
I... I endured everything to get us to this point.

374
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,190
How could you just disregard it all. Why?

375
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,160
Why?!

376
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,760
Soo Hyeon's mom.

377
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,440
You worked really hard.

378
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,480
Now, let's lay all that down and let's start a different dream.

379
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,600
No. There is no other dream. It's all over now.

380
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,700
Honey. You need to wrap this up for me.

381
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,850
What are you trying to say?

382
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,750
Snap out of it!

383
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,780
This is a new start!

384
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,730
There's something that you can help me with.

385
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,580
Just leave it alone. Anyway I soon won't be able to hear "assemblyman".

386
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,560
I came to give a report to Jeong Pyo today.

387
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:54,170
It this happens, won't the pressure from Taegyeong Group get even worse?

388
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,850
Of course, it's war. They are at odds with each other.

389
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,840
But if you think about it, isn't this a good thing?

390
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,000
The CEO doesn't have to worry about Assemblyman Cha's image anymore.

391
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,940
There's a task that I've been hesitating to carry out since a long time ago.

392
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:17,280
But the biggest problem is that I worry that Soo Hyeon will be left all alone..

393
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,700
I've very happy that she's with you, Jin Hyeok.

394
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,960
Am I right?

395
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,400
Be quiet.

396
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,270
Dad, how did this happen?

397
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,440
Up to now you have worked diligently to get to this point.

398
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,760
Soo Hyeon.

399
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,990
Yes?

400
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,590
This is a new start.

401
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,490
"All that's fair must fade."

402
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,820
The power of politics isn't only valid for a set period of time.

403
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,770
Make that time that you spent purposeful. That's what I believe it means.

404
00:38:54,770 --> 00:39:00,020
Things that are impossible to accomplish and the things you absolutely must accomplish, working towards those

405
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,560
isn't that what good politics are?

406
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,100
Letting go of that burden I held for 10 years is so refreshing.

407
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,540
Don't worry.

408
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,480
Why is your face like that?

409
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,720
Thanks to you, my daughter,

410
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,760
I was able to accomplish something great.

411
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,580
Thank you.

412
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,880
Taegyeong Group will try to make things more difficult for you. Fight through it well.

413
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,130
Now it's time arrange things properly.

414
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:36,610
Don't worry about me. Now I'm not afraid.

415
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,430
My daughter is growing cooler little by little.

416
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,520
I like seeing this.

417
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,730
Alright. Aigoo.

418
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,830
I guess I have to answer this.

419
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,270
Finally, I can breathe again.

420
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,780
Yes. Alright.

421
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,320
What is this, Hyungnim?

422
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,180
Let's go have some rice wine.

423
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,250
Even if you have free time, I'm working right now.

424
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,790
You can get fired then.

425
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,160
What are you saying? What did you talk to Soo Hyeon about?

426
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,760
Huh?

427
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,050
I told you I could drive.

428
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,000
Manager Nam was too drunk to drive, so he called me.

429
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,660
He wanted me to take you home.

430
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,970
I'm alright.

431
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,540
I'll take you home. Go comfortably.

432
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:41,100
You were shocked, weren't you?

433
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,260
Of course I was shocked.

434
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,620
I was shocked at how cool my dad is.

435
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:55,530
It wasn't easy for him to do. He must have had a hard time by himself.

436
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,370
But my worst anxiety is that Soo Hyeon will be left all alone.

437
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,360
I couldn't do it because I was being cowardly.

438
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:13,050
Do you know what you must do now?

439
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,910
Be happier.

440
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:22,530
Your father treasures you so much and everyone at work supports you.

441
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,950
And whatever happens,

442
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,290
I will protect you, so you can just be happy.

443
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,850
I'll do that.

444
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,900
No. That smile is a bit ambiguous.

445
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,260
Yes, Secretary Jang.

446
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,250
CEO, I forgot to tell you.

447
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,220
About that information on the report regarding the foreign business team that you mentioned.

448
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,130
I sent it, not to your company email but to your private email.

449
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:55,880
Thank you.

450
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,130
Mi Jin, the food is ready.

451
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,290
Bye, CEO.

452
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,880
Secretary Jang is with Dae Chan.

453
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,300
That's perfect. Let's go to his restaurant.

454
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,310
Today, I'm a bit tired.

455
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,830
You can't just go home alone like this.

456
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,130
I'll go next time.

457
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,060
Then you choose.

458
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,420
Either you hang around with me, or go out to eat whelks with me.

459
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,720
Cheers!

460
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,540
Jin Myeong.

461
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,590
Yes?

462
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,590
That's your hyung, right?

463
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,690
He can never hide his good looks.

464
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,980
You must be doing well now.

465
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,190
My house has always been well off. They'll have no worries as long as I do well.

466
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,750
What is there to worry about?

467
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,450
Just ask your hyung for help to get into the hotel.

468
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,930
My hyung is an employee. You think he's the boss.

469
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,160
If you seduce the boss, then you're pretty much the boss yourself.

470
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,770
Right! Right!

471
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,300
What do you mean, seduce? They've known each other since they were in Cuba.

472
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,480
Then, your father can close his shop now.

473
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,800
Truthfully, he's been running that fruit stand for a long time.

474
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,210
Couldn't he ask her to set him up with a supermarket?

475
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,830
Why are you guys only talking about my hyung when we're at a class reunion?

476
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,150
Cheers!

477
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,690
You said you were seeing your girlfriend again. Good for you.

478
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:27,080
If I just looked as good as Jin Hyeok, I'd find a rich woman like him and, bam!

479
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,320
My life would be easy, wouldn't it?

480
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,130
I'm so jealous!

481
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,220
Stop it! I bet you're making Jin Myeong uncomfortable.

482
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,070
Why? I'm just saying it because I'm jealous.

483
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,880
It'd be great if I had an older brother like that.

484
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,230
Hey, have you really seen that woman too?

485
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,590
She's totally crazy over your brother, isn't she?

486
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,020
How should I put it? I thought Jin Hyeok was a nice guy, but

487
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,020
actually he appears to be seductively sexy.

488
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,390
Stop it!

489
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,530
Don't speak nonsense when you don't know anything.

490
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,520
Is it wrong for me to say that I'm jealous?!

491
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,900
This bastard is throwing punches because he's got his brother's backing. Hey!

492
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,660
Try to hit me!

493
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,720
Hey, hey! Jin Myeong, don't do it! Stop!

494
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,060
Yes, Jin Myeong.

495
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:22,120
What? Where are you?

496
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,000
I got it. I'll be right there.

497
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,970
You don't have to accept more customers as of now and I'll be right back.

498
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,670
I'm sorry.

499
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,850
Did something happen to Jin Myeong?

500
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:41,900
- Who is this person?
- Someone else who hit him. It's someone else.

501
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,030
Hello. I'm looking for Kim Jin Myeong.

502
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,630
Hyung.

503
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,430
What are you and CEO—

504
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:08,000
What about Jin Myeong and Dae Chan?

505
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,730
The thing is that...

506
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,390
Dae Chan, what's going on?

507
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,960
Yeah.

508
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:27,130
I talked on the phone with Dae Chan earlier.

509
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:32,140
It seems like Jin Myeong's friends were talking badly about Jin Hyeok.

510
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,390
Soo Hyeon, I'm sorry. I'll call you later.

511
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:53,030
It seems like Jin Myeong's friends were talking badly about Jin Hyeok.

512
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,940
My neighbors are saying this.

513
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:23,460
That it's because he's with you that he got into the company.

514
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:29,440
You and our Jin Hyeok are very different.

515
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,780
I'm worried that our Jin Hyeok will just get hurt

516
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,960
and be talked about by people for a long time.

517
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,260
Don't be scared.

518
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,160
The closer I get to you,

519
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,410
it seems I shake your life even more. That makes me hesitant.

520
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:09,400
Your past isn't that important to me.

521
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,600
Because I love one person, Cha Soo Hyeon.

522
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:18,740
I want to be with that person every single day.

523
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,040
You'll let us do that, right?

524
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,600
Doesn't it hurt?

525
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,020
I didn't get hit that much.

526
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,980
I'm sorry.

527
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,500
Ah, I really was trying my hardest not to hit him.

528
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,140
You did well.

529
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,210
What did I do well? I just got in a fight.

530
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:15,470
It's wrong to just listen to someone talking badly about your family.

531
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,850
You did well.

532
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:22,400
I should have hit that bastard at least once. He's always played around too much since we were in school.

533
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,180
I didn't do it because of you, so don't misunderstand.

534
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,080
Wow. You're getting more mature, Jin Myeong.

535
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,860
I'm not getting mature. I'm still getting into fights.

536
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:41,900
Later, be friends with him again. He is your long-term friend after all.

537
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,910
I don't know. You just don't have other thoughts.

538
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,880
You're going to make up with him, right?

539
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,070
You have to for me not to think other thoughts.

540
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:56,080
Ah, I'll think about it.

541
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,930
But... how much did it cost?

542
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,170
I have some money I saved up from my part-time job.

543
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,520
I took care of it.

544
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,300
Let's keep this a secret between us two.

545
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,980
Mom and Dad will worry.

546
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,250
You really are not angry?

547
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,380
- Jin Myeong.
- What?

548
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,070
I'm sorry.

549
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:26,000
Why are you sorry? I told you, I didn't do it because of you!

550
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,300
What's been up with you since earlier?

551
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,710
Ah, I don't know! It's hurting more since I keep talking.

552
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,610
This will swell more tomorrow, won't it?

553
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,680
Let me see.

554
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,470
Ah, what the heck is this on your cute face?

555
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,360
- Aigoo.
- I'll kiss it for you.

556
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,160
Ah, hey!

557
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,530
This is why I call you informally instead of "Hyung".

558
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:47,490
- Be careful, Kim Jin Myeong.
- Let's go.

559
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:24,120
♫  You can't start entering ♫

560
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,890
♫  into my heart like this. ♫

561
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,120
No matter what happens,

562
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:33,080
I'll protect you. So all you have to do is be happy.

563
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,780
- I will.
- Hm?

564
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,080
I don't think so. That smile is a bit ambiguous.

565
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:46,500
♫ They shake my heart ♫

566
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:53,430
♫  The more I like you ♫

567
00:51:53,430 --> 00:52:01,290
♫  The more I depend on you ♫

568
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:04,320
Jin Hyeok, how is Jin Myeong?

569
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,600
It seems like he just got into an argument with his friends while they were drinking.

570
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,750
You know, the arguments that always happen when guys are together.

571
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:16,470
It was really nothing serious, so don't worry about it.

572
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:23,350
I shouldn't have told you to come to my neighborhood. I just ended up making you feel uneasy.

573
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,620
I called because I thought you might keep worrying.

574
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:34,790
My heart is at ease since I answered your call.

575
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,690
So get some good sleep.

576
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,830
Work tomorrow, okay?

577
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,420
I will.

578
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,120
Sleep well.

579
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,450
Benefits of Donghwa Hotel's Weddings

580
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:13,340
How far have we gotten with the release of the wedding products, Hye In?

581
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,700
The online release has already begun, and I think the release in the magazine will open when it's published.

582
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,030
Okay.

583
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,810
Wow, the pictures are nice. The models are definitely on a different level.

584
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,590
I think the composition is nice.

585
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:27,470
The bride is a little disappointing. She's too tall.

586
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,220
You need to be petite like me to be lovely.

587
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:35,140
You've looked into the mirror, right? Do you know what the word "lovely" means while you're using it?

588
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,290
It means lovely and Eun Jin-like.

589
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,660
Ah, so you don't look at the mirror.

590
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:10,000
CEO, I still haven't decided if this is something that I should tell you or not.

591
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,470
What's the matter?

592
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:15,460
I was contacted by Jang Soo Ah.

593
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:20,620
CEO Jeong's woman. She would like to meet you for a bit.

594
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,690
I wanted to see you at least once,

595
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:32,400
but I was not courageous enough.

596
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,340
We're not in the type of relationship where we really need to meet.

597
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:43,620
You're right. I sought you out today because I wanted to give you this as a present.

598
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,360
You came to the art gallery before, didn't you?

599
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,210
You looked at my painting for a long time then.

600
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:58,930
Because the painting left an impression. I didn't know it was your painting.

601
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,590
My name is Jang Soo Ah.

602
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,690
Why are you giving me that painting?

603
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,640
Now, I am going to New York.

604
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,540
Before I go there, I wanted to apologize to you.

605
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,080
What happened between the two of you is in the past.

606
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,590
- There's no need for an apology—
- It's because nothing happened.

607
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:23,780
Nothing happened between me and CEO Jeong.

608
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,310
And there is no relationship between us.

609
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:31,210
That is not important to me. Don't worry about it.

610
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:34,300
He said that all we had to do was eat together

611
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,780
or go watch a performance together sometimes.

612
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,500
He said that was enough.

613
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:48,420
I could finish my studies and start a small private academy thanks to him.

614
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:53,340
What? What do you mean?

615
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,780
I'm telling you that it was fake.

616
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,210
I'm telling you that it was all an act.

617
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:04,210
One of the conditions was to keep it a secret,

618
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,450
but I haven't been able to keep it.

619
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,300
I wanted to apologize.

620
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,590
Because it wasn't a good thing to do, no matter how much I think about it.

621
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:17,380
It started as an act, but as time passed,

622
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:20,110
I ended up being hopeful.

623
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,560
That just maybe...

624
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:26,170
But that was all my own delusion.

625
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:34,790
I have never been gazed at warmly by CEO Jeong Woo Seok.

626
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,260
I was jealous.

627
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:42,910
I was always jealous of you, CEO Cha Soo Hyeon.

628
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:49,650
That he made it possible for me to study art is probably hurtful to you,

629
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,940
but I want to give this painting to you as an apology.

630
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,750
Then.

631
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,170
I was surprised.

632
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:45,290
You came all the way to my personal office.

633
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,030
I heard everything.

634
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,580
About what?

635
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,880
Jang Soo Ah came to visit me.

636
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,460
Why did you do it?

637
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:04,140
I thought about it a lot.

638
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,020
What to do so that you could breathe.

639
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,650
You must have suffered a lot.

640
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:20,880
Compared to the heartache you suffered through while living at our house, well...

641
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,250
But Woo Seok...

642
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,540
I'm very thankful for your intentions, but

643
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,490
I was hurt.

644
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:38,380
Soo Hyeon, that was the best I could do.

645
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,780
I know.

646
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:46,480
I think that you were thinking of me in your own way.

647
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,830
But you know...

648
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:56,550
I was criticized and pointed at by others when I broke up with you.

649
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:05,590
There are many ways to break up,

650
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:10,470
but I think that consideration is needed even when you break up.

651
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:18,010
It seems I had the wrong solution again.

652
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,480
I didn't know that I was wrong when I brought you to Taegyeong.

653
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,650
I thought that I could make you happy.

654
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:33,530
I thought that letting you go like that would make you happy.

655
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,430
But I was wrong again.

656
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,530
Woo Seok, it was not your fault.

657
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,990
You were having a hard time, too.

658
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:49,790
You couldn't talk to anyone about it, and no one realized it.

659
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:55,000
I feel refreshed now that you know.

660
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:01,860
Live comfortably now. Don't worry about me.

661
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:10,490
I learned this thanks to you, Woo Seok.

662
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:16,440
What I should do when I break up with someone.

663
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:50,440
Oh, it fits so well.

664
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:38,390
Jin Hyeok

665
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:47,430
Jin Hyeok.

666
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:51,670
Let's go to a bookstore tomorrow and look at books.

667
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:58,890
Alright. I wanted to go too.

668
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,880
Really?

669
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,550
I thought you wouldn’t want to go there.

670
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:07,440
Let's go to a famous restaurant in Mahon-dong tomorrow, too.

671
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,290
Let's try standing in a line, too.

672
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:16,300
What's this? I won't be able to sleep because my heart's fluttering so much.

673
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:21,380
Then, I should look up some famous restaurants in Mahon-dong.

674
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,390
See you tomorrow.

675
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,690
Famous restaurants, she said...

676
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,450
That looks delicious.

677
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:26,520
Well, this croissant also looks delicious.

678
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:34,150
Secretary Jang will probably throw a fit today, too. Tons of pictures will come out.

679
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:38,250
It would be nice if we looked good in the pictures, since they're going to take them anyway.

680
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:41,030
Wow. You're becoming cooler and cooler.

681
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:43,560
When I look at the pictures we've been taken in so far,

682
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,720
I always look really aware of the cameras and stiff.

683
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,500
I hope I look more excited in them today.

684
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:56,460
You're admirable, Soo Hyeon. With that meaning in mind, say ah.

685
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:57,550
You try this, too.

686
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:00,410
♫  You know you keep me alive ♫

687
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,620
- Delicious, right?
- Yes.

688
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:04,330
It's been a really long time since I've been to a bookstore.

689
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:06,250
So this is the place that you like.

690
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,880
I'm really happy now that I'm coming with you.

691
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:14,320
♫  The other half of me ♫

692
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:21,040
♫  Oh take me on down on a river ♫

693
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,630
♫  I'll go wherever it leads to you ♫

694
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:32,350
♫  Oh take me on into your arms ♫

695
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:37,140
♫  I'll go wherever world you’re on ♫

696
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,740
You're right.

697
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,600
It's Miramar.

698
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:52,310
♫  The morning sunrise ♫

699
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:54,280
♫  It takes me away ♫

700
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,930
This is so cute, right?

701
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:56,600
It's so small.

702
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,540
It's as small as your face, Soo Hyeon.

703
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,770
Just my eyes.

704
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:03,320
“Girlfriend at the World’s End” by Kim Yeon Soo
♫  The feeling of adore ♫

705
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,990
♫  Oh take me on to you  ♫

706
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,680
This is the book, right?

707
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,470
Yes, you're right.

708
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:14,380
Wow. I'll give it to you as a present. Read it.

709
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:18,210
Is it interesting?

710
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,310
Here it is.

711
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:21,970
Look here.

712
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:24,390
We really reached the Metasequoia-lined Road, right?

713
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:28,250
Seriously. I'll have to read it from the beginning.

714
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:31,870
♫  You take my heart away ♫

715
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:35,020
Doesn't this line seem like it's speaking to us?

716
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:40,030
♫  Oh take me on down on a river ♫

717
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:42,100
Who is the girlfriend in this poem?

718
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:46,510
Who is the girlfriend in this poem?

719
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:47,630
♫  Oh take me on ♫

720
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:51,190
A good person.

721
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,970
How did you meet her?

722
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:55,950
♫  I'll go wherever world you’re on ♫

723
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:58,760
It looks like you really loved her, right?

724
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:04,770
That's right. I do.

725
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,680
So much that I want to take her with me to the end of the world.

726
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:48,210
♫ When I open the door, you whom I love comes to me ♫

727
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,440
Soo Hyeon.

728
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,780
Where is the end of your world?

729
01:06:54,780 --> 01:07:03,460
What's certain is that I'm there at that place.

730
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,080
♫ A fairy tale where I'm holding you and dancing ♫

731
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,160
Jin Hyeok.

732
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,490
Now, I...

733
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:16,000
I am breaking up with you.

734
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:24,600
♫ I don't want to wake up from that fairytale-like dream ♫

735
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:34,250
♫ I don't want to wake up and leave from here ♫

736
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:41,900
♫ I want to dream and hold you a little longer ♫

737
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:48,420
♫ If wake up it seems these many stories  ♫

738
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:52,690
♫ will all disappear ♫

739
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:55,520
♫ While I think that ♫

740
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:03,330
♫ Sometimes I imagine I'm somewhere you're not ♫

741
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:09,650
♫ I'm scared as though my body will freeze up ♫

742
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:15,240
♫ There is no such day for me. ♫

743
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:21,990
♫  My day on which you abandon me ♫
