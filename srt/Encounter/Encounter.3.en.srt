1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,830
Encounter

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,350
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,710
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,020
Boyfriend

5
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,680
The person my Woo Seok is seeing now,

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,140
I hope she has manners like you.

7
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,990
- You haven't changed your mind, have you?
- No.

8
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,500
It's uncommon to marry and divorce,

9
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,120
and to receive as your property settlement a hotel on the verge of ruin.
[Divorce Agreement]

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,630
I am glad for it, but why am I feeling detested?

11
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,510
It feels like you are declaring, "I'll never get involved with your family again."

12
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,130
When there is an event in this household

13
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,750
I must attend it. This clause exists in the contract.

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,320
So what would that declaration mean? You've misunderstood.

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,710
If that's the case, I'm thankful.

16
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,270
You must have reviewed the documents thoroughly. Do you have any questions?

17
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,760
The scandalous incident that you stated in Article 3, Clause 4,

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,330
I want to know what you mean by that.

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,500
Just what it says. Even after the divorce, live while maintaining your reputation.

20
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,360
It means don't cause a scandalous incident that will embarrass our family.

21
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,590
You understand, right?

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,250
Cha Soo Hyeon

23
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,750
Episode 3

24
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,530
Dispense with the greetings. How could I be at peace? (Customary greeting literally means "Are you at peace?")

25
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,540
Shall I prepare your usual tea?

26
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,420
Let's have cold water today. I'm fuming inside.

27
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,010
Article 3, Clause 4. That clause that you confirmed repeatedly. That clause.

28
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,630
Are you referring to the scandalous incident?

29
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,730
Yes, that scandal clause. Something I can't stomach ...

30
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,370
You, who had become a member of this family,

31
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,770
that you would be flitting around like a so-called celebrity in a news article with such an immature young man.

32
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,010
No matter how hard it try compose what I say it's coming out coarsely

33
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,130
Do you understand what you have done?

34
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,260
This matter is not a scandal.

35
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,830
I simply had a meal with a person to whom I was indebted.

36
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,930
This is nothing to be embarrassed about.

37
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,600
Cha Soo Hyeon! Taegyeong Group daughter-in-law Cha Soo Hyeon.

38
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,670
That you have become gossip fodder,

39
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,510
is an embarrassment to our organization. How could you not know that?

40
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,420
I am no longer a member of Taegyeong Group.

41
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,810
There is no reason for you to do this.

42
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,280
I was wondering why you're running around so senselessly.

43
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,180
You must have the wrong idea about something.

44
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,130
Divorce? Don't think that just because you got divorced that the two families severed the relationship.

45
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,040
You are well aware. Your father,

46
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,120
that position, and how he got there.

47
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,000
Even when you die, you are a member of Taegyeong Group.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,200
Once you've become a member of this family

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,960
you are a member of Taegyeong Group until you die, keep that in mind.

50
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,070
Don't mess around.

51
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,570
Did you hire him because he was handsome?

52
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,030
Your words are too harsh.

53
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,740
I gave you a company to maintain your dignity, and... ?

54
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,150
Let's stop now. My words will become harsher.

55
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,070
Make him resign.

56
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,490
Chairwoman!

57
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,530
Article 3, Clause 4. The moment an scandalous incident occurs,

58
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,080
Cha Soo Hyeon will lose all her rights.

59
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,080
Consider carefully

60
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,840
what those rights entail.

61
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,510
Why did you call me?

62
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,810
It's you, right? I meant the guy in the pictures with the CEO.

63
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,850
You're that guy, right?

64
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,560
You're like a ghost. (You know everything.)

65
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,180
I recognized your clothes.

66
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,360
I've been really curious.

67
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,100
What kind of relationship do you have with the CEO?

68
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,740
She was just someone I met in Cuba.

69
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,120
You guys met there?

70
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,290
I helped her out a little.

71
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,720
She was pickpocketed, so she had nothing.

72
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
At that time, I also never thought that I would be hired by Donghwa.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,030
That's everything.

74
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,810
If that's the case, it doesn't make sense.

75
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,770
If that's all to your relationship, you guys shouldn't have been eating ramen together at a rest area.

76
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,800
To explain it all would take too long. But it just naturally happened that way.

77
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
It's not the kind of relationship that the article is saying.

78
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,640
But then why do you look so worried?

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,070
Because I am worried.

80
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,420
About whom? Yourself?

81
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,710
No. About the CEO.

82
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,580
I don't know if she's alright.

83
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,990
Hey! Since she was a child

84
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,980
she's lived out in the open all her life so she will just brush it off.

85
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,350
She will be fine.

86
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,720
Worry about yourself. When your identity comes out, it's you who will have the bigger headache.

87
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,610
As expected. You're the only friend whose got my back.

88
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,700
La Terra

89
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,430
Your call cannot be connected at this time.

90
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,110
You're going to avoid my calls like this?!

91
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,300
You wench.

92
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,040
Director, it's me.

93
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,730
I enjoyed reading the article.

94
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,730
Indeed, a reporter should write the articles.

95
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,380
It was more fun than I had planned..

96
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,860
Thanks to you, the mission went well.

97
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,410
Of course, Taegyeong Electronic advertisements next year will be placed with Jaemin Daily.

98
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,650
You are welcome. We must all help each other out, mustn't we?

99
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,710
I'll call you back. Yes.

100
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,610
Welcome.

101
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,730
How is the mood at Donghwa Hotel?

102
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,900
CEO Cha hasn't issued any statement in particular about her position.

103
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,730
The employees regard it as mere gossip.

104
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,060
Perhaps because CEO Cha has dealt respectfully with her employees all of this time,

105
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,320
they don't appear to have any issues with her.

106
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,090
And she was recently successful in winning the bid for the hotel in Cuba.

107
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:08,210
So I don't think her position is threatened by an article like this.

108
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,450
Would she give up her CEO position easily?

109
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,770
We must deal with things one at a time and force her to.

110
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,480
CEO Cha is a smart child, so she won't be stubborn.

111
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,800
She should have a rest, after all.

112
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,870
She should return and perform her wifely duties for my Woo Seok.

113
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,930
Staying out too long will cause someone to get hurt.

114
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,160
It won't be long, Director.

115
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,920
I continue to believe that the position of operating Donghwa Hotel belongs to you, Director Choi.

116
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,030
Oh, what excessive praise.

117
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,220
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's Rest Area Date

118
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,530
Everyone is really too much.

119
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,860
- CEO Cha is inside, isn't she?
- No, CEO Cha isn't in today.

120
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,600
I know she's in there. Move.

121
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,420
Mother...

122
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,540
Ma'am ... but ... you can't just come in here like this.

123
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,990
You think not answering the phone or door will stop me?

124
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,600
Bury your head in the sand.

125
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,230
Seriously, why couldn't you just overlook it? Why come all the way here?

126
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,730
Is this something to be overlooked?

127
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,390
I'm getting nauseous from repeating myself.

128
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,860
- He's just someone I know.
- It's been settled.

129
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,140
Would it be all right with you? Who is Soo Hyeon to decide?

130
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,000
She's the one who created this situation.

131
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,840
We're simply grateful that you would take care of the matter.

132
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,420
Then we'll say Kim Jin Hyeok was a stalker

133
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,880
and close the matter.

134
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,970
Are you the devil? How could she make a kind, sincere person into a stalker?

135
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,550
- Are you a devil?
- You're the devil, not me.

136
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,800
You surely know that if you were quiet and ran the business well, you were going to waltz back in, but you cause this mess?

137
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,220
Why would I expect them to take me back in? Mom, why do you...?

138
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,390
Please, let's just live quietly. They've been talking about getting you two back together forever.

139
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,460
What is this mess?

140
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,730
Get back together?

141
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,330
I've already settled the matter with your mother-in-law.

142
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,490
So apologize to Son-in-law Jeong and say it was nothing.

143
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,260
Even if he is kind enough to overlook it, he must feel so badly about this.

144
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,830
You understand me, right? I'm going.

145
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,270
I'll only let it happen once.

146
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,400
I'll only be sold by you

147
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,860
one time, not twice.

148
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,880
You won't consider your father?

149
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,790
Wouldn't it be pathetic if party leader Cha ends his political life that way?

150
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,780
Your father's dream is the Blue House.

151
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,070
I'm sure it's your dream.

152
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,990
The Blue House isn't a place you can enter simply because you want to.

153
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,060
It's a place one is sent to by the people.

154
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,930
I'm going to send him. So don't cause any trouble.

155
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,030
And just prepare to get back together with your ex-husband.

156
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,200
He can't get to the Blue House without the Taegyeong Group's support.

157
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,210
Yes, Assistant Manager Park. I'm in front of the office.

158
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,830
I checked the changes made in the proposal draft.

159
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,690
Yes, yes.

160
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,750
I'll report to you as soon as I get there. Yes.

161
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,630
The CEO's office is on the 11th floor.

162
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,950
One, two, three, four...

163
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,440
Start over.

164
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,900
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

165
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,830
Eleventh.

166
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,600
CEO, don't look at the comments.

167
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,840
CEO, fighting!

168
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,160
How is the aroma?

169
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,370
It's good.

170
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,810
Sorry to do this during your busy hour.

171
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,480
Not at all.

172
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,720
Enjoy your time together.

173
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,670
I have to drive.

174
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,080
What about Manager Nam?

175
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,370
He's had to work late for several days.

176
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,450
Too bad you can't have a drink.

177
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,790
What's the reason for asking to meet?

178
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,790
It's been entertaining.

179
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,630
It's been better than other celebrities. You're trending in internet searches for two days.

180
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,560
Thanks.

181
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,140
First of all, your mother

182
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,330
is trying to fire a new hire who has worked hard to finally get this job.

183
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,680
He did nothing wrong.

184
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,470
And if that isn't enough, she's going to make him into a stalker who followed me.

185
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,350
Please stop her.

186
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,520
You're afraid.

187
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,200
It's been a long time since I saw your scared expression.

188
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,940
What's the second thing?

189
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,290
Why aren't you getting remarried?

190
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,860
It seems like you're blaming it on me.

191
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,870
You insisted you couldn't break up with that woman and were going marry her.

192
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,480
That's why I stepped aside. Why are you still alone?

193
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,560
Does it bother you

194
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,410
that I'm still single?

195
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,720
No. It doesn't bother me whom you date or if you're single.

196
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,820
But don't make me hear about us getting back together again.

197
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,610
You're mad this time.

198
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:19,270
Stop talking about me as if you know me. How much do you know about me?

199
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,770
I don't know. I didn't even know that Cha Soo Hyeon was such a goofy woman.

200
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,720
A rest stop ramen date? Could I have imagined this?

201
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,870
Watch your language.

202
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,260
Okay. I'll try to stop her from the first thing.

203
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,160
What did he do wrong? He probably worked hard to get into Donghwa Hotel.

204
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,580
On one condition,

205
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,620
he really has nothing to do with you, right?

206
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,140
The second favor isn't in my control.

207
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,140
- It's about your life.
- Soo Hyeon.

208
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,440
You and I both,

209
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,210
have we ever lived our own lives?

210
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,860
If she brings up getting back together, just tell her how you truly feel.

211
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,780
What kind of absurd talk is that?

212
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,510
I'm trusting you.

213
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,550
When will I ever become someone who makes sense to you?

214
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:46,460
If I were to tell her how I truly feel, it would make it hard on you.

215
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,850
If you eat like that at your age, you'll die sooner.

216
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,720
It's just a snack.

217
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,500
What is this about CEO Cha? With the new hire?

218
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,330
I don't know yet either.

219
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,570
Assemblyman Cha must be quite worried about her, too.

220
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,850
Reporter Cha is mean too, selling off his daughter for politics.

221
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,660
How can you call him "Reporter Cha"?

222
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,490
Whatever.

223
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,550
I liked the past better than Assemblyman Cha.

224
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,680
You were a reporter, my brother was a reporter, and Assemblyman Cha was also a reporter.

225
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,800
Back then, you were all like the Avengers.

226
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,590
Can you really eat ramen when there's a ramen scandal going on?

227
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,860
I'm experimenting to see if it tastes that good to go all the way there to eat it.

228
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,080
Why are you sighing so deeply?

229
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,570
- I made trouble.
- Trouble?

230
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,730
I hired a private detective.

231
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,320
Why a private detective?

232
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,550
My husband,

233
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,750
I think he has another woman.

234
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,410
That's ridiculous.

235
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,070
Huh? He has an adolescent daughter to think about.

236
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,610
Do people cheat just because they don't have children?

237
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,090
You don't know anything.

238
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,360
- Are you sure?
- I'm not, which is why I hired a private detective.

239
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,920
- When will you know the results?
- Don't know yet.

240
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,300
He has to do something to get caught.

241
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,360
This jerk.

242
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,780
- Just eat your ramen. It will get bloated.
- I'm not going to eat.

243
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,440
Why are you getting so worked up over someone else's business?

244
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,030
You're not a stranger.

245
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,610
Oh! Here she comes! Here she comes!

246
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,070
Is it good? There's just enough soup this morning.

247
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,430
Wow, it's beef soup.

248
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,210
You have to eat a hearty breakfast. Don't skip it because of work.

249
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,180
Thanks for the food.

250
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,230
Be sure to eat all the beef and the broth.

251
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,950
Whoa, it's beef soup!

252
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,650
Did you make beef soup knowing I was coming, Mom?

253
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,980
Why are you here?

254
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,370
What?

255
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,170
You're all so mean.

256
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,140
You don't even know when your second son is coming home?

257
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,250
Oh, so that was today?!

258
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,760
- It was yesterday.
- Then why are just getting here now?

259
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,890
Yesterday, I had some drinks with my comrades.

260
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,280
Mom, my soup?

261
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,150
How can you be discharged from the military like you're coming back from the neighborhood supermarket?

262
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,540
I slipped in quietly so Mom wouldn't prepare a feast, but this is too quiet.

263
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,920
Oh, dear.

264
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,810
There's no more beef.

265
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,400
You should have said so sooner that you were coming.

266
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,800
Father, you prepared rice cakes for him, but there's not even soup for me, eh?

267
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,300
- There's no more rice either.
- No rice?

268
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,280
Is there any ramen?

269
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,710
Did you get a job?

270
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,460
Hey, your hyung got into a really great company.

271
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,670
Oh, eldest son!

272
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,550
- Give me some spending money.
- I don't have any.

273
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,070
- She said you're at a good company.
- I haven't been paid yet.

274
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,940
Don't ask him for a handout. Make your own ramen and let's go to the shop.

275
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,070
But you know that the minimum wage went up, right, Dad?

276
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,950
I worked for free.

277
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,130
When I have my second child, I'm going to coddle him.

278
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,970
Hey, you better have a second child who is just like you.

279
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,670
Your hyung has never created any trouble while growing up, but I was called daily to school because of you.

280
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,070
You've straightened out your act, right?

281
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,620
Mom, I wasn't creating trouble.

282
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,960
I was just a passionate kid.

283
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,170
But Mom, where's my ramen?

284
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,140
I don't think we have any ramen either.

285
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,630
What home doesn't have any ramen?

286
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:17,430
My goodness. Next time tell us you're coming ahead of time.

287
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,790
- That makes no sense.
- You want me to serve twice?

288
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,000
- Twice is too much, right, Honey?
- Eat some kimchi.

289
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,100
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

290
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,040
You went through a lot.

291
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,500
About the painting that was supposed to arrive for the Sokcho Hotel's lobby...

292
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,510
It's scheduled to arrive tomorrow, correct?

293
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,920
But we just got word that the painting can't be sent.

294
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,210
Have you spoken with Artist Jang?

295
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,890
I kept trying to call her, but the phone is turned off.

296
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:51,950
We received art tour reservations from Seoul, Cheongju, Busan, and Sokcho locations.

297
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,930
Should I say Sokcho Hotel will be excluded? It's scheduled to open in two weeks.

298
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:00,400
No, we have to get the Jang painting here no matter what it takes.

299
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,930
It's a piece of art which took two years of hard work.

300
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,160
I don't think it will help. Doesn't it seem like Chairwoman Kim had a hand in this?

301
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,510
Why is she tormenting an ex-daughter-in-law like this?

302
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,080
Doesn't it appear as if she's venting her anger because of the news articles?

303
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,290
This isn't the first time.

304
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,360
This isn't going to do. I'm going to have to go meet with artist Jang in Sokcho.

305
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,420
Right now?

306
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,110
I don't think a phone call will suffice.

307
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,840
Just a moment. I'll get Manager Nam to get a car...

308
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,650
No, I'll take my car.

309
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,920
I have a lot to think about. It will be better if I just drive myself.

310
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,910
Pay no attention.

311
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,400
As you'd expect, the CEO can't be shaken.

312
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,540
Come.

313
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,850
Nice job. Then just three copies of these.

314
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,310
Okay. Thank you.

315
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,650
Excuse me.

316
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,160
Ah.

317
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,750
You know me, don't you?

318
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,660
Yes, I've seen you drive for the CEO.

319
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,430
Everyone calls me Manager Nam.

320
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:36,930
Ah, I see. Then I'll greet you as Manager Nam from now on.

321
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,930
Have you had lunch?

322
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,190
Isn't the food okay here?

323
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:01,870
I like the price even more. I heard nearby restaurants are expensive, so I planned to eat in the company cafeteria.

324
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,800
The company's cafeteria food is good, too.

325
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,950
The CEO is pretty mindful of the employee's food.

326
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,180
The CEO is pretty amazing.

327
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,990
- Eat up.
- Ah, after you.

328
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,460
Thank you for the meal.

329
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,480
Have one of these. It helps you feel less heavy.

330
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,730
I'm fine. It seems like you brought it for yourself.

331
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,690
This is for a guest. I have my own.

332
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,350
Thank you.

333
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,950
A trip?

334
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,770
Yes, she goes on sudden trips quite often.

335
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,070
When will she return?

336
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,860
I'm not sure. I don't think it will be beyond the weekend.

337
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,770
She said she's on a trip, but I don't think it's true.

338
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,130
I think I need to stay here for a bit.

339
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,420
I don't expect her to be here before the weekend.

340
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,990
Anyway, I should try going to her studio.

341
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,250
You didn't bring anything with you, but you're spending the weekend there?

342
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,530
I'm fine. I'll just buy what I need here. Don't worry.

343
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,930
I can see the shore and get some rest.

344
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,040
Contact Sokcho Hotel and get me a room.

345
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,810
Say what you need to.

346
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,810
Did you meet with Soo Hyeon?

347
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,740
I did.

348
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,370
Why didn't you quietly overlook it?

349
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,160
Isn't it cute that Soo Hyeon has a lackey?

350
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,340
That isn't a lackey, it's a disgrace.

351
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,870
That impudent brat. I made sure she understood, yet she went and told you.

352
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,530
Why not leave that new hire alone?

353
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,530
It will cause more commotion if you fire him as soon as he is hired.

354
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,730
And you're being too extreme by making him into a stalker.

355
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:55,540
I wasn't going to make such a big deal for such a dust-like nobody.

356
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,390
It's fine if that stuck-up Cha Soo Hyeon is discouraged.

357
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,370
Mother, you are far too busy.

358
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,880
Why trouble yourself with such matters?

359
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,670
- You don't know why? Get back together with her.
- Mother.

360
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,460
I've discussed it with Soo Hyeon's mother. Let's proceed with it.

361
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,290
I refuse to.

362
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,450
Do you think I don't know why you aren't getting remarried?

363
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,920
You're waiting for Cha Soo Hyeon. So why did you let her go? That thing.

364
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,080
She's not a thing, Mother.

365
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,350
Did she say that she won't get back together with you?

366
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,700
What's the point of forcing her back here?

367
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,160
We shouldn't force her. I won't stand to see her so full of herself.

368
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,320
We have to make her crawl back here herself.

369
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,610
She appears to think she's become something since her business is doing well.

370
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,530
We have to kill her spirit for her to concentrate on her wifely duties.

371
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,900
When her business fails, then she'll come to her senses and come back.

372
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,580
Don't touch...

373
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,490
Donghwa Hotel.

374
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:52,160
It sounds like you're saying not to touch Cha Soo Hyeon.

375
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,770
I hope nothing will come between us, Mother.

376
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,620
I'll excuse myself.

377
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,130
It's prior to opening, so it's very quiet. Will you be okay here?

378
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,980
There are only two employees right now.

379
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,360
I'll put some other employees on standby.

380
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,340
No, it's nice and quiet. Please just open a room for me.

381
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,980
In celebrity news, we have word on CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's romance.

382
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,860
It's trending in searches on the portal sites.

383
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,620
Yes. This ranks up there with interest in top stars.
"Top Star Interest #1 search for all kinds of portals"

384
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,840
Because her life itself was that of a star.

385
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,960
But even with the history of divorce, the focus on her doesn't seem to die.

386
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Cha Soo Hyeon is a woman for all people. First of all, ...

387
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:23,630
It's difficult to open a meeting because the quorum is not met. He has stated he's embarrassed and sorry to see the people...

388
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,310
Dad, it's me.

389
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:30,600
Yeah, I was thinking of calling. But I just waited because I wasn't sure how you were doing.

390
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,850
I'm sorry.

391
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,560
For what?

392
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,530
I'm the one who put you in the public eye. I'm the one who is sorry.

393
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:43,140
It will cause a commotion in your office. What can be done?

394
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,390
No, no, don't worry, it won't.

395
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,660
Don't skip your meals.

396
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,290
What's the matter?

397
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:09,310
I'm sorry, Manager Nam. I would like to go, but I have to take my mother to the hospital today.

398
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,160
I can just go, don't worry. Is this all there is?

399
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,110
She said she'd buy what she needed there, but you know that's she's not the type who'll do that.

400
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,790
Even more so now, with the news.

401
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:24,050
I'll take care of it. Take good care of your mother.

402
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,560
Yes.

403
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,350
Hotel Marketing Strategy

404
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,620
Hello?

405
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,920
Mr. Kim Jin Hyeok? This is Manager Nam.

406
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,840
Oh, hello.

407
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,120
We need to go on a little business trip.

408
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,150
Hello.

409
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,300
It's the weekend and you're home.

410
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,690
Yes.

411
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,040
Why the business trip all of a sudden?

412
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,840
I'm sorry about that. By the way, do you know how to drive?

413
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,630
Never mind. We'll talk as we go because the CEO will be bored.

414
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,140
Hey, Hyung!

415
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,150
Why, seriously. Why are you like this when you just got out of the army?

416
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,490
I've decided to make you into my master.

417
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,300
The number 2 store of Chan's Whelks will be up to me.

418
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,830
I'm not interested in making it into a franchise business.

419
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,370
Bro, how can you be so narrow-minded when it comes to business ventures, huh?

420
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,550
So you be the CEO of Chan's Whelks Restaurant.

421
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,350
Then I will be the manager for number 2 store.

422
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,090
I told you that I'm not interested in that.

423
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,990
Let's talk about it slowly, okay?

424
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,090
So why don't you bestow the secret recipe for that beautiful seasoned water snail to me?

425
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,100
Please run back home now.

426
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,210
Give that to me. I will do it.

427
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,030
This is so annoying.

428
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,870
Give that to me.

429
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,010
You're driving me crazy here.

430
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,950
Hey, why are you causing trouble like this?

431
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,830
Just let me do this. I should have something to do here like cooking dinner or something.

432
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,610
I don't care. Do whatever you want then.

433
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,270
Please show me.

434
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,130
Why are you being so petty? Hyung!

435
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,100
Come on, man.

436
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,260
We are here from the main office since we have something to deliver to the CEO.

437
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,820
I'm afraid the CEO is not available at the moment. I think the CEO went out for a walk earlier.

438
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,720
Jin Hyeok, why don't you wait here for a bit while I go out and about in downtown for awhile.

439
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,120
I have to go out and do a favor for my friend out there. I'll be back soon.

440
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,150
Ah, alright. I will wait for you here.

441
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,040
Okay, you do that.

442
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,120
See you later.

443
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:55,150
♫ The morning sunrise it takes you away. ♫

444
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:01,310
♫ As I'm staring at the light you hold ♫

445
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:09,010
♫ The feeling of adore, oh take me on to you. ♫

446
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:18,400
♫ When the light of you shines down so beautiful. ♫

447
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,460
♫ I laugh, I sing with you. ♫

448
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,810
♫ Oh, it's like when stars fall all around you. ♫

449
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:35,300
♫ You take my heart away. ♫

450
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:41,890
♫ Oh take me on down on the river. ♫

451
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:46,390
♫ I'll go wherever it leads to you. ♫

452
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,430
Mr. Kim Jin Hyeok?

453
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:53,380
♫ Oh take me on into your arms. ♫

454
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,130
♫ I will go wherever world you're on. ♫

455
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,120
How did you come here...?

456
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,650
I accompanied Manager Nam on his business trip.

457
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,940
Were you very shocked to see the news article?

458
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,100
I have to say that I was more shocked to see malicious comments about you.

459
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,780
To me, it's nothing since this happens to me all the time.

460
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,390
I'm sorry I couldn't pretend not to know you.

461
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,910
I didn't contact you because I was afraid to make things more difficult for you after being exposed.

462
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,740
I'm fine really, so you don't have to worry.

463
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,770
What is this?
[ I see you as I saw a flower by Na Tae Joo ]

464
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,210
It's a photo of you.

465
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,480
I'm shaking in my shoes because you didn't come out as good as you are in person.

466
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,880
It came out nice.

467
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,730
You should read this when you get bored. This is my favorite collection of poems.

468
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,740
That one is my favorite poem.

469
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,940
"LONGING"

470
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,740
You seem like a young man with literary interests, Mr. Kim.

471
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,440
You like novels and collections of poems too.

472
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,930
As a kid growing up, I had to pretty much spend time alone.

473
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:22,520
My friends were all invited to go out to eat and both of my parents were busy running their shop.

474
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,660
I would go play at the arcade but I would get tired of it after a while.

475
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,540
So I went to the library to kill time for a bit.

476
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,740
Then before you even know it...

477
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,070
Hello, Manager Nam.

478
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,720
Yes.

479
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,420
Oh, I guess that can't be helped then.

480
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,430
You go ahead and take care of your business. You don't have to rush yourself.

481
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,310
Alright, bye.

482
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,510
Did he say that he's going to be late?

483
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:57,440
Yes, he said that he has some things to take care of with his friend from Sokcho.

484
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,570
Should we go for a drive, CEO?

485
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,350
Pardon?

486
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,740
It would be suffocating to be just trapped here

487
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,860
since we are here at the shoreline city of Sokcho.

488
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,610
I am busy with my work though.

489
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,290
I heard it all from Manager Nam already.

490
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:18,580
Your work is to wait for the painter to come anyway, so why don't you get some fresh air with me?

491
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,690
I want another opportunity to go for a ride in that nice car of yours.

492
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,320
Is it okay to open up the window a little bit?

493
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:47,420
It's your car so you should have the right to do whatever you want with it.

494
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,190
The wind is very cold so I will open it for only a minute.

495
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,340
If you catch a cold here, even taking medicine won't help.

496
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,870
I feel like you have your own dictionary made up of your own phrases.

497
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,590
Maybe it's because you read a lot of books.

498
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,530
Why don't you just say that I have more unusual sensibility compared to others?

499
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,250
I wonder if Sokcho has tasty bread and coffee too.

500
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,810
Should we go look around for it since we have a lot of time?

501
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,720
I think it was great because it was Cuba.

502
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,950
There's no such thing as that.

503
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,700
Gangwon province is all about coffee and

504
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,800
potato pancakes.

505
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,190
Potato pancakes is my dad's favorite.

506
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,920
Oh, really? My dad really likes potato pancakes too.

507
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,650
It seems like we are able to connect more than we know.

508
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:34,640
Don't you think it's a bit weird to say that we are able to connect with each other with just potato pancakes?

509
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,610
Nevermind then.

510
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,400
Do you not like it very much?

511
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,090
I've had it when I was an elementary student, but I haven't eaten it since.

512
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,230
I know why my father likes it now.

513
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,910
The taste has an appeal. I didn't realize it when I was younger.

514
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,690
The taste is...

515
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,480
I really don't know it.

516
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,050
Is it perhaps your first time eating it?

517
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:19,790
Yes.

518
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,020
Then, why did you talk like you knew about it before?

519
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:26,520
Me? I just said that it was Gangwon province's signature food.

520
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,600
You said that your father liked it.

521
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,390
Starting from today, it's day one.

522
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,470
With who?

523
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,390
With me...

524
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,770
and this potato pancake.

525
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,790
This really does have an appeal.

526
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,730
Is Manager Nam going to be even later?

527
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,850
You and Manager Nam seem very comfortable.

528
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:06,770
Manager Nam worked with my father as a reporter at a broadcasting station.

529
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:11,620
To my father, he is the most trustworthy person. And to me,

530
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,750
he's like a friend.

531
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,560
You go quickly and send him away.

532
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,200
He didn't even drink alcohol, but he's having a deep sleep.

533
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,170
Excuse me, excuse me.

534
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,830
Customer, customer!

535
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,130
Where is this?

536
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,700
This is a sliced raw fish restaurant.

537
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,000
Aigoo, I just suddenly fell asleep.

538
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,030
What time is it right now?

539
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,070
Here.

540
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,690
I am leaving after eating well.

541
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,590
Your change.

542
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,360
Use the change to buy some seasoning.

543
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,670
We use natural seasoning.

544
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,820
Then, use it to buy some anchovies.

545
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,870
CEO, where are you now? Ah, my work just finished now.

546
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,020
You played... no, waited a lot, right?

547
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,810
Are you at a hotel right now?

548
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,850
We are at a sliced raw fish restaurant by the water.

549
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,370
What? A sliced raw fish restaurant by the water?

550
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,620
I can see you.

551
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,800
What? You see me?

552
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,520
Did you take care of your friend's favor?

553
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,950
Yes, well...

554
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,620
Ahjusshi!

555
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,900
Ah, you scared me. I told you many times that I am much more sensitive than I look.

556
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,930
Did you eat, Manager Nam?

557
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,610
Ah, my stomach is about to burst...

558
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,540
My appetite is a bit...

559
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,890
You must have had too much if you're lacking an appetite.

560
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:52,570
It's the sea. I can be lonely.

561
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,270
I'm hungry, Ahjussi.

562
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,900
The spicy seafood stew over there is a killer.

563
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,180
- You looked at it?
- Yes.

564
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,910
It's so great, right?

565
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,050
It's great. Please get this ready.

566
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:19,060
What to do? This has already been reserved.

567
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,220
This.

568
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,430
This.

569
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,000
This.

570
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,430
And this. This black is nice too.

571
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,420
What is your size, Manager-nim?

572
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,980
She must have a similar body shape as mine.

573
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,380
Prepare the ones that I picked in your size and you wear it.

574
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,640
And this one piece, prepare it separately for me.

575
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,460
Tell the person who reserved it that some crazy guy stole it.

576
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,840
You can give them my real name.

577
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,050
I shouldn't be doing this. I'll get it ready.

578
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,720
Soo Hyeon

579
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,250
Jang Mi Jin

580
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,390
Yes.

581
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:34,080
It has been a while, Secretary Jang.

582
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,860
CEO Cha is not in Seoul right now.

583
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,940
Did she go on a business trip?

584
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,120
Should I say that it's a business trip?

585
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,630
The painting that was supposed to hang in the Sokcho Hotel suddenly got canceled.

586
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,130
She went to stake out on Painter Jang.

587
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:51,680
My instincts say that it's because of Chairwoman Kim, but if not, I apologize.

588
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,790
Where is she right now?

589
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:57,070
Thanks to you, she's probably lounging around in an unopened hotel.

590
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,730
Soo Hyeon, do you want to play the sand game with me?

591
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,130
You did it a lot with me when you were younger.

592
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,790
Why? Because people might recognize you again?

593
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,820
It's okay. No one is interested in us.

594
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:16,710
Fine then.

595
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:22,210
Yeah? Then you two play. My knees hurt a lot these days.

596
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,860
Let's go back to the hotel.

597
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,620
Play it with me.

598
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,070
I'm known as the excavator of Hongje-dong.

599
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,100
Rock, paper, scissors.

600
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,310
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

601
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,310
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

602
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:42,590
♬  I keep thinking  ♬

603
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:43,650
Here, CEO.
♫  Why is my heart pounding so? ♫

604
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,600
I think I'll take a lot.
♫  Why is my heart pounding so? ♫

605
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:47,750
Why do you take away so little?

606
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,600
You took away so much.
♫ Why am I excited like  ♫

607
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,550
The excavator is coming.

608
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,590
♬  like getting sentimental in the fall? ♬

609
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,300
♬ Also not understanding I am being drawn in more ♬

610
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,330
How is Soo Hyeon?

611
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,620
She's hanging in there.
♫ Gradually step by step ♫

612
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,610
♬ to closing the distance  ♬

613
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:03,950
You should play with her.
♫ Seeing you my feeling also is slowly growing ♫

614
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:07,520
Whenever Soo Hyeon cried, she looked for you more than she did me.
♫ Seeing you my feeling also is slowly growing

615
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,650
♬ Stop playing hide and seek and come to me now ♬

616
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,760
Take it!
♬ I matched you, the last piece in the puzzle.♬

617
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,360
You can't do that!

618
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,790
♬ You ride the wind and come to me ♬

619
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,390
This is dangerous.

620
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,810
♬  Sweeter than the scent of spring  ♬

621
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,880
Comforting her whenever she cries...

622
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,310
I think I'm about to graduate from that now, Hyungnim.

623
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:35,890
♫ Waiting for love, it's been waiting for love  ♫

624
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,460
So much better at it than I am.

625
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,520
- No, no. Just once more.
- No, you need to go in!

626
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,130
- Just one time. Really.
- What do you mean, one more? Come!

627
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,480
- Play just one more time.
- Yes.

628
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,910
♫ Waiting for love, waiting for love ♫

629
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,100
This time, you must go inside. The person who loses will go inside.

630
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,850
♫ Even your flaws are love to me ♫

631
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,890
Rock, paper, scissors.

632
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:56,450
♫ Waiting for love, waiting for love ♫

633
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,000
Concentrating!

634
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,070
Now, let's go. CEO, let's go into the water.

635
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,510
No, one more time. One more time.

636
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,470
It's hot, so be careful.

637
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:11,710
- Thank you.
- Yes, enjoy your meal.

638
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,260
The spicy sea snail salad is out.

639
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,030
- Thank you.
- Yes, enjoy your meal.

640
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,590
The one who said that he's going to learn is just playing around?

641
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,290
Hyung, I'm in the process of figuring out the flow.

642
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,580
You need a side menu.

643
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,790
There's a limit to your sales if you only sell whelks.

644
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,040
Forget that. Just do the dishes.

645
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,810
I was the cook in the military! I'm so sick of it!

646
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,410
Don't you know that a chef starts out with doing dishes?

647
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,270
You need to get rid of those customs.

648
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,330
- Get out!
- I'll do it.

649
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,620
Jin Myeong!

650
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,100
Who is this? My goddess, Hye In.

651
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,050
You got discharged?

652
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,160
Of course. I heard that you work at the same company as my brother.

653
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,190
You are saying that this precious information hasn't been relayed to me.

654
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,590
I know. What about your brother?

655
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:56,030
He went on a business trip. What is this? Are you really in the same company?

656
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,380
What kind of business trip on the weekend?

657
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:03,130
I know... This is fishy. Did my brother get a girl?

658
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,670
Who? Kim Jin Hyeok who dates books and has dates in the library?

659
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,710
What is this? You don't even know where he went?

660
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,810
I don't know where a grown adult goes on a weekend.

661
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,560
Our Hye In, should I give you a beer?

662
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,400
No. Jin Myeong, let's have a drink next time.

663
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,600
- What is this? Are you going to leave?
- I just stopped while passing by.

664
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,660
- Oppa, I'm going.
- Yes. Get home safely.

665
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:28,950
What is this? If she came all the way here, shouldn't she raise the sales by buying a beer?

666
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,200
I know. If she didn't want to drink, she should have at least bought me one.

667
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,760
- But it seems that she became even more beautiful.
- Hey!

668
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,280
- Get out.
- I'll do it.

669
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,330
Why don't you just go to Seoul with us?

670
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,520
I don't think Painter Jang went on a vacation.

671
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,430
It seems that she's avoiding me. I'm going to go there tomorrow and Monday too.

672
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,660
Then, I'll stay with you.

673
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:03,430
Tomorrow is your father's death anniversary. You didn't prepare anything, right?

674
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,700
I reserved the ancestral rites food. It will be delivered to your house.

675
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,830
When did you do that?

676
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:12,790
Then, what if I stay...?

677
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,530
I shouldn't do that.

678
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:24,390
I'm really okay. All of today was fun, really.

679
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,420
Ahjusshi, leave that here.

680
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,590
Since we played with you a lot, you will fall asleep well.

681
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:38,170
You can't keep getting into the habit of taking sleeping pills.

682
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,900
You really can't take that.

683
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,430
You don't have a radio?

684
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:00,540
CEO, install the radio on your phone and listen to it.

685
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,400
There is a lot of good music.

686
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,030
I have a lot of things to do. Today, my work has been so delayed.

687
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,890
Now, you two should get going.

688
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:49,030
Get some sleep. We have a long way to go.

689
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:53,390
I'll do it. Let's go into a rest stop.

690
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,620
You drove here. Stay comfortable on the way back.

691
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,930
Oh, she's doing fine.

692
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:05,620
She's used to spending time alone ever since she was young.

693
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,960
Do you think she's spending time,

694
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,650
or enduring it?

695
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,190
It's so dark.

696
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,520
You aren't perhaps going to Sokcho Hotel, right?

697
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,900
I know I'm going out of bounds,

698
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:51,790
but I don't want you asking about how Soo Hyeon's doing if you can't even protect her.

699
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,190
Brother, let's have some ramen.

700
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,170
Do you really want to eat ramen 3 am in the morning?

701
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,030
I was serving whelks until 2 am today.

702
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,970
It's harder than the military. Let's have ramen!

703
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,800
- Sleep.
- Okay.

704
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,200
This is a story sent in by #3927.

705
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,360
Yes, it is even more lonely when you were with friends and then left alone.

706
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,100
#3927 who said that it's awkward because it's her first time sending in a story.

707
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,900
Your requested song is coming out. Try soothing your loneliness with yearning.

708
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,530
It's Si Llego A Besarte by Omara Portuondo.

709
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:11,540
♬ They say that your caresses will never be mine  ♬

710
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:20,130
♬ That your loving arms will never embrace me ♬

711
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,830
It's CEO.

712
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:26,190
♬ And I dreamed last night ♬

713
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,770
♬ that you loved me ♬

714
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,270
♬  And even if I die later  ♬

715
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:37,640
♬ I want to kiss you ♬

716
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,040
♬ Give me a kiss  ♬

717
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:47,170
♬ And forget that you have kissed me ♬

718
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:51,540
♬  I will give you my life  ♬

719
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,180
♬ If you ask me for it  ♬

720
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,330
I'm being told not to go, but there's a road I wish to take.

721
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:58,560
♬  If I manage to kiss you  ♬

722
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:03,420
While being told not to meet, there's someone I wish to meet.

723
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:08,710
If you tell me not to, it makes me want to do it even more.

724
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,640
♬  for you to forget me  ♬

725
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,910
That's life and longing,

726
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:17,080
it's you.

727
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,450
Longing

728
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,400
Hyung! Dae Chan!

729
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,490
Dae Chan!

730
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,390
Sorry, can you wake up for a sec?

731
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,210
Hyung!

732
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,250
Yes, welcome... One dish of sea snails?

733
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,580
Mom... Just fifteen more minutes...

734
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:54,420
Hyung!

735
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:56,970
Dae Chan!

736
00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:00,970
What? What, you freak?!

737
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,580
Hyung!

738
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,170
What... what... what?

739
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,060
What?

740
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,430
Hyung, let me use your car.

741
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:16,610
Why at this hour of dawn? Is your dad's broken?

742
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,970
No, but I have to go somewhere.

743
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:21,980
Where are you going, you freak? Hey!

744
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,370
Hey! Bring it back by morning, I need to go to the market!

745

♫ Once, a brief moment of the day ♫

746

♫ Could if have been then? ♫

747

♫ Was that when I felt it? ♫

764
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:55,520
Mr. Kim Jin Hyeok, what brings you back?

765
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:01,280
There's a really good hangover soup place nearby, but we couldn't go yesterday.

766
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,280
You came all the way here to eat that? Aren't you tired?

767
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,960
If you have it, you'll know what I'm feeling. It's extremely good.

768
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:30,340
Okay, let's go have it.

769
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,890
We'll see if I'll know what you're feeling.

770
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,270
It's out of this world. You might have two bowls of it.

771
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,520
Wait.

772
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,280
Okay, let's go.

773
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,580
Let's take this one.

774
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:08,280
This car's not that comfortable.

775
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,650
But I want to go on this one.

776
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,650
We have to do what you want to do!

777
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,470
Here.

778
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,600
Chan's whelks

779
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,700
Donghwa Hotel

780
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:12,000
I believe the CEO has gone out.

781
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,600
Is that so?

782
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,970
I don't think I'll know what you're feeling with this taste.

783
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,610
You're having this for the first time, right?

784
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,750
Rice soups are stronger items than ramens.

785
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:44,020
I've had this with Secretary Jang. We drank soju as well.

786
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,550
Compared to Uljiro, it's kind of...

787
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,660
It really hurts my pride when I get beat in famous restaurants.

788
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,530
The meat slices there are as chewy as this one?

789
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,930
Yes, much much more.

790
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,520
Kim Jin Hyeok.

791
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,550
I'm grateful, but why are we here?

792
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,100
I liked the music so much

793
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,970
that it woke me up.

794
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:43,050
The song that we listened to was playing on the radio.

795
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,490
The soup here is better.

796
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,960
Look, CEO.

797
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,660
For us ...

798
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:08,700
what kind of relationship is right?

799
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:12,770
We are...

800
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:19,940
You and I are an employee and his superior.

801
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,960
I was constantly thinking about it while coming here.

802
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,480
"Is this something you should do to your company's boss?"

803
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:37,240
I was raised as the eldest child in the family with a sense of responsibility, and I've also gone to the military so I'm not immature.

804
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,550
But why am I running to you?

805
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:49,460
Our relationship is kind of ambiguous.

806
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,020
Kim Jin Hyeok.

807
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,550
The expression "our"...

808
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,040
I came because I missed you.

809
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,510
Because I wanted to see you.

810
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:16,260
I'm being told not to go, but there's a road I wish to take.

811
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:22,260
That's life, and longing.

812
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,590
It's you.

813
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,320
♬  You're already entering  ♬

814
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:39,400
So that's why I came.

815
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:45,930
♬ my heart like this ♬

816
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,200
♬ Your sparkling eyes shine and ♬

817
01:02:54,220 --> 01:03:01,790
♬  they shake my heart ♬

818
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:08,450
♬  The more I like you  ♬

819
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:14,820
♬  The more I depend on you  ♬

820
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:19,240
♬  The heart I'm unwilling to lose ♬

821
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:25,590
♬  The heart that is unwilling to depart ♬

822
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:42,420
Encounter
~ Preview ~

823
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,750
Are you pressured because it's an unfamiliar experience?

824
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:50,480
I think a person allowing another person into his heart

825
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,660
is meaningful.

826
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:58,940
Honestly, I don't want to be involved with you, Kim Jin Hyeok.

827
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,860
♬  The more I like you  ♬

828
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,400
It's not a big deal.

829
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,000
It's not some kind of playful curiosity.

830
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,450
Look, Kim Jin Hyeok.

831
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:11,160
Stay there. Don't come any closer.

832
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:15,880
♬  My feeling grows bigger ♬
