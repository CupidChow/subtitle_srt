10
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,890
Happy New Year!

11
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,780
With Donghwa
Havana Party

12
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:11,020
I hope you enjoy these jazz and salsa performances in celebration of the 2019 Havana hotel.

13
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,320
We welcome you to the heat and passion of Cuba.

14
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,250
Episode 9

15
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,760
Please put double the cheese and add lettuce and avocado.

16
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,930
You still haven't eaten yet?

17
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,430
No, it was too crazy in Sokcho because it's the end of the year.

18
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,810
I came running because Manager Nam showed up.

19
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,260
Here.

20
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,530
But... is this really okay?

21
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,670
Yes. There are no customers here. So what? Are you uncomfortable?

22
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,640
No. Not at all.

23
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,240
It's delicious.

24
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,640
You must be hungry.

25
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,940
Ah. Manager Nam escorted me here and had me sit in your seat.

26
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,290
Really?

27
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,110
In the past when Secretary Jang wanted to sit in that seat one time, he said, "Absolutely not."

28
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,580
"I'm not here to escort Kim Jin Hyeok."

29
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,110
"I'm here to escort my CEO's boyfriend."

30
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,390
You're happy I came, right?

31
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,380
You already know, so why are you asking?

32
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,490
Ey! I want to hear it live.

33
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,190
I had the most exhilarating New Year.

34
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,450
Oh, our Cha Soo Hyeon must enter the annual spring literary contest.

35
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,540
Day after day she is beautiful.

36
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,930
You have to go back, right?

37
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,830
Yes, I have to be at work by 9 a.m.

38
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,620
Shall I give you a ride?

39
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,290
No. I'll take the bus and sleep on the way.

40
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,870
Shall we have a late-night date?

41
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,150
A late-night date?

42
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,330
I can be at work on time if I take the first bus.

43
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,870
Ahh, I see you have to work on New Year's Day.

44
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,410
That makes me feel even worse since I am the CEO.

45
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,540
You will be so tired.

46
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,440
Well, if you don't want, I can leave now.

47
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,080
Look at you. You are being sly.

48
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,750
If it's okay with you, let's go see a movie.

49
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,090
If it's not your cup of tea, then never mind.

50
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,740
No, no. Let's do everything.

51
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,410
Anyway, I don't think we can actually do them all.

52
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,130
What movie shall we see?

53
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,670
I'm not sure.

54
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,800
Will there be vacant seats on a day like today?

55
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,020
Is there any movie you want to watch?

56
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,150
What movies are out right now? I don't really know.

57
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,290
I know all about the Hongje-dong box office.

58
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,990
There's nothing you can't do, is there?

59
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:46,000
Lastly, we'll draw for the lucky Donghwa Hotel certificate.

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,270
Donghwa Hotel one-night stay certificate

61
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,020
The lucky winner's number is...

62
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,620
The leading number is... twenty!

63
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,670
20... 20, yeah.

64
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,100
Three! Congratulations!

65
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,770
Three! Three!

66
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,370
Yes, it's me. Yes, wait a moment!

67
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,020
Excuse me. Hold on, hold on.

68
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,890
Ah, I am fine. Yes, I'm sorry.

69
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,370
Please give him a round of applause.

70
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,290
You are the lucky winner. May I ask how you'll use the certificate?

71
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,520
Yes, I'll use it.

72
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,910
- Alone?
- Yes, for now.

73
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,450
- So you don't have a girlfriend.
- No, not yet!

74
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,780
Ah yes. Then why don't you take your mask off,

75
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,070
and ask publicly?

76
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,720
I'll take it off. Yes, I'll take it off!

77
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,080
Please give him a round of applause!

78
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,740
Don't take it off.

79
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,320
Oh my God. Who did I just dance with?

80
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,650
Please say something.

81
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,970
The person whom I danced with earlier,

82
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,510
that beautiful woman, please take your mask off, too. Please.

83
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,540
Did she go somewhere?

84
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,630
- She was over there earlier.
- Yes, yes.

85
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,400
Please give him another round of applause.

86
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,090
Jin Myeong! Hye In! I won it!

87
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,390
Good! Good!

88
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,640
Then I'll get going now.

89
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,650
Hold on. Hold... on.

90
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,460
Oh? That secretary from earlier...

91
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,450
I didn't know I'd see you like this.

92
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,820
Ah then, I'll get going...

93
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,050
Excuse me. What was that?

94
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,240
What was what?

95
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,790
I thought you were interested earlier.

96
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,220
But you are ignoring me now that your mask is off.

97
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,210
Interested, my...

98
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,720
It was a party after all.

99
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,630
Besides, we are not that friendly, are we?

100
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,290
No, we are not that friendly, but we are not strangers to ignore each other either.

101
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,700
There is Jin Hyeok and your boss.

102
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,850
- So what?
- It must be fate.

103
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,510
Let's go out and drink a bit more. We even closed the restaurant to come here.

104
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,050
Look how depressing it will be with just the two of us. If pretty noona

105
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,010
is generous enough to join us, I think it'll be great.

106
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,700
Oh my...

107
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,110
One beer. Just one.

108
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,530
I am busy, so I can't stay very long.

109
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,060
Ah, do you want some popcorn?

110
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,380
Didn't you like dried squid?

111
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,100
Aw, let's eat popcorn.

112
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,310
There aren't many people here.

113
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,140
Is my taste a bit peculiar?

114
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,170
No. I like it.

115
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,500
Cheers!

116
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,990
Will you be alright?

117
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,940
Yes, the booze tastes sweet today. It's coming fast and nice.

118
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,140
Ah yeah.

119
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,700
I actually haven't had anything to eat today because I was afraid my stomach would stick out.

120
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,180
Please give me one more of this!

121
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,490
Ah, hold on.

122
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,850
Tell me where you live before you drink, so I can take you home if you are too drunk.

123
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,020
What? What is this? Why are you trying to get my address?

124
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,330
What? Okay, whatever. Even if you get drunk, I will just leave you here.

125
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,580
I drink well, you know.

126
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,830
I had high hopes, then it was you again.

127
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,260
Ah, same here. We are both like each other ...

128
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,020
Hyung, Noona. Now that New Year's day has broken, happy new year!

129
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,160
Let's drink happy happily.

130
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,060
Your hyung has been exiled to Sokcho and you are happy.

131
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,850
Seriously, You brothers are not close to each other?

132
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,410
My brother?

133
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,050
Your brother Kim Jin Hyeok. Isn't he your brother?

134
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,220
He was not exiled but transferred. It's not as if he did anything wrong.

135
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,240
No, no, no. She is drunk.

136
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,410
She speaks nonsense when drunk, I see.

137
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,850
Do you really not know?

138
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,130
He touched the nose hair on the sleeping lion.

139
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:53,290
Kim Jin Hyeok plucked a handful of nose hair from that scary Taegyeong Group.

140
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,320
Ayoo... It's a huge problem. Kim Jin Hyeok and this woman over here.

141
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,120
Ms. Jang Mi Jin! Are you sleeping?

142
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,250
Jin Myeong, she's sleeping. Do something...

143
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,370
Hey, Kim Jin Myeong! Where are you going?

144
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,350
From the New Year...

145
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,360
Answer the phone, Kim Jin Hyeok.

146
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,660
♬  She laughs as she cries  ♬

147
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,380
♬  She don't know why  ♬

148
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,420
♬ I've come to know you  ♬

149
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,570
♫ He tells me his thoughts, crazy as they are ♫

150
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,560
♬  I am confused  ♬

151
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,950
♬  He said that he loves me  ♬

152
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,380
The exit is to the right.
♬  He always will ♬

153
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,700
♬ I've come to know you  ♬

154
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,970
Time went by too quickly, didn't it?

155
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,840
There will be so many checkouts today. It'll be a lot of work.

156
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,200
After enjoying an uplifting time, I should take care of them.

157
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,230
Today, don't do anything. Just peacefully rest.

158
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,490
Don't worry about me. I will be just fine.

159
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,350
Of course. My strong woman, Cha Soo Hyeon.

160
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,370
You should get going. You might miss the bus.

161
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,580
I'm leaving.

162
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,680
- I'm off.
- Okay.

163
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,370
Drive safely.

164
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,560
What?

165
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,520
- I'm really leaving now.
- Call me.

166
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,250
Roll up the window. You may catch a cold.

167
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,750
Okay. Be careful.

168
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,880
I'm off. Go ahead and leave.

169
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,140
Bye.

170
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,810
Go ahead.

171
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,790
Why am I here?

172
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,630
- What is this?
- What do I know?

173
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,330
You can't even hold your liquor, so what was I supposed to do?

174
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,140
You should have taken me to the hotel.

175
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,350
I was going to be generous and use my

176
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,430
hotel certificate to get you a room.

177
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,620
But there was no vacancy, so what else should I have done?

178
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,560
How could you leave someone out here while you slept in the room?

179
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,880
It's like you're asking for your things after I saved you from drowning.

180
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,980
This is crazy.

181
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,100
- Let's go.
- Where to?

182
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,810
- The sauna.
- Is it close?

183
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,060
It's right across the street. Let's go to the sauna

184
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,100
and have some rice soup

185
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,520
Oh, my! My stomach hurts!

186
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,850
Oh, my lower back. Goodness, my stomach hurts!

187
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,900
Oh, my back!

188
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,280
Oh. I think I can live now.

189
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,140
Take this.

190
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,960
You drank a lot of alcohol. It's effective. You'll feel relieved.

191
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,720
Thank you. You saved me.

192
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,310
- About Jin Hyeok...
- Huh?

193
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,460
Why was a transfer to Sokcho being exiled?

194
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,860
He was transferred, not exiled.

195
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,060
You said he was exiled and turned Jin Myeong upside down last night.

196
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,690
Me?

197
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:23,010
Then what about pulling nose hair of scary Taegyeong Group? What was that about?

198
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,700
What did you mean?

199
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,440
I drank too much and was talking nonsense.

200
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,210
Anyway, I thought is was strange that he was sent so far away from home.

201
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,960
That place is nice and clean because it's newly built and you can see the ocean at the front.

202
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,710
What's going to happen to him?

203
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,400
Donghwa Hotel's CEO Seen on New Year's Date

204
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,220
Here we go again!

205
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,050
Secretary Jang

206
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,220
Happy New Year!

207
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,120
It's not happy, Ahjussi. News came out again.

208
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,330
Is something going on with the CEO?

209
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,180
You weren't with her yesterday?

210
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,830
She was photographed with Kim Jin Hyeok again, Ahjussi!

211
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,670
That's no big deal. Go back to sleep.

212
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,460
Is it weird for young people to go on a date? Your reaction is what's weird.

213
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,760
Ahjussi, you shouldn't be that relaxed right now.

214
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,760
The world these days is not as romantic as you think!

215
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,670
- People are tearing off flesh in chaos and I can't mitigate this now! 
- Ah, she has so much energy.

216
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,480
Anyway, Happy New Year, Mi Jin!

217
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,380
Ahjussi—

218
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,880
You can't hide the sneeze anyway.

219
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,560
You can't stop the kids from what they want to do and the love...

220
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,670
Can't stop the burp, either?

221
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,800
You want to see all three or just pick the one you like?

222
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,410
What are you talking about?

223
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,200
How long are you going to be in this room alone?

224
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,530
I need to shower.

225
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:10,630
The lady of this room... most definitely can not be Cha Soo Hyeon.

226
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,220
Right from the new year, she gets her photos taken with a man so vulgarly.

227
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,040
Thanks to her, Taegyeong Group is on the search list and your name as well.

228
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Meet all three of them.

229
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Who is enjoying a date with CEO Cha Soo Hyeon?

230
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,400
Secretary Jang

231
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,500
Banpo-dong Madam

232
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,440
I-I'm not going to just leave this guy alone.

233
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
I will destroy him.

234
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,870
Are you really going to let Soo Hyeon be like this?

235
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,950
She doesn't even answer my calls.

236
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,270
She must be tied up with something.

237
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,240
Does this only affect Soo Hyeon?

238
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,140
I'll go see her.

239
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,610
So don't contact Soo Hyeon.

240
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,970
Really? My only child is no help.

241
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,790
Thank you.

242
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,910
Hello. May I help you check out?

243
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,920
Yes. You are all checked out. Thank you.

244
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,070
Have a great day.

245
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,040
Isn't that guy the one who was with the CEO?

246
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,060
Yes, that's him.

247
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Thank you.

248
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,860
Why is the front desk so chaotic?

249
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,440
Excuse me for a minute.

250
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,840
Did you get some sleep?

251
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,230
I slept, but when I woke up, there was chaos.

252
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,570
Are you okay?

253
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,830
This is expected.

254
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,070
Your beauty can't be hidden.

255
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,570
You face has been exposed.

256
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,630
My face came out so well in the picture. It's looks better than my actual face, right?

257
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,340
I like your actual face better.

258
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,220
CEO...

259
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,170
These are all very natural occurrences.

260
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,110
And as expected.

261
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,880
So don't worry about anything.

262
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,930
It's no big deal.

263
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,230
It's really quiet here.

264
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,590
You're listening, right?

265
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,180
I'm hungry. I should go get something to eat.

266
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,200
Eat something delicious and fill your belly up.

267
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,100
Hello.

268
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,500
Hello, you are going to work?

269
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,100
Ahjumma.

270
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,780
- Jin Hyeok is this person, right?
- What?

271
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,250
What is this?

272
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,390
Well, I'm not quite sure.

273
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,790
- Jin Myeong!
- What is it?

274
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,290
Jin Myeong! Come here and take a look at this.

275
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,110
This. Look at this.

276
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,440
This article. It's Jin Hyeok, right?

277
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,490
Oh. It must be someone who resembles him.

278
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,650
No. This is definitely Jin Hyeok.

279
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,350
The CEO must have treated him out for a meal because of his outstanding work.

280
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,460
Would she buy him a meal for doing a good job when she sent him to Sokcho?

281
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,120
Why did he go to a theater? And this, when was this picture taken?

282
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,280
That CEO and Hyung were close, I hear. Where was it?

283
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,670
Cuba. They met there.

284
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,970
Really?

285
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,840
Why would she date my hyung with her status?

286
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,260
Hey. What's wrong with your brother?

287
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,740
You aren't being objective because he is your son.

288
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,880
You are sure that they are just a little close?

289
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,300
Yes, it's nothing much.

290
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,760
It's because it's a little strange.

291
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,810
That thing. What is it? A pair of woman's shoes in your room.

292
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,880
Woman's shoes?

293
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,810
Oh, the thing is...

294
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,790
It's something from Cuba.

295
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,550
I just kept them to use as props for shooting later.

296
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:49,250
Cuba... If he's known her since Cuba...

297
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,750
Yes, Father.

298
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,990
It's the New Year. Should we have a meal together?

299
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,630
Sounds great.

300
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,320
This restaurant is expensive, so you pay. Your salary is higher than mine.

301
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,750
We should have picked a plain restaurant.

302
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,830
You saw the article, right?

303
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,770
Yes, I saw it.

304
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,640
Your name is also up on the search list. I'm sorry.

305
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,180
Is it the first time that my name came up on the search list?

306
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,610
This time, it's different.

307
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,170
The Taegyeong group didn't mention anything?

308
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,250
Now, the attacks will probably start pouring in.

309
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,990
Will you be all right?

310
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,960
Because I think the best defense is to attack.

311
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,520
So you are going to face it head-on?

312
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,720
I've been preparing for it.

313
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,380
It seems like the time is coming.

314
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,130
I have a concern.

315
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,480
If I start like this,

316
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,920
I'm concerned that it will be a hindrance to your work.

317
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:14,510
Up until now, I was a hindrance to your life.

318
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,990
- Father...
- Just think of yourself.

319
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,380
This is a big fight.

320
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,580
But ... will that person be all right?

321
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:32,010
Watching a precious person go through tough times because of us is a really horrible thing.

322
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:38,990
We are used to people speaking about us, but this young man is an ordinary person.

323
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,320
When normalcy is broken

324
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,200
it's a very distressing thing.

325
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,090
You must know that only too well.

326
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,370
Taegyeong probably won't just leave him alone.

327
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,770
Let's eat.

328
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,520
Yes.

329
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,700
Jin Hyeok

330
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,390
Because the call could not be connected

331
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,710
Jin Myeong

332
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,910
Oh, Jin Myeong.

333
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:35,870
I was so curious why you weren't calling back, but social media is telling me instead.

334
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,050
Your photo looks amazing.

335
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,660
Because well... I am good-looking.

336
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,400
Do Mom and Dad know too?

337
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,860
They don't know.

338
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,830
So don't worry. Just make sure you take those supplements.

339
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,680
You know that they didn't even get me any and only bought them for you, right?

340
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,840
Hey, I will buy you a box.

341
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,690
They are all doing well, right?

342
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,050
Of course. How long has it been since you left?

343
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,460
You are going to come back when you have free days, right?

344
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,100
I'm saying that you have to come, so that I can have meat.

345
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,950
Yes, I should go.

346
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,600
Did you eat already?

347
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,740
Yes. What about you?

348
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,470
I'm going to go inside now to eat with Dae Chan.

349
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,390
Mom gave me rice cake soup just now.

350
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:26,260
Okay, eat well and let's have a happy new year.

351
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,420
You have a happy new year too. It's cold. I'm going to hang up.

352
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,180
He's too kind. He should just worry about himself.

353
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,430
Smile fruit shop

354
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,430
I'm sorry. Isn't there a way that we can find it?

355
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,940
The sheets have already been collected to be washed.

356
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,540
How about we ship it by mail if we find it?

357
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,980
It's just that my daughter won't move anywhere without that doll.

358
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,150
Can't we find it later?

359
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,560
They say that it will take a long time to find the teddy bear.

360
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:45,520
You lost your friend?

361
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,890
You are sure that it got collected together with the sheets, right?

362
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,000
Yes. We checked out, but maybe she was having an upset stomach, she kept vomiting.

363
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,690
We went inside briefly just to change her clothes. I guess we left it on the sheets.

364
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,460
Mom.

365
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,980
Can you wait just a little while? I will try to look for your friend.

366
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,400
Can you wait while eating ice cream with your mom?

367
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,930
The ice cream here is really good. I had two of them myself.

368
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,830
You can wait without crying, right?

369
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,610
There's probably a lot of sheets that have been collected to be washed.

370
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,450
For now, I'll try to look for it.

371
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,140
I feel like the child will keep crying if she doesn't have her teddy bear.

372
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,880
I'm so sorry.

373
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,150
I can't guarantee anything, but I will try to look for it quickly. Please wait.

374
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm so sorry.

375
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,960
Let's wait while eating ice cream.

376
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,840
You are going to look through all of these?!

377
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,230
I will look for it so that it doesn't interfere with your work.

378
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,830
Oh... will you be okay?

379
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,110
Two hours have already passed...

380
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,690
He's still looking for it.

381
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,300
- I think it'll be hard to find.
- Of course.

382
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,510
- How can you find it like that?
- Let's go.

383
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,490
It's you!

384
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,440
I found it.

385
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,790
You are sleeping?

386
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,980
I'm here.

387
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,250
Wake up.

388
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,520
Ta-da!

389
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,290
My doll!

390
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,010
It's my doll!

391
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,040
- Mom, my doll...
- You like it?

392
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,610
- You see, I said that I would find it.
- Yes.

393
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,940
You have to say "thank you."

394
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,200
Thank you.

395
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,960
Don't mention it.

396
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,940
I am really thankful.

397
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,770
No, I'm also happy that I found it.

398
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,030
Then...

399
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,050
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

400
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,280
- Ahjusshi, thank you so much!
- Ahjusshi, thank you so much!

401
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,360
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!

402
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,160
Have a good time.

403
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,390
Customer!

404
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,600
You left your cellphone.

405
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,940
- Thank you.
- Yes.

406
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,460
TOURIST
Kang Soo Jin

407
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,130
Ah, yes.

408
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,190
Good work.

409
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,060
I asked to meet because there's something that I must say.

410
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:20,640
As for me, there's nothing else I need to say to you.

411
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,190
I'll be leaving.

412
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,620
Is this the meaning that I'm thinking of?

413
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,940
Even though time passes, the ring remains the same.

414
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,910
It's romantic, isn't it?

415
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,900
Come back.

416
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,910
Let's live far away from my parents.

417
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:55,960
You don't have to attend my family's affairs. I'll cover them for you.

418
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,990
You continue with the hotel work. It's the work you enjoy.

419
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,170
Woo Seok.

420
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,500
I'll do everything.

421
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,680
Why now?

422
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,170
Everytime your mother punished me,

423
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,310
you couldn't say anything to her and just watched.

424
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:19,210
I don't even remember your mother giving me hard times much anymore.

425
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,860
What I can't forget...

426
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:29,050
is that you always stood there with a weak stare in your eyes.

427
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:34,440
After those days passed, you showered me with gifts like handbags and jewelry.

428
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,650
That made me feel even worse.

429
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,700
Back then I was...

430
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:47,350
Back then, I told myself, "Cha Soo Hyeon, you are a vegetable."

431
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,660
I endured it by only breathing.

432
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,320
When you told me you were in love with someone else,

433
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,810
I had no other choice.

434
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,050
And I had no reason to stay and endure, either.

435
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,060
Soo Hyeon, that was...

436
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,710
Shall we live abroad?

437
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:14,320
How about Cuba? You have a hotel there. How about living there?

438
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,960
That person...

439
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,220
He is a meaningful person to me.

440
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,010
To me, he's a special person.

441
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,850
The person you are seeing now

442
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:34,010
is a meaningful person to you, too. Isn't she?

443
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,370
So why are you...?

444
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,300
Now, I hope

445
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,160
we can see each other with smiles.

446
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:49,520
You're supposed to sway when the wind blows.

447
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,040
It's okay if you sway.

448
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:00,350
Just don't get blown away in that wind.

449
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,360
Checkout time is 11 a.m. and the elevator is behind you.

450
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,060
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your stay.

451
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Have you been well, Madam?

452
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,480
Why all this way...? If you had called we'd...

453
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,370
May he leave his post?

454
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,030
You know who I am, right?

455
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,020
Yes.

456
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,420
I came to you because I must tell you something.

457
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,610
Yes.

458
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,620
I am warning you.

459
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,320
Don't even go near Soo Hyeon again.

460
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,640
This isn't the kind of relationship for an ordinary young man to get involved in.

461
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,460
You are not answering.

462
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,120
It's because I can't give you the answer you want.

463
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,010
Soo Hyeon... No, CEO Cha...

464
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,260
will soon get back together with CEO Jeong Woo Seok.

465
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,680
Now that the both families are in agreement,

466
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,340
you being like this is troublesome.

467
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,540
Does the CEO want it as well?

468
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,770
There are people who live their lives just as it has been decided for them

469
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,530
I am sorry, but there are no such people.

470
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,880
It is the CEO's life.

471
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,410
I think it's misfortune for her to live as specified by someone else.

472
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,390
Why would such a thought of yours interfere?

473
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:51,740
It seems that you are getting bold because my daughter is seeing you.

474
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,160
This place is pretty far away.

475
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,200
Don't make me come this far again.

476
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,670
A huge fight will begin because of you.

477
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,550
The fight will be beyond anything you know or imagine.

478
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,660
And the person who is driving CEO Cha

479
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,840
to this fight is you. Do you realize that?

480
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,120
I think we can handle it. Yes.

481
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,110
Oh, CEO.

482
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,040
You know her, right? She is the one who called you with my phone.

483
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,610
I scolded her already.

484
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,740
I'm sorry, CEO.

485
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,850
Not at all, Jo Hye In. Thank you for calling me.

486
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,000
But what is your relationship with Kim Jin Hyeok?

487
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,110
We are friends from junior high.

488
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,760
Then...

489
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,220
Excuse me...

490
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,070
Are you uncomfortable?

491
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,300
No, I'm not. Just a bit.

492
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,270
I'd like to ask you something, since you are his friend.

493
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:47,490
He's not someone who talks about himself.

494
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:51,700
Did he say he's doing alright?

495
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,030
CEO...

496
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,090
I know this is rude, but...

497
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:07,490
Can you stop it now?

498
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,270
Jin Hyeok told me that

499
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,400
he has to go to Sokcho so you can save this hotel.

500
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,360
He said that's the only way he can protect you.

501
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,900
If Jin Hyeok continues like this...

502
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,890
I'm sorry, CEO.

503
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,490
No.

504
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,370
You don't need to be sorry.

505
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,090
Thank you.

506
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,260
- What is it?
- I have something to show you.

507
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,660
This time I'm not Cha Soo Hyeon's secretary but your friend.

508
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,770
This is something to think about.

509
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,520
What is it?

510
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,820
Let me lay out some of the details regarding the man that Donghwa Hotel's CEO Cha Soo Hyeon went on a date with.

511
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,250
Did you see the articles about Donghwa Hotel's CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's love life that exploded?

512
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,870
People are saying that he's a third generation chaebol, and he's the CEO of some company, etc.

513
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,550
There are a lot of guesses, but it's not like that at all.

514
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,450
I went to college with him and the picture proves it. He looks the same in this photo, right?

515
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,060
Because he was good looking, those around him often told him to become a celebrity.

516
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,700
Even when he was in college, he was extremely skilled at picking up girls while walking around carrying books.

517
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,790
He is really living the life after seducing a woman.

518
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,790
Also, you guys can't think that just because he is good looking that he is a chaebol.

519
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,650
His family is super poor. From what I know, they run a fruit store. But who cares? It's literally about how good looking you are.

520
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,360
Gosh, if I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have deleted his phone number. Damn.

521
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,210
Wow, he's so good looking.
His face must do a lot for him.

522
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,270
But why are you disappointed?
I'm jealous of his face and his skills!

523
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,830
What's Kim Jin Hyeok to do?

524
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,700
And one more thing...

525
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,830
About your mother.

526
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,420
I think she went to Sokcho and met with Kim Jin Hyeok.

527
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,120
Jin Hyeok told me that

528
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,270
he has to go to Sokcho so you can save this hotel.

529
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,800
Taegyeong Group won't leave him alone.

530
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,330
These are all very natural occurrences.

531
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:30,600
Don't worry about anything.

532
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,690
Jin Hyeok, this is you, right? Shouldn't you buy some booze?

533
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,670
Hey, does this mean you get to stay at the hotel for free?

534
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,630
It means you'll own Donghwa Hotel.

535
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,970
A huge fight will begin because of you.

536
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,490
And the person who is driving CEO Cha to this fight is you. Do you realize that?

537
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,100
CEO

538
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,420
Yes, CEO.

539
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,020
You're busy, right?

540
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,150
I've been so busy learning about the hotel, I'm going out of my mind.

541
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:14,470
You are eating well and maintaining your beauty as well, right?

542
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,980
Yes, I am doing fine.

543
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,010
Jin Hyeok.

544
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,860
Yes.

545
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,280
All your personal information is exposed to the public.

546
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,400
It's very distorted though.

547
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,440
My classmates are pulling pranks on me.

548
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,540
Don't worry about it.

549
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:42,030
The extraordinary images of you

550
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,030
are wrapped up in minuscule things.

551
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,100
The diligent life you've led

552
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,610
has been purposely distorted.

553
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,530
My heart is...

554
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:59,470
It's just a few people among the population of 50 million.

555
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,610
It's not important, not even a bit.

556
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:04,590
It's not true. I know.

557
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,110
That sharp word stabs so deeply.

558
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:15,640
And the wound is so deep, it won't even heal quickly.

559
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:24,410
CEO, I am really fine.

560
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,180
I'm more worried about you.

561
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,810
Don't get on the internet, okay?

562
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:33,590
Just listen to music and eat well.

563
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,160
Yes?

564
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,160
How about we take some time to think?

565
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,100
You are having a really hard time, right?

566
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,170
Because I'm such an ordinary person...

567
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,900
I put you in a more difficult situation, right?

568
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,880
No, it's not that.

569
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,930
Because I'm afraid...

570
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,780
♫  You can't start entering ♫

571
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:30,140
I'm afraid that you will be hurt.

572
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,810
♫  into my heart like this. ♫

573
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:36,380
Don't be frightened.

574
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,300
The closer I get to you,

575
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,800
it seems I shake your life even more. That makes me hesitant.

576
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,840
♫  I won't ever lose my heart to you. ♫

577
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,880
The stares that are directed at me ...

578
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,220
The fact that they will be directed at you is scary.

579
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,860
♫  The more I like you  ♫

580
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:05,620
♫ The more I depend on you ♫

581
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:10,540
♫ The heart I'm unwilling to lose ♫

582
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,060
♫ The heart that is unwilling to depart ♫

583
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,830
Should we do this?

584
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:19,960
"No news is good news."

585
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,110
Nothing bad happened to either of us, so it's good news.

586
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:29,280
Let's spend some time like that.

587
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,320
To see who endures it better,

588
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,480
how about a bet?

589
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,950
A kind of a bet which you'll be sad to win and hurt to lose.

590
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,930
Let's do it.

591
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:56,280
♫  The more I like you ♫

592
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,010
Okay.

603
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,970
Aren't you bored? You came to a strange place suddenly.

604
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,090
I was bored at first, but I am getting used to it now.

605
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,890
How was the dinner for your team last night?

606
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,270
It was no joke. It was chaotic.

607
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,220
Was it chaotic?

608
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,510
I am really fine.

609
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,130
I am more worried about you.

610

617
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,470
I am also not the Cha Soo Hyeon who allows the person she likes to be mistreated without reason.

00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:46,110
I hope you will be filled with a happiness which is like magic.

640
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:52,590
♫  Now I belong to you ♫

641
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:02,200
♫  This feeling only grows more and more intense. ♫

642
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,720
It's body wash this year.

643
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,620
Assistant Manager Park, let's live cleanly this year.

644
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,670
I shower in the morning and at night, what are you talking about?

645
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:11,930
Really?

646
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:14,310
But it doesn't show.

647
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:29,280
One month later

648
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,630
Why aren't you coming home? You are still like this after one month?

649
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:34,940
I really want to go home.

650
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,050
I have a lot of work to do here.

651
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:41,130
Are you sure you are not staying because of the scenery?

652
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,630
The ocean is nice.

653
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:49,150
Why don't you take a half day off and come home? Your parents are worried.

654
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,250
Okay, let's talk again.

655
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,140
Okay.

656
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:46,110
♬ The morning sunrise, it takes me away ♬

657
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,570
♬ As I'm staring at the light you hold,  ♬

658
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:53,070
Because I am afraid... because you might get hurt,

659
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,040
I am afraid.

660
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,350
♬ The feeling of adore will take me on to you  ♬

661
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:10,740
A kind of a bet which you'll be sad if you win and hurts if you lose. Let's do it.

662
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,720
♬ Is this what they have been calling love? ♬

663
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:22,870
♬ And it just goes on, oh take me on to you ♬

664
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:32,400
♬ You're my flower and I'm your bee ♬

665
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,480
♬ You know you keep me alive ♬

666
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:43,750
♬ You're my reasons for everything I do, ♬

667
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:49,350
♬ the other half of me ♬

668
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:56,000
♬ Oh, take me on down a river ♬

669
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,720
♬ I'll go wherever it leads to you  ♬

670
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:07,340
♬ Oh, take me on, into your arms ♬

671
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,970
♬ I'll go wherever world you are. ♬

672
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:25,680
Once you have finished rewinding the roll of film, you open here and take it out.

673
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,640
To develop the film, you need to get it done professionally.

674
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,340
If you are hesitant about taking it in, then ask Teacher Lee.

675
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,440
She has a darkroom in her place.

676
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,050
Go there alone? Don't you think it's strange?

677
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,010
Hello.

678
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,620
Welcome.

679
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,830
I was just wondering if you were here while driving by.

680
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:07,180
Welcome. I got bored. I'm glad you came.

681
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,860
I don't know much about tea.

682
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:15,010
They said it was a good one but I'm not sure if you'd like it.

683
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:18,340
You shouldn't have done this.

684
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,630
So I can come here next time.

685
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,320
Thank you.

686
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,610
You brought your film with you, didn't you?

687
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:30,840
How did you know?

688
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,260
Jin Hyeok called.

689
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,150
If you possibly came, he wanted me to develop the film for you.

690
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,360
I heard he is in Sokcho, right?

691
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:47,510
He's having too much fun. How nice must it be for him to work while seeing the beautiful ocean and all.

692
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:48,700
That place must be unfamiliar to him, so...

693
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:54,110
Well, do you want to take a look around the darkroom? Come this way.

694
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,400
It's fascinating.

695
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,170
Jin Hyeok says the same thing whenever he works in this room.

696
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,640
You should give it a try.

697
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,620
Me?

698
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:28,240
You'll get better by practicing. This way.

699
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,850
Put that film first.

700
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,990
That's right.

701
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,830
You did it on your first try.

702
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:39,230
This is right?

703
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:41,820
Oh, you did well.

704
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:46,510
Now.. You wait.

705
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:47,730
It is amazing.

706
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:50,210
If you like how it looks,

707
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,990
put it over there into the first solution.

708
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,760
Alright.

709
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,380
You know...

710
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:39,950
I still miss my deceased husband so very much.

711
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:45,840
Will I have to die to be able to meet him again?

712
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:52,670
Looking at each other when it is possible... That is a successful life.

713
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:48,540
The closer I get to you, it seems I shake your life even more.

714
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,880
That makes me hesitant.

715
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:59,650
If you get intimidated,, you lose. And if you worry, you look worse.

716
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:05,340
So, starting tomorrow, the two of us must become even closer.

717
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:19,430
It was exciting when we were together.

718
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:25,350
But growing distant again ... returning to a place with nothing.

719
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:28,040
is as painful as ever.

720
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,480
Sokcho 81 km, Yangyang 64 km, Gangneung 16 km.

721
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,900
Sokcho 73 km, Yangyang 56 km, Gangneung 8 km.

722
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,890
Just in case there might be a situation where we'll have to endure some things,

723
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:45,360
if that happens,

724
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:50,590
let's fight through with the good memories we made, from Cuba until today.

725
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:57,350
With every step I take, Cha Soo Hyeon..

726
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,690
Cha Soo Hyeon, Cha Soo Hyeon.

727
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:02,470
I'm walking like this, I'm telling you. What are you talking about?

728
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:16,560
Why do you only worry about me?

729
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:22,260
I'm worried that I might've made things worse for you. That makes me uneasy.

730
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,860
Sokcho

731
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,240
You always run towards me, Jin Hyeok.

732
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,940
To Sokcho, to my house.

733
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:36,030
Let's endure well with good memories.

734
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:40,120
Alright. I will give it a try.

I lost our game of "no news is a good news."

740
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,510
We haven't decided on that.

741

What we are going to do for the winner?

742

What are you doing?

743
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:59,590
I'm out to have a meal with my colleagues.

744
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,380
There are so many good places to eat, you know.

745
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,640
Is that so?

746
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:10,170
Where are your colleagues then?

That place will be gone soon.

783

Why?

784
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:40,600
The world is constantly changing.

A storm of many different responses was raging towards us.

So, do I want to hide?
