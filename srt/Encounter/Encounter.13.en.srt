1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,930
Encounter

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,200
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,680
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,900
Boyfriend

5
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,190
The CEO came.

6
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,720
You should escort her inside. What are you guys doing just standing there?

7
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,460
Come on in.

8
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes. Come in.

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,570
Thank you for inviting me and allowing me to come to your place.

10
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,150
We're just having a meal together. It's not such a big deal.

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,760
I wasn't sure what to bring.

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,320
Oh. You could have just come. I didn't prepare a lot of food.

13
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,830
Come this way.

14
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,390
Yes.

15
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,510
Rice. Rice. Rice.

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,450
Episode 13

17
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,610
CEO Cha's car has arrived.

18
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,970
- CEO Cha So Hyeon!
- CEO Cha So Hyeon!

19
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,300
- Please look here.
- CEO, CEO Cha Soo Hyeon!

20
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,170
- Here she comes! Here she comes!
- CEO Cha! CEO! CEO Cha!

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,110
This way, CEO! CEO Cha! Please look this way!

22
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,890
Please raise your head!

23
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,050
- What?
- What is this?

24
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,700
CEO Cha had a conflicting scheduled appointment. She will not be able to attend.

25
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,600
I came to announce this personally.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,800
Yes. I understand. I will inform them.

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes. Then.

28
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,490
This is the taste! I have to learn how to make kimchi from Jin Hyeok's mom.

29
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,220
- Isn't it delicious, CEO?
- Yes.

30
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,560
It's very delicious, Mother.
(Employing the term a fiancée uses to refer to her mother-in-law)

31
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,490
Ah! Wh-What a relief! E-Eat a lot.
(Using honorific term)

32
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,450
Please speak comfortably.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,800
If we're going to speak comfortably, then let's have yaja-time.
(A game where honorifics are reversed from oldest to youngest)

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,700
So we can get close really quickly.

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,400
- Just eat.
- Okay.

36
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,380
We're going to have a problem. I think I will eat two bowls of rice today.

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Mmm. This. This. Did you also make this pickled plum?

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes. That there. Even though it's for spring,

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I heard it retains its flavor for a long time.

40
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,140
Ah! You prepare this kind of dish too. You are so cool.

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,500
Ah! No.

42
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,600
My mom is good at preparing fruit dishes.

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,250
She's just halfway taking care of fruits that are almost spoiled.

44
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,350
Is Dae Chan's store not getting much business? You've already eaten everything.

45
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,870
His store isn't getting much business, and I'm going to eat even more.

46
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,300
Eat a lot.

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,800
Dad, why are you so quiet? Are you holding back?

48
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm not.

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,500
Aigoo. This guy.

50
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
Eat a lot.

51
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,900
- Enjoy your meal.
- Yes.

52
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,860
The short ribs are delicious.

53
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,990
It's like this everyday, isn't it?

54
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:07,450
At your house, it's like this everyday, lively and comfortable. Right?

55
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,840
Ey! Sometimes, when my parents argue, it's like a war.

56
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,590
I don't think so.

57
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,570
Jin Hyeok.

58
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,960
You thought I might have a hard time. That's why you told me the dinner was cancelled, right?

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,200
If it were me, I think I would have told you to stop going to Taegyeong Group's events.

60
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,100
I don't think I would have been able to be so considerate.

61
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,700
Actually, I know this situation makes you feel uneasy.

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,170
As for me, wherever Soo Hyeon goes or whoever she has to meet

63
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,880
doesn't make me uncomfortable.

64
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,400
Soo Hyeon, all of the time that you've lived until now is meaningful

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,600
and has a purpose.

66
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,840
No matter where you go or what you do, your heart will come back to me.

67
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,890
Right?

68
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,980
- I was a bit awkward, right?
- Huh?

69
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,950
Did I make your parents uncomfortable?

70
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,880
I guess you don't know what uncomfortable feels like.

71
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,580
You all got along well together.

72
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,170
I was actually quite surprised.

73
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,660
Really?

74
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,450
"Wow. You make this kind of dish too?"

75
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,200
- Stop.
- "It's very delicious, Mother."

76
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,400
- Stop! When did I say that?
- "You are so cool."

77
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,900
Stop!

78
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,200
"Stop!"

79
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,850
- Oh! Stop it.
- "Oh!"

80
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,300
"Stop it."

81
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,650
Go get some rest.

82
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,310
Your father

83
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,860
must be upset.

84
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,690
Oh! Hey. Hey. Hey.

85
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,300
Eat some rice and drink some water with it.
(The dish is too spicy.)

86
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,600
I won't be satisfied with those, okay?

87
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,330
It's been so long since I've had homemade food like this.

88
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,370
Slowly. Slowly.

89
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,500
You're here.

90
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,240
Did you take the CEO back safely?

91
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,900
- Of course, I did.
- Hey.

92
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,600
Now that she's met your parents, you two are going full steam ahead?

93
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,530
Kim Jin Hyeok was smiling from ear to ear. Do you like her that much?

94
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,240
Yes, I like her that much.

95
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,970
Oh. It's too spicy. I'm going to go get something to drink.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,600
That's why I told you to eat it with rice and drink something.

97
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,300
I felt that way. About my sister-in-law.

98
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,900
Hey. Yah!

99
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,900
I mean, CEO.

100
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,900
I was a little worried about having the CEO over at our place.

101
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,110
Is that so?

102
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,800
But when she came and was with our family, I was watching, like, "This looks good."

103
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,300
If Mom and Dad think like that, it'd be good.

104
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,220
Of course. You just worry about your relationship, Hyung.

105
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,650
Still, I'm worried.

106
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,250
About what?

107
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,400
Dad came to visit me at the company one time.

108
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,610
What did he say?

109
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,140
He was asking me if we would be okay.

110
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,620
I asked him to trust us.

111
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,460
That's good.

112
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,420
How about Mom?

113
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,340
Ah ... As for Mom ... I'm not sure.

114
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,800
I think Mom was really surprised today.

115
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,400
You know, it was kind of like... the calm before a storm, maybe?

116
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,700
So, I'm kind of scared to ask her anything about it.

117
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,040
Should I ask her for you?

118
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,750
No, that's okay. I should just talk to her tomorrow.

119
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,680
How about you?

120
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,640
What?

121
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,000
Your friends don't bother you about it?

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,480
Aigoo. If I cared about stuff like that, I wouldn't be able to survive.

123
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,400
You like her. Why are you only worrying about the people around you so much?

124
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,190
So when are you two getting married?

125
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,950
Really! How can I discuss anything with you?

126
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,090
Why? You date, then bam! You just register your marriage and it's done.

127
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,110
Jin Hyeok! Hey! You're going to register your marriage first?
(Registration before the ceremony implies the girlfriend is pregnant)

128
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,080
Hey, yo— You guys go well together! Totally!

129
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,230
Good luck, Chan's Whelks!

130
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,140
Aigoo, how long has it been since I had homemade food?

131
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,120
- It's hot!
- Let's eat it together.

132
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,900
- My mom's kimchi stew is really delicious.
- Ah, it's delicious. So good!

133
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,300
After I went and begged like that—

134
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,600
Look at the article.

135
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,500
They're going crazy saying something like the long relationship between Taegyeong Group and Assemblyman Cha Jong Hyeon has ended.

136
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Ah. Sit down. Let's eat breakfast.

137
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,160
That's all old news. Why are you like this?

138
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,390
Honey, you eat a lot.

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,370
You were really upset, weren't you?

140
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,510
No. I fully understand your position.

141
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you.

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,700
I asked to see you because you'll be holding a meeting for Cha Soo Hyeon's reappointment as CEO soon. Isn't that right?

143
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,380
Yes. That's true.

144
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,130
Influence the directors.

145
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:26,880
Use this opportunity to move Cha Soo Hyeon from her position and make CEO Jeong Woo Seok the sole CEO.

146
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:35,220
Ah... If I'm to do that, I need a guarantee that the power of our directors will be enough to win for certain.

147
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,670
It's already been taken care of. You just have to hold the Board of Directors meeting.

148
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,190
Yes. I will proceed as you have directed.

149
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,870
Legal Team.

150
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,560
Begin the case on getting Donghwa Hotel right away.

151
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,100
Assemblyman Cha Jeong Hyeon is no longer our concern.

152
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,090
Make sure you take Donghwa Hotel.

153
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,330
There were a few of the same model, but it took time to find one made in the same year.

154
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,940
You worked hard. Thank you.

155
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,060
By the way, do you think Assemblyman Cha will be all right?

156
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,720
I feel like Taegyeong is going to make both of your lives difficult.

157
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,810
They'll push forward with the lawsuit to take Donghwa Hotel again, won't they?

158
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,270
That's what those people live for. Don't worry about it.

159
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,640
Yes.

160
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,480
Will the ad for the hotel wedding discount be going out in print, too?

161
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,390
It's been decided that it will be publicized in Donghwa's second quarter issue and only two luxury brand magazines.

162
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,830
Let's take some good pictures. We have to make sure people are dying to get married at Donghwa Hotel.

163
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,920
Yes, Department Head.

164
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,830
Also, how many wedding planners have we pared it down to?

165
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,030
Going by your criteria, we've narrowed it down to three.

166
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,880
Among those, let's go with the one that has the most experience in doing hotel weddings.

167
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,980
Yes.

168
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,650
When spring comes, the waves of weddings will overflow.

169
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,430
And my pockets will soon be emptied, too.
(because of wedding gift money)

170
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,500
Do you go to all of your friends' weddings?

171
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,160
You never know. If none of them comes to my wedding, it'll make me look as if I'm not a nice person.

172
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,710
I'm thinking of it as an exchange of labor.

173
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,930
Oh, who was the one in charge of the model agency last time?

174
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,630
Section Chief Lee.

175
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,430
Section Chief Lee?

176
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,860
Yes.

177
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,760
The model agency ... No, let's have Assistant Manager Park take it over.

178
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,110
You seem a little tired these days, and we can't risk something going wrong.

179
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,440
No, I'll keep doing it.

180
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,690
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

181
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,510
Fine. Then let's decide on the concept after discussing it with the photographer and the wedding planner.

182
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,930
Yes.

183
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,550
I think the wedding planner is the one that's from...

184
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,710
Dad, I caused trouble.

185
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,110
What do I do? I feel sorry towards you.

186
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,530
You did well.

187
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,280
Seeing how you've been acting these days, I'm learning from you.

188
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Your election is coming soon, though.

189
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,400
Soo Yeon, I've been holding back

190
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,500
since it's too early to explain things in a way that would bring some relief.

191
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,950
But don't be shocked at how I behave as a politician from now on,

192
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,220
and don't ever have strange thoughts like it might be because of you.

193
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,450
What do you mean?

194
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,600
I'm saying let us live properly.

195
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,420
You live your life happily,

196
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,340
and I will live properly as me.

197
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,560
Is the camera broken?

198
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,620
This one is from Jeonjoo.

199
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,560
Huh? Jeonjoo?

200
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,630
It was hard to find one that was made in the same year as the one you gave me.

201
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,820
Did you know it's the same model?

202
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,090
I feel a little proud of myself.

203
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,540
Seriously. What are you saying?

204
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,340
The only way to tell is for the expert to take a look. Stay right there.

205
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,810
I'll come over and look at it myself.

206
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,740
I'll show it to you at work tomorrow.

207
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,810
This is the worst.

208
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,190
If your dad showed you a present he bought you

209
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,800
but said, "Only look at it. Play with it tomorrow," how can you sleep?

210
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,500
I didn't say anything about giving it to you.

211
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,230
Ah.

212
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,750
What are you going to do with two of the same cameras?

213
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,710
Why do you keep making fun of me?

214
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,000
Because I like seeing your instant reaction when I make fun of you.

215
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,490
Fine. I guess you want to hurry up and see the camera.

216
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:58,910
Do you think I want to see the camera or you more?

217
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,720
- Where are you?
- At work.

218
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,430
Still?

219
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,050
I guess you're working overtime.

220
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,670
I guess the CEO should go there to cheer you on.

221
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,330
Then I guess I'll wait here.

222
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,620
Grilled beef small intestines

223
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,500
It's cooked well.

224
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,650
Try it with the sauce.

225
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,320
There are over a million things I like after having met you,

226
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,560
and one of those things is a mysterious experience.

227
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,790
Mysterious?

228
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,490
Chicken feet, chicken gizzard, beef tripe, they're all mysterious to me.

229
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,230
They're mysterious, but once you eat them... how should I put it, they feel familiar, right?

230
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,870
There's one thing you need to know.

231
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,610
I'm normally a very picky eater.

232
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:00,060
But whatever you ask to eat, I never say I can't, and I eat everything well.

233
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,340
Acknowledged. You're the best, seriously.

234
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,530
Here. Eat a lot.

235
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,890
Now, let's have a look.

236
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,530
There's no second half when it comes to tripe?

237
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,070
Really? You can keep going?

238
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,620
This is my first meal today.

239
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,810
- Excuse me, please mix the rice for us!
- Yes.

240
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,800
That's right. Fried rice is a perfect second half.

241
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,770
Come on, show it to me once before we eat fried rice.

242
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,550
We can't get any oil on it, though.

243
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,620
Wow, it's amazing.

244
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,330
It's the same model, so it's obviously going to look exactly the same,

245
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,520
but it's so strange.

246
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,540
Maybe because it's something that captures your emotions?

247
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,220
More like it's special since it contains all of my hard work and effort.

248
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,720
You must have had a hard time. Where did you find it?

249
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,970
It took a lot of effort. I'll tell you the details later.

250
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,990
I'll have to ask Secretary Jang later.

251
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,820
Aren't you mixing the rice?

252
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,390
You said you wanted to see me more than the camera.

253
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,660
Do you like seaweed on top of the rice?

254
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,270
- This much?
- A little more.

255
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,840
- Okay.
- That's good.

256
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,990
Eat a lot.

257
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,370
Whose phone number did you say? Section Chief Lee's number?

258
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,410
Yes.

259
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,350
When I checked the number Manager Nam gave me, it turned out to be Section Chief Lee's number.

260
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,190
Do you want me to call him in right away?

261
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,770
Leave it alone.

262
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,390
- You have proof now, so—
- It's not something we need to do in a hurry.

263
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,330
Thank you.

264
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,870
Yes.

265
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,030
Do you want to have some tea?

266
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,790
Green tea flavor.

267
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,210
If you eat one of these, it's the same as having a cup of tea.

268
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,230
It's not from Assistant Manager Park?

269
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,980
Assistant Manager Park likes eating things that kids like, so he doesn't like green tea flavor.

270
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,000
I came to discuss something serious, but now that I have candy in my mouth, it makes it not so serious.

271
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,500
Still, tell me about it.

272
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,510
If you don't, I won't be able to work all afternoon since I'll be curious.

273
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:13,810
I'm going to tell the Department Head that you're distracted and not doing your job.

274
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,360
Hah! You're the one who asked me to come.

275
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,170
Fine. Here.

276
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,920
Someone did something very wrong toward me,

277
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,170
so let's say that I had a hard time because of it.

278
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,430
But I found out who that person was.

279
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,060
What would be the best thing to do?

280
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:44,090
If it were me, I would forgive at least once if they apologize.

281
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,760
Since everyone wavers at least once.

282
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,700
The answer is obvious since I asked someone who has a big heart.

283
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,960
It makes you feel better to accept if they apologize.

284
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,280
If you forgive, that person will probably feel horrible from then on.

285
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,000
Seriously.

286
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,140
What does that make me? I was worrying over it all morning.

287
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,880
I wonder why you were so worried over it.

288
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,400
Maybe... there's nothing I need to apologize for, right?

289
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,730
Huh? You're making it feel strange.

290
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,760
This is that thing where you're supposed to figure out what you did wrong, right?

291
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,890
- I guess you're guilty about something.
- No. That's why this is making me feel anxious.

292
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,460
- You're anxious because there is something.
- That's not it.

293
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,570
To be honest, all morning while I was working,

294
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,930
I thought about you more than I thought about my work. So I feel guilty.

295
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,490
Sorry if that's wrong of me.

296
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,430
Well, go ahead and tell the Department Head on me.

297
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,230
I guess you're just a model employee.

298
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,550
There's no award for a model employee?

299
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,040
- You did well.
- Something other than this.

300
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,180
Like what?

301
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,360
Something like this.

302
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,880
Hey! You stand out even if you don't lift your hand up like that.

303
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,340
Wow, your company is really nice.

304
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,480
- What are you here for?
- Huh?

305
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,740
Well, I was just passing by.

306
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,620
- Let's eat together.
- I already ate.

307
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,730
What? What did you eat that early?

308
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,870
Then let's go have a cup of coffee at least.

309
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,200
Alright, alright.

310
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,280
- Did you have some business to take care of nearby?
- What?

311
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,050
What business would I have here when I run a whelks restaurant?

312
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,460
I came to see what your place of work looks like.

313
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,170
You come by my place of work all the time.

314
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,760
Why are you calling it a place of work? It's a hotel, a hotel!

315
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,330
- My mistake. Well, they're both in the service industry.
- Ah, seriously.

316
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,140
I came because I missed you. Since you don't come by at all these days.

317
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,080
Your heart just pounded, didn't it?

318
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,300
Ah, that was a good line.

319
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,200
Here. Drink up.

320
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,650
Wh-what is this?

321
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,080
It's my heart.

322
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,090
Wait, how can I eat this when it's so pretty?

323
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,500
Stop by after work often.

324
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,250
Let's make sure we see each other.

325
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,440
It's good.

326
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,810
Goodness, just tell the truth. You didn't eat, did you?

327
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,560
I usually don't eat lunch.

328
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,440
Ah, I told you that you're ruining your insides if you do that.

329
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,090
Next time I come, I'll bring you a packed lunch.

330
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,410
Ah, you're such a player. You're a player.

331
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,700
You must really like it.

332
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,440
Have you decided what you're going to do about him?

333
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,660
I'll have to wait and see what he's thinking.

334
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,760
Should I go with you? Huh?

335
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,380
There are people who become dangerous when backed into a corner.

336
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,920
What is it that you want, CEO?

337
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,500
I'm not very interested in you, Section Chief Lee.

338
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,860
I'm just deeply interested in the one who caused this incident.

339
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:29,720
What do you want me to do?

340
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,520
I want you to reveal the whole story behind the incident, of course.

341
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,650
I'm not going to question the Business Team. I'm not going to force you to resign, either.

342
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:46,870
However, I'm hoping that you will step forward yourself

343
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,370
and reveal the entire truth behind the incident.

344
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,570
Come to the Board of Directors meeting and reveal everything.

345
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,990
And...

346
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,740
Please go to Cuba.

347
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,420
I will reassign you to the hotel in Cuba.

348
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,540
Why are you sending me there?

349
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:26,220
I'm hoping that you'll go there and find out

350
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,300
how valuable that hotel is to Donghwa Hotel's future.

351
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,770
Why aren't you reporting me?

352
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,800
Because anyone ...

353
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,300
could waver at least once.

354
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,920
I'm Kim Jin Hyeok from the Public Relations Team.

355
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,020
Department Head, one moment.

356
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:24,230
I heard that the photographer suddenly had to go to the ER due to stomach pains.

357
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,560
What in the world did he eat for lunch?

358
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,290
You're saying that he set everything up like this and suddenly got taken to the hospital?

359
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,510
Should I just the take the pictures in his place?

360
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,410
Well, we'll just have to delay the shooting then.

361
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,780
We have to do the shoot today for it to make it inside the magazine.

362
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,320
They said that the photographer is going to Jeju Island for a photo shoot next week.

363
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,420
If you look here...

364
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,950
What if Kim Jin Hyeok took the pictures?

365
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,580
Forget about that. This time I should personally do it.

366
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,170
Don't joke.

367
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:01,360
He's good at taking photos. He's been doing it since elementary school.

368
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:10,070
Kim Jin Hyeok is the one who set the concept for today's photo shoot, so wouldn't it be possible?

369
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,860
Yes, that's good.

370
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,100
Yes, good. Please move a little closer together.

371
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,450
Yes, that's good. Very good, very good.

372
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,270
Good. Yes.

373
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,190
Yes.

374
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,210
What? Is there a photo shoot?

375
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,700
Is it a celebrity? Hold on a second.

376
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,000
Yes.

377
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Please smile.

378
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,360
Yes, smile a little more.

379
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,630
Get a little closer together. That's good.

380
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,920
It's Kim Jin Hyeok. Look, it's Kim Jin Hyeok. It's Kim Jin Hyeok.

381
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,960
A little bit more.

382
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,900
Good. Yes, that's good. Yes.

383
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,870
Lower your gazes. Yes.

384
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,110
Yes, that's good. Look each other in the eye.

385
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:14,280
It'd be great to fall asleep like this everyday.

386
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:21,570
That day will come for us, right?

387
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,440
What? Why don't you answer?

388
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,130
Just imagining it, I like it.

389
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,660
One moment.

390
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,230
Why was Kim Jin Hyeok taking the pictures?

391
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,970
All brides look amazing when you put them in wedding dresses.

392
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,150
Well, but then again, there was a bride who was unrivaled.

393
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,430
Our CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's wedding shots were really—

394
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,020
Sorry.

395
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:27,520
What I really wanted to say was that they were amazingly beautiful.

396
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,330
- Kim Jin Hyeok, these pictures have a great feel to them.
- That's right.

397
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,300
- Thank you.
- Hye In was right.

398
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,950
It's probably because the equipment was good.

399
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,860
Goodness, you should acknowledge things that deserve to be acknowledged. You look seriously uncool.

400
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,750
- You're acting so pathetic.
- Please move it carefully so that the pot doesn't break.

401
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,510
About this bouquet, would it be possible to...

402
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,230
Were you working?

403
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,570
Yes. Did you eat dinner?

404
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,600
No. I wanted to eat with you.

405
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,360
I have something to show you.

406
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,160
Ta da!

407
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,110
Oh, isn't this a prop from the photo shoot earlier?

408
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,580
That's right. You saw me taking pictures, right?

409
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,090
The photographer suddenly had to be taken to the ER, so I ended up using the camera.

410
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,780
I was so nervous I broke into a cold sweat.

411
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,100
You did well, though.

412
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,720
Well, you know, I'm the—

413
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,750
You're what? The Hongje-dong photographer?

414
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,840
That's right. You're right.

415
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,750
The bouquet is pretty, isn't it? I asked them to give it to me and brought it here.

416
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,840
To give to me?

417
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,140
Why?

418
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,620
Here. Hold it.

419
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,270
- Why should I?
- So I can see it once.

420
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,900
While I was taking pictures of the model, I kept thinking that you'd be prettier.

421
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,020
I'd get fired if I brought you there and took pictures of you, right?

422
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,580
But I still wanted to get this shot.

423
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,690
I'm telling you, I thought about it a lot.

424
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,980
Come on, I'm being sincere.

425
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,100
You look really pretty.

426
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,500
Because beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

427
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:02,700
♫ When love shines in the two eyes looking at me ♫

428
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,560
Just like this.

429
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,760
Come to me like this.

430
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,580
♫ say I won't let go of the hand which was offered to me and  ♫

431
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:17,990
I can't even imagine it now.

432
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:22,340
Time without you...

433
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,830
is not time to me.

434
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:31,000
♫ Oh I know I belong to you ♫

435
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,160
Live together with me

436
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,070
for a long, long time.

437
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,450
♫  I'm looking at you like this lasts forever ♫

438
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:50,100
♫ Now I belong to you ♫

439
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:58,100
♫ Facing you my feeling only grows more and more intense ♫

440
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,800
♫ Always at a distance within my reach ♫

441
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,900
What is this? Why aren't you answering?

442
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,600
♫ I want to make you feel ♫

443
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Huh? Are you saying you don't want to?

444
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,100
♫ I'm always with you ♫

445
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,400
Oh, I should put these in a vase.
♫ I know ♫

446
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,400
♫ I belong to you ♫

447
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:28,700
♫ Hoping this dream wouldn't be broken ♫

448
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:37,340
♫ Now I belong to you ♫

449
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:46,440
♫ This feeling only grows more and more intense ♫

450
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,900
Alright.

451
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,200
You should have gone straight home after you got off work. Why did you come all the way here?

452
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,860
I'm getting some exercise.

453
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,120
Ah, thank you.

454
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,740
Take a rest!

455
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,220
Did she say anything?

456
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,670
I'm talking about the CEO. She didn't say anything about the food or anything?

457
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,450
She really loved it.

458
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:35,160
Because our house's atmosphere is always fun and bright like that, she's jealous.

459
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,160
I'm sure you also know this, but she really gathered up a lot of courage.

460
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,270
I was actually a little worried.

461
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:44,430
Different pictures of her with you came out.

462
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,600
I didn't know what was going on at the company, but then you were suddenly transferred to Sokcho.

463
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,800
When you got sent to Sokcho, I was actually angry.

464
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,030
Why would they send someone else's precious son all the way to Sokcho as soon as he entered the company?

465
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,740
The CEO's not the one who did that.

466
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,290
No matter who did it.

467
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,870
But my heart is more at ease now that you've come back home.

468
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,170
What is up with that? I'm talking about that Taegyeong or whatever it is.

469
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,520
Tons of articles came out about her not attending some memorial or something.

470
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,920
She must have predicted that all of that would happen, yet she came here.

471
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,800
That's why I'm so thankful and also regretful.

472
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,420
I was frustrated even when you asked me to support you,

473
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,730
but I decided to go all in and support you.

474
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,120
Thank you, Dad.

475
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,190
Ah, I was really worried.

476
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,700
I really like her,

477
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:43,220
and I can't even imagine living without her now.

478
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:49,100
But I was really worried that you and Mom wouldn't like her.

479
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,720
Thank you so much.

480
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,060
Of course. You put all of the fruit up.

481
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,650
Okay! I'll do it all!

482
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,700
Jang Soo Fruits

483
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,410
I'm back.

484
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,030
Oh, you're here? All right.

485
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,040
What? Should I give you something? Are you hungry?

486
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,210
No.

487
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,400
You must be tired. Hurry inside and get some sleep.

488
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,320
I have something to say.

489
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,620
Is it something urgent? I'm a little tired today.

490
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,470
You trust me, right, Mom?

491
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,790
Why are you asking so suddenly?

492
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:25,630
Aigo, I'm so tired today of all days.

493
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,170
Shall I give you a massage?

494
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,080
You're more tired than me.

495
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:37,110
Hurry and go wash up and sleep. I should go to bed early today.

496
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:54,520
It's D-Day. How will the votes regarding CEO Cha's reappointment turn out?

497
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,350
Isn't it corrupt if we know beforehand?

498
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,580
There's something called "predictable".

499
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,770
There are several directors who are already congratulating you before the voting.

500
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,650
I want to see a list of those directors.

501
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,070
Won't you see them at the celebration anyway?

502
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,670
Thank you for taking time to attend this meeting despite your busy schedules.

503
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,100
In order to carry out the voting regarding CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's reappointment,

504
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,890
I will give you a few...

505
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,430
Before you do that, there is an important matter that needs to be addressed.

506
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,680
Let's handle other matters after the voting.

507
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,780
It won't take long.

508
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,320
Come in.

509
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:15,060
First, I extend my apologies.

510
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:22,230
I was blinded for a moment and made a huge mistake.

511
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,670
I persuaded Manager Kim to cause the incident with the email for Cuba Hotel.

512
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,000
I told him to send an email that could cancel Cuba Hotel's construction and then resign.

513
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:41,190
- Wait, what is this?
- What is he saying?

514
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,950
Why did you do that?

515
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,040
It was under Director Choi Jin Cheul's orders.

516
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,510
- What?
- What did he say?
- That can't be. Director Choi?

517
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,890
Accordingly,

518
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,990
I demand an apology from Director Choi Jin Cheul.

519
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,790
If you really admit your fault and apologize sincerely,

520
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,370
then this issue will end here.

521
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,600
I think that this is slander against me, CEO Cha.

522
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,140
I'm giving you a chance.

523
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,900
If I'm the one who gave Section Chief Lee the orders,

524
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,700
then who do you think gave those orders to me?

525
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:39,500
Is it that difficult to say a single word of a sincere apology?

526
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,900
I was just a hired hand.

527
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,850
Who were you hired by?

528
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,450
I will follow the decision of CEO Jeong Woo Seok, Director Choi Jin Cheul,

529
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,320
and several other directors here.

530
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,820
I hope that you will also relay the results of the remaining issues to me as well.

531
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:33,870
This happened before I was appointed to this position, so the directors should handle this matter.

532
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:41,240
I think that it would be best to hold the meeting regarding her reappointment at another time.

533
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,350
Even though they tried to cover it up, I think the rumors have all spread by now.

534
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:00,650
What will Section Chief Lee do now?

535
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:03,470
He looked really haggard when I saw him this morning.

536
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,170
He's probably having a hard time himself.

537
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,380
The CEO is amazing.

538
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,640
I would have fired him right away if it were me.

539
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,060
How could she think of sending him to Cuba to be a team leader?

540
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,750
Someone committed a great wrong toward me.

541
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,740
Let's say that I suffered a lot because of that.

542
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,610
But then I found out who that person is.

543
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,620
What should I do?

544
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,240
What do you think will happen to Section Chief Lee?

545
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,040
I don't know.

546
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,890
Let's go back.

547
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:57,240
I thought I'd be here longer than you at least.

548
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,210
But you never know about life. It's amusing.

549
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:06,690
Don't feel relieved that this war is over just because I'm leaving.

550
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,970
He's unlikable to the very end.

551
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:17,710
Let's go.

552
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,810
Can I see you briefly?

553
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:43,130
Can you set aside some time tonight?

554
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,800
Why are you so sure that I don't have my own plans tonight?

555
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,950
Do you?

556
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,490
I don't. Why?

557
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,510
Let's eat.

558
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,970
Ah, where?

559
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,200
At my home.

560
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,800
Okay, then what do you want me to bring over as our menu?

561
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,880
Just come over. I'm thinking about making something tonight.

562
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,480
What?

563
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,250
Ask Manager Nam to come, too.

564
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:08,470
You both worked hard on the Choi case, so I should give you my thanks.

565
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,610
Let's just eat out.

566
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,330
Come around 8.

567
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,720
I was worried since I haven't seen you around much, so I came over.

568
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,830
You like zucchini pancakes.

569
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:25,430
It looks good. I was hungry.

570
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,190
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

571
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,400
You made it so well.

572
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,040
I can't make it crispy like this.

573
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,250
Excuse me, Jin Hyeok's mom.

574
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,010
Please get my son a job at that hotel.

575
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,490
I'm begging you like this.

576
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:05,160
Wait. Why would you ask such a thing of me?

577
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,630
To be honest, since he has a relationship with the CEO,

578
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,660
it must have been easy for him to get a job there.

579
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,610
Then where do I have to call to get in touch with the CEO?

580
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,470
I'm sorry, customer.

581
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:27,720
We are not able to put you through since we are not in charge of the CEO's office.

582
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,260
Do you have any other questions?

583
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,700
No. It's all right.

584
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,290
You're really a good cook. It's unexpected.

585
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:00,150
Leave it, and go and get some rest. It was a lot of work, right?

586
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:04,470
All I did was hand you the ingredients. You had a harder time.

587
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,810
Still.

588
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:11,700
Cooking and setting the table together like this,

589
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,980
it feels really special.

590
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:21,480
You cook well, too, and just too perfect.

591
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,140
When did you learn all this?

592
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,580
They should be here by now.

593
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,480
I'll call—

594
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:48,250
Thank you, Ahjussi. I took care of it well thanks to you.

595
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,500
I didn't do anything. I did well, though. Right?

596
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,910
Yes, thank you.

597
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,230
I acknowledge that you used to be a reporter.

598
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,060
I told you so many times and now you acknowledge it?

599
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,510
I'm the suspicious type.

600
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,570
Did you cook, too?

601
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,310
I just prepared the ingredients.

602
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,680
That takes more work.

603
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,550
That's the way it naturally is! Even if there is no salty food at the restaurant, you just peel the onions. While crying!

604
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,500
I guess this is the time for caring about each other. You worked hard, CEO.

605
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,370
Jin Hyeok, you had more work to do, right? I told you we should eat out!

606
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,090
It's my wish. You can't just go along with it?

607
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,490
What wish? This is your wish? Eating soybean paste stew? Rice and side dishes?

608
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,080
To me, it's more like a Korean Table d'hôte.
(a menu with only a few choices charged at a fixed total price)

609
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,410
I see. I hope you two live and eat well together.

610
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:29,430
Stop picking on them.

611
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,590
If you're jealous, get married.

612
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:33,120
Ah, let's eat.

613
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,280
Thank you for the meal.

614
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,480
Where to start...

615
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,280
It's good, huh?

616
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,310
But isn't the wish a little too small, Ahjussi?

617
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,890
It's not small.

618
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:53,250
To me, this is hard.

619
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,200
The food or us?

620
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,850
Eating a meal that I prepared and eating with those I care about.

621
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,680
To me, it was difficult.

622
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,490
So it can be my wish.

623
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,600
I was honestly a little hurt.

624
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,970
Why? About what?

625
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:20,070
This is the first time I've been here after the day she moved in.

626
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:22,700
It's not like she moved in a few days ago. It's been years.

627
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,700
And then saying, "You want to come eat?" Would you feel hurt or not?

628
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,220
I don't think I'd feel that hurt.

629
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,550
Asking him is 100% loss for you. You should have asked me instead.

630
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:36,080
Of course, you would be hurt. I should have invited you sooner.

631
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,890
Enjoy the food today and forgive me.

632
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:43,210
Well, I thought this day would never come. I'm happy.

633
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:46,190
You're changing too fast. Take your time.

634
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:49,630
Do you think she's changing? She's coming back to herself.

635
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:53,950
Don't call me over with Ahjussi. He nags way too much.

636
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:57,040
But don't you think you're too dressed down?

637
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,290
Since we're eating a home-cooked meal, shouldn't I dress down like this?

638
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,560
Give me a change of clothes so I can eat comfortably.

639
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,230
I'll give it to you. Eat first.

640
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,450
Then don't you have something for Ahjussi?

641
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:10,650
Do you think I'd be comfortable if I wore Soo Hyeon's clothes?

642
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:14,340
I'd like that.

643
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,330
Are you sure that she can't come because of work?

644
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:33,220
Dae Chan asked Secretary Jang to work in my place.

645
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:39,330
We can't tell yet.
(T.N.: Dad is watching a Baduk ("Go") match on television)

646
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,590
He does have to counter here.

647
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:50,030
But he chose to place his stone adjacent instead which means that he is choosing the two remaining spaces.

648
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,820
I see that, too.

649
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:58,250
Park Jeong Hwan is a professional baduk player representing our country.

650
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,920
He has studied immensely.

651
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,180
He has already studied most of patterns and has them under his belt.

652
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:10,790
Most players would panic under unexpected patterns like this.

653
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,770
Are you going somewhere?

654
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,280
Next door.

655
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,290
The tangerine syrup tastes good.

656
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,230
Come in, it's cold.
Chan's Whelks

657
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:28,870
It's all right. I have to leave soon.

658
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,710
Excuse me, Dae Chan.

659
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,730
Yes.

660
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:38,700
Could you give this to that secretary person?

661
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,080
- Secretary Jang?
- Yes.

662
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,300
What is it?

663
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:46,320
Ask her to give this to the CEO.

664
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,610
CEO?

665
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,870
Yes.

666
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:57,100
And please don't tell Jin Hyeok and Jin Myeong about this.

667
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,800
All right, I won't.

668
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,200
Go on in. It's cold.

669
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,770
Yes.

670
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:06,710
Chan's Whelks

671
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:19,810
Give me. I'll do it.

672
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:22,010
I did it all already.

673
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:34,250
So many things happened today. I'm tired.

674
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,830
This feels like my place, too. The whole house feels comfortable.

675
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:54,230
I thought your room looked comfortable. It looked cozy.

676
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:55,580
That's a good place, too.

677
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,640
It's small, so you have to stick together.

678
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,150
It doesn't feel like we're apart now.

679
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:12,480
You know that I'm very busy keeping my 10 centimeter distance from you, right?

680
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,220
I know.

681
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:18,210
You came early today and helped out a lot.

682
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,010
You're so reliable.

683
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:26,730
You say I'm reliable, but why aren't you giving me an answer?

684
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,920
What?

685
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:34,910
I asked you to live together with me for a long, long time.

686
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,990
But you avoided answering me.

687
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:07,010
♫ You can't start entering ♫

688
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:11,280
I'm very good at cooking Italian food.

689
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,640
You see? You're avoiding it again.

690
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,920
I can cook Chinese food, too.

691
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,990
I cook Japanese food some, too.

692
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:24,560
♫ Your sparkling eyes shine ♫

693
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,490
After I went to live in Taegyeong,

694
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,460
♫ and shake my heart ♫

695
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,820
I learned it all.

696
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:38,590
♫ The more I like you ♫

697
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:42,570
♫  The more I depend on you ♫

698
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,230
So what?

699
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:49,120
It's good that you can cook.

700
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,040
♫ The heart that is unwilling to depart ♫

701
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,520
Jin Hyeok.

702
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:00,510
After I went to your house,

703
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:03,230
I keep having dreams.

704
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:08,900
I want to be happy together in that house, too.

705
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,900
That will happen.

706
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,530
I keep getting held back

707
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:25,310
by my memories and my past.

708
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:35,180
I want to hold a pretty bouquet like that

709
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,560
and stand in front of you, too.

710
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:43,200
But... I'm not sure

711
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,760
if that's really something I'm allowed to dream about.

712
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,540
♫ My feelings won't stop ♫

713
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:53,380
I feel like I'm being too greedy,

714
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:57,630
so I'm kind of sad.
♫ My heart will never ever ♫

715
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:01,920
♫ go to you ♫

716
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:29,520
I met a woman in Cuba,

717
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:34,450
and I didn't even know her name or what kind of person she was.

718
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:39,810
But the day that I first met her,

719
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:46,310
I thought, "Does this woman possibly have a boyfriend?"

720
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,070
"I hope she doesn't have one."

721
00:58:55,730 --> 00:59:02,500
Cha Soo Hyeon, you're the woman from that day.

722
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:11,610
You're the first person to enter deeply into my heart.

723
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,620
Your past isn't that important to me.

724
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:24,550
♫  I can't hide anywhere ♫

725
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:27,500
Because I love one person, Cha Soo Hyeon.

726
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,720
♫  Is this what they have been calling love? ♫

727
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,560
With that one person,

728
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:40,740
I want to be together every single day.
♫ And it just goes on Oh take me on to you ♫

729
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:43,510
I look forward to it every day.

730
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,430
♫  You're my flower and I'm your bee ♫

731
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:53,360
♫  You know you keep me alive ♫

732
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,790
Can we do that?

733
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,530
♫  You’re my reasons for everything I do  ♫

734
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,870
You're going to let us do that, right?

735
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,290
♫  The other half of me ♫

736
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:07,310
I will do that.

737
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:13,990
♫ Oh take me on down on a river  ♫

738
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:18,590

♫  Oh take me on into your arms ♫

740

♫  I'll go wherever world you’re on ♫

741
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:01,350
Please preserve these flowers.

742
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:04,020
Preserve? What is that?

743
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:08,750
I heard that you could treat them with a special solution so that they won't wither.

744
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,360
Oh, I think I've heard of that.

745
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,040
Give it to me.

746
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,100
What is it?

747
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:20,590
Kim Jin Hyeok's mother told me to give this to you.

748
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:25,560
I didn't get it from her personally. The boss of Chan's Whelks gave it to me.

749
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,190
Yes.

750
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,990
I'm sorry for contacting you so suddenly.

751
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:54,710
I was wondering if there was a way that we could meet with each other.

752
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,600
Please call me at this phone number.

753
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,080
You must be busy. I'm sorry.

754
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:28,090
You were really surprised that I got in touch with you suddenly, weren't you?

755
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:31,930
No. I enjoyed the tangerine syrup that you sent me.

756
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,660
Thank you.

757
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,330
Yes.

758
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:09,260
Um... I'm not good at beating around the bush.

759
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:12,150
Please speak comfortably.

760
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:20,380
CEO, I am sorry.

761
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,160
Sorry.

762
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:32,990
Please break up with our Jin Hyeok.

763
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:41,120
Our next door neighbor came to me.

764
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:45,830
She asked me to get her son hired at Donghwa Hotel.

765
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:50,300
I sent her away because it was such an absurd request,

766
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,480
but all of my neighbors are saying this.

767
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,620
They're saying that he didn't make it into the company normally.

768
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:06,880
That it's because he's with you that he got into the company.

769
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,590
But my Jin Hyeok didn't get into the company like that. Right?

770
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:22,150
I've ended up having to live my life explaining something that's so obviously true.

771
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:36,870
CEO. You're really upset too, aren't you?

772
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:44,410
I want my family to continue living quietly

773
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:48,450
and happily, as we are now.

774
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:52,880
If someone in such a high station as you is with our Jin Hyeok...

775
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:01,250
And you aren't going to marry our Jin Hyeok, right?

776
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,670
People don't all get married just because they've dated.

777
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,390
But, CEO.

778
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:17,910
You and our Jin Hyeok are very different.

779
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:26,100
Because I'm so lacking,

780
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:32,490
I'm anxious and my insides are being burned to a crisp.

781
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:38,860
I'm worried that my child will just get hurt if this continues.

782
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:43,000
I'm worried that he'll be talked about by people for a long time.

783
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,970
I'm scared to death.

784
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:56,130
CEO. I'm sorry.

785
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:58,420
I'm really sorry.

786
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:02,510
Please, please, with our Jin Hyeok...

787
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:06,330
Please break up with our Jin Hyeok.

788
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:44,450
♫ When the door opens, you whom I love come to me ♫

789
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:50,430
I can't even imagine my days without you now.

790
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:55,500
Live together with me for a long, long time.

791
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,870
I love you, Cha Soo Hyeon.

792
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,950
♫  A fairy tale where I dance holding you ♫

793
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:12,070
♫ While I spend such a day with you ♫

794
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:19,610
♫ I don't want to wake up from that fairytale-like dream ♫

795
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:30,450
♫ I don't want to wake up and leave from here ♫

796
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:38,250
♫ I want to dream and hold you a little longer ♫

797
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:44,670
♫ It seems if I wake up these many stories ♫

798
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:48,920
♫ will all disappear.  ♫

799
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:53,760
Encounter Preview 
♫  While I'm thinking that.  ♫

800
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,210
I treasure the CEO greatly.

801
01:07:56,210 --> 01:08:00,840
How long will this flower last without withering?

802
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:03,750
Why? I'm just saying it because I'm envious.

803
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:07,550
It didn't happen because of you, so don't misunderstand.

804
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:12,910
If the ordinary happiness of Jin Hyeok's family is shaken because of me,

805
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:15,240
there's no answer for that.

806
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,530
I learned this thanks to you, Woo Seok.

807
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:18,390
Jin Hyeok

808
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:21,170
How I should break up with someone.
