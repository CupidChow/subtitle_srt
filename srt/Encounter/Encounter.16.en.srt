1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,580
Encounter

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,290
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,840
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,060
Boyfriend

5
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,140
You haven’t left work yet?

6
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,410
I’m about to leave work.

7
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,560
I understand you.

8
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,560
I totally understand why you broke up with me.

9
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,140
Manager Nam is waiting.

10
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,110
Hear me out before you leave.

11
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,490
I…

12
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,620
can’t break up with you.

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,940
Jin Hyeok.

14
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,240
You… You can do whatever you want to do.

15
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,940
But don't expect me to do the same.

16
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,380
I will keep my promise.

17
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,430
Every single thing that I’ve said to you, every promise...

18
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,700
I will keep.

19
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,870
You're making a difficult decision.

20
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,470
I know it's difficult. But you should know this…

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,520
You may break up with me.

22
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,630
But I will continue loving you.

23
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,870
Let's make another bet

24
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,280
and see if your break up will win or my love will win.

25
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:38,100
♫ My heart is filled fully by you ♫

26
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:44,170
♫ There is still a lot I want to tell you ♫

27
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:52,360
♫  I don't want to wake up and leave from here ♫

28
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,580
Go home safely.

29
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,920
♫ I want to dream and hold you a little longer ♫

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,870
I'll see you tomorrow.

31
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:06,020
♫  If I wake up it seems these many stories  ♫

32
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,860
♫  will all disappear, while I am thinking that. ♫

33
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:20,560
♫ Sometimes I imagine I'm somewhere you're not ♫

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,460
♫ I'm scared as though my body will freeze up ♫

35
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,020
♫ There is no such day for me. ♫

36
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,710
♫ My day on which you abandon me ♫

37
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,900
You can do what you want to do. But don't expect me to do the same.

38
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,690
I can't break up with you.

39
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:52,470
♫  At any time I will stay there like this ♫

40
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,500
Final Episode

41
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,040
Seeing you ask to use the darkroom,

42
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,470
I can see that you are uneasy about something.

43
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,530
Did you two break up, after all?

44
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,700
I thought a lot about if breaking up is the right thing for me to do, for her sake.

45
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,600
That doesn't seem to be the solution.

46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,150
But... why is your face like that?

47
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,290
Because I can't see how she is doing,

48
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,730
which makes me worry.

49
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,450
I'm going to go tend to my vegetable garden now.

50
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,490
So take your time in the darkroom.

51
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,420
♫ The morning sunrise, it takes me away ♫

52
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:01,230
♫ As I am staring at the light you hold ♫

53
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,210
♫ The feeling of adore.  ♫

54
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,960
♫  Oh take me on to you ♫

55
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,540
♫ When the light of yours shines down so beautiful ♫

56
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,380
♫ I laugh, I sing, with you ♫

57
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,970
♫ When I see you it's like when the stars fall around you ♫

58
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,460
♫ You take my heart away ♫

59
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,370
♫ Oh take me on ♫

60
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,030
♫ down on river ♫

61
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,970
♫ I'll go wherever it leads to you ♫

62
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,440
♫ Oh take me on into your arms ♫

63
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,060
♫ I'll go wherever world you’re on ♫

64
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,060
There she is! Here she comes!

65
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,350
Is it true that you directly accepted funds from Taegyeong Group?

66
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,270
Did Donghwa Hotel CEO, Cha Soo Hyeon, know?

67
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,800
Please answer. Please comment.

68
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,380
Please give us just one comment. Did Taegyeong Group try to politically influence...

69
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,470
Please respond.

70
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,200
Please answer.

71
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,590
It seems Assemblyman Cha's wife

72
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,000
appeared at the prosecutor's office.

73
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,610
She's coming! She's coming!

74
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,140
Assemblyman Cha Jong Hyeon's wife Jin Mi Ok who acknowledged receiving bribes from Taegyeong Group

75
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,900
has just left the prosecutor's office after a very lengthy interrogation.

76
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,920
She acknowledged that in 2008, during Assemblyma Cha Jong Hyeon's campaign,

77
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,760
at a suite room in the Sunrise Hotel, she received illegal campaign funds

78
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,700
from Chairman Kim Hwa Jin of Taegyeong Group.

79
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,680
(Banner) Cha Jong Hyeon's wife Jin Mi Ok revealed to have accepted illegal campaign funds.

80
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,850
Yes.

81
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,480
Dad, are you at home? I'm coming.

82
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,170
No. Don't come. The press is outside.

83
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,960
Your mom will come home soon. Don't worry.

84
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,670
Still, Dad...

85
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:11,270
Soo Hyeon, things are finally being set right.

86
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,520
It's nothing to feel sad about.

87
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
Take care.

88
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,050
Yes.

89
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,900
Taegyeong Group is absolutely denying all charges regarding this incident
Sunrise Hotel Manager's Decisive Information.

90
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,740
but the former Sunrise Hotel Manager, surname Im, has provided decisive information.

91
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,480
So Assemblyman Cha Jong Hyeon's arrest

92
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,460
and Chairman Kim Hwa Jin's appearance at the prosecutor's office appears imminent...

93
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,910
Assemblyman Cha's Wife's Response to Questions After Her Interrogation...Silence

94
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,000
Soo Hyeon

95
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,200
Jin Hyeok

96
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,100
Missed Call

97
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,680
You made this yourself?

98
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,840
Have some breakfast.

99
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,090
How nice. Let's eat together.

100
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,920
Quickly, Ahjussi. I have to see my dad's face.

101
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,650
Yes, Mr. Park.

102
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,120
Ah, really? Yeah.

103
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,250
Ahjussi.

104
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,870
Soo Hyeon.

105
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,840
Your father has been arrested.

106
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,000
What should I do? I didn't even get to see Dad's face.

107
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,150
In custody. Our CEO's father was arrested.

108
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,100
- Did he really get arrested?
- That's what I'm saying.

109
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,720
What to do?

110
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,470
Oh no.

111
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,130
Moonhwa Party's Cha Jong Hyeon finally gets arrested!

112
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,640
Soo Hyeon,

113
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,570
you're scared, aren't you?

114
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't cry too much.

115
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,110
There are people who love you.

116
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,710
Don't forget how we feel about you.

117
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,910
Everything will be alright.

118
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,400
Did you eat?

119
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,450
The people from the prosecutor's office came by.

120
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,680
Your father had just started eating.

121
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,900
It would have been nice if he could at least have finished eating before he left.

122
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,520
It was my first time cooking, today.

123
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,190
I resent your father so much.

124
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,330
You have to be strong, Mom.

125
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,900
If he goes on trial, things will be a lot more difficult.

126
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,800
You resent me too, don't you?

127
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Mom,

128
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,880
I didn't know that you'd do what Dad wanted and step forward.

129
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:19,670
I thought that I should act like a mother for once.

130
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,290
I am not emotional.

131
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,250
I'm still regretting it a hundred times over.

132
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,390
Let's go on a trip when the trial ends, Mom.

133
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,860
Do things like that suit our family?

134
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,710
Just protect the hotel well.

135
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,450
Your father claims that he did it because of his conscience as a politician,

136
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,630
but he did it to protect you from Taegyeong.

137
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,330
Dad isn't here. Will you be okay alone here by yourself?

138
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,850
I'll give you a hotel room.

139
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,450
It's all too bothersome.

140
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,530
I hate being seen by others.

141
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,990
And you know that I'm spiteful.

142
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,540
So would I die? Leave.

143
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,310
Mom.

144
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:20,420
There are times like this. Even when we're having a hard time and suffering,

145
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,590
we say, "It's okay. Everything will be alright."

146
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,150
"Let's be strong."

147
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,780
It would be nice if you would say that.

148
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,830
What meaning would such useless words have?

149
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,760
Let's practice that, too. I found that everyone does that as they go through life.

150
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,500
Even if it feels awkward and useless,

151
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,740
let's practice it as we live.

152
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,450
You should eat a lot of lunch. It's my treat today, for once.

153
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,200
I enjoyed it.

154
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,520
And I am paying for the coffee for once, so drink it all and don't leave any behind.

155
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,650
While you leave yours untouched?

156
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,230
Can't you tell me the truth?

157
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,170
There's nothing going on, though.

158
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,690
Do you think I don't know you? I'm still your friend.

159
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,250
But I don't know anything about what's going on with you.

160
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,670
It's just because I can't help the CEO.

161
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,760
She probably feels that you're helping her just by being by her side.

162
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,870
I want to be by her side.

163
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,400
Something happened with the CEO and you, didn't it?

164
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,240
She said we should break up.

165
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,170
She said she can't be with me because she's worried that I'll have a hard time.

166
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,660
You must be hurting.

167
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,330
She's hurting more than I am.

168
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,070
What's that?

169
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,060
You don't remember this, do you? You picked it for me.

170
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,050
I did?

171
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,630
What do you think about this one? Does the color stand out too much?

172
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,200
It's pretty. It'll be easy to see because it's bright. I was looking at this one.

173
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,950
Really? We were on the same page.

174
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,280
You still have that?

175
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,510
I'll tell you something funny.

176
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,780
When I bought this,

177
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,650
I actually didn't really like this color.

178
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,360
I had passed on it, but then you came and asked me what I thought about it.

179
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,540
I thought, I should also buy this.

180
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,800
I think I thought that? In any case, I usually don't like bright colors like this.

181
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,660
It's funny, right?

182
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,880
Sometimes I write my diary in here... No, not a diary.

183
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,420
Sometimes I just write memos in it.

184
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,380
Jin Hyeok.

185
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,960
It's a bit embarrassing,

186
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,240
but I liked you.

187
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,100
So, while I wrote things in here, I wondered when I should tell you.

188
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,740
I wondered when you would realize how I felt.

189
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,210
But then the scandal with the CEO came out

190
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,930
and you had a really good relationship with her.

191
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,290
It must have been annoying to come in to work.

192
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,430
It was super annoying.

193
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,650
But then I had this thought.

194
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:22,290
"Did I really like you?

195
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,500
Or did I like the times that I liked you?"

196
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,990
When I saw you going full speed ahead after the CEO,

197
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,160
I thought about things from your perspective.

198
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,250
I think I just liked you. But I don't think that I loved you.

199
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,520
I don't know what I should say.

200
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,310
What would you say?

201
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:00,090
Jin Hyeok. You're a great person.

202
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,900
You're as great of a person as the CEO is.

203
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,170
So I'm supporting your feelings.

204
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,440
Hye In.

205
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,710
Thank you for liking me.

206
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,640
It's better than saying that you're sorry that you didn't know how I felt.

207
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,800
It's less embarrassing.

208
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,310
It was not the time for me to say that.

209
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,550
I told you, don't apologize.

210
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,420
I made a huge decision to tell you this

211
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,980
because I don't want you to end things with the CEO like that.

212
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,580
That won't happen.

213
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,110
Ah, it's all cold.

214
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,680
That happened because you confessed.

215
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,560
I'm not confessing. I'm turning myself in.

216
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,270
Did you commit a sin? Why would you call it turning yourself in?

217
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,700
I know, right? Should I call it coming clean?

218
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,960
That's the same thing.

219
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,640
It's refreshing.

220
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,440
I had a feeling.

221
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,730
Then it's been a while. Why didn't you tell me earlier that they broke up?

222
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,560
I thought that you'd heard about it from Kim Jin Hyeok.

223
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,360
I don't think Jin Myeong knows, either.

224
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,030
Why did you want to see me today?

225
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,270
It's a bit hard to say this because the atmosphere is like it is.

226
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,200
What is this?

227
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,650
I bought this because I thought of you when I passed by it.

228
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,260
I'm allergic to metals, though.

229
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,740
Goodness. This is real gold, 14k.

230
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,080
- Do you not like the design?
- It's my style.

231
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,740
Look at that, I paid careful attention.

232
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,590
You wear this style a lot.

233
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,140
I will not accept this.

234
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,080
It's gold, though.

235
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,390
Lee Dae Chan, you know that everyone has different viewpoints. Right?

236
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,010
Not everyone can be the same.

237
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,820
Of course. Everyone is different.

238
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,190
I'm sorry that I end up saying

239
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,650
words that I'm sorry for.

240
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,330
Just speak comfortably. It's okay.

241
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,570
There are standards that I've had in mind.

242
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,720
Some people transcend those things and dive into another world and experience true love and all that.

243
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,700
But I'm not that kind of person. I'm very realistic.

244
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,160
And if someone doesn't meet my standards, I hit the brakes. That is who I am.

245
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,250
I've had fun and my heart has fluttered while I've been dating you,

246
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,900
but it looks like these damn brakes are working again.

247
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,670
That's completely possible.

248
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,490
But it's not bad.

249
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,970
Thank you for thinking that way.

250
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,900
Can't you just take this? It stands out too much for me to wear it.

251
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,910
- Just return it.
- Return it?

252
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,270
Let's just throw this away, then. Just throw it away. Well ...

253
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,030
A present is a present. Did I ask you to take this and live with me?

254
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,050
Let's just throw this away. Throw it away.

255
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,070
You're saying throw it away?

256
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,220
Think of it as a friendship gift

257
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,930
and just accept it.

258
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,860
Let's do that.

259
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,810
Do you want to have a glass of beer?

260
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,410
Shall we have a glass in the name of friendship?

261
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,850
Deal!

262
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,800
Jin Hyeok.

263
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,670
Mom, why are you here? It's cold.

264
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,780
How long have you been out here? You're all frozen.

265
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,990
I felt stuffy, so I came out for a walk.

266
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,270
Let's go home. It's cold.

267
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,580
Jin Hyeok.

268
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,520
Seriously.

269
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,290
Your body is totally frozen, Mom.

270
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,550
Honestly ...

271
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,840
Honestly, I have to tell you something.

272
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,850
Mom.

273
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,940
I heard everything.

274
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,940
Especially what you and Dad talked about.

275
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,620
Even still, you acted as if you didn't know.

276
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,820
At first, I was confused and heart-broken, but

277
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,320
I thought, "I can understand how Mom can feel this way."

278
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,920
You must resent me.

279
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,140
No, you can do something like that.

280
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,400
Because you might not know

281
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,060
how much I love her.

282
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,310
Or what kind of meaning she holds in my life.

283
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,420
How much do you love her?

284
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,320
What meaning does she have in your life?

285
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:01,400
I love her as much as I love you, Dad, and Jin Myeong.

286
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,740
She told me to break up.

287
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:15,850
But it seems she broke up with me because she was worried about you.

288
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,090
She said that our simple home

289
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,630
was priceless, that beautiful masterpiece.

290
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:28,260
She said she was afraid that it might be destroyed because of her.

291
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,770
So she said to break up.

292
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,810
I ...

293
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,180
I am sorry. What could I do ...

294
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,690
Your feeling is love and her feeling is love, too.

295
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,260
So, Mom ...

296
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,290
I will somehow protect both loves.

297
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:57,790
Until you understand, until she is free from feeling guilty...

298
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,680
I'm going to wait. In my place.

299
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,680
I guess I was ...

300
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,240
a little scared.

301
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,650
I told your father that I was scared of you getting hurt, but...

302
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,350
Honestly, I guess I was very scared.

303
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,000
My baby... Your mom...

304
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,180
It's okay to hate me.

305
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:42,290
I love you, Mom.

306
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:23,520
I won't break up with you.

307
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,240
Let's make another bet.

308
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,690
Let's see if your break up will win or my love will win.

309
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,170
Conference Room

310
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:08,400
Well, with the scandal surrounding Assemblyman Cha, will the hotel image be okay?

311
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,510
I'm not sure.

312
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,940
The number of guests at the hotel have increased.

313
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,170
I'm less concerned about the hotel and more concerned about the CEO.

314
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,560
How upset she must be, with her father in prison.

315
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,140
Let's see how we're doing with the wedding promotion.

316
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:29,860
Here. I know we originally said we'd do one page, but they requested additional pictures so we're planning two pages.

317
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,790
It turned out well. Let's focus on work and not be distracted.

318
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,680
And who is working on the video for the anniversary of the opening?

319
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,100
Deputy Park edited it, and I'm working on the music.

320
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,810
My editing was a work of art.

321
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,760
- Truly a work of art?
- As always, of course.

322
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,420
Enjoy your meal.

323
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,030
I skipped breakfast since you said you would buy me lunch.

324
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,250
Gosh, you two really love ramyun.

325
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,960
Next time I'll buy you bindae ddeok.
(Bindae ddeok is mung bean vegetable pancakes)

326
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,760
I'm just joking. Anything you buy me is fine.

327
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,820
She should have put in some ddeok, though.
(Ddeok is sticky rice cake)

328
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,450
I... CEO's father...

329
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,220
I'm worried about how he is doing.

330
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,400
Well, he's eating and surviving. It's his mind I'm worried about, of course.

331
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,030
If you happen to see him,

332
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,360
please tell him that he doesn't have to worry about CEO.

333
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:32,180
So, no matter what news he hears, just think of it as part of the process.

334
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,990
Oh. About Soo Hyeon breaking up with you?

335
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:40,810
You understand why CEO Cha decided that, right?

336
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:47,400
CEO Cha is always like that. She thinks it's right for her to endure for the sake of others.

337
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,800
So even if you are having a hard time with it...

338
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,260
It's part of the process. The process of everything turning out well.

339
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,530
Right. We must believe that.

340
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:01,620
But honestly, this is hard for you, right? Since Soo Hyeon is like a brick wall.

341
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,490
I'm okay. Because I will win.

342
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,050
That's right. Who knows what you will win, but let's be happy.

343
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,750
Of course. There's no such thing as "sad" in my life.

344
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,720
So, Manager Nam...

345
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,540
- Kim Jin Hyeok.
- I'm only going to drive.

346
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,680
I'm not here to put you in a difficult position.

347
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,030
- Jin Hyeok, I—
- I'm not here to change your mind about anything.

348
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,110
I have no intention of giving you a hard time.

349
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:51,530
I just wanted to take you home comfortably. Just let me do that.

350
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,200
Shall we go?

351
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:21,900
When I sit here, I understand how Manager Nam feels.

352
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,130
Thank you.

353
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,330
Here.

354
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:56,160
It's not a ring. It really is film.

355
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,850
These are photos I really wanted you to see.

356
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,490
I'm sorry, but you should just keep it.

357
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,940
You have it.

358
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,170
There is a Cha Soo Hyeon that only you don't know here.

359
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,490
♫ The morning sunrise  ♫

360
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,900
♫  It takes me away  ♫

361
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,260
♫ As I am staring at ♫

362
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,290
♫ the light you hold  ♫
"If the wave is the work of the ocean..." by Kim Yeon Soo

363
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,540
♫  The feeling of adore ♫

364
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,850
♫  Oh take me onto you ♫

365
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,490
♫ I can't hide anywhere  ♫

366
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,320
♫  I followed to your dream ♫

367
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,700
♫ Is this what they have been calling love  ♫

368
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,710
♫  And it just goes on ♫

369
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,560
She became just like she looks in here.

370
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,280
♫ You're my flower and I'm your bee  ♫

371
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,460
♫ You know you keep me alive  ♫

372
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,630
♫ You're my reasons for everything I do  ♫

373
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:15,190
♫  The other half of me ♫

374
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,030
♫  Oh take me on ♫

375
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,830
♫  Down on river ♫

376
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:26,480
♫ I'll go where ever it leads to you  ♫

377
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,520
♫  Oh take me on  ♫

378
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,150
♫ Into your arms  ♫

379
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:39,670
♫ I'll go wherever world you’re on  ♫

380
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,250
Mom, did you go grocery shopping? It's been so long since we had these.

381
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,950
- It's delicious!
- It's too salty. Eat it with rice.

382
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,230
- I'm going to wash up.
- How can you put it back after you bit into it?

383
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,490
Did something happen? She prepared a lot of dishes.

384
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,620
CEO.

385
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,630
You are probably having a tough time these days,

386
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,520
so to have me also want to meet you is uncomfortable, right?

387
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,550
No, it's alright.

388
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,110
You came all the way here.

389
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,930
I think I have made a mistake.

390
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:18,400
Jin Hyeok said that he loves me

391
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,430
and that he also loves you.

392
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,530
So he said that he's going to protect both those loves.

393
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,140
It concerns the feelings of you two,

394
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,630
but my worries got ahead of me.

395
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,740
No, it's not your fault.

396
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,010
It's because of me.

397
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,020
Mother.

398
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:48,140
If I broke up with him because of your words,

399
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,340
I would have visited you every day and begged you

400
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,380
to please accept our relationship.

401
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:02,090
The reason that I made my decision is because what you were worried about

402
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:07,620
is also something that I'm also fearful of.

403
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,670
I really like Jin Hyeok.

404
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:18,700
Because I like him, the tough things that I endured...

405
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,260
I wished that he also wouldn't have to endure that.

406
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,750
It's not your fault.

407
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,270
Jin Hyeok's words are right.

408
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:38,990
And for me, I broke up with him because this too is love.

409
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,140
Don't concern yourself over this.

410
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:56,700
Because it seemed like our homemade food suited your taste.

411
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,730
You must have a lot of worries because of your father's case.

412
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,120
I wish that you would at least eat well.

413
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:21,110
It would be nice if you came by some day to have a meal again.

414
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,170
Then...

415
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,520
Thank you.

416
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,310
Jin Hyeok

417
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,680
Did you eat dinner?

418
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,250
As I got off of work, I saw the sky.

419
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,140
The moon is quite pretty.

420
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,990
How about eating something?

421
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:02,590
When you leave here, it'll be harder for you to eat.

422
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,900
To me, that girl's eyes always made me uncomfortable.

423
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:14,540
Her words and actions were always obedient.

424
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,960
However,

425
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,640
those eyes always bothered me.

426
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:30,530
How should I put it? In Cha Soo Hyeon's eyes, Taegyeong's strength, worth, dignity...

427
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,140
I saw no envy of any of these things.

428
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,160
That always concerned me.

429
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,270
I hated her.

430
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,090
For you ...

431
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,330
that is why you hated her.

432
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,390
As for me,

433
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,160
that's why I felt sorry towards Soo Hyeon.

434
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,680
In the end, she hit our vulnerable spots. The Cha Soo Hyeon who is nothing.

435
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,090
The investigation may take long. I will stay waiting in close proximity.

436
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,960
Do you think I prepared a lawsuit just for that Donghwa Hotel?

437
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,870
The Cha Soo Hyeon who used to just breathe has changed.

438
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,960
Sometimes when I look at her, she even seems alright.

439
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:32,340
The one who made Cha Soo Hyeon change like that

440
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,320
is not Taegyeong's heir.

441
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:43,250
To see that it was some neighborhood fruit seller's son,

442
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:47,070
that offends me over and over.

443
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,910
Lawsuit? I've done even worse things than that.

444
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,990
Mother, just think of yourself now.

445
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,730
Everyone else is finding their place now.

446
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,950
What about you?

447
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:09,160
Where is your place?

448
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,940
It's to protect you and Taegyeong.

449
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,670
Don't worry about anything.

450
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,870
CEO.

451
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,360
From the prosecutor's office, people are...

452
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,780
Tell them that we are escorting her out.

453
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,070
- She's here!
- She's here!

454
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,220
- What are your feelings right now?
- Are you acknowledging the charges?

455
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:27,910
- Chairwoman Kim Hwa Jin, please say something!
- Please give a statement!

456
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,700
- Just one word, please!
- Say something!

457
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,880
Taegyeon's Chairwoman Kim Hwa Jin appears at Prosecutor's office.

458
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:03,010
This day has eventually come. Ah, I feel so relieved.

459
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,500
This is the best part.

460
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,350
Can we leave now?

461
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,220
Ah, right!

462
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,420
Alright. How is Mom doing?

463
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,380
Manager Nam and I frequently visit her.

464
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,350
I guess it's still hard for her to come outside.

465
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,100
Make sure you take good care of her.

466
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,770
What about you? It's cold. Is it endurable?

467
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,680
Ah, I'm doing well. I'm eating all three meals.

468
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:41,680
And I'm reading all the books that I've put off reading before.

469
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,230
Tell me the books that you want to read. I'll send them to you.

470
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,800
I heard you broke up with him.

471
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,080
What happened?

472
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,040
Dad...

473
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:02,340
Being next to me and watching me go through struggles, how did it feel?

474
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:08,020
Somehow I feel you had a more difficult time than I did.

475
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,560
It was very upsetting.

476
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,920
You did come along because this was the road that I've chosen.

477
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,550
But you gradually lost your smile.

478
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:26,640
So... I worry that the same would happen to Jin Hyeok or his family.

479
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:35,570
Do you know what kind of thoughts that I have most while I'm here?

480
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:40,340
I thought that I lived very diligently.

481
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,830
However, no one was happy.

482
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:47,500
You, your mother, and me too.

483
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:53,550
I know your heart that puts other people first.

484
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:57,360
But if you are questioned about the root of it all,

485
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,080
you need to examine yourself.

486
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:07,550
Do you think that you can really live your whole life thinking that way?

487
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:20,210
Teacher, I was wondering if the CEO came to the darkroom.

488
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:26,090
No, she didn't... Should I contact you when she does come?

489
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:29,660
No. I'm sorry for calling you at such a late hour.

490
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,740
Get some rest.

491
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,710
Yes, alright.

492
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,930
Help me.

493
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:08,650
Please get me my shoes.

494
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:17,970
♫ I'm living next to you ♫

495
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:25,330
♫ I will never lose you ♫

496
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:33,150
♫ to anyone ♫

497
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,920
Donghwa Hotel

498
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,160
Please check the traditional music orchestra's New Year's dinner invitation.

499
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,050
All the members will come to dinner, so please check the restaurant menu again.

500
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,750
Yes. I understand, CEO.

501
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,540
What is this?

502
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,780
Ah, that. Kim Jin Hyeok asked me to give it to you earlier.

503
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,810
Yes.

504
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,220
Yes.

505
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,490
These are the shoes that brought you to me.

506
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:36,330
I believe that these shoes will bring you back to me.

507
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,150
Right now, you're only walking down a difficult road, right?

508
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,680
When you look at these shoes, please remember.

509
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,830
♫ They say that your caresses ♫

510
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,680
Those happy footsteps of ours.

511
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,670
♫ Will never be mine ♫

512
00:52:54,670 --> 00:53:01,190
♫ That your loving arms will never embrace me ♫

513
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:07,770
Cha Soo Hyeon, you are my one and only love.

514
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,860
♫ That you loved me ♫

515
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,070
Don't forget that.

516
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:14,330
♫ And even if I die later,  ♫

517
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:20,540
Every single thing I’ve said to you, every promise... I will keep.

518
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,730
You may break up with me… But I will continue loving you.

519
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:28,720
♫  that you have kissed me ♫

520
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:37,360
♫  I would give you my life, if you asked for it ♫

521
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:45,810
♫ If I manage to kiss you as I have dreamed ♫

522
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:52,610
♫ It would be impossible for you to forget me. ♫

523
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:34,050
♫ Give me a kiss ♫

524
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:16,730
- Ahjussi, I'm getting out here.
- Alright.

525
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,610
Ah, it's snowing.

526
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:14,210
Who is it?

527
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,710
Who is it?

528
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,740
Oh, CEO!

529
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,320
Your expression is so great.

530
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,200
You're pretty.

531
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,630
You look happy.

532
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:49,130
These are photos I really wanted you to see..

533
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,310
There is a Cha Soo Hyeon that only you don't know in them.

534
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,610
- Where do you want to go?
- Take me to Hongje-dong.

535
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:13,800
What are you going to do when the playground is demolished?

536
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:44,260
♫ A wish gently spreads ♫

537
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,690
♫ You look like starlight ♫

538
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:52,880
I saw my feelings that only I didn't know.

539
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,660
♫ I'm feeling you ♫

540
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:01,030
I'm smiling in all of the moments that I spent with you.

541
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:04,460
♫ Still magical ♫

542
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:07,960
I didn't realize I could smile that happily.

543
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,680
♫ You are my starlight ♫

544
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:20,030
Always live while smiling like that, Soo Hyeon.
♫ You are my starlight ♫

545
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:26,210
Without you, Jin Hyeok, I can't smile at all.
♫ Before I know it the expression in your eyes ♫

546
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:32,080
Please let me be by your side.
♫ make me smile ♫

547
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:37,070
I want to live happily by your side.
♫ My sunshine. My dreamlike sunshine ♫

548
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:40,380
♫ I want to touch ♫

549
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,310
I'm sorry.

550
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:48,060
I'm sorry for breaking up with you.
♫ A picture worthy moment ♫

551
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:51,500
♫ Good night ♫

552
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:02,360
Don't say you're sorry.

553
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,920
Thank you...
♫ Wishes protect each other ♫

554
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,340
for giving me courage.

555
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:18,710
♫ You resemble the starlight ♫

556
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:27,610
♫ I'm feeling you. ♫

557
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:30,980
I love you.
♫ Still a miracle ♫

558
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:35,110
I love you, Jin Hyeok.
♫ You are ♫

559
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,820
♫ You are my starlight. ♫

560
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:47,090
♫ You are my starlight. ♫

561
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:58,440
♫ The look in your eyes still as ever is smiling again ♫

562
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:10,490
♫ Then I want to touch my dreamlike sunshine ♫

563
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:16,660
♫ A picture worthy moment ♫

564
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:19,420
♫ I feel you. ♫

565
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,050
♫ Stay with you ♫

566
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:28,760
♫ The whole world is getting tinged with you ♫

567
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,410
♫ I'll become the wave  ♫

568
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:35,360
The atmosphere is so nice.
♫ And watch over you ♫

569
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,790
But, why isn't she coming back?

570
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,880
♫ Good night. ♫

571
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,260
Chan's Whelks

572
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:49,350
Hey. I prepared a special double order of whelks.

573
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:50,720
Thank you for the meal.

574
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,860
And here are two overflowing mugs of beer. Special order.

575
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,400
- Then, we'll leave now.
- Why? We should sit and eat, too.

576
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,930
- Have a good time.
- Enjoy your time.

577
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:04,660
We should eat dinner at home.

578
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:08,280
I have a lot of side dishes at my place.

579
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,740
Your mom made them for me.

580
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,040
Really?

581
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:18,470
I was so sorry, I couldn't eat them, but now I think I should feel at ease and eat them.

582
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,820
I guess then we should go eat at your place for our second round.

583
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:29,170
So where is the couple ring I gave you?

584
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:40,090
I had it with me everyday, so don't be mad at me.

585
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,900
You have loyalty.

586
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,900
It's love, of course. Would it be loyalty?

587
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:50,840
Give it here.

588
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:16,940
This time there is no taking it off, ever.

589
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:23,270
I won't take off the couple ring, and I will diligently take a lot of pictures with the camera.

590
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:30,830
You still have the camera case, right?

591
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:32,750
Yes.

592
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:37,060
Do you know why I gave the case to you as a gift?

593
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,350
Of course I know.

594
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:42,520
You want to become my home (jip).
(jip = case / home)

595
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,750
Look at that. You're smart enough to know that

596
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,820
and you wanted to make a sad ending?

597
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:51,310
You told me to not be sorry, but you're scolding me again?

598
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:55,330
Sorry. I got upset for a moment because I was disappointed.

599
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:59,770
So I thought I would try making one, too.

600
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:03,340
I will make you a pretty home.

601
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:07,910
It will take about a year. It is for me, after all.

602
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,820
It doesn't matter if it takes a long time, does it?

603
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,550
You will stay by my side for even longer than that. Right?

604
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,890
I told you a million times.

605
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,890
That I will stay with you for a long, long time.

606
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:43,280
We are closed for today.

607
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:53,550
If we saw each other again, I wanted to ask you, do you have a boyfriend? From: Fruit Vendor

608
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,190
One year later

609
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,900
To New Employees: We genuinely welcome you for joining our Donghwa Family

610
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,630
Mr. Oh Kang Hui, do you drink?

611
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,250
I cannot drink any alcohol.

612
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,550
That is quite an impediment of your social life.

613
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:26,530
My mother told me that such judgment of others is a bad thing.

614
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:27,380
Are you a mama's boy?

615
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:30,470
Yes, I can't say that I am not.

616
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:32,250
- Kim Jin Hyeok.
- Yes, Section Chief.

617
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,860
How have you trained the new employees?

618
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:37,930
I apologize. I will begin with spoon-feeding him beer.

619
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:39,590
You drink beer with a spoon?

620
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:42,190
Yes, that is how we drink beer.

621
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:43,630
Do you like squid?

622
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:44,380
No, I don't.

623
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,790
I agree. We go together well.

624
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:47,810
No, I don't think we do.

625
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:52,660
- I like that guy.
- Hey.

626
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,580
'Hey?' Call me Section Chief.

627
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,110
Enough already.

628
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:57,060
Speak formally to me.

629
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:00,450
Public Relations Team? Let's get back to work.

630
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

631
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,260
Kang Hui, I will show you how to print and make copies.

632
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:32,310
Chairman, your mother has refused your visit request again.

633
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:34,730
I understand.

634
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:36,750
Please submit the request again next week.

635
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,260
Yes.

636
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:43,990
Thank you to the entire My Rainbow After A Storm Team

637
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:48,070
Thank you to our multi-talented Channel Manager marykarmelina

638
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:52,060
Thank you to our precise segmenters: Pilar_velasquez, marykarmelina, bjohnsonwong, hana_860, nicefly09,

639
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:55,910
Thank you to our precise segmenters, cont.: shms, cgwm808, dudie, sosoeali, sophieball_858 and signsofserendipity

640
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,770
So did you have some business nearby again?

641
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,010
Yes.

642
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:08,580
So why not just see to your business? Why ask to see me?

643
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:11,010
Your earrings look good on you.

644
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,720
How sweet.

645
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,320
It seems you keep coming because you are clinging to hope? Don't do that.

646
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,740
But when I ask to see you, you always come.

647
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:21,420
That's because you say that you will wait until I come.

648
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,560
Look closely into your heart.

649
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,270
Why do you keep coming?

650
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:28,100
Oh, you...

651
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:32,800
Thank you to our irreplaceable Korean to English subtitlers: cherae_lynn, aerichoi, starlight_0,

monstertop, cherae_lynn and juliakyo09

658
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:57,110
Thank you to all language moderators and subtitlers

659
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:59,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

660
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:00,680
Can I look at some of the art?

661
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,420
Of course, look around freely.

662
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:09,360
Your face looks better each time you come.

663
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,290
Is that right?

664
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:13,380
Jin Hyeok looks better each time, too.

665
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,510
Does he come often? He doesn't tell me.

666
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:18,420
He comes once in a while.

667
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,750
But that guy, he is quite boring.

668
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:23,620
Jin Hyeok?

669
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:27,050
He always talks about books. Is he like that with you?

670
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:29,870
He only talks to me about famous restaurants.

671
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,650
Honey.

672
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:39,050
I hate Jin Hyeok so much.

673
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:41,070
Why?

674
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,510
He keeps bringing his girlfriend home for dinner.

675
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:49,820
How am I supposed to plan the menu?

676
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,370
Now it's hard to even turn around.

677
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:57,230
Why can't they eat out? Why are they always eating at home? Right, Honey?

678
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:59,900
So ask them to pay for their meals.

679
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,220
I better do that. Good idea.

680
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,320
Kim Jin Hyeok, this boy...

681
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,710
The tangerines are so sweet this year, aren't they?

682
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,460
Yes, they are.

683
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,930
I went to visit Hyungnim Jong Hyeon yesterday.

684
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:18,720
After he is released from prison, he wants to go hiking mountains with me.

685
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,530
Why hiking, of all things? It's so tiring.

686
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:22,090
Is this really hiking?

687
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:24,500
Going as high as makgeolli restaurants is hiking.
(makgeolli = rice wine)

688
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,290
When you go higher up, that's mountain climbing.

689
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:28,960
Then why did you buy that mountain climbing outfit?

690
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,560
Do you only think about yourself?

691
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,710
For people with large heads like mine, it's more difficult to climb mountains because we are more exposed to the elements.

692
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:38,660
How can people with small heads like yours understand?

693
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:43,250
That large size head of yours serves as an excuse for everything.

694
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:46,870
This acorn jelly is so good. Eat some. These are not fattening at all.

695
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:50,560
If I eat this, won't I become like you, Oppa?

696
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,600
What do you mean by that?

697
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,660
- This place is good. Is it delicious?
- Yes, it's delicious here.
- Here is your food.

698
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,590
Enjoy.

699
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,180
- Thank you.
- Yes.

700
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,620
Why does Oppa keep leaving his restaurant lately?

701
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,020
Is he really going to open a chain?

702
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,590
I don't know. He keeps disappearing.

703
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:13,290
Oh, yeah.

704
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,300
Look at this.

705
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:18,880
What is that?

706
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,840
He's a friend from the army. He's the same age as you. His personality is amazing.

707
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,460
How about it? Do you want a blind date with him?

708
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,730
I said I don't want to.

709
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:28,250
Why not? Do you still like Jin Hyeok?

710
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,600
Stop it already. That boat has sailed.

711
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,920
How much do you need to be hit for you to become a proper person?

712
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,100
Just meet him once.

713
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,460
You can date him.

714
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,960
I will set a date, okay? I will even go with you.

715
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,990
Why would you do that?

716
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:41,410
- Okay?
- Don't follow me.

717
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,920
Can't you just meet him once?

718
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:49,720
This neighborhood is so pretty.

719
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,290
Yes.

720
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,450
It's pretty.

721
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:53,320
The neighborhood?

722
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,860
No.

723
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,350
Who?

724
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,580
Did you meet with Dad?

725
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:03,490
Yes, once in a while.

726
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:04,980
Did he talk about me?

727
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:08,330
Dad said you are boring because you only talk about books.

728
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:12,280
Well, I began talking about music.

729
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,470
But it turns out, we have nothing in common on that topic.

730
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,820
Father and I, it seems we have completely different tastes in music.

731
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,090
- So you changed to books.
- Yes.

732
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,470
But he finds that boring?

733
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:24,430
I think so.

734
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:28,790
You have some ham left at home, right? Shall we make some sandwiches?

735
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,410
Let's make kimchi fried rice.

736
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:31,620
What?

737
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,150
I'm not good at making that.

738
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:35,390
You can only get better with practice.

739
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:40,570
It's not that I don't want to. It just doesn't taste good to me.

740
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:44,480
If you like kimchi and ham, there is no way that doesn't taste good.

741
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,830
Did I say that then?

742
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:48,020
- Is that so?
- Yes.

743
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:53,050
Be careful.

744
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,460
Will you be busy in the second quarter too?

745
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,530
- Me?
- Yeah.

746
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:02,040
The hotel in Cuba will be built, so I probably won't be busy at all.

747
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,330
Then make some time for me?

748
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:06,370
Time?

749
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:08,950
If I do, what will you do?

750
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,180
Just...

751
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,630
Shall we go to Santiago?

752
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,730
Can we go after we marry?

753
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,710
Let's go eat something delicious.

754
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,780
What about the kimchi fried rice?

755
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,440
Today is a good day

756
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,820
so let's go eat something really delicious.

757
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:53,020
All right, let's go eat something really delicious.

758
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,800
So what would that be?

759
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,490
Chung-gook-jang!
 (Fermented soybean in spicy broth)

760
01:12:57,490 --> 01:13:00,440
Fine.
♫  An unexplainable feeling ♫

761
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,310
♫  When I'm with you ♫

762
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:05,060
Isn't this how they're sitting?

763
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,390
No.

764
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,750
I am right. This is how she is sitting.

765
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,850
She's leaning on him like this.

766
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,150
But when are you going to make my camera case?

767
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:16,800
I'm thinking about how to make it.

768
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,170
See? I told you it will take at least a year.

769
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,330
It won't take a year.

770
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:22,220
Never mind.

771
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:24,300
Smile wide.

772
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,320
One, two, three!

773
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,320
Let me look at the mirror, first...

774
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,900
You don't need to, you look pretty.

775
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,400
One, two, three!

776
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,520
♫  Beautiful day ♫

777
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,750
♫  A day like a painting ♫

778
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:41,420
♫  A night like a movie ♫

779
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:44,660
♫  Make me forget everything ♫

780
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:48,230
♫  You and a beautiful day ♫

781
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:54,550
♫  This beautiful day ♫

782
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:57,630
♫  It’s beautiful ♫

783
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:04,810
♫  Out of everything which passes here ♫

784
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:12,660
♫ You're the only one seeing me coming and going ♫

785
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:15,830
♫  You who were looking for me for a while, for a while, ♫

786
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:18,500
Among a multitude of stars,

787
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,660
♫  Stay like that  ♫

788
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,660
one stares down at me.

789
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,930
♫ up to now ♫

790
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:27,900
Among a multitude of people,
♫  Just the moment  ♫

791
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:31,130
I stare up at that one star.
♫ you stayed with me, ♫

792
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:34,600
