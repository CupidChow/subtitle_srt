1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,320
Encounter

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,750
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,440
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,830
Boyfriend

5
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,750
Wow. We went to famous restaurants in Mangweon-dong and went on a date at a bookstore.

6
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,480
Let's go to a skating rink once before winter is over.

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,450
Either that or sledding.

8
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,030
Ah, that would be cold.

9
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,490
It's not that cold if you use a hot pack.

10
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,850
Okay?

11
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,740
Fine.

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,640
Good.

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,450
Jin Hyeok, I...

14
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,210
It's a present.

15
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,150
Open it.

16
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,940
What is this?

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,760
It's a camera case for you, Soo Hyeon.

18
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,140
I made it.

19
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,800
I made it whenever I had time after work,

20
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,010
and it came out better than I thought.

21
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,760
How did you make this?

22
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,350
You're so devoted.

23
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,760
I knew you would understand.

24
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,530
Look at the words inscribed there.

25
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,410
Soo Hyeon

26
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,010
♫ You can't start♫

27
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,750
Do you like it?

28
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,920
♫ entering my heart like this ♫

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,330
Soo Hyeon

30
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,110
♫ I won't ever ♫

31
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,400
Ah. Weren't you going to tell me something?

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,350
It's nothing.

33
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,200
♫ lose my heart to you. ♫

34
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,980
♫ The more I like you ♫

35
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,990
♫ The more I depend on you ♫

36
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,570
♫ The heart I'm unwilling to lose ♫

37
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:15,110
♫ The heart that is unwilling to depart ♫

38
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,710
It would be nice if we looked good in the pictures, since they're going to take them anyway.

39
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,260
When I look at the pictures we've been taken in so far,

40
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,540
I always look really aware of the cameras and stiff.

41
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,250
Let's go to the bookstore tomorrow and look at books.

42
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,970
Alright. I wanted to go there, too.

43
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,850
This is as small as your face, Soo Hyeon.

44
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,080
- Really?
- Yes.

45
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,990
- It doesn't cover my face.
- No, it does.

46
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,840
Just your eyes.

47
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,920
♫ The more I depend on you ♫

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,040

51
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,000
You're dating properly, Jin Hyeok. Good job!

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,490
♫ go to you ♫

53
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,500
Seriously.

54
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,270
She's even prettier today.

55
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,510
Episode 15

56
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,790
- Assemblyman!
- One moment! One moment!

57
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,440
Assemblyman Cha, please give a statement.

58
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,530
First, I would like to deeply apologize to all of the citizens

59
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,610
for the trouble I have caused.

60
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,720
When I was first elected an assemblyman ...

61
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,430
I accepted illegal corporate contributions.

62
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,910
The prosecutor will tell you about that fact today,

63
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,240
and I will accept the punishment for that.

64
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:28,090
For everyone's benefit, I expect that I'll be taken soon into police custody for my wrongdoing.

65
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,370
Assemblyman Cha appears before prosecution himself to right his wrongs

66
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,250
Assemblyman, do you admit the charges?

67
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,780
I've been holding back since it's too early to explain things in a way that would bring some relief.

68
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,100
But don't be shocked at how I behave as a politician from now on,

69
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,150
and don't ever have strange thoughts like it might be because of you.

70
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,260
In particular, he has not yet resigned.

71
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,940
After Cha Jong Hyeon admitted receiving illegal contributions,

72
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,640
the political community is holding its breath.

73
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,690
Cautious speculation oscillates
[Song Myeong Ho, Reporter]

74
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,460
as to which corporation is the business described as making the bribes.

75
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,220
Assemblyman Cha Jong Hyeon exposes shocking corruption of Taegyeong Group!

76
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,360
Our CEO doesn't have a single peaceful day.

77
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,870
What's going to happen with this?

78
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,810
It's said that he got it from Taegyeong.

79
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,440
Isn't that really twisted?

80
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,230
Who said that it's from Taegyeong? Nothing is even certain yet.

81
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,580
That's why the CEO married into Taegyeong and...

82
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,620
Please take care of Soo Hyeon.

83
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,160
I'm asking you to become a reliable fence around her.

84
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm very happy that she's with you.

85
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,320
I thought that something was strange.

86
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,890
He came on Oppa's memorial day to do this.

87
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,530
I think even the people in the political party office didn't know that.

88
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,450
If he does this without any proof, then he's the only one who will get hurt.

89
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,130
Taegyeong will definitely keep themselves out of this one. What did he believe would happen when he drew his sword.

90
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,920
Ah, I'm seriously going crazy.

91
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,150
I would hold a press conference, but I need evidence.

92
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,950
What kind...?

93
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,120
I hope that you'll provide evidence.

94
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,400
What are you saying?

95
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,300
What are you saying that you're doing?

96
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,950
Revealing that I received illegal campaign funds from Taegyeong.

97
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,930
Do you not know what that means?

98
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,010
I'm going to handle it by clearly stating I knew it was an illegal contribution from the start,

99
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,340
and it will result in your getting a suspended sentence at most.

100
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:40,010
You should go traveling then. You'll only get pestered if you stay here.

101
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,490
No. I can't do it. I refuse.

102
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,240
Honey.

103
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,620
This is something that must be done.

104
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,990
Are you going to leave Soo Hyeon to be dragged around by Taegyeong like that for the rest of her life?

105
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear this.

106
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,500
What you were hoping for

107
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,100
doesn't exist anymore now. Don't you realize that?

108
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,600
So you're ending everything in the end.

109
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,800
Cha Soo Hyeon
010-141-3927

110
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,170
CEO Cha is inside, right?

111
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,630
CEO Cha ordered me not to hold any meetings.

112
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,110
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,280
CEO's Office

114
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,940
Is CEO Cha eating?

115
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,720
I'm taking good care of her.

116
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,490
I'll come back later.

117
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,710
Assemblyman Cha, you came with us. You fit Taegyeong well.

118
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,400
We took this path together based on a promise.

119
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,320
Taegyeong has many documents

120
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,290
and evidence related to you.

121
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,190
Chairwoman

122
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,690
Chairwoman

123
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,290
Chairwoman

124
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,700
Your call cannot be connected. You will be sent to voicemail...

125
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,500
- He's coming!
- Assemblyman! Assemblyman Cha!

126
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,400
Manager Nam

127
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,030
How is my dad?

128
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,680
He's coming out now. I'll take him home, so get some rest.

129
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,370
Yes. Please take care of him.

130
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,040
Do you admit your illegal funding?

131
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,040
Please give us a word!

132
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,770
- Assemblyman Cha!
- Is your statement true?

133
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,120
Please give me your keys.

134
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,960
When we arrive, I'll wake you up, so get some sleep.

135
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,260
Why don't we have a cup of tea?

136
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,810
It's a bit late.

137
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,630
You're tired today. Just go get some rest.

138
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,550
I have something to talk to you about.

139
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,750
You got off work late.

140
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,750
I waited.

141
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,650
I figured you were alone, so I waited.

142
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,890
You're really worried about your father, aren't you?

143
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,200
I don't know what I should do to help him.

144
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,270
Probably, in your dad's eyes, if you eat well

145
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,480
and work diligently, he would think that's helpful.

146
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,660
My words of comfort aren't that great, are they?

147
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,020
No, they are.

148
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,260
Thank you for worrying with me.

149
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,130
Hey, that's upsetting. Of course, we should worry together.

150
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,840
Did you eat something? Do you want me to buy you a piece of cake?

151
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,990
Jin Hyeok.

152
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,090
Let's...

153
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,490
break up.

154
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,250
I've been thinking about it for a while.

155
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,600
Let's break up.

156
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,260
It's not that you have done anything wrong.

157
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,330
It's not because our love lacks anything, either.

158
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,620
What are you talking about?

159
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,220
In some cases, love

160
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,140
can only continue to a certain point.

161
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,870
Please help me.

162
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,520
So that I can live with my good memories of you...

163
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,320
Please help me.

164
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,530
Wait. Why would you live with memories?

165
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,160
We have to live making memories together.

166
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,260
There are so many things I still want to do for you and do together. What are you talking about?

167
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,260
We are the only ones who are happy.

168
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,290
Soo Hyeon...

169
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,580
All of the days that we spent together are a miracle.

170
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,840
These kinds of miracles are gift-like memories.

171
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,590
I don't want to destroy them.

172
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,070
The situation with your father

173
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,020
is difficult, right? I understand.

174
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,370
I'm so frustrated not knowing how I can help.

175
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:27,580
But still ... I have to stay by your side and protect you.

176
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,800
I made that promise.

177
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,430
So don't talk like this.

178
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:36,110
You said you cherish me very much, right?

179
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,480
I, too, cherish you very much.

180
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:50,440
That's why I am going to stop here.

181
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,980
My father's matter will flow to the right direction.

182
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,300
I won't have a hard time or be scared.

183
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,070
But...

184
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,170
Why...

185
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,410
Why are you abandoning me?

186
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:33,910
I... How could I abandon you?

187
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,420
I am sending you away.

188
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,690
I'm sorry.

189
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,390
I'll get going.

190
00:18:52,440 --> 00:19:00,580
♫  When the door opens, you whom I love come to me ♫

191
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,280
♫  A fairytale which kisses beautifully ♫

192
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:15,050
♫  When night falls, where there is just the two of us ♫

193
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,330
♫  A fairy tale where I dance holding you ♫

194
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:27,460
♫  While I spend such a day with you ♫

195
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:35,170
Jin Hyeok
♫  I don't want to wake up from that fairytale-like dream ♫

196
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:45,790
Jin Hyeok
♫  I don't want to wake up and leave from here ♫

197
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:53,700
Jin Hyeok
♫  I want to dream and hold you a little longer ♫

198
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:00,000
♫  If I wake up it seems these many stories  ♫
 Jin Hyeok

199
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:06,940
♫  will all disappear, while I am thinking that. ♫

200
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:14,760
♫  Sometimes I imagine I'm somewhere you're not ♫

201
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:21,970
♫  I'm scared as though my body will freeze up ♫

202
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,610
♫  There is no such day for me. ♫

203
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:33,190
♫  My day on which you abandon me ♫

204
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:40,600
♫ Everyday even though my heart aches as though it were broken ♫

205
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:48,210
Soo Hyeon
♫  At any time I will stay there like this ♫

206
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,890
Soo Hyeon (11)

207
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:59,380
♫  I don't want to wake up and leave from here ♫

208
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:07,140
♫  I want to dream and hold you a little longer ♫

209
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,550
♫  If I wake up it seems these many stories  ♫

00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:20,800

212
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,670
♫  I'm scared as though my body will freeze up ♫

213
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,090
♫  My day on which you abandon me ♫

214
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:47,120
♫  A melancholy and tiresome fairytale ♫

215
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,000
- What about Jin Hyeok?
- I woke him up, but he's not getting out of bed.

216
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,200
Is he sick or something?

217
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,140
I'm not sure. He didn't say anything.

218
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,330
Jin Hyeok!

219
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,860
- Yes?
- You don't look so good.

220
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,180
I had a lot of work to do.

221
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,240
Mom, I have to wash up and leave right away. I don't think I can eat breakfast.

222
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,820
Based on Assemblyman Cha's testimony this afternoon,

223
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:54,160
the prosecution office obtained a search warrant for Taegyeong Group suspecting illegal campaign funds.

224
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,260
The court seems to be concerned with a possible destruction of evidence.

225
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,240
It's still unclear about Taegyeong Group's Chairwoman, Kim Hwa Jin's arrest.

226
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,850
Oh. Hello.

227
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,560
Dad, don't skip meals.

228
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,290
You too.

229
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,070
And make sure to take your blood pressure medicine.

230
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,930
I know.

231
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,100
How is Mom?

232
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,020
She is resting in the room. Don't worry. How are you doing?

233
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,150
Don't worry about me. It is you and Mother who are having a hard time.

234
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm sorry.

235
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,300
What are you sorry for?

236
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:54,910
I thank you for getting your courage up. I know how you feel.

237
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,710
Alright. Take care.

238
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,800
Won't you be summoned as well at this rate, Chairwoman? I'm worried.

239
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,910
Even if they do a search and seizure, nothing will come of it.

240
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,880
By chance, will Assemblyman Cha's wife—

241
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,490
She is a person who begs for her life on her knees.

242
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,570
She's not the type to be a witness.

243
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,510
There is nothing to be worried about.

244
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,280
There is no proof or any documents at Taegyeong.

245
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:53,540
How could I abandon you

246
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,990
I'm sending you away.

247
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,560
Jin Hyeok.

248
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,830
Let's go inside. Everyone's in the conference room.

249
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,430
Alright.

250
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,750
I am sure you all are feeling the company's unsettling atmosphere.

251
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,760
Let's get through our company's founding day event well.

252
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,320
And put this unsettling atmosphere to sleep.

253
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,340
- Let's get energized.
- Yes.

254
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:43,720
How about if we get an idol for the event? For livening up the atmosphere, an idol would—

255
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,590
- Let's focus a little more.
- Yes, ma'am.

256
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,510
Jin Hyeok. Are you sick?

257
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,790
No.

258
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,690
Your complexion really doesn't look good.

259
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,990
I also thought something was off with you this morning. You look even worse.

260
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,160
I'm alright.

261
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,050
I think it'd be better if you take off early and get some rest.

262
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,260
Go.

263
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,750
Yes, Dad.

264
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,870
You are still at work, right?

265
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,700
I'm alright. I just finished early today.

266
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,550
Oh, really? Then come by the fruit stand.

267
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,470
You're here.

268
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,020
Did you eat lunch?

269
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,560
Of course. Look at what time it is.

270
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,090
This is what CEO brought. It's really strong and good.

271
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,080
You want to try one?

272
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,270
That's alright. I already took some medicine.

273
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,640
I could tell this morning that your condition wasn't good.

274
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,560
Let's close the stand and go to the sauna together.

275
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,020
I'll go home and take a nap.

276
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,220
You're worried because of the CEO, right?

277
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,200
She's probably having a hard time.

278
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,360
At a time like this, you should be taking care of her. How could you catch a cold?!

279
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,010
- I took some medicine, so I'll be okay.
- There's nothing wrong, right?

280
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:16,120
- There's nothing wrong. It's probably just because I couldn't sleep well.
- Alright.

281
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,510
- If that's the case, go ahead and get some rest.
-Alright.

282
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,250
Jin Myeong, is that you?

283
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,170
What are you doing here at this time of da—

284
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,820
You're sick, huh?

285
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,170
I took some medicine. Don't worry, Mom.

286
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,890
Why did you report on paper? You've alway reported face to face.

287
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,150
I thought you'd be uncomfortable.

288
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,440
It's draining to meet people at times like this.

289
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,360
It's alright. Business is business.

290
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,460
Do we have a celebratory performance for the company's founding day?

291
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,730
I was thinking of a classical theme. What do you think?

292
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,950
I hope it's not too long. Employees might get bored.

293
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,010
I'd like it if this event is wholesome.

294
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,150
And give out a lot of employee awards, too.

295
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,800
Yes. I will prepare as you have directed.

296
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:36,400
Oh, right. Today, Jin Hyeok took some sick leave.

297
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,960
He seemed alright, but you could tell by his face that he was really not well.

298
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,190
About that treat for taking care of the trouble,

299
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,390
don't you think I should at least be treated with meat?

300
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,890
This contains a lot of meat. It's got vegetable and lots of protein.

301
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,520
Why are you in cheap mode suddenly? Why now, of all times?

302
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,350
I need to save money. My hyung paid for all the damages I caused in the pub.

303
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,520
I am going to save money and give it to Jin Hyeok.

304
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,870
I am now touched by the brotherly love.

305
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,950
- Is that right? Then give me the rest of that.
- Ayi, you punk.

306
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,970
Why don't you think of me 1/16th of the amount that you think about your brother, Punk?

307
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,310
I probably love you much more than Jang Mi Jin does.

308
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,970
Ah this...

309
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,510
Hello, Dad. I'm at Dae Chan's place, of course.

310
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,000
Hyung? Alright.

311
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,800
Something's up with Jin Hyeok?

312
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,000
He came home early. That's unlike him.

313
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,960
Jin Myeong

314
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,180
- Hey, Jin Myeong.
- Hyung, did you catch something?

315
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,660
- No.
- Then why are you sitting at home bored? Come over.

316
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,300
I'm going to rest.

317
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,420
Shall I come home?

318
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,250
Then, after I rest some, I'll come over.

319
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,620
All the days that we've met are a miracle.

320
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:39,040
These kinds of miracles are gift-like memories.

321
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,740
I don't want to destroy them.

322
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,240
Tous les Jours Café

323
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,620
- Please give me this and a chocolate cake.
- Yes.

324
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,900
2019 First Quarter: Reference for Sponsored Donghwa Hotel Drama

325
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,890
- Eat this and cheer up.
- Why are you here again?

326
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,190
How I can go home when you are like this all day?

327
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:13,660
You need to eat a lot of sweets after a break-up. I even bought a chocolate cake.

328
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,090
Eat this and cheer up.

329
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,000
It's delicious. Thank you.

330
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,260
How is your dad doing?

331
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,040
He said he's fine, of course.

332
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,850
To be honest, I feel great that Assemblyman Cha got the courage up this time.

333
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,500
Although you are probably concerned since it's your father.

334
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,570
Now they'll stop talking about the lawsuit or whatever.

335
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,780
He took care of it in one shot.

336
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,790
Because of me, this is the start of a difficult life.

337
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,500
What is this again? Why are you always saying things are your fault?

338
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,590
- Is Jin Hyeok's mom your fault too?
- Yes, it's all my fault.

339
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,360
No, Jin Hyeok is the one who really likes you. What did you do wrong?

340
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,470
- She only cherishes her own child...
- Mi Jin.

341
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,350
Whatever. It just seems like that to me.

342
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,570
Why does the mother get involved in her child's dating—

343
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,910
It's because my situation isn't normal.

344
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,040
Hey! If being unusual is a crime, then being normal is a crime, too.

345
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,550
Does it take one to be in love? It takes two.

346
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,400
Are you really here to encourage me?

347
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,790
Right. I won't talk. Eat.

348
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,430
I really won't talk. Just eat some more. Can't you see my intention?

349
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,660
When the issue with my father is cleared up, I'm going directly to Cuba.

350
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:49,130
I'll come back from time to time for my father's sake and since I'm worried about my mother.

351
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,700
You too, take about a year off.

352
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,910
No letter of resignation.

353
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,860
Okay.

354
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,700
I'll take a sabbatical

355
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,340
and go to Cuba and have a leisurely time at your side.

356
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,820
Did you go to the hospital?

357
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,800
Did you come home early because you were sick?

358
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
It wasn't like that.

359
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,150
I took some medicine and got some sleep. I'm fine.

360
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,420
Is everything okay at the office? Tell me what I missed.

361
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,170
Just rest. I'll fill you in at the office tomorrow.

362
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,590
I told you already. I'm feeling better.

363
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,200
He's about to die, tell him.

364
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,140
Eun Jin's suggestion of getting an idol is voted out.

365
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,960
The CEO wants the event to be quiet and wholesome.

366
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,820
But it's too non-eventful, so it was decided to vote for the most popular employee from each hotel and give awards.

367
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,510
That sounds like fun. Where will the vote be held?

368
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,120
On the homepage.

369
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,420
I heard Employee Kim Jin Hyeok is most likely to be picked from the main hotel in Seoul.

370
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:09,090
Whatever. Assistant Manager Park is the popular one.

371
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,640
This is the first time I've seen you down like this.

372
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,030
Is there something bothering you?

373
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,220
I think my clothes were too thin.

374
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,650
It's because I caught a cold.

375
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,070
Chan's Whelks

376
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,000
Hyung!

377
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,950
Ta-da! Drink this before you go to sleep.

378
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:52,090
Drink that and cover yourself up warm to your chin, okay?

379
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,820
Okay.

380
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,290
I'm going back in.

381
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,740
Jin Myeong.

382
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,850
Thank you.

383
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,770
What did you say?

384
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,650
I said thank you.

385
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:11,530
You've giving me goosebumps. I'm going in. You too. Get going.

386
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,220
So cold.

387
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,870
Did you really meet her

388
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,170
and ask her to break up with him?

389
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,570
It's because I'm foolish.

390
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,690
I can't see our Jin Hyeok get hurt.

391
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,280
Jin Hyeok's feelings don't matter?

392
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,080
I did it because I know Jin Hyeok won't give up.

393
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,790
You know he goes forward once he's decided.

394
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,100
He has a path that he wants to take.

395
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,670
If he decided like that and goes forward, then we need to help him.

396
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,680
If you can't help him, then you should just stay out of it.

397
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,000
Why did you do such a thing?

398
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,030
I don't regret it.

399
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,370
Things will quiet down once some more time passes.

400
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,270
But things can't go on any further, Honey.

401
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:32,180
Jin Hyeok is probably having a hard time right now, but he'll forget everything with time.

402
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,130
Once he gets married and has children and as he lives life,

403
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,650
he'll wonder if he even had bad days like this.

404
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,660
Is Jin Hyeok someone who can do that?

405
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,520
Do you think he can live like that? Do you not know your own son to that extent?

406
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,860
Fine. Let's say that they keep dating like this.

407
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,190
But if they broke up,

408
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,900
our Jin Hyeok would be the only one hurt.

409
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,040
Honey, I... I just want to keep living normally

410
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,490
like we have until now.

411
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,760
Just as we've been living happily even if we didn't eat much or have a lot.

412
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,250
I want to live like that.

413
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,020
You and I, when the kids were young,

414
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,860
we were selling fruit on the streets because we didn't even have money to rent a store.

415
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,500
I went to the fruit market, and

416
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,120
you went out early in the morning to get a spot on the street.

417
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,720
Jin Hyeok was so young and only seven years old then,

418
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,860
but he watched after his younger brother that early in the morning.

419
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,740
Jin Hyeok endured that much.

420
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,780
But his own parent can't endure it?

421
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,850
I can endure anything.

422
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,120
It has to do with my child, so there's nothing that I can't endure.

423
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,460
But this is something that will only hurt Jin Hyeok when it's over.

424
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,240
It's as plain as day.

425
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,390
You...

426
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,670
This time, you were wrong.

427
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,280
I can just be punished, then.

428
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,740
Do you think I feel at ease?

429
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,020
Do you think that I don't know that I tore that CEO's heart apart?

430
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,450
I'll take all the punishment

431
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,570
for causing her pain.

432
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,210
But she can't be with our Jin Hyeok.

433
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,770
I'll just accept all the punishment.

434
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,440
Because we're the only ones who are happy.

435
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,110
I also treasure you very much.

436
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,470
That's why I'm ending things here.

437

♫  Another long day is about to begin ♫

438

Your call cannot be connected.

♫  As much as I long for you and you've grown in my heart  ♫

441
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,530
Secretary Jang, where is CEO?

442
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:50,610
♫  Today is passing slowly ♫

443
00:40:52,460 --> 00:41:05,240
♫  If I approach like this even if it appears strange ♫

444
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:17,910
♫  Just as my heart tells me I will be going to you.  ♫

445
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,660
Why didn't you tell me you met my mom?

446

♫  I will not hesitate anymore ♫

451
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:52,660
I didn't break up with you because of that.

452
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,460
It was my decision.

453
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,420
So let's not hurt ourselves any further and stop this.

454
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,940
How could I do that?

455
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,880
How could my heart not hurt? I can't see you.

456
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,350
You needed time.

457
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:22,060
We needed time, too.

458
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:25,600
Once that time passed,

459
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,300
we only treasured each other.

460
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,400
So let's wait, alright?

461
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,680
My mom will also—

462
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,350
Your mother...

463
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,970
gave me some tangerine preserves.

464
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,280
It's so simple and pretty.

465
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:52,420
It's something that can't be bought with money.

466
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,080
How could I destroy something like that?

467
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,180
I can't do it, Jin Hyeok.

468
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,250
Soo Hyeon.

469
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,890
Articles come out even if my family just gets together for dinner.

470
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:17,410
Things got noisy just because I ate a bowl of ramen with you.

471
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,330
You remember, don't you?

472
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,570
Our house is chaotic like that.

473
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:32,810
Do you think that I fit with such simple and pretty

474
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,500
tangerine preserves?

475
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:46,730
Do you think that I love you because of your money or because you're the CEO of a hotel?

476
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,450
Do you think I was interested in you because your father was a famous politician?

477
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,570
You know that's not true.

478
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:58,890
Differences between my family and your family

479
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,960
can't be the reason.

480
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,690
Everyone is different. Love is when people who are different begin to resemble each other.

481
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,030
Don't do this, please.

482
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,730
I can't let you go.

483
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,870
I don't have the confidence to see you

484
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:29,260
or the people that are important to you become exhausted because of me.

485
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,790
I think that would be more agonizing for me

486
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,860
than never being able to see you again.

487
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,680
I'm sorry.

488
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,860
I don't think I can do it.

489
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:45,960
♫  When the door opens, you whom I love come to me ♫

490
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,540
♫  A fairytale which kisses beautifully ♫

491
00:45:51,540 --> 00:46:00,690
♫  When night falls, where there is just the two of us ♫

492
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,640
♫  A fairy tale where I dance holding you ♫

493
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:11,810
♫  While I spend such a day with you ♫

494
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:20,440
♫  I don't want to wake up from that fairytale-like dream ♫

495
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:30,160
♫  I don't want to wake up and leave from here ♫

496
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:37,760
♫  I want to dream and hold you a little longer ♫

497
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,210
♫  If I wake up it seems these many stories  ♫

498
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:52,350
♫  will all disappear, while I am thinking that. ♫

499
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,130
Do you think that I fit with

500
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:58,920
such simple and pretty tangerine preserves?

501
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,070
That would be more agonizing to me

502
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,490
than never being able to see you again.

503
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,250
♫  There is no such day for me. ♫

504
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:13,950
I'm sorry. I don't think I can do it.

505
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,960
♫  My day on which you abandon me ♫

506
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,350
I've made up my mind.

507
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:26,260
So let's not hurt ourselves any further and stop this.

508
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:39,250
♫  In all the time you remain constant ♫

509
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:46,840
♫  being just as you are in the place where you remain ♫

510
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:54,280
♫  My heart is filled fully by you ♫

511
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:00,340
♫  There is still a lot I want to tell you ♫

512
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:08,200
♫  I don't want to wake up and leave from here ♫

513
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,100
I know that you won't understand.

514
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:17,470
I hope that he understands me after time passes.

515
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:21,630
Even if he says that he can't, that's alright.

516
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:26,460
Even if I'm the bad person, it's alright.

517
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,230
♫  while I am thinking that. ♫

518
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:37,780
♫  Sometimes I imagine I'm somewhere you're not ♫

519
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:43,990
♫  I'm scared as though my body will freeze up ♫

520
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:49,420
♫ My day on which you abandon me ♫

521
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:56,410
♫  A melancholy and tiresome fairytale ♫

522
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,440
I'm okay with being punished.

523
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:29,550
Do you think that I don't know that I tore that CEO's heart apart?

524
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:37,370
I'll just take the punishment for causing her pain.

525
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,360
But she can't be with our Jin Hyeok.

526
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,680
Jin Hyeok, come eat.

527
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,500
It's dried pollack soup.

528
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,960
Dad, did you do something wrong?

529
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,200
It's not me.

530
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,060
It's because we had a lot of leftover dried pollack.

531
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,420
Thank you for the food.

532
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,800
I don't have the energy for long conversations.

533
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,480
There's a small art gallery in Samcheon-dong.

534
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,130
It's a good gallery to run alone.

535
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:26,990
Why are you here discussing something like that right now when your father is in the state that he's in?

536
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:30,220
Because I'm wondering what you think about running it.

537
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:35,090
What in the world are you thinking? Is this the time to be thinking about things like that?

538
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,020
You liked paintings, Mom.

539
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,850
I don't have the energy to discuss things of the past.

540
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:49,360
When I was young, if there was something that upset you,

541
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:54,920
you would take me to an exhibition with you and always stare at paintings for a long time.

542
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,360
I don't know about those kinds of things anymore.

543
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,860
You were a great person, too.

544
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,390
You think that I wanted to become like Dad.

545
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,750
You think that's why I studied journalism and broadcasting.

546
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,880
I went because I thought that you were cool when you were an announcer.

547
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:18,290
Every time that you were on the morning news, I watched it every day.

548
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,150
I want you to live as a great person again.

549
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:29,330
Give some thought to running the art gallery.

550
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,430
Doing that sort of thing and finding a romantic life

551
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,050
has passed me.

552
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,740
Let's start over again, Mom.

553
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,340
I'll help you.

554
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:51,140
Don't you resent me?

555
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,750
Why are you going this far?

556
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:59,270
We're mother and daughter.

557
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:06,120
I'm leaving. Think it over.

558
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:20,760
We're mother and daughter, aren't we?

559
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,500
Are relationships important?

560
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,890
Worth is important to me.

561
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,860
Live as a useful child.

562
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,920
Jang Soo Fruits

563
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:54,480
Let's eat.

564
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,080
Leave it. I'll eat later.

565
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:01,060
It'll get cold. Eat it while it's warm.

566
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,980
I told you, I'll eat it later.

567
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,620
You can curse at me.

568
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,050
I don't want to leave someone with so many circumstances by Jin Hyeok's side.

569
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:18,330
It's her life. Why call it circumstances?

570
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,380
Eat up.

571
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,790
Jin Hyeok, shall we go out to eat lunch?

572
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,810
Kim Jin Hyeok.

573
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,500
Yes?

574
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:43,730
Shouldn't you take a sick day or go on vacation? You don't look good these days.

575
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,060
Let's go out and eat soup and rice. My treat.

576
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,870
Me too.

577
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:51,960
Then shall we all go out to eat together for the first time in a long time?

578
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,060
You're coming too, right, Department Head?

579
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,690
Alright.

580
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,300
I ate too much this morning. You guys go ahead.

581
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,450
Look at this. Have you lost your appetite, too?

582
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:08,090
I really ate a lot this morning. I still haven't digested it all yet.

583
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,350
Cuba?

584
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:13,680
Since it's a big business, I'm thinking I should go until it's fully built.

585
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,220
Chief Lee is going there, too.

586
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,680
Wait, why does it need to be that long?

587
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,250
I'll come to visit often.

588
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:25,460
So since you know the most about the hotel,

589
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,690
I am hoping you'll transfer to the General Management team.

590
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,200
I think I'd feel at ease if I left it to you.

591
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,780
What are you saying?

592
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,570
I'm not skilled enough for that,

593
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:39,620
and the professional management is already running the hotel in Cuba well.

594
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,520
You should come with us.

595
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,650
You go ahead.

596
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,260
You're suffering a lot, aren't you?

597
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:07,190
My father is the one suffering. I'm fine.

598
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,560
I know, even if you don't say it.

599
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,630
What brings you here?

600
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,160
I'm talking about CEO Jeong Woo Seok's shares.

601
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,250
You know that he got all the shares from Taegyeong's shareholders and has them now, right?

602
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,970
He's saying that he'll give them all to you.

603
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,670
What do you think?

604
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,570
Just leave him be.

605
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,850
Soo Hyeon, Woo Seok is doing this because he's thinking of you, so—

606
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,630
I know everything.

607
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:42,690
I also found out why you agreed to Woo Seok coming in

608
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,170
as Co-CEO.

609
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,960
You were upset, weren't you?

610
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,130
I understand why you couldn't tell me.

611
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,930
Since you said that you know everything, then I'll speak comfortably. Accept the shares.

612
00:57:55,930 --> 00:58:02,220
Since Assemblyman Cha and Taegyeong's relationship is like this, wouldn't it have some meaning in the court case to take the hotel?

613
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,920
Take this chance to secure the shares and—

614
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:09,180
No. Managing the shares and assets aren't that important.

615
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:15,080
I think that just being able to work at Donghwa Hotel is meaningful.

616
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:19,950
It's true that this hotel started because of Taegyeong Group, so please leave Jeong Woo Seok's shares as they are.

617
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,750
I don't think it's something that I should receive.

618
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,550
Kim Jin Hyeok.

619
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,330
Let's eat together.

620
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,690
Did you come back because of me?

621
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,720
I am not crazy about the soup and rice.

622
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,520
Sit down.

623
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,890
I have a personal question.

624
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:06,420
The CEO said that she was going on a long business trip to Cuba.

625
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:09,250
I thought that it was strange.

626
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:13,190
Did something happen between you and the CEO, Jin Hyeok?

627
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,560
She said that she'd be in Cuba until the construction was complete,

628
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:24,650
but she's not someone who would leave this hotel behind and do that.

629
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:30,570
You know that your father made a huge decision, right?

630
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,240
I know.

631
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,250
Not anyone can do that.

632
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:40,270
Not anyone could make this kind of decision after coming so far in the political world.

633
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,160
Yes.

634
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,240
He showed such courage, so do you think it's okay for you to be like this?

635
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,400
I'm okay. It's because I'm worried about Dad.

636
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,000
But why did you break up with him?

637
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,170
I heard it from Mi Jin.

638
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:00,360
Even if Mi Jin didn't say anything, I sensed it.

639
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,180
We didn't break up because of what happened with Dad.

640
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,600
Soo Hyeon.

641
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,720
Yes?

642
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,400
You didn't know that your dad and Jin Hyeok met, right?

643
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:18,280
I think that he met with Jin Hyeok to ask him to take care of you because he was going to do this.

644
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,480
But if you do this, how do you think your dad would feel?

645
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:26,600
He did it so that you won't have to live such a difficult life.

646
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,720
That's why he gathered the courage to do it.

647
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:35,450
I have to stay by your side and protect you. I made a promise to do so.

648
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,250
So don't say things like that...

649
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:42,900
But...

650
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,540
Why are you abandoning me?

651
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:54,430
♫  You can't start entering ♫

652
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:57,680
Because I feel like I'm being too selfish.

653
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,210
You've endured so much until now. How are you selfish?

654
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:04,870
It's just because my very existence

655
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:08,920
can become a burden to someone else.
♫ I won't ever ♫

656
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:17,350
♫ lose my heart to you. ♫

657
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:23,320
♫  The more I like you ♫

658
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:30,250
♫  The more I depend on you ♫

659
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,710
♫  The heart I'm unwilling to lose ♫

660
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:41,700
♫  The heart that is unwilling to depart ♫

661
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:05,110
♫  The more I like you ♫

662
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:12,050
♫  The more I depend on you ♫

663
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:16,370
♫  My feeling grows bigger ♫

664
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:19,990
♫  My feelings won't stop ♫

665
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:22,950
♫  No matter what happens ♫

666
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:28,210
♫  My heart will never ever ♫

667
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:32,550
♫  go to you ♫

668
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:49,330
They're going crazy on the news.

669
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:53,580
Is that person alright?

670
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:59,880
This is the hardest time for her,

671
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,200
but there's nothing that I can do for her.

672
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,300
She said we should break up.

673
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,970
That person...

674
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,710
already broke up with me.

675
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,350
What about you?

676
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,600
I should also...

677
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,380
break up with her now.

678
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:36,050
Let's just wait a little while.

679
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:38,890
She just needs time.

680
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,900
I had made up my mind to do that,

681
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:52,100
but that person's feelings persuaded me.

682
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,800
I thought

683
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,200
that I had taken her

684
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:05,700
out of a high and remote castle.

685
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,530
But once I heard what she had to say,

686
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,100
I felt once again

687
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:21,980
that she would be trapped in a castle by my side.

688
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,710
What kind of castle?

689
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:30,530
A castle of guilt.

690
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,800
Guilt that everyone would either suffer

691
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,400
or have to walk on eggshells for her sake.

692
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,700
If she

693
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,200
gets trapped in that same guilt again,

694
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:56,820
what meaning would this love have?

695
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,030
So that's why...

696
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,850
I'm going to let her go.

697
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,660
Donghwa Hotel

698
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:48,160
She said that she's going on a long business trip to Cuba.

699
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,870
She said that she'd go there until the hotel construction is complete.

700
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:55,440
But she's not someone who would leave this hotel behind and do that.

701
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:07,510
What's with that face?

702
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:09,850
Don't be hurt.

703
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:14,030
Jin Hyeok, I'm sorry.

704
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:48,740
Letter of resignation

705
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:51,490
Department: Donghwa Hotel Public Relations
Position: Team Member
Name: Kim Jin Hyeok

706
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,990
We cheer for you!
Donghwa Hotel Public Relations Team. Kim Jin Hyeok, fighting!

707
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,630
The reason I am

708
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:46,380
resigning from Donghwa Hotel is...

709
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,990
The reason...

710
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:53,340
Soo Hyeon, why do you like me?

711
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,550
I like you because you're Kim Jin Hyeok.

712
01:08:55,550 --> 01:09:00,090
Because you're the one and only Kim Jin Hyeok in the world.

713
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:03,690
Kim Jin Hyeok, why did you come here?

714
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:05,700
I'll get in trouble later.

715
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,530
Today, just do as I say.

716
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:11,750
I'm afraid that you will get hurt.

717
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,410
Don't be frightened.

718
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:16,310
Can we do that?

719
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,600
You're going to let us do that, right?

720
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,850
No matter what happens,

721
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:24,400
I'll protect you. So all you have to do is be happy.

722
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,600
I'll do that.

723
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,060
Thank you.

724
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:32,290
Thank you for coming all the way here to see me because you missed me.

725
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:35,470
What are you thanking me for?

726
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:38,640
You always did that for me, Jin Hyeok.

727
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:50,930
Just in case there might be a situation

728
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:55,540
where we'll have to endure some things,

729
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,840
let's fight through with the good memories we made, from Cuba until today.

730
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:05,000
I wanted to ask you this if I saw you again. If you have a boyfriend.
From the Fruit Vendor.

731
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:18,980

Don't cry too much.

It'd have been nice if he ate before he left.

You are a cool person. I cheer for your feelings.

Please tell her not to worry.

745
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:27,300
No matter what she hears, it's just a process...
