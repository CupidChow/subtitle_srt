1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,810
Encounter

2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,250
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,780
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,030
Boyfriend

5
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,390
Isn't consistently playing dumb from the article to the message board

6
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,490
an inappropriate treatment?

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Isn't the damage to the company's image very serious?

8
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,960
Let's go.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,470
CEO!

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,420
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon!

11
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,600
Are you going home?

12
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,850
I have some money.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,980
I will treat you today.
♫ You can't start entering ♫

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,930
Do you want to go eat ramen with me?
♫ into my heart like this ♫

15
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:38,500
- What's going on?
- So that man was Kim Jin Hyeok?

16
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,800
- Jin Hyeok!
- So that man was him?

17
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,810
Since there will be too much traffic at the rest stop,

18
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,290
today, have cup of ramen at a convenience store with me.

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,260
♫ The more I like you ♫

20
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,170
I'll buy.
♫ The more I depend on you ♫

21
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,620
♫ The heart I'm unwilling to lose ♫

22
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,650
♫ The heart that is unwilling to depart ♫

23
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,030
Is this for real, Department Head?

24
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,420
Episode 5

25
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,980
Should I head to a convenience store, CEO?

26
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,090
Please drop Kim Jin Hyeok off, someplace quiet.

27
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,100
It is awkward for this combination of people to eat ramen together.

28
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,590
Right.

29
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,490
Please stop the car at a quiet place.

30
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,200
There is a good place to pull over up ahead, Manager Nam.

31
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,100
- You can get out right over there, Secretary Jang.
- What? Me?

32
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,530
Then, Secretary Jang and I will get off.

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,890
This is not a thing to just laugh off, Manager, you see?

34
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,360
We are not in a social club or something. Why must we go to a convenience store as a group?

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,040
Right, CEO?

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,540
If you are disappointed, Secretary Jang,

37
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,790
you can stop by a convenience store with Manager Nam.

38
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,150
I see...

39
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,290
Oh, this is serious.

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,570
CEO, please reconsider. This could cause a headache.

41
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,600
Ahjussi, you have to say something! What are you doing?

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,390
- Hey. How long has it been? Maybe 25 years?
- What?

43
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,090
How long it's been since I've seen such a cool guy.

44
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,930
I was just like that about 25 years ago.

45
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,170
- I'm going crazy.
- You don't have a man like that, do you?

46
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,420
Taxi!

47
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,760
Let's go to a convenience store, Mi Jin.

48
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,830
Baby! Let's go eat ramen together!

49
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,700
Baby! Baby!

50
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,450
You weren't serious about going to the convenience store, right? I'll drop you off at home.

51
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,270
No. If you eat ramen at this time, your face can swell up.

52
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,180
So let's go to an amazing tea house.

53
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,990
No. There must be an amazing place somewhere with another claw machine.

54
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,250
On such a heart-racing day

55
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,950
there is a perfect tea house we can go to.

56
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,580
Up ahead, make a right.

57
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,800
Did you say this is the tea house?

58
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,700
Aigoo, Jin Hyeok! Oh my!

59
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,050
- Teacher!
- Aigoo!

60
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,490
- I almost forgot your face.
- It's been a long time, right?

61
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,190
Why have you lost so much weight?

62
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,000
- But you have gotten more beauti—
- Why you—

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,530
Was Cuba fun?

64
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,380
Yes. Extremely!

65
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:47,220
This is my... friend... that I met in Cuba.

66
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,390
Oh, really?

67
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,500
Welcome. This place feels unfamiliar to you, right?

68
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,170
It seems like a private place. Excuse me for intruding.

69
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,350
I think everyone who likes tea is a good friend.

70
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,570
Since Jin Hyeok has come, shall I bring you some fine tea?

71
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,180
Yes!

72
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,270
Please, make yourself comfortable.

73
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,380
It's nice, right?

74
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,990
This is the teacher I told you about in Cuba.

75
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,130
I told you about the person who owned a photo studio who was my dad's friend.

76
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,880
The person who gave you the camera?

77
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,660
Yes. She is that man's wife.

78
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,080
She was a school teacher, but...

79
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,690
after her husband died, she spent time travelling.

80
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,150
This building looks like a church.

81
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,080
Right. The empty church building was for sale at a bargain price. It's unique, right?

82
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,830
Stay here for just a moment. I'll go help her.

83
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,930
Is she your girlfriend?

84
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,710
Excuse me?

85
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,000
Aren't you here to introduce her to me?

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,280
Ah, that's not it...

87
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,970
It's because I had to calm down.

88
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,720
Why? You've confessed to her.

89
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,740
If I confess to her, will she accept it?

90
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,200
Look here.

91
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,540
You look ugly tonight. Next time.

92
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,950
Well, my handsomeness is going up a level day by day.

93
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,700
I think your eyesight is getting a bit weak.

94
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,050
- What did you say?
- Take a closer look, Teacher.

95
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,230
Never mind! Today, I won't look! I won't look. I'm not looking!

96
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,820
- How does the tea taste?
- It's mellow. I like it.

97
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,130
We have a lot of different teas here.

98
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,160
You can try all of them before you leave. I—

99
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,970
Where are you going?

100
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,270
The owner of a tea house served tea. I am done here.

101
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,300
Can you watch over the place for a bit?

102
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,850
I have to go give a massage for the elderly lady that lives in the upper neighborhood.

103
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,970
I won't be long.

104
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,660
Jin Hyeok. I found a good tea that recently came from Kunming,

105
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,660
so try that one too. It's good!

106
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,660
Of course. Come back soon!

107
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,820
Have you calmed down a bit?

108
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,520
Thanks to you, I was shocked. And thanks to you, I was able to calm down.

109
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm sorry for surprising you.

110
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,900
But I don't regret it.

111
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,630
Jin Hyeok, starting tomorrow things are going to get hard at the company,

112
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,600
since everyone knows now.

113
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,720
There will be more gossip and rumors.

114
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,670
CEO, I've made a decision. That's why I stepped forward.

115
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,500
What kind of decision?

116
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,760
Is it a decision to bear the brunt of the gossip of everyone at the company?

117
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,560
While drinking good tea, I can't swear.

118
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,480
Jin Hyeok, I'm not joking around.

119
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,180
You are saying what I wanted to say to you.

120
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,200
I'm not joking, either.

121
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,250
I'd like to try to become a significant person to you.

122
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,680
That's the decision I made.

123
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,590
♫ When love shines  ♫

124
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,650
♫ The moments which are as beautiful as a falling star ♫

125
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,370
That's enough. Get up.
♫ I won't let go ♫

126
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,630
No. We have to watch over the tea house. She hasn't returned yet.

127
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,080
There are a lot of expensive teas here. We can't leave this place unattended.

128
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,180
And tea, when you brew it a second time

129
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,280
it tastes the best.

130
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,700
♫ are embedded and permeate my heart ♫

131
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,220
♫ I know I belong to you ♫

132
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,860
♫ Wishing the moment I'm looking at you like this  ♫

133
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,370
♫ lasts forever ♫

134
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,620
♫ Now  ♫

135
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,320
♫ I belong to you ♫

136
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,280
♫ Facing you my feeling only grows more and more intense ♫

137
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,640
CEO!

138
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,170
I will treat you today,

139
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,000
so would you like to go eat ramen with me?

140
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,500
One, two!

141
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,120
Since I'm having lunch with my mom and dad, let's meet up later.

142
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,660
I'm also eating with my family. Let's keep in touch.

143
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,930
We will meet up later and really tear it up, all right?

144
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,370
What are you doing, Hye In? Shall we go together?

145
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,520
My parents are already on their way. My dad must be there now.

146
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,510
I think we will probably take pictures there and be going together. You guys go ahead.

147
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,390
Then let's text each other.

148
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,220
- See you later!
- Bye.

149
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,980
Hye In!

150
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,620
Jin Hyeok!

151
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,130
Congratulations on your graduation.

152
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,630
I get to visit a girl's high school thanks to you.

153
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,580
How did you come here? How about your part-time job?

154
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,530
I switched shifts. Your father couldn't make it?

155
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,170
No, I told him to stay with my mom at the hospital.

156
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,340
Then let's have lunch together and go to the hospital. Your mom's surgery went well, right?

157
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,680
Yeah.

158
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,800
It's still a graduation so I should take a photo.

159
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,420
I really didn't think you'd come. Thank you.

160
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,710
What's there to be thankful for? Of course, I'd come. What are friends for? Look this way.

161
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,480
One, two, three.

162
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,120
Let's take one together.

163
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,360
Look over here. Congratulations, Hye In.

164
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,690
One, two, three.

165
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,770
Then what am I

166
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,110
supposed to do, Jin Hyeok?

167
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,090
Excuse me,

168
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,370
please do me a favor.

169
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,690
Yes. If it's something I can do.

170
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,060
Text Kim Jin Hyeok and tell him to stop by here.

171
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,620
Why don't you do it yourself?

172
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,000
If I do it, he won't come.

173
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,460
I thought this the last time, too. You are in a money lending business, aren't you?

174
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,160
Jin Hyeok isn't the type to spend that kind of money.

175
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,880
What makes you think I'm in a money lending business?

176
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,510
My goodness. People always think I'm a professor when I go out. You can't tell by looks.

177
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,520
Even though I don't know anything about you, I can tell you aren't an academic person.

178
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,710
Whatever, you send the text yourself.

179
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,690
I'm not saying that you look igorant. Hey! Send the text!

180
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,660
So loud, seriously!

181
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,390
Why are you getting angry while asking for a favor?

182
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,440
If someone saw you, they'd think you were a hysterical old maid.

183
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,570
Do I look like an old maid to you?

184
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,550
You think you look that youthful? I think not.

185
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,710
Are you picking a fight now?

186
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,770
Why would I fight with a woman I've seen exactly twice?

187
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,140
Then why are you picking fights?

188
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,910
You're the one who started it. What a strange ahjumma you are!

189
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,550
Ahjumma? Ahjumma?!

190
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,820
If you aren't an old maid then you must be an ahjumma.

191
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,280
I am a young lady. I'm not an ahjumma. Why do I have to explain myself?

192
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,700
I don't need to know, nor do I care to.

193
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,460
Here. If I send the text, you'll stay quiet, right?

194
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,960
Just know that I'm holding it in because I really have to meet Kim Jin Hyeok today.

195
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,660
Stupid whelks.

196
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,310
They're tasty whelks, you should know.

197
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,870
Are you saying that young lad interfered on his own?

198
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,210
They're not in their right minds. So what are you going to do now?

199
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,910
Are you going to let CEO Cha get away like that?

200
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,000
I only trust you, Director Choi. I hope you will not disappoint me.

201
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,500
What were you saying?

202
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,260
Cha Soo Hyeon has lost her mind with that young kid.

203
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,350
What kind of humiliating behavior is this, in front of all the employees?

204
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,920
Humiliating, so humiliating.

205
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,180
Did something... happen?

206
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,300
I don't want to say any more on the matter.

207
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,040
Mother, what do you mean about letting "CEO Cha get away like that?"

208
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,080
Do we have to sit by and watch Donghwa Hotel crumble?

209
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,530
If the CEO loses her mind, a new CEO needs to step in.

210
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,240
That hotel is her business, Mother.

211
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,650
Who gave it to her?

212
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,170
Did you forget it was given to her as alimony?

213
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,400
Why would I forget?

214
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,360
I thought it had finally become something, but she brings it to ruin like this.

215
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,270
I need to call a board meeting and get rid of her.

216
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,190
Secretary Kim, find out what happened at Donghwa Hotel today.

217
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:34,690
CEO, the painting that you were waiting for in Sokcho, were you able to get it back?

218
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,960
It went well.

219
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,230
You went through a hard time with it so I'm glad it went well.

220
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,130
I don't know much about art and paintings but

221
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,140
it lifts your spirits to look at the exhibits displayed in my neighborhood.

222
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,220
Is there an art gallery there?

223
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,280
Yes. There's a painting from a painter who was famous in the 1940s.

224
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,560
And there are landscape paintings by a foreign painter, whose name I don't quite know.

225
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,370
If you have time, go check it out.

226
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,990
That's strange. I know of all the art galleries though.

227
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,860
- There's something like that in Hongje-dong?
- Yes.

228
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,370
I think you're lying.

229
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:13,510
What's the name of the art gallery? Are you talking about the ones near Buam-dong?

230
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,950
I'm sure it's in my neighborhood. I'll bet my name on it, Docent Kim Jin Hyeok of Hongje-dong.

231
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,730
You have so many titles. You called yourself "the excavator of Hongje-dong", and now you are a docent?

232
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,250
I'll explain all the paintings if you ever come by.

233
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,750
Oh, you can let me off up there.

234
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,540
I'll take the subway.

235
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,900
So, Kim Jin Hyeok,

236
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,650
starting tomorrow the office will be...

237
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:42,420
After what happened, if we act awkward or avoid each other, that will make us look really bad.

238
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,210
So, starting tomorrow, the two of us must become even closer.

239
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,290
The workplace isn't a casual place like that.

240
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,480
You think I'd be so immature to call you "Noona" there?

241
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,710
Is my saying "Noona" that funny to you?

242
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,670
It is laughable.

243
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,960
Call me if you want to go to the art gallery. Did you delete the picture taken of my phone number?

244
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,870
I'll write it again for you.

245
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,880
010-432-2026.

246
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,950
I memorized it when you wrote it on your palm. I am smart.

247
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,990
Wow. I knew you were different.

248
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,600
But why haven't you texted me once then?

249
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,140
I had no reason to.

250
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,680
You have my number. Why aren't you giving me yours?

251
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,030
When did I ask for it? You're the one who wrote it down for me, Jin Hyeok.

252
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:43,140
Yeah. It feels like we've got closer since you call me Jin Hyeok, right?

253
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,570
You can get out now.

254
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,750
I'll stop joking with you now.

255
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,680
I was doing it because I thought you might be scared after what happened today.

256
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm not scared. I have chutzpah.

257
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,470
See? It's not such a big deal once you can laugh about it.

258
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,710
CEO, you're the CEO of Donghwa Hotel,

259
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,000
and Assemblyman Cha's daughter, and you were Taegyeong Group's daughter-in-law.

260
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,380
That is the sort of person you are, so I have to be formal with you.

261
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,050
There's no need for you to do that.

262
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,500
That's right. We shouldn't have to do that.

263
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,520
There you go with the "we" again. I said not to say that.

264
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,510
Is there a reason why I mustn't?

265
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,470
I'm going.

266
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,100
If you get intimidated, you lose. And if you worry, you look worse.

267
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,910
Sleep well.

268
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,550
Oh, you're here?

269
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,710
What about Jin Myeong?

270
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,390
Oh, he left work early. He has an important game tournament to attend.

271
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,860
Good grief. What kind of part-time worker is that?

272
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,030
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

273
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,970
Should we have a seat?

274
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,750
You created a huge mess, Kim Jin Hyeok.

275
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,500
I was only telling the truth.

276
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,700
As you well know, CEO didn't do anything that deserves such harsh words.

277
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,400
Actually, I was a little moved. It must not have been easy to step forward like that.

278
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,690
I'm her secretary, so I always think about her perspective first.

279
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,940
And I'm worried about what will happen tomorrow.

280
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,920
The reason for waiting for you today

281
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
is to say I'm thankful for everything you did up to now.

282
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,070
So now just ignore her and pretend you don't know her anymore.

283
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,220
You were strangers to begin with.

284
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,700
If you make things so serious like this,

285
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,000
it will make things weirder. So we decided to be more casual from now on.

286
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,060
"W-We? We?"

287
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,740
Did you just refer to you and CEO Cha as "we?"

288
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:45,530
Yes. That's correct. It's a first person pronoun which includes me.

289
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,480
Oh, my head hurts.

290
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,830
Excuse me!

291
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,840
Yes?

292
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,900
Give me a bottle of soju.

293
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,300
You should have whelks on the side. They're very delicious here.

294
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,490
This place is so weird.

295
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,360
Jin Hyeok, the car is here.

296
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,170
What's up with that woman?

297
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,290
What's your relationship with her?

298
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,780
She's a senior at my company.

299
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,220
She works at such a company?

300
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,360
What a waste for that company.

301
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,690
She should drink in moderation.

302
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,460
I'm the only friend Soo Hyeon has left.

303
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,020
She's super rich but has never dated once.

304
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,100
And she was sold off in marriage by her mother.

305
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,670
You're too young to handle Soo Hyeon.

306
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,740
You think Taegyeong Group is an easy opponent?

307
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,880
Her father's politics?

308
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,100
He couldn't have made it to that position without Taegyeong Group.

309
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,150
So they're forever indebted to them.

310
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,240
They are a family that can summon their divorced daughter-in-law to attend all their birthday parties.

311
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,320
If she doesn't go, she will be in a huge trouble.

312
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,410
But this resolute woman never cries. It kills me inside.

313
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,580
What kind of life is that, CEO?

314
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:51,070
♫ Is this what they have been calling love? ♫

315
00:22:51,070 --> 00:23:00,240
♫ It just goes on, oh take me on to you ♫

316
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,800
That's right. It's not a big deal.

317
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,600
♫ You're my flower and I'm your bee ♫

318
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,880
♫ You know you keep me alive ♫

319
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:20,000
♫ You're my reasons for everything I do ♫

320
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,380
♫ The other half ♫

321
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm not joking either.
♫ of me ♫

322
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,490
I'd like to try to become a significant person to you.

323
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,850
That's the decision I made.

324
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:36,730
After what happened, if we act awkward or avoid each other, that will make us look really bad.

325
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,390
So, starting tomorrow, the two of us must become even closer.

326
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,530
Do you think I would be so immature as to call you "Noona?"

327
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:49,060
♫ I'll go wherever world you're on ♫

328
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,810
Good morning, CEO.

329
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,280
Hello, CEO.

330
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,600
Hello.

331
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,970
CEO came to work as if nothing had happened. What to do?

332
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,500
In the hotel lobby?

333
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,580
Yes, that's what I heard.

334
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,440
Good work.

335
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,280
Secretary Kim.

336
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,760
Yes, CEO?

337
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,680
Look into that employee. Everything about him.

338
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,600
I think he's that new employee?

339
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,630
I saw him yesterday.

340
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,290
This is the most shocking thing since I started working here.

341
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,230
Isn't this huge, Hye In?

342
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,760
What kind of thing?

343
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,530
It's a huge thing for both of them.

344
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,620
Hello!

345
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,030
Hello! Hello.

346
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,200
Here comes the owner of a strong rope (backup).

347
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,980
Excuse me?

348
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,500
I was just talking to myself. Did you hear me?

349
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,410
Jin Hyeok.

350
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,440
Honestly, what's your relationship with our CEO?

351
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,690
We met accidentally in the past.

352
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,810
But after getting this job, I discovered she's the CEO of Donghwa Hotel.

353
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,280
Sheesh, you expect me to believe that?

354
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,140
She's practically a celebrity.

355
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,210
I didn't know because I'm not interested in stuff like that.

356
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,220
You should get back into the working mode, Assistant Park.

357
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,320
Yes.

358
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,620
It appears you had too much to drink last night, Secretary Jang.

359
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,480
Yes, thanks to you.

360
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,050
You should have stuck to cup noodles. How much did you drink?

361
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,070
I drank so much that I even left my wallet at the bar.

362
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,960
I've never done such a thing before. But last night, of all nights...

363
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,050
Did you know there's an art gallery in Hongje-dong?

364
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,470
Just hearing "Hongje-dong" makes me want to barf. I don't even want to know.

365
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:52,810
The two of you, which includes Kim Jin Hyeok, who has decided to use a first-person pronoun "we."

366
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,330
I don't know anymore, do whatever you two want.

367
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,550
What are you talking about?

368
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,910
I heard you agreed to casually be a "we."

369
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,590
You met with Jin Hyeok?

370
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,910
Jin Hyeok—

371
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,440
I'm feeling sick again.

372
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,160
Go and sober up.

373
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,160
I'm going to have a black coffee to match my black insides.

374
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,330
One for me, too, please.

375
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,240
No! Make it yourself!

376
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,090
Hyung, what's your unlock code?

377
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,830
To do what?

378
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,210
Let's sign you up for a dating service.

379
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,530
How long are you going to play patty-cake with whelks here?

380
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,700
- A blind date?
- Yes.

381
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,550
Why would I do that just to meet people?

382
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,080
Trust me. Everyone meets people this way.

383
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,800
Hurry.

384
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,020
Even your pattern is so like you, Dae Chan.

385
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,760
If we install the app and enter your information,

386
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,460
the women will start pouring in.

387
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,720
No way!

388
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,990
Bro, let me take a profile pic for you where your face doesn't show that well.

389
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,020
No, no. If you're going to take it, make it show clearly.

390
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,390
Hyung, do you want to get kicked off with bad ratings?

391
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,370
Hey, what's wrong with my face?

392
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,250
It's kind of...

393
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,550
Put this hand in front of your facial hair.

394
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,830
Like this?

395
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,730
The opposite side.

396
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,500
What a pain. Like this?

397
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,780
- Okay.
- Take a good one.

398
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,180
Women don't really like facial hair.... one, two three.

399
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,060
Oh, my head!

400
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,250
Today we have two new members.

401
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,640
I see we've got some new members.

402
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,130
Let's take a look. Someone who will take this headache away in a flash.

403
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,450
Lee Dae Chan
Age: 36

404
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,220
Oh, my head!

405
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,270
He's seems a little familiar.

406
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,380
Where did I see him?

407
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,280
Is he a Donghwa employee?

408
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,590
A franchise restaurant owner?

409
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,950
Chicken? Pizza?

410
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,800
A family restaurant?

411
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,110
About merging with the Hwangmin Party

412
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,700
let's not mention it anymore.

413
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,550
The members are on the same page.

414
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,470
But Taegyeong will place a lot of pressure.

415
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,270
We can't leave politics in the hands of a business.

416
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,340
They should make their demands reasonable.

417
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,800
We can't be pushed around like this any longer.

418
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,210
Combining parties? It is possible if they have the same goals and beliefs.

419
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:37,550
But our Moonhwa Party and the Hwangmin Party, each has totally different identities.

420
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:42,720
We simply need to stay steady on the path we've been traveling.

421
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,410
Should we eat lunch out today?

422
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,470
The pork cutlet restaurant was good.

423
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,040
It's okay. We can just eat in the cafeteria.

424
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,810
You were pretty shocked, too, weren't you?

425
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,450
A little.

426
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,310
Jin Hyeok,

427
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:06,180
about the posting on the employee bulletin board...

428
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,780
Oh, darling, let's eat.

429
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,920
Sure.

430
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,850
What were you saying?

431
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,980
Never mind. Let's talk later. Go eat.

432
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,310
It's that guy.

433
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,250
That guy?

434
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,640
He's good-looking.

435
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:39,040
I'm sorry, Assistant Manager. I'm not feeling well.

436
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,430
Oh, alright. It's better to get rest then.

437
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,090
Sunbaenim, that man is my hoobae.

438
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,960
Walk Signal

439
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,050
It's Kim Jin Hyeok.

440
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,520
Is he skipping lunch?

441
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,630
If you can laugh about it, it's not such a big deal—

442
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,660
You have the app for the radio station, right?

443
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,830
Director, you should use your cell phone to download the app to listen to the radio.

444
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,270
There will be a lot of good songs that you can listen to.

445
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,480
When I'm bored I listen to the radio.

446
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,650
What do you think about requesting a song from the DJ you like from the radio station?

447
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,120
I'm thinking about running away since the weather is so nice.

448
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,880
I'm not able to because I can't muster up the courage to do it on my own.

449
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,790
I think it's not something the CEO of a company like me should know about.

450
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,540
Then, CEO, would you like to come with me,

451
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,050
since playing hooky together with the company CEO would be safe?

452
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,220
Do you want me to get permission to take the afternoon off so we can go to the art gallery in Hongje-dong?

453
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,100
The weather is really nice out there.

454
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,730
I don't think I can since I have such a busy schedule.

455
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:32,440
Shall we play hooky in a safe fashion, with the company CEO?

456
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,360
Forget wearing anything elegant.

457
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,510
But I strongly recommend you to wear your jogging outfit.

458
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,680
He is a weird guy.

459
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,060
You're not feeling well?

460
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,820
No, I feel fine.

461
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,720
Well, it's not that...

462
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,890
You can be honest with me.

463
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,450
I'm not really feeling unwell or anything.

464
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,190
All right. You can take an early leave today, since we don't have anything urgent to take care of and all.

465
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,680
Sorry, ma'am.

466
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,730
He has awesome connections.

467
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,300
I have somewhere else to be, so you can give me back the car now and you can be off for the day.

468
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,690
That's good since I have to go and see Assemblyman Cha because he wanted me to go see him today.

469
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,620
You got caught, didn't you, Ahjussi?

470
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,050
Why would I get caught when I didn't even do anything wrong?

471
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,060
I think Mom will be calling me anytime soon.

472
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,300
See?

473
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,460
Yes.

474
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,850
Where are you at now?

475
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,130
I'm out on a business trip.

476
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,270
Where to?!

477
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,580
Busan.

478
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,470
You're coming back today, right?

479
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,620
I have to take a look at my appointment book.

480
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,070
Are you really going to do this to me?!

481
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,510
I have to go into a meeting, so I will talk to you later.

482
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:17,940
Does this mean I also have to go do something in Busan too?

483
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,920
Send the message to my dad. Let him know that we'll make it seem as if I went to Busan.

484
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,830
Okay.

485
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,660
Soo Hyeon.

486
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,990
Yes.

487
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,860
Nobody can stop flowers from blooming when the spring wind blows.

488
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:37,270
Even if you try to hold out and stop from blooming, eventually the flowers bloom in the end.

489
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,110
Yes.

490
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,660
What? What just passed by me?

491
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,650
Oh my, is it you, Jin Hyeok?

492
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,180
Hey, what are you doing here at this time of the day?

493
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,100
Because I'm not feeling well. I mean, because I have an appointment.

494
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,830
What does he mean?

495
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,390
See? I strongly recommended that you wear a jogging outfit, didn't I?

496
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,880
We're going to have to walk a bit, so please put this on.

497
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,990
It's okay. Do I look that cold to you? You're always putting something on me.

498
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,770
Just in case you might really be cold.

499
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:51,130
Why did we come here? I thought you wanted to see an art exhibition.

500
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,260
To see an art exhibition.

501
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,130
I want to leave.

502
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,660
I'm not lying, right?

503
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,950
You call this an art gallery?

504
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:18,090
Uh-huh. Because there's art to look at and we also have a person called Cha Soo Hyeon who likes to look at art here too.

505
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:22,920
There's also Kim Jin Hyeok, who happens to like this person named Cha Soo Hyeon who likes to look at art.

506
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,400
What more is there to an art gallery?

507
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,130
Your hands please.

508
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,140
There's more art to look at till all the way over there. There's a lot of good art to look at too.

509
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,190
I was fooled.

510
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:48,330
Shall we walk? Why don't you listen to the docent of Hongje-dong?

511
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:54,420
First of all, this painting is by a person named Lee Jong Seob and its title is Gobu.

512
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,360
Lee Jong Seob is one of the most famous Western-style artists here in Korea.

513
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,140
I wonder if he is even cleaning his room these days?

514
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,530
What's this?

515
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,850
- Mom.
- Oh, you startled me.

516
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,990
I want food.

517
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,890
When did you come home?

518
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,460
Earlier in the evening before going to work, because I needed some sleep.

519
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,590
You're half awake there, boy. Hey, Jin Myeong.

520
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,390
Yeah, Mom?

521
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,890
Do you know what this is?

522
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,020
Mom, did you buy a pair of dress shoes for yourself?

523
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,890
No, they're in your brother's room...

524
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,800
He probably bought them for you, Mom.

525
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,010
- For me?
- Yup.

526
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,610
Why don't you try them on, Mom? Or maybe not?

527
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,490
Maybe they're not for me.

528
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,020
This is my favorite artwork.

529
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,600
I always take a look at this when I'm here to exercise.

530
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,400
Where, when, as what will the two of us meet again?
(painting by Kim Whanki made in 1970).

531
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,500
At first I thought this wasn't even art since there were so many random squares.

532
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,810
But the more I look at it, the more I fall deeply into it.

533
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,700
The texture of the colors is the result of so much patience and hard work.

534
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,730
I really like this artist. I really like his early works as well.

535
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,820
Don't you really like the title of this one?

536
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,510
'Where, when, as what will the two of us meet again?'

537
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,690
I heard it is from a famous poem called 'In The Evening.'
(by Kim Gwang Seop)

538
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,060
Among a multitude of stars, one stares down at me.

539
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:37,140
Among a multitude of people, I stare up at that one star.

540
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:41,370
"You, one so warm, and me, one so tender, "

541
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,150
"Where, when, as what will the two of us meet again?"

542
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,390
Oh, you know it too?

543
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,990
I didn't know the poem originally.

544
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,160
However, I learned it because I like the painting so much.

545
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,990
They met in Cuba while she was broke.

546
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:02,730
And they met each other again at work as an employer and employee.

547
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,020
Our relationship is quite interesting too.

548
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:11,190
The more I hear it, the more I get used to it. "We," the first person pronoun.

549
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:19,860
I wonder where, when, as what will the two of us meet again?

550
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,690
Nothing more will change between us.

551
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:35,090
The sun's about to go down and since we're done looking at the painting,

552
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,100
let's go eat something tasty.

553
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,780
No, I need to get going.

554
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,200
I enjoyed looking at all the art.

555
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,220
You're busy, right?

556
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:53,350
If you ask me if I'm busy with that face, then how should I answer you?

557
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:01,960
If you really want to know, let's go somewhere and have a tasty meal.

558
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,830
Cheers.

559
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,820
I feel great drinking soju with you since we haven't in awhile, Assemblyman.

560
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,300
Please don't call me Assemblyman when it's just the two of us.

561
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,900
Hyungnim, you are really busy these days, right?

562
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,460
Same as usual.

563
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,330
How's our Soo Hyeon doing these days?

564
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,790
There's a lot of commotion these days, but it doesn't look so bad to me, Hyungnim.

565
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:33,250
I read the article and Soo Hyeon's mom said something about it yesterday.

566
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:37,520
The young man that you saw on the article is actually a new employee for Donghwa Hotel.

567
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,420
- Oh really?
- Yes.

568
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,130
That kid is really admirable.

569
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,290
In what way?

570
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,950
Someone wrote something on the message board about that kid and Soo Hyeon.

571
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,640
It was something very nasty towards them.

572
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,920
About what?

573
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,230
What's the use of talking about it?

574
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,690
Anyway, Soo Hyeon had to go through a lot of pain because of it.

575
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,660
Then this kid came up forward in front of all those people.

576
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,490
He said, "I'm that guy from the news article."

577
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:02,570
"President Cha is not involved with a person that should make people get into rough and malicious gossip."

578
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,330
I felt so refreshed after hearing that. Isn't that really admirable?

579
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,670
And what did Soo Hyeon say?

580
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,830
She doesn't express it but is really appreciative about it.

581
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,530
Isn't that young and indiscrete man's pushing himself forward making things more difficult for our Soo Hyeon?

582
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:21,600
I guess we have to wait and see about that but I don't think he's the type that would do such a thing, Hyungnim.

583
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:30,050
Here's your seasoned whelk dish.

584
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,460
- Have a drink with us.
- No, I do not drink...

585
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,290
You are doing well, right, mister?

586
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,160
Of course, I am.

587
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,070
Welcome...

588
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

589
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,480
- I forgot my wallet yesterday.
- Oh!

590
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,090
Right up there.

591
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,260
Oh my!

592
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,400
How could you use a clip to hold up my wallet like that?! You know how much this is?!

593
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,930
My goodness. I put it nicely up there so it won''t get chili paste all over it, you know.

594
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,870
Do I have to hear that from you?

595
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,960
How could you say it that you put it nicely up there when you just roughly hung it up?!

596
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,100
You seriously are a strange woman.

597
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,160
Who told you to get drunk off your ass and forget about it?!

598
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,560
Drunk...? How could you even use that kind of expression? It just makes you look cheap.

599
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,910
What brings you here?

600
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:19,370
Wow. What's going on? How come you two... came here together?

601
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:23,550
She was on her way back from an exhibit. I told her I knew a good place to eat.

602
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,550
I just sobered up, but I could use some more alcohol...

603
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,760
Hey, Jin Hyeok. This woman here...

604
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:34,190
I mean, this lady right here. Your sunbaenim at work. Could you please get rid of her?

605
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,850
Am I an object or something? What do you mean "get rid of"? That's nonsense.

606
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,360
Are you dropping honorifics right now? How cheap.

607
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,120
Let's have some whelks together, Secretary Jang.

608
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,450
Forget it.

609
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,560
Why don't you eat with us?

610
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,550
So are you my Jin Hyeok's sunbaenim at work?

611
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,000
Yes, well...

612
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,400
Welcome. I will make it extra delicious for you.

613
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,280
Here, please take a seat.

614
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,730
I think your eyes might cross each other at that rate, Secretary Jang.

615
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,230
Right. Mind your business.

616
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,420
These hoobaenims are nice.

617
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,890
What do you mean hoobaenims?

618
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:17,000
It seems like this lady right here is your hoobae, too.
(looks younger)

619
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,240
What makes you think so?

620
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,160
They are friends, Hyung.

621
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,700
Then, I will go back to the kitchen.

622
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,150
This place is cursed.

623
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,060
Everything is a problem.

624
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,910
But you two are a bigger problem!

625
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,600
Hey, Kim Jin Hyeok. Seriously—

626
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,250
Alright. I will keep my mouth shut.

627
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,570
Is the full moon out over my restaurant?

628
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,190
Your beauty lightens up this place.

629
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,190
Don't look at me. It's blinding.

630
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,050
- My Jin Hyeok, right here...
- Oh, please.

631
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:01,000
- I'm really blind now.
- Oh, come on, no.

632
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,790
Please look after my Jin Hyeok.

633
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,340
He's so naïve.

634
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,920
You're going to want to eat here all the time.

635
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,080
Oh, Amazing! Weren't you at the library?

636
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,220
I'm on my way home, but I needed to buy some pens first. What about you?

637
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:23,320
I need to get a diary.

638
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,850
Right, New Year is around the corner.

639
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,390
Did you decide which one you're getting?

640
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,080
Not yet.

641
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,880
What do you think about this one? Does the color stand out too much?

642
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,500
I like it. The color makes it stand out. I was looking at this one too.

643
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,160
You think so? We have the same taste.

644
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,760
I think that is the best option here.

645
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,380
Right.

646
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,700
Here... Please try this.

647
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,660
Thank you.

648
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,700
No problem.

649
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,310
Thanks.

650
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,820
Hyung.

651
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,070
Had dinner yet?

652
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:27,360
My boss hasn't fed me.

653
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:35,590
This person ... I mean, this lady... That TV—

654
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,890
Introduce yourself. This is my younger brother.

655
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,030
I see. Nice to meet you.

656
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,210
They are Jin Hyeok's sunbaenims at work.

657
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:47,510
Then, that Ramen was you?

658
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,510
What ramen?

659
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:53,970
This is really dramatic.

660
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,180
- Good bye.
- Take care.

661
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,750
What's going on?

662
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,460
Tell me already!

663
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:33,120
Hey, Kim Jin Hyeok! You should've told me earlier.

664
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,140
Didn't know she was such an important person. If I knew,

665
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,540
I would have given her extra noodles on the house!

666
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,060
I didn't know you were that Ramen Guy.

667
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,730
Right, ramen. What is up with that ramen thing?

668
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,480
Be quiet. There are customers.

669
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,520
I should call Mom.

670
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,490
Forget it, forget it. Just keep it to yourself. Mom will get worried.

671
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,560
Why would she? What's going on between you two?

672
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,140
Why?

673
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,280
What's the relationship between you two?

674
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,780
What's the relationship?

675
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,050
Hey, Ramen Guy over there!

676
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,370
Ramen, Ramen!

677
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,080
There's nothing special.

678
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,930
He's from a very ordinary household. Nothing special, Sir.

679
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,880
Donghwa Hotel
Personal Details

680
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,720
It's awkward, isn't it?

681
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,790
Yes.

682
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,890
Should we have a drink?

683
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:01,700
Well, excuse me.

684
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,150
What is it?

685
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,290
It seems that I must make sure that you like me, Jeong Woo Seok.

686
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:09,660
But I'm not good at things like this.

687
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,150
I'd appreciate it if you could be honest.

688
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:18,030
For instance, what do you want in women? I might make myself fit that standard.

689
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,910
Well, I don't have any preferences.

690
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,480
But now, I just got an ideal woman in mind.

691
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:31,330
Can you make it easy for me to understand?

692
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:35,260
I'm not stupid, but with this kind of thing...

693
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,250
I like this kind of woman ...

694
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,950
someone like you, Cha Soo Hyeon.

695
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,690
Soo Hyeon.

696
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:12,760
You know you won't be able to take care of him until the end.

697
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,160
He's a newbie. You are making it hard for him.

698
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,370
I know that too.

699
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,050
That's why I am running away, but I find myself back at the starting point.

700
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,900
It feels like I'm in a maze.

701
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,060
There are enemies everywhere. Even your mom is an enemy.

702
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,840
I hope you'd stop here.

703
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,710
It's upsetting me so much, Mi Jin.

704
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,890
Your enemies?

705
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,820
The timing.

706
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,350
What do you mean?

707
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,120
This kind of...

708
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:48,930
This kind of feeling ...

709
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:52,520
We would have been so much happier if it had come when we were young.

710
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,450
Why now, at this age ...

711
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,200
When everyone knows I'm a divorcee...

712
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,340
The timing sucks. It's unfair.

713
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,900
You like him, don't you?

714
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,080
I don't know.

715
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,080
But I'm more and more curious and want to know him.

716
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,930
The timing really sucks.

717
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:23,640
Thanks for saying that.

718
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,830
Are you going to go for it?

719
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,880
My life doesn't allow that, does it?

720
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:31,950
I'm good with holding things in.

721
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,430
Dozens of sorries are going to come out, Girl.

722
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,820
You are not in Busan.

723
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,200
How dare you to lie to me?

724
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,100
I called the secretary's office. They said you don't have a business trip scheduled.

725
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,600
Let's talk tomorrow. I'm driving.

726
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,950
I wouldn't be able to live as Cha Soo Hyeon, not even for a day.

727
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,360
When you hang in there, time will pass.

728
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:20,130
I wonder if Sokcho had tasty bread and coffee too.

729
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:23,090
I think it was great because it was Cuba.

730
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:35,270
Spending a day, a routine day with someone was exhilarating.

731
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:40,120
But growing distant again is as painful as ever.

732
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:45,830
That's why, I'm going to stop.

733
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,280
Cha Soo Hyeon! That you would be flirting around like a so-called celebrity in a news article

734
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,770
with such an immature young man.

735
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,600
Have I ever done anything to invite scrutiny?

736
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,370
Since Dad got into politics, I couldn't even yawn comfortably.

737
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,180
After being sold off to that family, never mind yawning,

738
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,170
I couldn't even breathe loudly.

739
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,770
And even now, I ...

740
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,610
This is not just playful curiosity.

741
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:20,160
I think when a person enters the heart of another person, it's something meaningful.

742
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,310
CEO, I've made a decision.

743
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:35,390
That is why I stepped forward.

744
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:39,050
Jin Hyeok, I'm not joking.

745
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:41,400
You are saying what I wanted to say to you.

746
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,270
I'd like to try to become a significant person to you.

747
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:48,570
That's the decision I made.

748
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:57,780
See? If you can laugh about it, it is no longer a big deal.

749
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,460
If the main character in the news is our CEO, what happens to our company's image?

750
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,110
It looks like she's completely fixated on a young boy.

751
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:26,060
I'd like to try to become a significant person to you.

752
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,190
That's the decision I made.

753
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,630
Hongnamkyo Bridge

754
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:59,170
How can you see the artwork, when it is so dark?

755
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:01,440
Mr. Kim Jin Hyeok.

756
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,850
It's us. We met again, under Naebu Inner Beltway.

757
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:16,920
What shall we say our meeting again has become?

758
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:22,860
It looks like you caught me.

759
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,960
On this night, right here.

760
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:30,830
I'm good at restraining myself ... And yet, here I am.

761
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,710
I read this in a book once.

762
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:42,730
"Some" (flirting) is when the certainty that you like someone

763
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,820
is in a power struggle with doubt.

764
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:51,020
Certainty and doubt ebb and flow like the tide.

765
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:55,160
And when doubt finally recedes, and only certainty remains,

766
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:59,170
at that moment, love begins.

767
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,120
Power struggle...

768
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,520
CEO.

769
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:22,480
These feelings... to find out if they are feelings of liking someone...

770
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:29,470
what if we allow the certainty and the doubt to fight it out?

771
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,110
Let's say...

772
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,330
here

773
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:01,530
we met again in a "some" relationship?

774
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,100
How about that?

775
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:12,790
"Some relationship" : a relationship which has not yet developed into a commitment

776
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,470
Alright.

777
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:47,890
Let's meet again in a "some" relationship. Let's do that.

778
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:57,870
♫ It feels very small, the tremor in your eyes ♫

779
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:06,350
♫ Even now, I think you will tell me ♫

780
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:09,510
♫ I think you will tell me ♫

781
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:15,730
♫ If you come too close, it is hot ♫

782
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:20,000
♫ If you're too far away, I'm afraid it will be cold. ♫

783
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,680
♫ We are watching. From so far away  ♫

784
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,660
♫ it's as though we are waiting.  ♫
