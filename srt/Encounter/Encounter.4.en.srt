1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,450
Encounter

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,860
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,910
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,290
Boyfriend

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,880
Separately

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,970
Kim Jin Hyeon, the expression "our"...

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,450
I came because I missed you.

8
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,170
Because I wanted to see you,

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,700
that's why I am here.

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,340
Episode 4

11
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,650
It's a good feeling that someone says he misses me.

12
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,210
However, you know it's an extremely dangerous thing to say, right?

13
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,470
I'll act as if I didn't hear it.

14
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,190
The world is really big and wide, right?

15
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,980
There are so many different countries.

16
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,960
And out of those, meeting in one country, one city, and

17
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,150
spending the day together.

18
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,010
We returned after that.

19
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,030
Meeting again as an employee and superior in the same company.

20
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,180
And also spending a short but fun day together.

21
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,060
All of this ...

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,850
is in fact an amazing relationship.

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,380
Your choice of words is a bit off.

24
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,540
It's kind of like spending a day together and

25
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,660
- spending a routine day together.
- Then what should I say?

26
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,680
We didn't spend them separately.

27
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,580
Just...

28
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,120
For a moment, well...

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,030
See? It is correct that we did spend them together.

30
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,340
Let's drink our rice soup.

31
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,670
You aren't just telling me to go now, are you?
Sokcho Rice Soup

32
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,850
I know you're tired but I won't ask you to take a break before leaving.

33
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,530
But even so ... I can see you are saying we must have a cup of coffee.

34
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,280
I found an unbelievably good cafe.

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,300
Really perfect! Let's go.

36
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,410
It's okay.

37
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,870
No, no.

38
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,590
I'm not cold at all.

39
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,300
Shall I say that it's because you are like a heater?

40
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,290
It's warm, right?

41
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,640
Yes, thank you.

42
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,920
Excuse me, Kim Jin Hyeok...

43
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,990
When I was young, I had no friends.

44
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,600
I wanted to play together but

45
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,260
my mom didn't like that.

46
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,980
If I got as close to them as I wanted, I would have to distance myself again.

47
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,520
So starting at some point,

48
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,330
I got used to thinking "from the beginning"

49
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,990
"all of them were nothing special."

50
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,470
♫ You can't enter my heart like this ♫

51
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,370
Distancing myself overnight from a close friend,
♫ You can't enter my heart like this ♫

52
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,900
is very painful.
♫ You can't enter my heart like this ♫

53
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,750
♫ You can't enter my heart like this ♫

54
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:07,570
♫ I will never let you into my heart ♫

55
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,020
I had forgotten for a moment.

56
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,430
♫ I won't ever lose my heart to you ♫

57
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,020
Spending a day,

58
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,580
spending a routine day with someone was exhilarating.

59
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,720
But growing distant again,

60
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:32,200
returning to a place with nothing,
♫ The heart I'm unwilling to lose ♫

61
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,900
it's as painful as ever. That's why ...
♫ The heart that is unwilling to depart
 ♫

62
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,960
I'm going to stop.

63
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,840
Sorry, I was so sleepy.

64
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,140
Spam call.

65
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,270
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,440
Your head is bigger than it looks.

67
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,210
My shoulder is quite delicate, don't you know?

68
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,470
Here.

69
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,320
Thank you.

70
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,270
- Could I leave a note?
- Yes.

71
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,290
"What to write when giving a gift without being burdensome" - no results

72
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,850
Chan's Whelks

73
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,950
CEO.

74
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,230
This. I ordered this for you. Gamjaddeok*.
(potato rice cakes with sweet bean filling).

75
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,260
Thank you.

76
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,660
You still like it, right?

77
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,490
Eating breakfast with a friend, instead of alone. You like it, right?

78
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,100
Get home safely.

79
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,030
Picked this up on my way here.

80
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,110
"Picked this up on my way here."

81
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,220
Chan's Whelks

82
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,660
Oh, Hyung.

83
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,640
Are you insane?!

84
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,550
Hey, I bought two bags of onions and took the subway today.

85
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,840
Everyone complained about the smell, because I had no car.

86
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,900
And Jin Yeong said he would work part-time, but he's not here. If I get a hold of you two brothers....

87
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,300
- Sorry.
- Where are you? You're not coming?

88
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,120
I am waiting around nearby, so please tell her to contact me.

89
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,200
Yes.

90
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,410
How are you, President? Do you know where Painter Jang is right now?

91
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,860
What's going on here? Why do I have to come here specifically? I just wanted to have an afternoon drink.

92
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,680
- Well....
- Even trying to hide out itself is work. It's boring.

93
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,700
Why are you hiding?

94
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,120
Don't be so upset with the president please. I swore and made some threats at the gallery.

95
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,710
I can't really do anything about it either. And you know that.

96
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,750
Your mother is the one who is sponsoring my art.

97
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,530
Yes, I know.

98
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,200
When you do this, you make things difficult for everyone else.

99
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,050
My mom is the one supporting your art.

100
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,610
And CEO Cha Soo Hyeon is your ultimate fan.

101
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,580
I brought you over here because I wanted to let you know about CEO Cha being your ultimate fan.

102
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,890
CEO Jeong.

103
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,090
During my early years of marriage, I happened to score really high.

104
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,620
And I remember that was the only thing where I even scored at all.

105
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,140
I went to Spain for a business trip

106
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,430
but she wanted to go to Portugal instead.

107
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,500
Not by airplane but via automobile.

108
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,140
I remember hearing that this person felt awkward being in a car where the secretary was the driver.

109
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,750
So I was asked to be the driver.

110
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:32,220
So I rented a car and kept on driving west endlessly which I remember clearly.

111
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,110
As I was facing the warm sun while I was driving west,

112
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,990
no matter how high I turned on the air conditioner it was still extremely hot.

113
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,990
I drove for six hours.

114
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,810
Why do I keep on going on this road?

115
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:56,000
I think CEO Cha wanted to follow in your footsteps in "The Road Going West."

116
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,750
Is the dazzling sunflower field really spread wide?

117
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,700
Is the path you are going on as you are facing the sun hotter than the sun itself?

118
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,030
Will the scent of violets be carried in the wind

119
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,730
of the sea hills at the western-most end of the continent?

120
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,870
It seems she wanted to follow you in everything

121
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,500
that you could possibly feel through your paintings.

122
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,360
That person really likes your art that much. She does.

123
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,670
Sokcho is your hometown so I'm thinking that CEO Cha wanted to hang more of your art at the hotel there.

124
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,430
Hello, Painter Jang.

125
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,150
You can take the painting.

126
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,910
But I'm not going to accept payment for the painting from you.

127
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,210
I'm sorry but why?

128
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,880
Let's just say it's complimentary for a fan. To one fan of "The Road Going West" tour.

129
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,870
You are a fan that took a tour to go all the way west after all.

130
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,970
Did you really have to go that far?

131
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,180
Please don't do that. She was your daughter-in-law at one point.

132
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,720
That's what I'm trying to say here.

133
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,160
A person who was a member of this household at one time

134
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,770
loses her mind and causes hideous rumors to spread? So I had to punish her for a bit.

135
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,590
We don't have a close enough relationship with her to treat her that way anymore, Mother.

136
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,310
You shouldn't have done that even when she was part of this household anyway.

137
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:31,460
I'm thinking of being good to her if she decides to become a part of this household again. So don't you worry.

138
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,170
Mother, whether we get back together or not is between me and Soo Hyeon.

139
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,230
This is an issue between the two families.

140
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,890
Assemblyman Cha can't make up his mind whether to merge political parties or not. Like father like daughter, indeed.

141
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,250
I will take care of everything. Your undivided focus should be on Taegyeong.

142
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,100
Soo Hyeon is not an object.

143
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,420
She should have the right to decide what she wants for her life.

144
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,260
So is that why you are letting your life slip away like this?

145
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,950
It's up to me get back together with her. So you don't have to do anything.

146
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,790
This is the last time I'm going to speak about this kind of thing and if you continue on with this

147
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,980
I'm going to go live my own life, too.

148
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,870
What the heck is your own life anyway?!

149
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,580
At least I'm going to live as a person who's not part of this Taegyeong Group.

150
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,570
Hyung, I'm going to sleep in your bedroom for a bit. If I go back home I won't be able to sleep.

151
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,880
Hey, hey, hey, you took the car at the crack of dawn and there was no news of you since the...

152
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,800
Hey you, this is not your motel room you know!

153
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,210
He's acting strange.

154
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,140
I had forgotten for a moment.

155
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,790
Spending a day,

156
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,000
spending a routine day together with someone was exhilarating.

157
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,010
But growing distant again,

158
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,840
returning to a place with nothing

159
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,990
is as painful as ever.

160
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,970
That's why ... I'm going to stop.

161
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,930
Ms. Cha Soo Hyeon, you got caught red-handed.

162
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,780
Hi, Sister.

163
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,760
- It's cold, huh?
- Hey! You think this is an opportunity or something?!

164
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,420
Do I look like a pushover to you kids?

165
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,450
What's wrong with him? Is there something going on with him?

166
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,550
Jin Hyeok upset the neighborhood at the crack of dawn by pounding the shutters,

167
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,210
demanding to give him the car.

168
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:09,100
And his younger brother is constantly insisting that he's a part-time worker here. This is making me age.

169
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,310
Jin Hyeok was asking for the car at the crack of dawn? For what?

170
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,590
I know, right? I wonder where he was trying to go.

171
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:18,240
Something is fishy here. When a man is urgently moving around like that so early in the morning

172
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,430
it has to be either because of parents or a woman.

173
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,600
- There's nothing wrong with our mom and dad.
- Yup, that's why it has to be because of a woman.

174
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,860
Bro, if it was a woman, you shouldn't be driving the delivery van to go meet her.

175
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,490
I'm pretty sure he'd rent a nicer car than that.

176
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,060
Hey, what's wrong with my car?

177
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,980
But that van doesn't bring out the mood, you know.

178
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,730
Bringing out the mood, my ass. That's all vanity.

179
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,660
So where is Jin Hyeok?

180
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,120
He's inside in deep sleep.

181
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,980
He is sleeping.

182
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,770
What's going on with you, Jin Hyeok?

183
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,070
I came because I missed you.

184
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,670
I wanted to see you so that's why I came.

185
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,090
Jang Mi Jin

186
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,540
I have a request.

187
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,140
The CEO personally was intending to give it back to you, but she's really behind on her schedule right now.

188
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,880
Soo Hyeon's birthday is coming up soon, right?

189
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,850
Was I going overboard by giving her a gift as her former husband?

190
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,780
I think that you going all the way to Sokcho was a bit burdensome to her perhaps?

191
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,530
So Secretary Jang, this is why you brought it over yourself, huh?

192
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,540
It seems like the secretary has a lot of various tasks and duty.

193
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,470
I'll just say that I came here as a friend instead.

194
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,210
If you are a friend, why don't you give me some good advice?

195
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,950
There's too much noise going on out there because of all the gossip articles.

196
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,630
So I thought that we have to be more careful.

197
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,870
I wonder what that's supposed to mean, Ms. CEO?

198
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,050
He was saying that we should be more careful.

199
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,970
Did you meet him again?

200
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,200
There's nothing for you to be concerned about.

201
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,750
I'm not part of the "noblesse" so I have no clue about your world at all.

202
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,330
But don't you think the incident with Painter Jang is a warning to you?

203
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,410
You should know better what kind of people they are.

204
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,930
If nothing is going on, would they praise me,

205
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,610
and just leave me alone? Would they do that?

206
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,020
Where are you going, Sunbaenim?

207
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,510
You startled me.

208
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,630
I heard that you went over to Hyung Dae Chan's shop.

209
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,670
You were so passed out while you were asleep yesterday. Why are you sleeping over there instead of at your own home?

210
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,370
I had a good reason.

211
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,620
What kind of reason? Are you working two jobs or what?

212
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,270
Hey, I don't need to work two jobs since I have such a good job like this here.

213
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,180
You are happy to work with me, aren't you?

214
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,550
No.

215
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,740
Sunbaenim, wait for me.

216
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,690
It's the CEO's birthday soon.

217
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,480
So don't you think we should write a birthday message for her, Ms. Department Head?

218
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,790
The CEO isn't into stuff like that.

219
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,620
The wealthy people get nothing but brand name stuff as gifts, huh?

220
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,990
She doesn't like those kinds of gifts.

221
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,390
I know you are good friends with the CEO, but you never truly know a person.

222
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,150
I bet she likes brand name gifts after all.

223
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,190
The CEO herself is brand name person, okay?

224
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,960
Stop with that nonsensical talk of yours.

225
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,740
Our department head leaves a good first impression, doesn't she?

226
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,720
Yes.

227
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,230
Don't get fooled. The workload is ridiculous.

228
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:26,170
And if you disturb her, you are really in for it. Our CEO scouted her personally.

229
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,180
You could say she is one of the "original members."

230
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,920
Assistant Manager, by any chance, is there going to be a birthday event for the CEO?

231
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,880
Didn't you hear from the department head? She doesn't like that kind of stuff.

232
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,070
But how do you remember the CEO's birthday?

233
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,360
Her birthday's the same as mine! It's on Saturday this year.

234
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,190
Don't prepare a gift for me.

235
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,090
Try this drink. It's supposed to make you feel lighter.

236
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,080
Thank you.

237
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,950
Yes, I feel lighter already.

238
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,320
Right?

239
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,880
It's on Saturday but don't prepare in advance on Friday. I really hate stuff like that.

240
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,660
I don't use men's cosmetics. I have sensitive skin so I use my mother's.

241
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,650
Oh, it feels so dry.

242
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,470
♫ I will be happy tomorrow.

243
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,850
Manager Nam!

244
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,600
Why did she have to come down here? Here she comes.

245
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,950
Ah, it's going to be a pain.

246
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,970
Oh, Secretary Jang, good afternoon!

247
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,250
Be honest with me. I already know everything.

248
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,660
If you already know everything, why are you asking?

249
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,400
What happened with Kim Jin Hyeok?

250
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,900
Kim Jin... Ah, well... It turned out that he had to go to Sokcho, too, so I drove him there.

251
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,410
You went together to Sokcho?

252
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,190
You said you already knew everything.

253
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:13,750
Seriously, how can you do that knowing Soo Hyeon's situation? What if there were another photo?

254
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,370
Did they take one already?!

255
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:19,410
We were only in the hotel. So what if there's a photo? I was with them, too.

256
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,500
There'd be rumors that he's your son.

257
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,960
Nothing happened. Don't worry.

258
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,320
Seriously, a problem may occur.

259
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,940
Honestly, I wish something would happen. Look at Soo Hyeon!

260
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,680
She's more expressionless than the store's mannequins. Don't you see that?

261
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,540
That hotel or whatever? What kind of "movie" does she want to see?

262
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,460
A person must be happy in order to live.

263
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,360
It would be a hundred times better to give it all up to live on a farm with someone you love.

264
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,480
It turns out the dangerous person was you, Ahjussi.

265
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,530
- Mi Jin.
- I don't know.

266
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,460
Soo Hyeon laughed brightly.

267
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,630
It's the first time I've seen that laugh since middle school.

268
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,880
So? If he were at the level of Taegyeong Group,

269
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,120
I'd do anything to help them.

270
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,080
A newbie employee who can barely feed himself just won't do, in my opinion.

271
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,820
Mi Jin, if you're so hung up on specs, you won't find anyone to marry.

272
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,150
Ahjussi!

273
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,420
You went through so much trouble coming all the way to Sokcho.

274
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,570
Why won't you accept the painting?

275
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,120
The unwanted hands are a burden.

276
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,530
Your earnestness amounts to only this much?

277
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,310
And yet you pestered me to death?

278
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,210
I am earnest.

279
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,960
That's why I don't consider my time in Sokcho a waste.

280
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,750
I mean the burden of the involved hands is as great

281
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,670
as my earnestness.

282
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,810
You can't win against those people.

283
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,590
Fighting against people you can't beat

284
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,530
will only make you dispirited.

285
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,760
I am truly grateful to you.

286
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,640
Now, our "Weekly Hot Issue" is next. At Taegyeong Group...

287
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,560
Oh? It's the same as this.

288
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,960
This cardigan is just like that one.
Donghwa Hotel CEO Cha Soo Hyeon

289
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,970
You're right. I picked it out.
 has not issued a statement about her celebrity type rumored romance.

290
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,720
I'm good at that. For me to be a mere fruit seller is a waste, really.

291
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,570
It's a waste, right, Honey?

292
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,420
But have you ever seen your company's CEO in person?

293
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,130
What?

294
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,340
Yeah, at the office.

295
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,780
- How is she? Is she really pretty?
- Yeah.

296
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,210
He even says she's pretty.

297
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,460
She really must be pretty.

298
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,380
What good is it to be pretty? Her poor life.

299
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,150
What's the use of being rich? Her life must be exhausting.

300
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:56,220
A woman should just live a happy life with her husband and children.

301
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,730
What's the use of being that successful? Right, Honey?

302
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,550
Who thinks like that these days, Mom?

303
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,450
Isn't it cool to be that talented?

304
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,340
Mom's worrying about useless things again.

305
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,340
The most useless worries are worrying about celebrities and chaebols, they say.

306
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,850
It would be my only wish to meet a woman like that.

307
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:19,320
Hush. Mom hates women who are too talented, and she hates woman who have complicated personal baggage even more.

308
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,730
Right, Honey?

309
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,500
But that guy seems a little familiar.

310
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,060
As to who he is, as soon as we receive more information, Weekly Hot Issue will...

311
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,170
Doesn't he kind of

312
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,520
remind you of Dae Chan?

313
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,370
You're right.

314
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,020
So you can talk.

315
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,050
He doesn't talk to me.

316
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,710
It's heavy, give it here. I'll carry it for you.

317
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,740
It's fine.

318
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,540
Aren't you going to move? I see you at work and in the neighborhood.

319
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,680
Get your story straight. You moved here after me.

320
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,490
Get your story straight. My husband chose this neighborhood.

321
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,130
Maybe the location isn't good? Right Oppa, this neighborhood's location isn't so good?

322
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,750
Maybe that is why he cheated on me?

323
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,110
- Have you confirmed anything yet?
- No.

324
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,630
Why do you keep speaking as if it were a fact? Your imagination, geez.

325
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,220
You know that my intuition is sharp.

326
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,770
Freshman year in college.

327
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,340
When my oppa had given up on life.

328
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,990
I cried to you, saying something was strange, and to help find him. Remember that?

329
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,630
Why are you bringing up the past again?

330
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,310
What if it's true?

331
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,690
If, by any chance, it's true, I'll beat your husband to death.

332
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:46,020
Don't do that. I already lost my brother. If I lose my husband, too, what becomes of me?

333
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,560
That jerk better not be...

334
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,140
Help me carry it, it's heavy!

335
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,930
Okay.

336
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,220
Chan's Whelks

337
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,170
Look at all the fun she's having. Cha Soo Hyeon.

338
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,090
Who is this? Is this his girlfriend?

339
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,120
I don't believe so. She's a Donghwa Hotel employee.

340
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,710
She's a long-time friend of Kim Jin Hyeok.

341
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,390
(Product placement: Song Hye Kyo is the model for Sulwhasoo)

342
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,540
Turn off your lamp before you leave.

343
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,080
Since I got to work, it's been on my mind, Sweetie!

344
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,020
Making you wonder all day before I give it to you, that has more impact.

345
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,860
I'm really touched! How did you know it's my birthday, Sweetie!?

346
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,340
Happy birthday. I'm off now.

347
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,610
Sweetie, how did you know I had sensitive skin?

348
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,510
Sweetie!

349
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,150
What should I buy for you?

350
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,210
Isn't Assistant Manager Park funny?

351
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,940
He sets the mood in the office.

352
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,650
He's just immature.

353
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,340
I don't recognize this number.

354
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,750
Yes? Yes, this is.

355
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,180
Could we meet for a moment?

356
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,930
Who are you?

357
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,130
I have something to discuss with your regarding Kim Jin Hyeok.

358
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,670
I need to take the subway.

359
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,420
Why? Isn't that the bus that goes to your house?

360
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,080
Yes. I have to stop by somewhere. Bye.

361
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,000
You dummy Cha Soo Hyeon.

362
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,070
Ugh, how insane.

363
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,260
How could you stop so suddenly?

364
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,870
I'm sorry.

365
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,850
Ah, I'm sorry.

366
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,120
Who are you?

367
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,820
I'm a work colleague.

368
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,410
Are you hurt at all?

369
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,710
I'm not.

370
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,840
I can't see anything in the dark.

371
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,350
You should call your insurance company, no?

372
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,480
You must be shocked after braking so fast. Please allow us to pay for all your repair costs directly.

373
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,280
What if you skip out on paying me? Just call your insurance.

374
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,890
Please allow us to pay for everything instead. I apologize.

375
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,810
After you get an estimate, please contact me here.

376
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,090
Oh, you work at a good place.

377
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,490
Then, I'll just take some photos.

378
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,760
You were a bit startled, right?

379
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,990
Just a little...

380
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,400
Would you like to go to a hospital?

381
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,360
No, I'm fine.

382
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,250
Where is Manager Nam?

383
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,370
Since I was very late today...

384
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,790
I will escort you.

385
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,660
I said that I'm fine!

386
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,010
CEO.

387
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,940
I think you are screaming for help.

388
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,690
Look here, Kim Jin Hyeok! What do you know about me that you are making such mindless remarks?

389
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,350
Let me do another mindless act.

390
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,630
It's dangerous, so I am taking you home.

391
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,860
I'll get in trouble later. Today, just do as I say.

392
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,730
Please rest your eyes until we arrive.

393
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,500
That necktie... is really a great item.

394
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,690
Ah, it's a bit funny, right?

395
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,340
Since you laughed, it's a commendable item.

396
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,760
What did you say?

397
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,540
Please upload some gossip on the company's anonymous message board.

398
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,180
If you do that, then I will make you an assistant manager

399
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,590
on the ace team, the Strategy Team for Donghwa Hotel.

400
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,620
I don't want to do that.

401
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,400
I have no interest in CEO Cha Soo Hyeon.

402
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,270
I am even more uninterested in anything that will put Kim Jin Hyeok in a dangerous position.

403
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,100
Depending on how you frame it, Kim Jin Hyeok won't be harmed.

404
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,070
It will upset Kim Jin Hyeok.

405
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,790
Jin Hyeok is my friend. I cannot do that.

406
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:58,350
Whether it's an opposite sex emotional relationship or friendship, the combination is not good.

407
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:04,760
You guys are going too far. Please don't play dirty tricks on people's lives.

408
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,670
I can't say I welcome the combination, but it is not something I would go that far for either.

409
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,780
It's not even a fact.

410
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,420
Sometimes, reporters still come around.

411
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,820
So from here, I will drive and go.

412
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,440
And when they call about the accident, relay the message to Secretary Jang.

413
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,970
Wait a moment.

414
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,320
CEO, just one minute.

415
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,240
Kim Jin Hyeok, are you sick somewhere?

416
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,760
You can't move?

417
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,630
No, wait a moment.

418
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,960
It happened.

419
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,990
Happy birthday.

420
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,420
This is a present.

421
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,680
It's your birthday. I wanted to make sure to give you a present.

422
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,790
They say that chaebols receive a lot of brand-named products.

423
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,360
And I'm just a new employee.

424
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:30,600
If I exert myself trying to buy you a luxury gift, that will ruin my image.

425
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,410
I saw the model that had this lipstick on.

426
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:38,220
I bought it because I thought that it would look good on you.

427
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:46,020
Thanks for the birthday tidings. I'll just accept the thought.

428
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,580
The present is a bit simple, right?

429
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,640
That's not it.

430
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,310
Kim Jin Hyeok.

431
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,070
Truthfully, I hope that I won't have anything to do with you anymore.

432
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,780
Since these are unfamiliar situations, I feel a bit burdened.

433
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,770
It seems I crossed a line.

434
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,570
Then, I'll get going.

435
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,860
Give it to me.

436
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,810
Since you might misunderstand that I am disregarding your intentions.

437
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,330
Happy birthday to you.

438
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,090
I can't live. It happened like this again.

439
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,610
Open it. Let's have a birthday party.

440
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:16,640
Oh, lipstick! It looks like a new product.

441
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,180
I got it as a present.

442
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,830
From who?

443
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,310
It smells fishy.

444
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,160
If you are going to nag, the birthday party is over.

445
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,470
It's almost as if he's a ghost.

446
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,130
Exactly when are you meeting him? Are you meeting him in your dreams?

447
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,040
I got into a car accident.

448
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,600
What?

449
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,390
When Kim Jin Hyeok contacts you, get the information and take care of it, please.

450
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,410
What's with the car accident? And why does Kim Jin Hyeok come out in that situation?

451
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,730
Ow, my head. Ow, my head.

452
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,330
It happened that way. A minor collision.

453
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,910
In the scene, that person was really coincidently there.

454
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,420
He gave his business card instead of mine. And that was it.

455
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,800
And he gave you this lipstick.

456
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,330
He said that it's a birthday present.

457
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,970
Is he a stalker?

458
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,370
She probably doesn't think I'm a stalker...

459
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,920
Should I have told her how I knew about her birthday?

460
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,860
I heard that Manager Nam drove him.

461
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,140
Did he confess?

462
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,590
I got it out of him.

463
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,760
As expected, he only cares about your happiness.

464
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,450
And he doesn't care about the rear blast that's to come.

465
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:47,470
I am very strange these days, right?

466
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,850
I don't know.

467
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,630
I am strange.

468
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,820
These days, you...

469
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:07,370
it seems like you went back to the days before your father got elected.

470
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,000
What does that mean?

471
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,310
I'm saying that you seem like the long ago happy, crazy Cha Soo Hyeon.

472
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,430
Am I crazy?

473
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,250
Ah, I get it. Let's just say that you were a fourth dimension.

474
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,490
That's the same thing.

475
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:29,050
When I ditched school to go that concert, I was about to be punished by our homeroom teacher. But I was saved, thanks to you.

476
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,490
Don't you remember? Even Cha Soo Hyeon, the model student, top in the school,

477
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,410
skipped school to go to the concert. Who would've guessed?

478
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,470
He let it slide because he saw you there, too.

479
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,620
Did I?

480
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,940
It seems like someone else's story. It's unfamiliar.

481
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,340
You need to stop it now, Soo Hyeon.

482
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,710
I've been thinking about that since Cuba.

483
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,620
But we keep crossing paths.

484
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,080
This lipstick, should I return it for you?

485
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,310
I returned Woo Seok's gift for you.

486
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,770
Let's return it, huh?

487
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,440
What is with you? Why are your pupils wavering?

488
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,580
They weren't wavering.

489
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,700
Ah?

490
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,110
This is no joke.

491
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,760
Give this to Soo Hyeon. It's her birthday, right?

492
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,670
You even remember her birthday.

493
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,120
I hope that Soo Hyeon can understand our heart.

494
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,130
But communicating my heart has been difficult.

495
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,270
I smoothed things over with her.

496
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:04,110
Please smooth over Assemblyman Cha's heart as well.

497
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,170
I've heard that he is opposed to merging parties.

498
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,140
Of course not.

499
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,190
The mood between both parties is improving, so I hope that everything is resolved cleanly.

500
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,990
Yes, of course.

501
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,410
You are aware that the people in the Munhwa Party

502
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:23,910
are not enough to support him all the way to the Blue House, right?

503
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,480
Even if the political parties merge, there will be no change in the party representatives.

504
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,890
And for the election, he will be the sole nominee of the party.

505
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,110
Thank you, Chairwoman.

506
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,260
Consider our relationship as in-laws.

507
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,720
Yes, Madame In-Law.

508
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,840
People will think you went to a salon.

509
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,120
Do mine, too.

510
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,220
Wash your face first.

511
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,340
Are going to your parents?

512
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:14,470
Yeah. Not calling me would be a gift, but my mom doesn't get that.

513
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,590
Want to go with me?

514
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,850
You can see my dad, too.

515
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:21,560
No, no. I'd like to see your dad, but your mom...

516
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,070
I have plans in the afternoon.

517
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,330
It's a gift from your mother-in-law.

518
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,860
She asked me to deliver it because you've been so abrasive.

519
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,430
Can't you be more friendly?

520
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,820
We're no longer in a relationship to exchange gifts.

521
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,680
Why did you accept that?

522
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,880
Since you are like this, I am busy.

523
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,930
What do you think this means?

524
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:58,960
That she has her eyes on you, so conduct yourself accordingly, no?

525
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,070
Why call her here on this good day for that? You'll make her sick.

526
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,620
Here, this is my present.

527
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,110
You like this poet, too?

528
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,160
Yes, you like him too?

529
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,480
I am beginning to like him.

530
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,990
Yes.

531
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,250
"I Look at You as if I'm Looking at Flowers" by Na Tae Joo

532
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,390
Here, Jin Hyeok.
Jang Soo Fruits

533
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,870
Put that over there.

534
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,670
Hello?

535
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,890
Yes, hello. This is Jang Mi Jin.

536
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,680
Yes, hello.

537
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,420
Oh, would you be able to meet me for a bit? I will go near you.

538
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,490
I am hoping that it's a quiet place.

539
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,550
A quiet place?

540
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,690
Why did he ask to meet at a place like this?

541
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,370
Is he asking to have a day drink or what?
Chan's Whelks

542
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,660
Is anyone there?

543
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,420
It is quiet.

544
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,890
Aigoo, welcome.

545
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,750
You came alone?

546
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,770
You can order by looking at the menu.

547
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,700
Do you have coffee?

548
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,860
No, we are more about alcoholic beverages.

549
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,220
You have cola, right?

550
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,550
Yes, we do.

551
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,210
This isn't some kind of cafe.

552
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:44,250
That's what I'm saying. Why did he ask to meet here when this isn't some cafe?

553
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,830
Huh? What kind of place is this then?

554
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,140
Ah, it's a bit weird to have whelks in broad daylight.

555
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,170
That's true, why would someone eat whelks in broad daylight?

556
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,670
Yes, an open bar is a fascinating thing.

557
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,540
Look here. You can go outside.

558
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,420
If you make a left turn and go straight about 100 meters, there is a very delicious coffee shop.

559
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:08,270
Go drink coffee over there.

560
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,020
Aigoo, did someone say to come here?

561
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,840
Aigoo, it's not like someone said to come here.

562
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,410
Because he told me to come here!

563
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:20,350
Jin Hyeok, is she your guest?

564
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:24,810
I'm sorry for being late.

565
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,680
Since my father's shop was busy.

566
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,010
If you feel uncomfortable, should we move locations?

567
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,270
Let's do it here because we aren't going to spend a lot of time.

568
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,660
- Please give me a cola.
- Yes.

569
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,470
- Me too, Hyung.
- Okay.

570
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:41,480
Have a nice chat.

571
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:47,500
Is he your hyung?

572
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,400
He's a close friend.

573
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:53,120
I asked to meet somewhere where no one is present.

574
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,620
It's okay. He doesn't have any interest in my business.

575
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,110
Why did you ask to meet me on the weekend?

576
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,150
I'll say this comfortably.

577
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,480
Please don't involve yourself with CEO Cha anymore.

578
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,480
To you, it might be a small happening, but it's not like that here.

579
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:17,900
Yes, I understand what you are saying.

580
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,790
Although she may look tough, she's a very soft-hearted person.

581
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,040
I have a question.

582
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,650
Go ahead.

583
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:34,260
Is there nothing that she can do as she likes?

584
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,040
There probably is.

585
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,810
Even just to meet a friend, does the company require her assistant to arrange it?

586
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,280
If it were an obvious friend, there wouldn't be news articles written about them.

587
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:48,860
The same goes for me and for you.

588
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,850
Ordinary people can meet and part ways. It's personal business.

589
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,550
But not in CEO Cha's world.

590
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,520
Admittedly, that is a part of her life I also cannot get used to.

591
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,840
Even a minor collision becomes an issue.

592
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,520
Yesterday, I crashed into the car in front of me, but the car owner was Donghwa Hotel's CEO Cha Soo Hyeon.

593
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,970
She is so pretty.

594
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,280
Since the male secretary settled everything, I couldn't get her personal number.

595
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,620
That's the way it is.

596
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,320
It's a relief that you just passed as a male secretary. What would you have done otherwise?

597
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,280
To you, it might be a playful curiosity because you met someone of another world.

598
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,180
But she is someone who can be swayed and toppled for even the smallest flaw.

599
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,160
Please be understanding of me, who has no choice but to go overboard.

600
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:52,220
Wow, who is she? Her prickliness is dripping from her head to her toes.

601
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,420
Where are you going?

602
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,340
Yes, they didn't take the caps off.

603
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,530
It isn't fun because I met someone of another world.

604
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,050
I'm just surprised every single day.

605
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,480
She is really from a different world.

606
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,780
It's really surprising.

607
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:30,390
I will make sure that my interest in her no longer causes her trouble. But you know,

608
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,120
it's not some kind of playful curiosity.

609
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,180
A person...

610
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,010
a person allowing another person into his heart

611
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,350
even if it's just for a moment,

612
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:45,970
that...

613
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:49,640
I think it's something meaningful.

614
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,930
Please go safely.

615
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,600
What is this? CEO Cha Soo Hyeon, time has come for her to stop?

616
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,800
Look at what popped up. CEO Cha is in big trouble.

617
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,970
Assistant Manager Kim, did you see this?

618
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,720
Is this real? Did you see what was posted on the bulletin board?

619
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,900
Isn't she in trouble?

620
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,790
What is our CEO going to do now?

621
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:06,190
I received information that the man who appeared in the recent article is an employee of a subsidiary.

622
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:12,570
I hope that CEO Cha will no longer harass this man with her personal desires.

623
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,710
As an employee of a subsidiary,

624
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:18,800
he cannot say no to her request to go out with her.

625
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,710
Has she thought about the difficult position he is in?

626
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:25,640
Using her name and power to use a helpless employee

627
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,430
is unacceptable as the CEO of Donghwa Hotel.

628
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:33,420
The time has come for her to return to being a CEO worthy of respect, as before.

629
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:36,620
Who is this?

630
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,730
Director Choi keeps on contacting the CEO office, requesting a meeting with you.

631
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:55,960
Saying that he could overlook the article, but now that this situation has happened, he must discuss it with you.

632
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,350
How fun for Director Choi.

633
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:03,480
And the person who needs a discussion is not me, but my ex-mother-in-law, perhaps?

634
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,430
It's not a big deal, so there is no need for us to meet and talk about it. Please give him that message.

635
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,530
Yes, I understand.

636
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,510
Donghwa Hotel - Anonymous Message Board

637
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,980
Wow, look at the comments.

638
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,780
Based on the CEO's beauty, I knew something like this would happen eventually.

639
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,370
Is this how it's proven that she is a regular at host bars?

640
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:46,160
Whoever this employee is, he is stuck between a rock and a hard place. If he refuses, he will be forced to resign.

641
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,990
Wow, this is no joke, really.

642
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,060
Isn't this about "fainting" level for the CEO?

643
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,790
Hey, who is this, anyway?

644
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,740
Talk about candy, he ate a huge piece of candy.
(Meaning he got screwed over.)

645
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,380
Please stop paying attention to useless gossip.

646
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,660
You all know what sort of person our CEO is. How can you get swept up in this?

647
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,510
Of course, you never really know what someone is like on the inside.

648
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:11,710
Everyone is filled with jealousy. Anyone who shows capability is an enemy.

649
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,860
Is it even possible for me to be jealous of someone like her?

650
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:18,290
Money, looks, and ability. There is no way I can win. Ah,

651
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,410
I am a bit younger.

652
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,310
But that is no comfort.

653
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,720
But does she really go to host bars?

654
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,100
But to be honest, at her age, isn't it too lonely to just live doing nothing but work?

655
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:34,340
People constrained by politics, they tend to be more sly than they appear.

656
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,480
Have you seen it, Eun Jin?

657
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,320
Huh?

658
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:42,760
People constrained by politics, when they become lonely, have you seen it for yourself?

659
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,040
I mean, based on rumors...

660
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,310
Assumptions based on speculation. These are dangerous things.

661
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,410
I'm sorry.

662
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:07,720
This is a junior whom I treasure. He has sharp ears.

663
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,580
His mouth must be discreet as well.

664
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,870
Just leave it to me, please.

665
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:15,700
I will show you my loyalty to Taegyeong Group.

666
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,500
I received information that the man who appeared in the recent article is an employee of a subsidiary.

667
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,150
I hope that CEO Cha will no longer harass this man with her personal desires.

668
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:17,800
Have we thought about the difficult position he is in, because as her employee, he cannot say no to her?

669
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,700
Using her name and power to use a helpless employee is unacceptable.

670
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,700
It is time for her to return to being someone worthy of respect, as before.

671
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:29,630
I regret missing an interesting sight at Donghwa Hotel.

672
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,820
So the mood there is pretty fun, isn't it?

673
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:38,060
Let's call a board meeting soon and discuss how CEO Cha has damaged the dignity of the hotel

674
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,690
and ask her to take responsibility.

675
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:44,010
Director Choi, you should prepare yourself. You've been in the Board of Directors for too long.

676
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:47,980
The day you enter the CEO's office is approaching soon.

677
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:57,240
When my Woo Seok sees the anonymous message board, he will be hopping mad.

678
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,030
He has such a pure heart.

679
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:04,590
But he should know about this situation, shouldn't he?

680
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,140
- Yes, CEO?
- Will you please come see me?

681
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:15,930
Yes, CEO.

682
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:20,420
On the Donghwa Hotel anonymous message board, someone uploaded a libelous message about CEO Cha.

683
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,830
I want to know who did that.

684
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:22,870
I will look into it quietly.

685
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:27,060
Please find a hacker who can bring the server down so that this message will not spread anywhere else.

686
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,370
Tell him I will pay anything he asks and to do it as soon as possible.

687
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:39,950
It's not as if our company is supposed to manufacture third-rate romances.

688
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:43,500
If the main character in the news is our CEO, then what happens to our company?

689
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,200
She seemed so arrogant, but this is such a twist. Daebak.

690
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,760
Actually, I knew it. Once her type gets fixated on someone, she becomes scary.

691
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,240
Looks like she became completely fixated on a young boy.

692
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,510
- I wonder who? The message said that he was an employee?
- Hey.

693
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,110
Would he want to step forward?

694
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,960
As soon as he steps forward, his job is kaput.

695
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,120
Everyone is having so much fun.

696
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,500
They have so much to chew on, even if there were no side dishes.

697
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,160
Why aren't you eating, Jin Hyeok?

698
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,240
Huh?

699
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,310
My stomach is a bit upset.

700
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,650
I don't have much appetite either.

701
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,350
Let's go out.

702
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,380
You should leave work now. I'll have the car waiting in the basement garage.

703
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,760
No, what for? I don't have any reason to hide.

704
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,670
Everyone is very excited.

705
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:56,750
At times like this, it's best to just quietly avoid it.

706
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:00,690
I'm fine. It makes me look sillier if I avoid it.

707
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,530
Let's all go home now.

708
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,750
Things are a bit chaotic, how about some soju?

709
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,530
I don't feel chaotic at all.

710
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,840
Let's go home now.

711
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,550
So you were at the company.

712
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:32,620
I've been trying to contact you to discuss some things, but you have not responded.

713
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,040
So I was rather perturbed.

714
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,340
Because I didn't feel that there was anything to discuss.

715
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,700
Oh, CEO. You've caused all the employees to be in a panicked state

716
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,100
and you say there is nothing to discuss?

717
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,590
Aren't you too much?

718
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,230
CEO must get going. She is late to her meeting.

719
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:54,260
Is that so? Since you are busy, then how about speaking to me here?

720
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:59,720
Look, everyone wants to hear your explanation.

721
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,170
I have nothing to explain.

722
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,850
Then...

723
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:10,790
As the head of Donghwa Hotel, you should at least state your position.

724
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:17,430
Is that man really an employee of a subsidiary

725
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:24,260
or, although I am uncomfortable saying such crass things, is he a man from a host bar as the employees' comments allege?

726
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:30,130
What I personally hope is that perhaps he is a younger cousin of yours.

727
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,900
I have no reason to answer your question.

728
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:39,160
Isn't consistently playing dumb from the article to the message board an inappropriate treatment?

729
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,310
Isn't the damage to the company's image very serious?

730
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:48,180
So please speak now.

731
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,760
It looks like it's true.

732
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,960
Looks like the rumors are true.

733
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,810
What is going on?

734
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:06,740
Let's go.

735
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,510
CEO!

736
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,380
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon!

737
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:07,230
Are you going home?

738
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:11,250
Please just live your life.

739
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:15,420
Stay there. Don't come any closer.

740
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,280
I made my choice.

741
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:25,120
In that world where you stand alone, I decided to barge in.

742
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,760
I have some money.

743
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:36,660
I will treat you today, so would you like to go eat ramen with me?

744
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:41,660
What's going on? So that man was Kim Jin Hyeok?

745
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,060
Jin Heok.

746
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,610
So that man, it i him?

747
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:55,690
Since there will be too much traffic at the rest stop, today, have a cup of ramyun with me at the convenience store.

748
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:04,420
Please don't ask me what I am feeling right now.

749
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,460
I don't know, yet, myself.

750
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:15,810
For me, right now, to not leave you to be alone,

751
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,460
that is all I know.

752
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:23,130
♫ A brief moment of the day ♫

753
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:26,360
♫ Could if have been then? ♫

754

771
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,600
Shall we walk?

772
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:44,520
You met me in Cuba after you were completely broke. Then we met again as boss and employee.

773
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,630
We are pretty entertaining.

774
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,420
Your hands please.

♫ You who were looking for me for a while, ♫

I found myself smiling, without realizing it.

777
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,500
That is when love began, they said.

778
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,840
Look into that employee. Everything.

779
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,750
Will we ever meet each other again?

780
