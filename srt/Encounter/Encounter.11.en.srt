Song Hye Kyo

Park Bo Gum

00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,000
Boyfriend

5
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,930
♫ Out of everything which passes here ♫

6
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,030
The color of the sea is really... good.

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,730
♫ You're the only one seeing me coming ♫

8
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,300
It feels good.

9
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:56,830
♫  You who were looking for me for a while, for a while, ♫.

10
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:02,720
♫  Stay like that up to now ♫

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,270
♫  Just the moment you stayed with me, ♫

12
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,370
♫  the day you and I were together was beautiful ♫

13
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,590
♫  It’s beautiful time ♫

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,880
♫  My heart beats loudly every time ♫

♫  It’s a beautiful day ♫

16
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,120
♫  Beautiful day ♫

17
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,540
♫  A day like a painting ♫

18
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,170
♫  A night like a movie ♫

19
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,390
♫  Make me forget everything ♫

20
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,040
♫  You and a beautiful day ♫

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:51,030
♫ This beautiful day ♫

22
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,290
♫  On the day I miss you  ♫

23
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,630
♫ I write down your name ♫

24
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,740
♫ Even so for the rest of the day I drew you ♫

25
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,070
♫  Because of that everyday ♫

26
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,260
♫ To me is a beautiful day ♫

27
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,980
♫  This beautiful day ♫

28
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,980
♫  It’s beautiful ♫

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,710
I just remembered.

30
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,550
There was a man who refused to fly business class,

31
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,440
saying he needed to keep his promise to himself.

32
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,130
At that time, that was right.

33
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,770
I've got business class tickets but

34
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,360
if you don't want to this time again, well ...

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,370
I'm going to board the plane.

36
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,620
Take me, too.

37
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,400
Episode 11

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,810
Notice

39
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,000
Donghwa's Face: Employee Kim Jin Hyeok Personnel Announcement

40
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,070
Kim Jin Hyeok

41
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,420
Oh!

42
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,160
Kim Jin Hyeok, congratulations on re-entering the Public Relations Department.

43
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,750
Thank you!

44
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,610
Thank you.

45
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,730
How is it? How does it feel to enter this department a second time?

46
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,080
I knew that this would happen. Jin Hyeok isn't someone who would get chased out like that.

47
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,340
Ah, here we go again.

48
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,090
Jin Hyeok, I cleaned up this whole desk in the morning.

49
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,340
Thank you, Sunbaenim.

50
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,560
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

51
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,170
You have something to say too, right, Section Chief?

52
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,890
No. Good to see you.

53
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,540
Thank you!

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,570
I made a comeback. Shouldn't you be showing your face to me at least once?

55
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,860
Congratulations on your comeback.

56
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,640
That's it? Ay, I'm disappointed.

57
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,130
More? Am I supposed to do something more?

58
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,150
How about you show me your face at least once?

59
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,530
Then come to my office.

60
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,330
I think your office is too businesslike.

61
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,840
You aren't asking to go out to play again, right?

62
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,840
Kim Jin Hyeok

63
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,420
I can't do that right after I've made a comeback.

64
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,500
You said that my office is too businesslike.

65
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,320
And it's not like you are asking to go outside. Then?

66
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,180
There are some places that employees go to that you may not know about.

67
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,220
I'll see you there in a bit.

68
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,840
There are no places that I don't know of.

69
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,020
I know every nook and cranny of Donghwa Hotel.

70
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,470
Should we have a bet?

71
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,680
What are we betting on?

72
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,960
To buy dinner?

73
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,470
Sure. Then, where will we be going?

74
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,650
First, come out of your office,

75
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,830
go to the hotel, and take the elevator.

76
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,230
- What floor?
- 2nd floor of the basement.

77
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,850
You're not talking about the receiving area are you?

78
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,880
If we meet there, we will stick out right away.

79
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,990
Is your expectation of me that low?

80
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,180
This way leads to the laundry room and the restaurant kitchen.

81
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,770
Oh, you know everything. As expected of our CEO.

82
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,150
There are quite a lot of employees here. You are asking to meet here?

83
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,340
If that's the case, we should just meet in the lobby.

84
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,780
First, come here quickly.

85
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,370
Yes, Director. Go ahead and talk.

86
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,520
Am I a director now?

87
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,560
I'm quite taken aback that you understood me to mean it in that way.

88
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,740
Okay. You see a door at the end of the corridor, right?

89
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,120
[ Do not open fire door]
Then, open the door,

90
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,410
You'd be surprised by now.

91
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,760
Do you see Director Kim Jin Hyeok?

92
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,120
No, where are y—

93
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,190
You honestly didn't know, did you?

94
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,650
It seems like they did construction here.

95
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,410
This space utilization is arranged by the Facility Team.

96
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,140
You wouldn't know very well.

97
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,200
I think I won the bet.

98
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,970
It is quiet.

99
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,020
It's nice, right? They only use this place when there is an event.

100
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,680
It seems like you know the hotel facilities better than I do.

101
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,360
I stored equipment here for the last event that we had.

102
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,190
I see.

103
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,000
Since you won the bet and saw my face,

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,990
shouldn't we go now?

105
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,590
What is this? You are just going to show your face briefly and then leave?

106
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,230
Don't you have a lot to do after you've made a comeback?

107
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,020
So you only show your face for 30 seconds and leave?

108
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,450
This is neither seeing nor not seeing your face.

109
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,180
I'm just saying. It's not like there is anything we can do here.

110
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,550
No.

111
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,040
During work hours,

112
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,190
briefly seeing your face.

113
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,330
This is an office romance.

114
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,080
Office romance...

115
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,810
If someone saw us, it would seem strange.

116
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,010
Since there are no events, there is no one that will pass by...

117
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,490
I organized everything there already.

118
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,450
I just wanted to take a break. Yes.

119
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,270
Go in here.

120
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,950
Oh my! Hello, CEO.

121
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,450
You're working hard.

122
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,080
Why did you come all this way?

123
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,010
I wanted to see if this was a nice place for employees to frequent.

124
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,780
Please, keep up the good work.

125
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
Yes, Assistant Manager.

126
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,020
Jin Hyeok, did you go back to Sokcho?

127
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,710
No way.

128
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm in the bathroom.

129
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,270
Well finish up and come back out.

130
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,680
Yes, I'm done.

131
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,270
Yes.

132
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,070
Hello.

133
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,660
Keep up the good work.

134
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,410
It's such a nice time. They're having the time of their lives.

135
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,040
CEO Jeong Woo Seok

136
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,830
CEO Cha will collapse.

137
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,560
Handle this and submit a resignation letter.

138
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,970
Go and ...

139
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,190
You were surprised, weren't you?

140
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,920
Let's discuss it in person.

141
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,500
Ahjussi.

142
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,310
Do you want to go to Hongje-dong?

143
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,170
You should just move there, Ahjussi.

144
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,250
I'm thinking about it really seriously.

145
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,510
Because I'm living in the same neighborhood as Department Head Kim Seon Joo,

146
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,640
how should I put it? Shall I say that my tiredness with life is increasing?

147
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,950
It's much better to live seeing Kim Jin Hyeok's face.

148
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,890
Should we move there together?

149
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,150
If you're not going to go to Hongje-dong,

150
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,110
what are you going to do?

151
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,630
About what happened with the Cuba Hotel...

152
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,880
I was planning to ask you about it.

153
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,650
Are you going to leave things this way?

154
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,900
You're not going to catch that Assistant Manager Kim or whatever his name was?

155
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,760
I have to find whomever was behind it.

156
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,000
I can't send it to the police station to investigate publicly.

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,030
And I don't want to have the hotel in Cuba in the news.

158
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:23,250
So I thought about it, and I think you could help me out.

159
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,430
Just say what you need.

160
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,220
I was really surprised.

161
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,230
I was, too.

162
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,050
Do you really have to go this far?

163
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,750
I don't think it's something that Chairwoman Kim will like.

164
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,840
The results are more important.

165
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,090
Please, speak.

166
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,620
Didn't you come to see me because you wanted something?

167
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,480
You're pretty confident.

168
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,050
You're saying that you just followed the chairwoman's orders.

169
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,000
That's what you mean, isn't it?

170
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,520
I don't have any intention of making things difficult for you with that video.

171
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,510
So I'd like it if you would help me.

172
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,860
I'm showing you my hand, but it seems you are refusing.

173
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,200
Secretary Jo is also in that video.

174
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,530
Are you talking about that secretary who's helping the chairwoman?

175
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,990
He's probably not in the country. Wouldn't he already be in hiding right about now?

176
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,300
It seems that you don't know my mother very well, Director Choi.

177
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,610
So let's start here.

178
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,730
Let's keep the video a secret between you and me.

179
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,890
Why don't you first find out what the chairwoman's intentions are?

180
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,520
Whether she will protect you

181
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,990
or will shift the responsibility all to you. I'm thinking the latter.

182
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,040
Let's meet again and discuss this once more.

183
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,470
If you mention that video first,

184
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,560
then I won't think any further either.

185
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,830
I'll just hand it over to CEO Cha Soo Hyeon.

186
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,990
Alright, congratulations on your comeback, Jin Hyeok!

187
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,160
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

188
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,700
Wow, the neighborhood is so bright now that our Jin Hyeok is back.

189
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,940
Aigoo, thank you!

190
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,910
Do you know how quiet Oppa was when you weren't here? I thought he'd gone into depression.

191
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,540
- Was that true?
- No, no, no, no.

192
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,440
I was appropriately melancholic. I'm in a winter mood.

193
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,930
Hey, part-timer!

194
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,120
Are you even working?

195
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,490
Oh, Hyung, why are you bothering me when it's winter?

196
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,680
I think my hair's going to fall out because you're stressing me out.

197
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,390
Oh, that's mine. I didn't tell you to use it!

198
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,880
Let's share it. Why are you so stingy?

199
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,660
Why are you two fighting?

200
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,710
And why am I stilll a part-timer? It would be so nice to have a partner.

201
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,620
That's right. But a partner doesn't get a part-timer's pay.

202
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,690
- Did you buy your mother's birthday gift?
- I'm thinking about what to get her.

203
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,070
- Mother? Are you talking about our mother?
- Stop being silly.

204
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,080
You guys live in the same house and yet you don't know that?

205
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,360
- Put me in on your birthday present. Let's tell them we bought it together.
- That's fine.

206
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,060
So are you going to have a party for her?

207
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,570
- I'm planning on taking her out this time.
- Oh, you're doing it big, Eldest Son!

208
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,140
I'm going to use the hotel vouchers I got as a reward and take her out to eat at the hotel.

209
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,860
That'd be fine, right? She would like that, wouldn't she?

210
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,190
I think she'll really like it.

211
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,610
You're definitely a good son, Eldest Son.

212
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:19,720
You know, I think that it would be worth getting married if I were to have a kid like Jin Hyeok.

213
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,510
What are you talking about, marriage? Did you get a girlfriend?

214
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,380
Are you going to get married?

215
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,780
You're getting ahead of yourself.

216
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,500
Alright, alright. Let's celebrate Jin Hyeok's comeback!

217
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,040
- Alright!
- To his comeback!

218
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,230
To Dae Chan's future wedding!

219
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,220
Wait, wait!

220
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,230
Happy birthday to Mom!

221
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,240
Jang Soo Fruits

222
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,680
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's Rest Stop Date
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon and a mysterious man got out of the car together...

223
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,090
- Father.
- Oh, you scared me!

224
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,920
- Let's go.
- Alright.

225
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,940
- How is the store?
- I came to get a drink.

226
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,430
I was bored just being at the store.

227
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,120
You have to hurry back, don't you?

228
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,620
No, I still have thirty minutes for lunch.

229
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,340
I wanted to talk to you, but your mom's at home.

230
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,790
Why not ask me to come to the store?

231
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,510
I wanted to see where you work one time.

232
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,980
Jin Hyeok.

233
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,160
Yes?

234
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,080
I can't pretend like I don't know anything anymore.

235
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,240
Your mom is also worried.

236
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,290
You and that ... what is it?

237
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,710
I'm talking about the CEO.

238
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,930
I should have told you first about it.

239
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,840
But the timing wasn’t good.

240
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,700
I had a bad feeling when you got sent to Sokcho.

241
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,440
But it felt strange to ask why you were leaving so suddenly.

242
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,210
And you were talking about how it takes effort to love someone.

243
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,690
You were saying that because things were difficult with her.

244
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,950
Will you be alright?

245
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,050
About what?

246
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,320
The hotel is big and nice.

247
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,180
There are a lot of hotels like that one. There's some in Cuba, too.

248
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,200
She is a famous person.

249
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,500
I trust you. I really do, but...

250
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,490
Father...

251
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,100
I've thought about this a lot. You're worried too, aren't you?

252
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,030
But, Father, this person and I

253
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,400
have the intention of going together.

254
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,650
Although we might not know up to where, we intend to go wherever we can.

255
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,600
What are you going to do if it does not work?

256
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,450
That's right. One person is liking another.

257
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,120
If you calculate how things will go if you keep being together, then it means you don't like them.

258
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,160
I got it. I felt like I had to know how you felt, in order to make up my mind about this. That's why I came.

259
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,570
To decide whether to support you or not.

260
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,460
Please support us, Father.

261
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,900
Your lunch time is going to end. You should head back.

262
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,790
Reporter Nam. No, now that Nam Myeong Sik is going around doing this,

263
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,530
it's hard to say anything. Ah, seriously, I can't get used to it.

264
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,480
Hey, do you think that I'm used to it? It's really nothing.

265
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,160
Hey, at least finish eating before you give it to me.

266
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,640
You eat with your lips, right? So listen with your ears.

267
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,780
Give me this number's call records.

268
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,280
You're like yourself for the first time in a while, Reporter Nam.

269
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,150
- Is something going on?
- Let me use a favor.

270
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,040
I have to find it out, but I need it to be done quietly.

271
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,330
It doesn't even have to do with you. Why are you working so hard for it?

272
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,880
I'll need some time.

273
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,170
Okay.

274
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,780
Ah, that's right. I beat someone up. He did something worth getting hit for.

275
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,540
I hit him because he cheated on someone, so what happens?

276
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,980
Indicment.

277
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,720
Alright.

278
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,630
It's our first time eating out in a long time, so eat a lot.

279
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,470
You're too skinny.

280
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,640
Because I'm on a diet.

281
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,270
You're studying, so why are you on a diet?

282
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,990
You say that while you're on one too, Mom.

283
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,070
That's because I don't have an appetite.

284
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,570
Why don't you have an appetite? Is it because you're getting divorced?

285
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,770
No.

286
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,900
Later, when you get married,

287
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,930
what if they look at your mother being divorced as a flaw?

288
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,100
I won't be with someone like that.

289
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,580
Dad didn't cheat because you aren't pretty, Mom.

290
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,830
Dad is really the weird one.

291
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,750
I don't think that!

292
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,030
I study well, you know.

293
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,780
Of course. I know you do well.

294
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,980
I do that because I want to become like you.

295
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,820
You're awesome, Mom.

296
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,060
I also want to work at a good company and be pretty like you, Mom.

297
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,310
Because you're great. You're the best.

298
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,540
Thank you. You've given me a lot of strength.

299
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,340
And you should also not let anything get you down.

300
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,950
Did I feed you organic foods while I was raising you?

301
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,970
Why are you talking about feeding me organic food right now?

302
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,600
That's what I'm saying.

303
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,400
Then, when you become a grandmother,

304
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,150
I'll take care of you and feed you organic food.

305
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,620
Here, let's start with this.

306
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,850
Is it good?

307
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,970
It's delicious!

308
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,580
Me too. I went to the Hongje-dong playground.

309
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,060
That place will be demolished soon.

310
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,300
You must be so sad.

311
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,720
Of course, I'm sad.

312
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,230
That playground and I shared time together.

313
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,920
Soo Hyeon

314
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,300
We agreed that I'd buy dinner.

315
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,430
Did you remember?

316
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,140
I mean, we said that whoever lost the bet would buy dinner. But you didn't say anything.

317
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,830
And it's weird for me to bring it up.

318
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,490
This kind of thing is very awkward, you know.

319
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,020
I feel refreshed now that you said you remember.

320
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,680
Of course I could forget. Why would you go so far as to say you feel refreshed?

321
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,060
I have to buy dinner for me to see you.

322
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,490
You don't keep your promises and don't realize how I feel.

323
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,340
But I want to see you everyday, though.

324
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,740
What should I do? I just have to be understanding, that's all.

325
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,130
I thought about your playground and wanted to go to it together before it disappeared,

326
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,620
so I used the excuse of buying dinner to come here.

327
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,880
Ah, I think that you also don't realize how I feel, Jin Hyeok.

328
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,450
Ah, really!

329
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,220
I made a mistake.

330
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,170
I thought about this playground as I was looking at the garden in Cuba.

331
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,740
This playground is such a meaningful place to you.

332
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,390
So I felt a little sad when I thought about it disappearing.

333
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,430
You're upset, aren't you?

334
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:46,390
That old man said this about the garden in Cuba.

335
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:51,900
He said that he started and finished his love with his wife there.

336
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,270
I would be disappointed if this playground disappeared.

337
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,090
But because it's the place that allowed me to begin my love,

338
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,370
I can let go of it.

339
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,850
Aren't your legs cramping up?

340
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,610
You don't have a single drop of romanticism, seriously!

341
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,730
Let's go. You have to buy dinner.

342
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,760
Where are you going to go?

343
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,460
- Shall we go to Chan's Whelks for the first time in a while?
- No.

344
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,330
That place isn't good for your mental health. Today, let's go somewhere else.

345
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,700
Can we meet for a bit?

346
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,080
I have something to give you.

347
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,780
What shall we eat?

348
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,000
Since you're buying...

349
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,650
You're getting food cart udon, right?

350
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,440
Of course. Then I'll start with udon.

351
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,430
Don't slurp your noodles.

352
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,020
Hey, udon noodles are too difficult to slurp, so I can't anyway.

353
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,090
Can we have a glass of soju?

354
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,910
Sure. Today, let's do anything you want to do.

355
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:40,030
If I come to think of this. I haven't ever seen you drunk.

356
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,360
I can drink well. I just don't drink often, that's why.

357
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,110
Then are we going to drink the night away tonight?

358
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,120
- Deal.
- Deal!

359
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,970
- Auntie, please give us a bowl of udon and chicken gizzards.
- Yes.

360
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,600
And a bottle of soju, please.

361
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,410
It looks delicious.

362
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,650
Ah... But... Why aren't you drinking?

363
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,340
Today, I'll be your driver.

364
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,720
It is no fun being drunk by myself.

365
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,400
Still, I can't.

366
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,200
- Jin Hyeok.
- Yes.

367
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,130
Jin Hyeok, do you know this?

368
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,790
I like it a lot these days.

369
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,920
I like it too.

370
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,660
No.

371
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,340
I like it way, way, way, way more.

372
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,780
What do you like way, way, way, way more?

373
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,640
Ah, we eat ramyun together and udon together.

374
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,760
And we eat whelks and chicken gizzards.

375
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,150
Today was my first time eating chicken gizzards.

376
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,850
- What do you think? It's good, isn't it?
- It's delicious!

377
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,350
- It's awesome, right?
- It is!

378
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,440
You are cuter when you are drunk.

379
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,230
Yes, I am the cute style.

380
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,170
Honestly, I'm such a cute person,

381
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,140
but people don't know that.

382
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,980
So what if other people don't know? I'm the only one who needs to know.

383
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,500
I...

384
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,530
I really like that.

385
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,030
I know.

386
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,040
Because Jin Hyeok is next to me….

387
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,410
I really like it.

388
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,390
I feel really great, too.

389
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,350
But I feel kind of sad.

390
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,310
About what?

391
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,810
I'm worried that it's all a dream.

392
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,920
♫  You can't start entering ♫

393
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,390
♫  into my heart like this. ♫

394
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,740
When I open my eyes in the morning, I think,

395
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,050
"Even today,

396
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,090
Kim Jin Hyeok will be there, right?"

397
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,360
"Yesterday wasn't a dream, right?"

398
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,930
I confirm it and reassure myself like that.

399
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,060
And then I feel afraid all over again.

400
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,510
♫  whom I liked ♫

401
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,060
Because you might disappear.

402
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:38,530
♫  The more I like you ♫

403
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,730
♫ The more I depend on you ♫

404
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,840
Why should I disappear?

405
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,870
I am right here now.

406
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,300
It seems like you'd turn back.

407
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,920
♫ The heart that is unwilling to depart ♫

408
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,420
Like those friends

409
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,450
who used to be my friends.

410
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,760
I'm scared you'll turn away.

411
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,000
Soo Hyeon.

412
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,940
Yes.

413
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,490
I have coordinates.

414
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,030
- Coordinates?
- Yes, coordinates.

415
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,070
One meter in front of Cha Soo Hyeon is my coordinate.

416
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,460
I will be there all the time.

417
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,750
♫ The more I depend on you ♫

418
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,010
I like that.

419
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,100
♫ My feelings won't stop ♫

420
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,450
But isn’t one meter too far away?

421
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,460
Is that so?

422
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,480
What about this distance?

423
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,950
10 centimeters.

424
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,250
That's good.

425
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,990
That's perfect. Ten centimeters.

426
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,510
Good.

427
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,240
Perfect.

428
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,660
♫ whom I liked ♫

429
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:34,800
♫ I will never lose you to anyone ♫

430
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,560
La Terra

431
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,740
♫  The morning sunrise ♫

432
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,650
♫  It takes me away ♫

433
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,310
♫  As I am staring at the light you hold ♫

434
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,800
♫ The feeling of adore ♫

435
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,080
♫  Oh take me on to you  ♫

436
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,550
♫  You’re my flower and I’m your bee ♫

437
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:44,370
♫  You know you keep me alive ♫

438
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,920
♫  You’re my reasons for everything I do  ♫

439
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,410

443
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,760
♫  Oh take me on ♫

444
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,240

445
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,980
♫  I'll go wherever world you’re on ♫

446
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,600
Come out quickly.

447
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,710
You've stayed there too long.

448
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:38,280
- My Jin Hyeok, ahhh
- Soo Hyeon, you eat it.
- Eat it! Good boy.

449
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,140
Oh, you're so pretty! Your eyes are pretty, your lips are handsome too!

450
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,350
Cute!

451
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,550
Why? We're getting in here to go for round two, right?

452
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,730
Yes, yes.

453
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,970
Manager Nam, let's go to the company.

454
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,370
Having a fling later in life is scary. It's scary.

455
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,230
Why did you suddenly wake up so early?

456
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,330
You were singing. Who wouldn't wake up?

457
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,720
Mom! Hyung...

458
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,670
I'll give you money.

459
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,680
- How much?
- 50,000 won (≈ 45 USD)

460
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,110
- Dad!
- 100,000 won!

461
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,140
What about your brother?

462
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:17,500
No... he wants to give up his job and join an audition program.

463
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,400
- Don't you not have the skills to do that?
- Yes.

464
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,290
- That's why I'm not planning to do that.
- Really?

465
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,750
The Cuba hotel situation, with CEO Cha's personality ...

466
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,110
She will reveal the whole account and more. I feel uneasy.

467
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,090
You caused that kind of issue?

468
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,990
Ah, Chairwoman...

469
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,650
But why did you come here?

470
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,110
Secretary Jo was also present there.

471
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,340
Who is Secretary Jo?

472
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,790
Chairwoman, if you act like this, it will put me in a tough situation.

473
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,570
Why am I making it tough?

474
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,770
Why don't you first find out what the chairwoman's intentions are?

475
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:18,870
Whether she will protect you or will shift the responsibility all to you.

476
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,810
You are too much. I put everything on the line for you.

477
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,820
I don't know what the hell you're saying.

478
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,430
For something that you should be discussing with CEO Cha,

479
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,030
why are you here at Taegyeong Group to complain about it?

480
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,720
Donghwa Hotel Business Outlook (2019)

481
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,860
What is it that you want?

482
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,240
I guess it would be better not to ask how it went with Chairwoman Kim.

483
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:11,080
Gather all the shareholder's stocks and hand them all over to me. I can't do anything with the stocks that I currently have.

484
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,010
I at least have to have more stock than CEO Cha

485
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,770
in order to protect you or anyone else.

486
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,990
Bring it for a good price. Don't worry about the cost.

487
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,200
I wish that you would speed things up. I need to open a stockholder meeting.

488
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,530
A stockholder meeting?

489
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,940
Because I have an important matter to discuss.

490
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,530
Donghwa Hotel has become too grand for CEO Cha to handle on her own.

491
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,290
It seems she needs professional personnel at this time. What do you think about that?

492
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:39,190
Are you saying that you are going to overthrow her from her CEO position?

493
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,730
We'll see about that.

494
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,790
First of all... I'm thinking of getting myself in there.

495
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,500
Are you saying that you are coming in as a co-CEO?

496
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,730
That isn't such a bad picture, right?

497
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:55,640
I'm sure that you know this, but even if you were to get shares from Taegyeong's stockholders,

498
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,940
you won't be able to gain the seat as a co-CEO.

499
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,800
It's obvious that the directors that are friendly with CEO Cha will disapprove.

500
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,000
I will take care of that side.

501
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,340
Just quietly give me the shares of the Taegyeong's directors.

502
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,630
It would be better if you proceed without Chairwoman Kim knowing.

503
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,990
Chan's Whelks

504
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,620
- Oh, you scared me!
- What have you been doing there for thirty minutes?

505
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,190
Ah, it's so cold. Is there something worth getting frozen for?

506
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,940
What are you talking about? I was just passing by.

507
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,810
The whelks are selling well, right? Good-bye.

508
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,070
Alright, alright.

509
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,900
Let's just say that you were passing by.

510
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,730
Let's say that you just happened to be passing by on this street, out of all the streets in the city of Seoul.

511
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,280
Should we do that?

512
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,960
Omo! Wait a moment.

513
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,880
I'll go in by myself.

514
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,100
It was really cold, right?

515
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,240
Do you have any rice?

516
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,330
Oh, yes! Of course.

517
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,400
Hey, Jin Myeong.

518
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,670
Serve a full warm bowl of rice here.

519
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,320
- Dae Chan!
- Yes, Hyungnim.

520
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,190
Is she your girlfriend?

521
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,660
- I'm just a customer, sir.
- Is that right?

522
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,100
I thought that you didn't suit each other.

523
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,510
Yes, Hyungnim, we don't match each other, right?

524
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,950
Why is my mood not so great?

525
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,290
It's nice to see each other often, because we seem like family, Secretary Noona!

526
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:39,150
Let's stop calling me "Secretary, secretary". I got off of work, but it seems like I am going into work.

527
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,660
- Ah, it's because I don't know your name...
- Jang Mi Jin.

528
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,180
You seem to have a lot of interest in me. You even memorized my name.

529
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,480
After meeting each other through a dating app and getting cursed at that much,

530
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,930
isn't it normal to remember something as simple as your name?

531
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,190
Your grudge is really... I already apologized.

532
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,910
Yes, that's why I'm giving you a warm bowl of rice like this.

533
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,720
I am buying this.

534
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,780
I guess you don't accept food money from charming women, either.

535
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,570
Ah, of course. But Jin Myeong, where is the charming customer?

536
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,080
Here... She's here...

537
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,170
- Goodbye.
- I'm joking, I'm joking.

538
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,490
Since before, why do you keep grabbing my wrist?

539
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,230
Can I hold your hand?

540
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,240
You are really a swindler, Lee Dae Chan!

541
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,070
Ah, Lee Dae Chan. Hearing my full name...

542
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,500
it has been a really long time.

543
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,130
Hey, Jin Myeong! Quickly bring the soju.

544
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,340
Soju!

545
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,350
Donghwa Hotel

546
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,310
It's been a long time since I've visited my daughter's office.

547
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,910
It's exactly the same, isn't it?

548
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,870
Dad, by any chance, is something the matter?

549
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,180
No. Why?

550
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,110
But since you are suddenly asking to borrow the room ...

551
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,600
You haven't done this even once before, you know.

552
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,260
I need to meet an important person.

553
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,400
- There are so many reporters who have their eyes on me.
- It's not a big deal, right?

554
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,570
It is an important matter.

555
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,770
But it's not something to be concerned about. Don't worry about it.

556
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,860
That's fine, then.

557
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,480
Should I slowly get moving?

558
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,300
Alright.

559
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,090
This hotel's CEO is your daughter, right?

560
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,850
Yes.

561
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,020
Since you are asking to meet at a place like this,

562
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,100
I feel like you will be talking about a sensitive topic.

563
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,790
President Lee...

564
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,070
What do you think about merging with my Moonhwa Party?

565
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:42,100
I want to know the reason why you are suddenly bringing this up...

566
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,820
Either our Moonhwa party or yours,

567
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,880
as separate parties, we can't guarantee this election.

568
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:54,000
So are you asking our party to become your accomplice?

569
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,370
No, I'm just saying that we should join forces.

570
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,610
Well... I'm not sure.

571
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,640
There won't be a situation when I am running for the election.

572
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,580
I'm talking on the condition of keeping it confidential until the announcement of the merger.

573
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:15,110
I won't run and will be your line of support.

574
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:19,340
Why are you making this kind of proposition?

575
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:27,020
Anyway, I won't be able to run in this election.

576
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,370
So I am asking that the Moonhwa Party be protected.

577
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,470
What the hell are you saying?

578
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:38,560
That the Moonhwa Party's principles not be compromised

579
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,330
is my only condition in merging parties.

580
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,800
CEO Jeong, what is this nonsensical thing that you are saying?

581
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,440
I need to come in as a co-CEO,

582
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,100
so please open up the hearts of CEO Cha's directors.

583
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:05,220
In the end, you are Chairwoman Kim's son.

584
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,220
Uncle.

585
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,390
I am unqualified to become the director of this company.

586
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,660
Giving up my calling to teach students,

587
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,760
why do you think I came here?

588
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,220
Guilt.

589
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,880
I'm here because of the guilt of sending Soo Hyeon to you.

590
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,730
I felt that protecting Soo Hyeon from your mother

591
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,960
was the only thing that I could do.

592
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,310
Uncle, that was not your fault.

593
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:33,340
No. Assemblyman Cha trusted me and sent Soo Hyeon.

594
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,830
I told him that you were going to be different.

595
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,340
That my brother and sister-in-law would be different.

596
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,880
That they will cherish and take good care of Soo Hyeon.

597
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,780
But then what about you? It's not just my family which was cut off.

598
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,570
After that, I can't even meet Assemblyman Cha.

599
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,370
I am ashamed. Do you get it?

600
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,780
No matter what, I must enter Donghwa Hotel.

601
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,520
Please help me.

602
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,440
It's been a while since I've attended the board of directors' meetings.

603
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,210
But I must attend the board of directors meeting that is opening this time.

604
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,390
Don't even dream about it.

605
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:14,110
Do you not know what kind of meaning this hotel has to CEO Cha?

606
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,140
Today, let me treat you to a meal.

607
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,830
Hey, hey, hey. Let's go out and eat some mung bean pancakes.

608
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,760
Aigoo, let's just have a plateful of sashimi here. Yes?

609
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,960
Look how swollen my face got because I haven't eaten sashimi.

610
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,190
Ever since you were young, you had a round face.

611
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,430
Why are you associating it with sashimi?

612
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,290
Ah, I wanted to spend some money, but you really aren't helping me.

613
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,510
Hey, Jin Hyeok.

614
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,440
That guy is this guy.

615
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,720
Introduce yourself. This is...

616
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:49,380
Ah, I am CEO Cha's father.

617
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,460
Nice to meet you. I am Kim Jin Hyeok.

618
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,860
I work in the Public Relations Department.

619
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,550
We are going to go eat mung bean pancake just in front. Do you want to go together?

620
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:02,860
Ah, I really like mung bean pancakes, but right now is my working hours.

621
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,590
Alright then, let's have a meal together some other day.

622
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,790
Yes. If you call, I will come visit you whenever.

623
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:26,040
How cold will it be on my way home?

624
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,180
Jin Hyeok, do you want to have a drink?

625
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,700
Ah, I have to go buy my mother's birthday present.

626
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,370
Next week...

627
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,200
We don't even know what will happen tomorrow. How would we know about next week?

628
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,590
You must think of every day as being precious.

629
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,330
The clingy style.

630
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,760
Eun Jin, you are only listening to my words at work?

631
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,420
Section Chief Lee, aren't you leaving?

632
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:48,590
- Section Chief.
- Huh?

633
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:52,130
Did something bad happen? You don't look too good.

634
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,810
Ah, no. I just have some cold symptoms.

635
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,750
If it's your mother's present, how about a design like this?

636
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,900
She doesn't like anything too fancy. Just give me this.

637
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,420
Yes.

638
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,740
When I open my eyes in the morning, I think

639
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,660
"Kim Jin Hyeok is here today too, right?"

640
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,100
"Yesterday wasn't a dream, right?"

641
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,860
I confirm it and reassure myself like that.

642
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,930
And I feel afraid all over again.

643
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,820
Because you might disappear.

644
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,970
You must bring the camera.

645
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,820
I'm going to check if you practiced a lot.

646
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,030
Did you practice using the camera a lot?

647
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,250
I did, but I think it's really hard.

648
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,800
Hey, exposure first.

649
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,070
This time, try to take a picture of the sky and the trees.

650
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,800
Yes.

651
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,910
♫  You ride the wind and come to me ♫

652
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,120
How can your picture taking form also be so pretty?

653
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:35,910
Now, I'll capture your form with the camera.

654
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,480
Me?

655
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,680
You are so pretty right now. Ah, so pretty.

656
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,180
No matter how I take it, it's all so pretty.

657
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,500
Do you want to lean on the tree behind you like this?

658
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:52,790
You want me to do this? This is too weird.

659
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,500
So pretty!

660
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,860
- Shall we take a picture of our feet now?
- Our feet?

661
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,230
One, two, three!

662
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,010
When we first met in Cuba,

663
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,880
the day the accident happened.

664
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,530
The day that you were upset because your camera was ruined?

665
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,400
Yes, that day.

666
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,380
What about that day?

667
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,140
You don't remember the book I was reading, right?

668
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,400
I do remember the book that you were reading at the airport.

669
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,360
Yes, that's right. That book.

670
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,490
This metasequoia tree appears in there.

671
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,830
The poet that appears in that book

672
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,370
wrote a letter to the person he loved.

673
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,750
That person buried that letter under a tree.

674
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,370
Later, the poet's teacher found out about that and dug it up.

675
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,960
Because that person couldn't deliver it and left, he dug it up to deliver it on his behalf...

676
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,970
But ... it ends there.

677
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,720
Everytime I read it, I'm curious.

678
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,980
About what was written on there...

679
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,560
"I learned about love from reading books."

680
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,450
"Now I can clearly understand." Something like that?

681
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,860
Seriously...

682
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:12,260
But why didn't that poet personally deliver the letter and just bury it under the tree?

683
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,250
Did they break up?

684
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,300
He had a limited life.

685
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,390
What are we going to do about this mood? It's a sad ending.

686
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,200
Ah, why is that sad?

687
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,510
Just because a person disappears, does love also disappear?

688
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,860
It's true love.

689
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,330
You said that we were going out for some air and you tell a sad story.

690
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,780
All of a sudden, I feel bad.

691
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,980
It won't do for you to feel bad suddenly.

692
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,240
I have to make you happy. I'm doomed.

693
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,720
What is it?

694
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,900
You feel better all of a sudden, right?

695
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,410
A lot.

696
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:40,100
♫  When love shines in the two eyes looking at me ♫

697
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:48,190
♫  The moments which are as beautiful as a falling star ♫

698
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:55,150
♫  say I won't let go of the hand which was offered to me and ♫

699
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:58,440
It's pretty.

700
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,410
Once a year, I will upgrade it.

701
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:06,650
How can that be? You change a couple ring every year?

702
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:11,400
Because there is a big difference from your jewelry.

703
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,380
There is a big difference.

704
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,790
♫ I'm looking at you like this lasts forever ♫

705
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:20,320
This is the most beautiful.

706
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:25,970
♫  Now I belong to you ♫

707
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:31,090
♫  This feeling only grows more and more intense. ♫

708
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:36,840
My whole being is filled with you.

709
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:42,670
I won't be like the friends that you liked.

710
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,800
I can't grow distant or disappear.

711
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,620
Because I'm wholly full of Cha Soo Hyeon.

712
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:56,960
Until the day you eternally sleep,

713
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,850
I will protect you.

714
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:06,510
♫ The smile made for me without even a single small word ♫

715
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:14,230
♫  Is embedded and permeates my heart ♫

716
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:20,570
I will do everything slowly.
♫  I know I belong to you.  ♫

717
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:24,420
♫  Wishing the moment I'm looking at you ♫

718
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,290
I'm excited.

719
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:29,960
♫  like this lasts forever ♫

720
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,960
♫  Now  ♫

721
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:38,320
Should we take a commemorative photograph?
♫  I belong to you ♫

722
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:46,320
♫ This feeling only grows more and more intense. ♫

723
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,800
♫  Always at a distance within my reach ♫

724
00:51:51,800 --> 00:52:01,460
♫  I want to make you feel I'm always with you ♫

725
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:08,270
♫  I know I belong to you ♫

726
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:17,120
♫  Hoping this dream wouldn't be broken ♫

727
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:25,790
♫  Now I belong to you ♫

728
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:33,910
Couple rings
♫  This feeling only grows more and more intense. ♫

729
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:59,420
Even if everyone doesn't know, Jin Hyeok should know.

730
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,120
He's someone that has never forgotten a family member's birthday.

731
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,450
He is too much, really too much.

732
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:11,040
- What is too much?
- Ah, you scared me.

733
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,480
Why are you coming so soon?

734
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,520
We're closing the store today, so of course I came right away.

735
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,530
You are closing the store today? Why? Are you sick?

736
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:23,030
Jin Hyeok says to come to the hotel that he works at.

737
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:24,840
He asked to eat lunch together.

738
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,970
Why all of a sudden?

739
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,120
Maybe because he's going to buy seaweed soup.

740
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:35,500
Aigoo, our Jin Hyeok truly...

741
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,390
Just pack some comfortably clothes. We aren't coming home today.

742
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,160
Why can't we come home? Why?

743
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,940
He said for us to sleep at the hotel. He received the hotel voucher.

744
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,320
Last time, you know, the travel magazine. He should have just used it for himself.

745
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,100
Why does Jin Hyeok need to use that?

746
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,260
Unless he goes with us.

747
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,380
You... know what today is, right?

748
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,180
Ah, I know.

749
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,580
Dad's birthday!

750
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,280
You, you... just stay and cook ramen.

751
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:06,690
Just the two of us are going out.

752
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,650
There's really no use of raising children. Aigoo...

753
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,840
How about it? Should I cook for two?

754
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,240
- Is it fun?
- Yes.

755
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,450
♬ Happy Birthday, Jang Soo. ♬

756
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:18,890
This damn kid...

757
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,890
Department Head, we have a lunch meeting.

758
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,050
Yes, let's do that.

759
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,930
My parents and Jin Myeong are coming. Do you want to eat lunch together?

760
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,820
No. Have a good time with your family and have a luxury meal.

761
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:35,290
How about we go Dutch and go to a restaurant? Italian.

762
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:38,250
Ah, that's great. Let's go Dutch and get some sweet and sour chicken.

763
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,980
Um, we don't match.

764
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,220
Because I have planned to eat lunch with my parents, I'll be getting up first.

765
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,830
- Hye In, how about we get pasta?
- Ah, that's great.

766
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,810
- How about sweet and sour chicken?
- You like pasta, right?

767
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,760
Sweet and sour chicken sounds good.

768
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:07,180
In the hotel, even the elevator has such a nice ambience, right, Honey?

769
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,920
It's obvious that you're coming here for the first time. Let's go quietly.

770
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,360
Aigoo, it is our first time. Everything shows.

771
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,860
The flowers are pretty.

772
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:31,650
Is it on the 13th floor?

773
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:35,260
What was the name of the restaurant? It's in English, right?

774
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:40,040
If you just say that it's an Italian restaurant, everyone should know.

775
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,540
Are you going to Piazza Ristorante?

776
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,410
Pi... yes.

777
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:49,130
It's on the 13th floor to the right.

778
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:52,110
Yes, thank you. Yes.

779
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:05,360
This article. It's Jin Hyeok, right?

780
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,240
I'm sure it's just someone similar.

781
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,060
Mom.

782
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,910
Jin Hyeok.

783
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,290
Jin Hyeok.

784
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:35,940
Happy birthday, Mom. You were upset this morning, right?

785
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,010
Just a little bit!

786
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:42,570
Are you all really going to tease me like this?

787
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,340
Oh, my family!

788
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,440
Never in your life have you had a quiet entrance.

789
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,640
Let's go in! I'm hungry.

790
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,410
Lets go!

791
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:56,940
Delicious, right?

792
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,490
It's delicious.

793
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:06,150
- Mom.
-Yes?

794
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,820
We're already eating at a hotel! Why did you spend more money?

795
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,980
"Why did you spend more money"!

796
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,160
She loves it but our mother is always like this!

797
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,970
It's your only present, so cherish it.

798
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:26,550
Letting it go for Jin Myeong, but you don't even bring anything.

799
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,540
I got it with Jin Myeong.

800
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,090
I can't believe you.

801
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,300
It's so pretty!

802
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,990
Oh my.

803
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,510
How is it? Am I pretty, Jin Hyeok?

804
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:47,960
I got it with him.

805
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,180
You didn't even get your paycheck. Why do you keep insisting that you got it together?

806
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,330
I just borrowed some from Dae Chan.

807
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:57,650
Excuse us, the CEO sent this.

808
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:01,370
We prepared some wine that would match your menu.

809
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:05,210
Wine?

810
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:07,680
Thank you, Manager-nim.

811
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:13,550
Also, I was told to allow you two to use the hotel resources freely.

812
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,460
That's great! You two were going to sleep here tonight.

813
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,140
You have the sky lounge, right?

814
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,750
Yes. The view is amazing.

815
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:25,650
I will arrange a reservation at our sky lounge and escort you.

816
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:28,080
You don't have to.

817
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,750
If we walk around here, the hotel's atmosphere will only become shabby.

818
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,610
What do you mean?

819
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,920
Thank you for the wine. Please tell the CEO our thanks.

820
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,930
Yes, I will.

821
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,510
Would you proceed with the wine-tasting?

822
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,870
Test?

823
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:48,390
I will prepare it for you.

824
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,280
This is your first time drinking wine, right?

825
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:58,500
You. Grape alcohol or wine, same thing.

826
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,450
You're correct.

827
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,060
Yes?

828
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,990
I prepared what you asked.

829
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,360
Thank you.

830
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:26,540
They rejected the other offers. They were thankful enough with the wine.

831
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,110
Is that so? You did well.

832
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:34,900
I think they are sleeping here tonight. Should I upgrade their room?

833
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,370
No, they might find that uncomfortable as well.

834
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,910
Just make sure their place of stay is well kept.

835
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,160
Yes, ma'am. Then.

836
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,830
Alright then, let's have a meal together some other day.

837
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:05,140
If you call, I will come visit you whenever.

838
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,670
Director Choi contacted us. He said that he got the stocks together.

839
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:24,380
Will you really proceed with this?

840
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:29,760
I will try. To become the CEO of Donghwa Hotel.

841
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:34,380
It can't be Taegyeong's funds. Buy the stocks with my personal funds.

842
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,450
Yes, CEO.

843
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:40,220
Also ... keep an eye on Director Choi.

844
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,600
Yes, sir. Then I'll take my leave.

845
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,660
Jin Hyeok gave us such a great room.

846
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:06,700
Look at the view, honey. It's quite amazing.

847
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,930
Honey. Honey?

848
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:10,570
Yeah?

849
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:13,230
What are you thinking about?

850
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:16,590
I'm more tired laying down here.

851
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:25,760
Honey. I feel a little off.

852
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,180
What do you mean?

853
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:33,750
Because I think Jin Hyeok has a special relationship with that CEO.

854
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:36,010
It's his life. Leave him be.

855
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,010
They don't suit each other.

856
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:41,320
Jin Hyeok is handsome and the CEO is pretty. So what makes them not suit each other?

857
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,450
She's the boss of this fancy hotel.

858
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:48,000
I'm also the boss of Jang Soo Fruits.

859
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,800
Get some rest. I'm going to go get some air.

860
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,980
Where are you planning to go when you don't even know your way around?

861
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,480
I'll be right back. Should I buy you something?

862
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,870
No, I'm full.

863
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,600
- Hurry back.
- Alright.

864
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,800
Excuse me, customer.

865
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:26,670
Can I help you with something?

866
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:33,630
Thank you so much for today. I was so happy.

867
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,800
I'm not sure if the wine suited their tastes.

868
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,130
Should I have sent traditional liquor?

869
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,000
My father loved it.

870
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,570
He drank almost all of it himself because it tasted good.

871
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:47,510
I'm glad.

872
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:53,340
Your family gives out such a nice atmosphere.

873
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,390
You have something that my family doesn't have.

874
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:00,800
Ah, you really brought the mood down. Why are you thinking so sadly?

875
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:06,370
Well, it's the truth. And your mom has a really nice first impression.

876
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,980
What about my father?

877
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:15,640
Maybe it's because I've only seen a glimpse of him, but he seems like he would be a bit stoic.

878
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:20,540
You got him pegged. Does he seem like that even to other people?

879
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,810
Are you going home?

880
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:28,800
Yes. It's been such a long time since I went into an empty house.

881
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,040
You go home to an empty house every day, don't you?

882
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,970
That must be lonely.

883
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,100
Not really.

884
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,340
Should I go there?

885
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,870
Let's talk later. I think someone's here.

886
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:48,840
I understand.

887
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,200
Kim Jin Hyeok.

888
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,860
I ended up coming to this neighborhood.

889
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:15,650
I don't know anyone here, though.

890
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:21,830
I was about to call you and ask you to meet with me. But you came at exactly the right time.

891
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:25,530
Why are you here?

892
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:30,090
Because of the woman that I fell for at first sight

893
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,980
and am still in love with.

894
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,670
It's because of my woman.

895
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,580
Manager, what's the matter?

896
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,430
♬  Another long day  ♬

897
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:41,020
♬  is about to begin  ♬

898
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:45,130
♬  Today is passing slower than yesterday  ♬

899
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,810
♬  As much as I long for you  ♬

900
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:55,710

901
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,720
♬  Today is passing slowly  ♬

902
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,420
Encounter
~ Preview ~

903
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:07,530
If there's something that I have to endure in order to protect her, then I won't run away. No matter what it is.

904
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:11,760
Since things are like this, all you have to do is finish things up with the hotel.

905
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,310
Because of you, Jin Hyeok,

906
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:16,770
I've also almost forgotten what fear is.

907
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:21,780
I'm behaving so well, so what are you worried about? You're being too much.

908
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:27,200
Your courage and my restraint will be sorted out.

909
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,350
I'm protecting her in my own way.

910
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:34,810
♬  Whenever you miss me, just tell me  ♬
