1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,540
Encounter

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,730
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,960
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,820
Boyfriend

5
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,230
Please sit.

6
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,580
I thought you were scheduled for a business trip.

7
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,870
I've never had to do this while running the company,

8
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,620
but thanks to you, Director Choi, I'm experiencing these things.

9
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,960
- What's the matter?
- Are you asking because you don't know?

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,560
While I was away, you stole an employee and stabbed me in the back.

11
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,190
You shouldn't use those expressions as the CEO of Donghwa Hotel.

12
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,750
Wow. I'm taken aback.

13
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,710
I've lowered myself to your level so that you'll understand quickly.

14
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,580
Because it is such a sudden and unjustified transfer,

15
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,900
I don't understand a personnel assignment for the first time.

16
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,410
What did you do?

17
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,540
You can ask that to the HR—

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,030
Do you think I would've called for you

19
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,900
without looking into anything?

20
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,280
CEO, let's be more honest with each other.

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,400
I hope for that too.

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,880
Do you think this was solely my doing?

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,240
Don't you think that Taegyeong had something to do with it as well?

24
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,510
Today, I finally figured out

25
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,420
why you are always out of line.

26
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,170
I'm talking about Donghwa Hotel, and you speak of Taegyeong.

27
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,310
So that's why you've always been wandering and struggling on your own.

28
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,920
Is Donghwa Hotel just Donghwa Hotel?

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,050
"Donghwa Hotel's owner is Taegyeong."

30
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,400
Should I understand that to mean that's how I should think?

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
I can't say it isn't.

32
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:42,510
It is regarding that subject that I canceled my plans, came back, and summoned you here.

33
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,850
Regarding that, if you cross the line once again,

34
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,270
you will have a hard time dealing with the consequences.

35
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,430
Is that a threat? Do you think Taegyeong will allow that?

36
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:00,630
What I am saying is the matter of the mud you dug up in Sokcho.

37
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,620
I mean I will oppose Taegyeong in the future.

38
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,510
You make the choice.

39
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,770
Are you going to get lost by acting as Taegyeong's puppet,

40
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:18,020
or are you going to learn about behavior that receives respect as a director at Donghwa Hotel?

41
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,770
Please leave.

42
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,250
Jin Hyeok!

43
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,220
I have something to confess.

44
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,990
Confess?

45
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,070
I ...

46
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,210
I called the CEO.

47
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:54,230
I thought that she had to know. No one would've been able to stop it, and you would've been kicked out.

48
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,930
I thought that she would've been more upset if she came to know it after coming back from her business trip.

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,750
Thanks for being concerned for me.

50
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,860
You're not going to get angry?

51
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,460
I probably would've done the same if I were you.

52
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Because we're friends.

53
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,860
Yes, what brings you here, Mr. Kim Jin Hyeok?

54
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,610
I've come to meet the CEO.

55
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,860
Mr. Kim Jin Hyeok, were you the one who raised the SOS?

56
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,910
Did you call the CEO, asking to stop it from happening?

57
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,300
Is that what's important?

58
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,200
Yes, CEO. Mr. Kim Jin Hyeok is here.

59
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,840
Yes.

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,170
Go inside.

61
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,990
I'm sorry for letting you go through this. It was my fault.

62
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,330
It's nobody's fault. I'm alright.

63
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,620
It's not alright for me. I'm going to clean this up and return things to how they were before, so don't worry—

64
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,220
Are you going to cancel my transfer?

65
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,650
It was unfair to begin with.

66
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,280
CEO, if you return things back to normal,

67
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,620
then that seems like preferential treatment, too.

68
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,760
Kim Jin Hyeok, this issue—

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,480
It's unlike you, CEO.

70
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,530
When I first started working and learned about what you did and how you built this hotel,

71
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,810
I thought you were a really admirable person.

72
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,520
Making these sorts of decisions is unlike you, CEO Cha Soo Hyeon.

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,820
Please let me go there,

74
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,220
and watch how I'll return back to where I belong.

75
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,060
Kim Jin Hyeok, what in the world are you—

76
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,250
I do have one main concern.

77
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,260
The distance isn't short enough for me to just run to you whenever I miss you. That's my concern.

78
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,010
This isn't something to joke about.

79
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,930
I'll be on my way tomorrow after I finish this morning's work.

80
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,000
Episode 8

81
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,240
Do you want something?

82
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,500
I have to leave soon.

83
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,130
What's wrong? You came all of a sudden.

84
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,190
I've come to tell you right now, just in case you find out later and freak out.

85
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,920
What? Did you cause trouble again?

86
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,040
From your perspective, it might be.

87
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,410
What's that supposed to mean?

88
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,450
I realize after being born that you're my mom and Dad's my dad.

89
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,910
Cut the wordplay.

90
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,860
I'm not saying I hate it.

91
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,350
Up till now, I've worked hard to live by your plans.

92
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,470
I lived thinking that my desires were luxuries.

93
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,540
Having gone through life like that, I'm already in my mid-thirties.

94
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,990
It's thanks to me that you're known as the daughter-in-law of Taegyeong Group.

95
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,140
That was also my choice, so I don't blame you for it.

96
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,150
But...

97
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,550
I'm not going to live like that from now on.

98
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,360
So?

99
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,530
I think probably a lawsuit from Taegyeong will be served and it will cite the divorce agreement.

100
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,530
A lawsuit? But we're only just starting again. Why would they sue?

101
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,240
There's nothing to start again.

102
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,580
True. An in-law, no matter who, is a tough opponent.

103
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,450
I also went through a difficult time with your grandmother. But as you go through life—

104
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,120
I smiled when I got the divorce.

105
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,790
I was smiling without even realizing it, because I felt like I could breathe.

106
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:18,400
I'm not going back, so you should stop meeting Chairwoman Kim. You'll only get hurt.

107
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,120
Do you think you will be able to oppose Chairwoman Kim?

108
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,470
I'll prepare myself for the lawsuit and meet with a lawyer.

109
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,690
Are you out of your mind?

110
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,960
I'm not negotiating with you. I'm letting you know of my decision.

111
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,110
I'm leaving.

112
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,840
Sit.

113
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,400
Is it because of him?

114
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,030
Is that why you're running around acting crazy? Is that it?

115
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,860
For the first time, I'm going to try to be the owner of my own life.

116
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,540
And it's not because of or thanks to anyone.

117
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,660
What about your dad?

118
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,750
How could you do this so close to the election?!

119
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,590
If politics don't allow me to do this,

120
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,000
is that really politics?

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,040
Dad is the one who accomplished everything up until now.

122
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,860
Not you, not me, but Dad.

123
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,170
My goodness.

124
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,340
Manager Nam, you can give me the car and get off of work.

125
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,380
Right now?

126
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,470
Stop near your place and give me the car.

127
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,750
Where do you need to go? I'll take you there.

128
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm going on a date.

129
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,220
Oh, I see. Then I can get off here.

130
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,560
Everything's resolved, right?

131
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,550
Yeah.

132
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:51,040
- What a relief. If you were to go to Sokcho—
- I'm going to Sokcho.

133
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,580
What? How is that supposed to mean everything's resolved well?

134
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,540
Did CEO Cha just tell you to go?

135
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,220
I told her I would go.

136
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,680
I need to go in order for CEO Cha to protect Donghwa Hotel.

137
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,130
Do you not have a life?

138
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,360
You went through the SAT, college, employment. Are you not thinking about yourself?

139
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,520
The fact that a newbie is going to Sokcho...

140
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,340
This is the best I can do.

141
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,460
CEO Cha can protect the hotel, and I can protect CEO Cha.

142
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,720
Let's go. The department head is probably waiting.

143
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,520
We need to say goodbye.

144
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,460
Jang Soo Fruits

145
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,010
You're here.

146
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,700
Why didn't you stay home? It's so cold.

147
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,570
Here. Drink this.

148
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,750
I brewed some raisin tree tea.*
(hovenia dulcis, a remedy for hangover, promoting liver health)

149
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,420
Don't go sharing this with everyone in the neighborhood.

150
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,220
Why do you look so down? Did something happen?

151
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,130
Then do you think I'd be happy?

152
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,560
I wasn't like this even when we were sending Jin Hyeok away to the military.

153
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,980
I was so happy that he got into a good company, but he got sent to the countryside so quickly. Ugh, what is this?

154
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,330
He said hotel work is like that.

155
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,310
Then why isn't Hye In going?

156
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,080
They say there are a lot of hotels out in the countryside.

157
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,500
She's a girl.

158
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,670
It's 2018. There's no boy this or girl that.

159
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Perhaps our Jin Hyeok

160
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,560
did something wrong after all?

161
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,230
That's ridiculous.

162
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,550
Our son is not someone to get spoken badly about anywhere.

163
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,490
I know that cannot be the reason, but that's why I'm so frustrated.

164
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,770
He says he's leaving tomorrow. Did you help him pack?

165
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,960
I can't focus.

166
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,260
Just prepare dinner well.

167
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,210
Don't stay out too late.

168
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,430
Alright. I'll go home early.

169
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,510
- I'm going to go to the market.
- Okay.

170
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,890
Joo Yeon Ja! This tastes good.

171
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,410
I brewed it.

172
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,240
Goodness.

173
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,430
It was only for a short time, but I've learned a lot, Department Head.

174
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,210
I'm quite upset.

175
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,330
You had an impact and presence here.

176
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,950
It's going to feel empty without you.

177
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,840
We're not going to have a goodbye party?

178
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,380
A goodbye?

179
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,720
Sorry, I have plans tonight.

180
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,060
With whom? With the CEO?

181
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,450
- What?
- I guess I'm right.

182
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,750
Then we'll have to let him go.

183
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,370
- Then I'll go to Sokcho one time.
- Sure.

184
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,440
But where are you going to go with the CEO? Somewhere nice?

185
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,380
Just let him go. You're so annoying. Do you date like that too?

186
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,480
I want to date someone. To figure out what type of dater I am.

187
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,990
You're obviously the annoying type.

188
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,080
Stop talking to me, Eun Jin.

189
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,390
Should I give you a cup?

190
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,760
I'll brew it myself.

191
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,300
I shouldn't have done that, right?

192
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,900
Friendship. I decided to think of it in a good way.

193
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,110
Oh, you're here early.

194
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,180
Are you leaving again?

195
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:19,060
I need to go back to work and finish something up.

196
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,230
You said you're leaving to Sokcho tomorrow,

197
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,450
but you still have a lot of work?

198
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,660
I need to finish up the preparations for an event.

199
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,920
Did you go grocery shopping?

200
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,280
Since you're leaving,

201
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,530
I thought that we would have something nice for dinner.

202
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,890
I think I'll be kind of late tonight.

203
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,040
Then we'll have it when you come over during the weekend. Or I'll pack you something delicious.

204
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,370
Alright then. I'll get going.

205
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,900
Alright, go.

206
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,980
Why? Huh?

207
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,460
Aw, my baby. You can do it! Be strong, okay?

208
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,260
Bye.

209
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,880
Where are we going?

210
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,510
Somewhere nice and windy?

211
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,290
I didn't know that there was a place like this so near.

212
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,590
It's nice.

213
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,560
I came out here once in a while.

214
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,320
To take a photo of the wind.

215
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,680
You can take a photo of the wind?

216
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,430
When I take pictures of the reeds,

217
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,780
the wind can be seen.

218
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,460
It'd be better for you to become a poet.

219
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,450
It's a secret. Absolutely no one knows.

220
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,110
Actually, I have submitted a poem for an amateur writers' competition before.

221
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,460
Really?!

222
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,880
Thud! I was dropped in the first round.

223
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,190
I've come to know that not just anyone can write a poem.

224
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,820
What do you think about being a photographer?

225
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,260
- This is also a secret.
- You submitted to a photography competition, didn't you?

226
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,330
Again. Thud! I was dropped in the first round.

227
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,630
So I decided to just do it as a hobby.

228
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,430
Now I know two secrets about you.

229
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,090
Now our relationship has reached a special level

230
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,910
because you know all about my two secrets.

231
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,440
Have you ever gone up there?

232
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,980
The view is no joke.

233
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,370
The view from here is also different.

234
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,470
My heart is refreshed.

235
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,400
The wind is chilly.

236
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,450
You may catch a cold.

237
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,210
Just a moment.

238
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,070
I'm fine. You will be cold.

239
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,360
It's warm, isn't it?

240
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,220
It's warm.

241
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,650
♫ The morning sunrise, it takes me away ♫

242
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:07,510
♫ As I am staring at the light you hold ♫

243
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,690
It's not my fault if you catch a cold.

244
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,220
I'm not that weak.

245
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,220
Now I have a lot of memories.

246
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,800
What memories?

247
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,490
Good memories.

248
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,410
You know how it is.

249
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,110
Suddenly while I'm working, going to bed,

250
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,210
or brushing my teeth,

251
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,100
memories that have me smiling to myself.

252
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,550
♫  The other half of me  ♫

253
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:43,420
Since meeting you in Cuba, I have a lot of those kinds of memories.

254
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,130
The same is true for me.

255
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,990
You at the Hongje-dong playground,

256
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,310
you in front of the claw machine,

257
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,550
and you are in my memories from Cuba too.

258
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,790
♫ I'll go wherever world you’re on ♫

259
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,810
With these good memories of each other,

260
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,740
let's successfully go through it all together.

261
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,800
Right. Let's give it a try.

262
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,440
I have one more secret.

263
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,900
♫ It takes me away. As I... ♫

264
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,620
I learned about love from reading books.

265
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,080
Well. So that's what love is.

266
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,150
♫ Take me on to you ♫

267
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,340
If you love, that's what happens.

268
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,070
♫ When the light of yours shines down so beautiful ♫

269
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,290
♫ I laugh, I sing with you ♫

270
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,840
♫ Oh it’s like when stars fall around you ♫

271
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,430
Now, I can clearly understand.

272
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,720
♫ You take my heart away  ♫

273
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,210
Thanks to you, I know what it is

274
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,140
♫ Oh, take me on down a river ♫

275
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,530
I can clearly understand.

276
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:11,580
♫ I'll go wherever it leads to you ♫

277
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,430
♫ Oh, take me on into your arms ♫

278
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,250
Your third secret is really great.

279
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,000
♫ I'll go wherever world you're on. ♫

280
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,350
It's a gift to you.

281
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,800
Really? I know this is precious to you.

282
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,930
That's why I want to give it to you.

283
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,330
This is a memento for the fact that I've graduated from learning about love from books.

284
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,440
Even still...

285
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,040
As you take good pictures with this camera, think about me often.

286
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,740
I'll teach you how to use it.

287
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,360
You just have to press this button.

288
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,470
If you don't adjust the exposure level, the picture will come out blurry.

289
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,990
Use this to adjust the lighting, focus on your object, and click!

290
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,770
Go ahead and take one.

291
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,750
I'm going to the bathroom.

292
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:39,260
The object you are snapping is pretty much artwork, so it'll turn out well even with a mediocre shot.

293
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,820
Try it.

294
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,210
Is this weird?

295
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:18,070
♫ You can't start entering ♫

296
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,270
Is it not clicking?

297
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:24,870
♫ into my heart like this. ♫

298
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,690
Don't move. It's blurry.

299
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:40,670
♫ I won't ever lose my heart to you. ♫

300
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:47,380
♫  The more I like you  ♫

301
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:54,630
♫  The more I depend on you  ♫

302
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,070
♫  The heart I'm unwilling to lose  ♫

303
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:04,520
♫  The heart that is unwilling to depart ♫

304
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,070
You should have done this earlier. Who does laundry on the day they go on a blind date?

305
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,080
Hey. This is something for me to actually wash the clothes and go wearing freshly cleaned clothes.

306
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,130
Hyung, let's buy you something to wear. Even if those clothes dry, you have nothing to wear!

307
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,190
I have good visuals, so it doesn't matter what I wear.

308
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,550
Oh, my.

309
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,780
What if she falls for me at first sight? That's no fun.

310
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,470
Hey, where is this arrogance coming from?

311
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,080
Shouldn't you shave?

312
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Hey, Jin Myeong. The girl wants to meet at a place that's too expensive.

313
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,260
If I meet her but don't like her, all that's left is the bill.

314
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,440
It's worth a few plates of snails.

315
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,350
You're a real cheapskate. Don't you know how to invest in yourself?

316
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,500
Would you like your receipt?

317
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,410
What?

318
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,900
Hello?

319
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,290
Why are you answering?

320
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,170
I'm answering because you called.

321
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,720
Is your name Lee Dae Chan?

322
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,830
Is your name Jang Mi Jin?

323
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,970
This match making app has a problem with trustworthiness.

324
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,470
The app worked well and caused you to meet a good catch!

325
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,350
How did I not think of Chan's Whelks?

326
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,240
Why do you always ridicule my restaurant?

327
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,730
My store is something I've devoted my life to since I was twenty-three.

328
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,450
You started early. A business?

329
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,320
Did you run it during college?

330
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,810
I didn't go to college.

331
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,160
You didn't go to college?

332
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,090
Well, why is college necessary if I'm selling snails?

333
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,160
Why? Why didn't you go to college?

334
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,000
Jang Mi Jin, you're quite odd.

335
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,610
Have you ever been asked why you went to college?

336
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,820
Nobody asks you that.

337
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,500
So why do you ask why I didn't go to college when I told you I didn't?

338
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,260
Everyone has their own way of living.

339
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,220
Why does there only seem to be one path?

340
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,260
Well, that's that. I heard you were the CEO of a franchise.

341
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,510
Why did you lie?

342
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,310
It's not a lie. The first branch is my restaurant.

343
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,950
I'm opening a second branch in the near future.

344
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,700
Then open it or don't.

345
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,160
CEO is not a title that just anyone can use!

346
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,110
- What are you getting?
- Eat alone.

347
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,200
Don't talk about our meeting

348
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,680
to Kim Jin Hyeok.

349
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,800
I couldn't even eat dinner. What is this? So annoying!

350
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,680
You didn't go to college?

351
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,160
Well, why is college necessary if I'm selling snails?

352
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,720
I heard you were the CEO of a franchise. Why did you lie?

353
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,260
I'm opening a second branch in the near future.

354
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,650
CEO is not a title that just anyone can use!

355
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,290
Was I too harsh?

356
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,430
Whatever. Who told him to lie?

357
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,880
- What is that?
- I was very stressed today.

358
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,170
- This is to prevent hair loss. I'm so frustrated!
- You scared me.

359
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,460
She didn't look like that much of a psycho in the pictures.

360
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,200
I had a good feeling.

361
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,440
It's all a scam. The profiles and whatnot, they're all a scam!

362
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,110
I'm going to send a complaint over to the company that runs that app.

363
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,210
Oppa, there are a lot of good people in the world.

364
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,050
You just don't have time to find them because you're running the store.

365
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,640
- What is this?
- Hey.

366
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,710
- Want to come to my company's year-end party?
- No.
- What kind of party?

367
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,660
- Masquerade party.
- Masquerade...

368
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,750
Hyung! That's perfect for you! If you just cover your face, your nice body will stand out.

369
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,410
Oh, I'm so stressed.

370
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,510
What's wrong with his face?

371
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,540
- He has charm.
- Aw, our Hye In has been in society.

372
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,120
Even if it's saying something she doesn't mean, she says it smoothly.

373
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,090
- That's not so.
- She's good.

374
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,980
My coworkers are inviting their friends and family. I'm inviting you. Come and have a blast.

375
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,220
So we should go too, right? Thank kind of event suits my visual.

376
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,460
- What's the concept?
- Just like a club party.

377
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,910
- It'll be fun. There's a raffle, too.
- Wait.

378
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,510
- What's the prize?
- There are lot. There are hotel certificates, too.

379
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,810
I'm great at getting this kind of stuff.

380
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,870
Since a long time ago, I've oddly had amazing luck with this stuff.

381
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,100
You're exploding with happiness from the free prizes.

382
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,420
But what are you wearing? Let's go buy proper clothing this time.

383
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,410
A nice, fitted suit that pops!

384
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,410
Just borrow Jin Hyeok's suit.

385
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,710
- There won't be any feel.
- Hey, I have a suit, too!

386
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,070
- And whether it's Jin Hyeok or me—
- What are you saying?

387
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,620
Don't you remember what happened when my mom gave you pants she bought that were too big for my brother?

388
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,420
You looked like a total ahjusshi!

389
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,610
Then what about you? You're his brother. Did they fit you?

390
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,320
I didn't try them on. If I did, they would have fit perfectly.

391
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,350
And I don't compare myself with Jin Hyeok. Why?

392
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,990
This is not the food industry.

393
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,660
How wise of you all.

394
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,910
Oh! My hair is falling out!

395
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,010
Didn't you buy a size too small?

396
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,230
This is the smallest one!

397
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,930
- You have a fever.
- It's okay.

398
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,840
See? You caught a cold.

399
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,400
I'm really okay.

400
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,310
- Here.
- Yes.

401
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,320
I'll get better real fast if I have this.

402
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,180
I'll get you some warm tea. You need to drink a lot of fluids.

403
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,620
It's not as good as Teacher Lee's tea,

404
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,010
but it should be alright. It's a nice tea.

405
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,830
I keep being greedy.

406
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,240
"I want to have tea with this person."

407
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,510
"When I have tea,"

408
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,020
"I want to have a meal with this person."

409
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,410
"I want to tell her stories."

410
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,900
"I want to give her my heart."

411
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,830
This person...

412
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,650
I want to hold her beautiful hands.

413
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:31,640
♫ I know I belong to you ♫

414
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:40,820
♫ Wishing the moment I'm looking at you like this lasts forever  ♫

415
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,500
♫ Now, I belong to you ♫

416
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,780
I want to hug this person.

417
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:57,340
♫ Facing you my feeling only grows more and more intense ♫

418
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:12,900
♫ When your warm warmth encounters my heart ♫

419
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:20,900
♫ My feeling which has grown so that I can't hide it ♫

420
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:28,390
♫ The smile made for me without even a single small word  ♫

421
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:35,030
♫ Is embedded and permeates my heart ♫

422
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:42,450
♫ I know I belong to you ♫

423
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:51,740
♫ Wishing the moment I'm looking at you like this lasts forever ♫

424
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:58,560
♫ Now I belong to you ♫

425
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:08,160
♫ Facing you my feeling only grows more and more intense  ♫

426
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,630
♫ Always at a distance within my reach ♫

427
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:23,300
♫ I want to make you feel I'm always with you ♫

428
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,380
Jin Myeong! Hurry up and come out!

429
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,870
When are you leaving?

430
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,290
Slowly after eating breakfast.

431
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,270
Did you pack your bags well?

432
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,920
Yes.

433
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,380
What are you talking about?

434
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,940
You didn't tell Jin Myeong?

435
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,260
When he leaves for work, he's sleeping. At night, he comes late because he's working.

436
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,370
When did he have time to tell him, right?

437
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,900
Ah, what are you talking about?

438
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,500
I got transferred to Sokcho. I'm leaving today.

439
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,940
Sokcho? All of a sudden? Why are you the only one going?

440
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,790
What is it with "you"?

441
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,460
Ah, Hyung, why are you the only one going?

442
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,050
Hotels are usually like that. They go around to other branches and work.

443
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,100
Why is Hye In only in the main branch?

444
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,330
- Noona!
- Noona.

445
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,590
She got assigned, but I volunteered.

446
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,170
Since it's a newly opened hotel, there's a lot to learn.

447
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,840
There's probably a lot to learn in the main branch too.

448
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,810
They do field service at a different branch and go back to the main branch.

449
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,880
If I get transferred to an international branch later on, you are probably going to cry.

450
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,800
Just try and get transferred to an international branch... you must take me.

451
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,290
Depending on how you do.

452
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,770
It's good that you are working in Dae Chan's store, but take care of Father's store too.

453
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,490
When he goes shopping, go help him.

454
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,540
Because his driving is dangerous, it doesn't even help if he comes along.

455
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,450
Huh? Last time, you said "Jin Hyeok's driving is too cautious"

456
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,800
- "that it would take 3 nights and 4 days."
- 3 nights? Huh?

457
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,600
Did you pack his supplements?

458
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,390
Aigoo, really.

459
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,690
You have to eat it well, taking into consideration my devotion.

460
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,150
I will eat it well.

461
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,910
Hyung, you won't be able to make it to the year-end masquerade party then.

462
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,990
Hye In ... Noona. I'm going because she invited me.

463
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,630
Play well on my behalf.

464
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,150
I will go and if there's a fine lady, I will get her number and give it to you.

465
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,920
Don't say such nonsense. Just let him eat.

466
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,380
But really, Jin Hyeok drives for 3 nights and 4 days?

467
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,040
He's a frustrating style.

468
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,220
You just don't speed.

469
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,760
I wish I can just mix up your driving speeds.

470
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,650
Something's going to happen, something's going to happen like that.

471
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,300
I'm going to get a sports car later.

472
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,560
Are you going to drive us then?

473
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,730
Of course. But it can only seat two people.

474
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:34,000
Then between your dad and me, who will ride it?

475
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:42,420
Call Soo Hyeon and persuade her. She said some strange things.

476
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,050
This girl is becoming more and more... This is all because of that weird guy.

477
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,630
What is "guy" to someone else's precious son?

478
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,840
They're preparing a lawsuit!

479
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,770
Whose path is she trying to block?

480
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,600
We are the ones that blocked the path of our one and only child.

481
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,160
What do you want me to do when she kicked away her luck?

482
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,800
I shouldn't have sent her to that household.

483
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,560
After everything, you are saying that it's all my fault?

484
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,900
It's all my fault.

485
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,660
Whether the money you said you borrowed from the bank was actually put in by Taegyeong Group,

486
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,450
the fact that I didn't verify it was all my fault.

487
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,900
And it's also my fault that I didn't reject them when they got a hold of my ankle and asked for our daughter in marriage.

488
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,230
And the fact that, because of that, we are still facing this commotion,

489
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,030
this is my fault as well.

490
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,340
Why are you mentioning this now? Stories of everything that passed?

491
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,570
That's why I'm saying that you should just leave Soo Hyeon alone.

492
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,080
She's saying that she's going to live her life too.

493
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,310
Donghwa Hotel Year-End Party

494
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,750
Taegyeong Group

495
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,670
I thought that I should let you know, CEO.

496
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,800
Kim Jin Hyeok was transferred to Sokcho.

497
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,400
- To Sokcho?
- Yes.

498
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,590
And CEO Cha just let that happen?

499
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,660
It seems that way.

500
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,210
I understand.

501
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,800
We invite you to our year-end party.

502
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,970
Why all of a sudden?

503
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,590
I exercise here.

504
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,270
There are a lot of nice hotels near your company.

505
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,860
The machines here are very nice. And it seems like the air is good.

506
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,110
Is the air purifier working well?

507
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,110
What happened? Because I don't have a lot of time.

508
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,080
I heard that he got transferred over.

509
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,150
It's Donghwa's issue. You seem to have a lot of interest.

510
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,760
You could have placed him back in his position.

511
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,160
Why are you curious about that?

512
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,940
Because it's an issue with a woman I like.

513
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,910
I heard this wrong, right?

514
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,270
Is my pronunciation bad?

515
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,130
I'll say it again "Because it's a woman I like..."

516
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,590
No, Woo Seok.

517
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,650
Don't joke with me.

518
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,120
It's not a joke.

519
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,590
What are you doing right now?

520
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,610
See you again.

521
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,090
I missed you a lot lately.

522
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,770
I'm leaving.

523
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,010
Sokcho Beach

524
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,050
Sokcho Express Bus Terminal

525
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,810
Hotel Reservation List and Event Participants List

526
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,070
Demand for duty-free shops is expected to increase.

527
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,510
Jin Hyeok

528
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,320
Yes, it's me!

529
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,010
Did you arrive there safely?

530
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,110
Yes, I arrived here safely.

531
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,330
It's a bit unfamiliar, right?

532
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,760
It isn't that unfamiliar.

533
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,120
But your face is glimmering.

534
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,260
I'm in deep trouble because I miss you.

535
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,520
It sounds like you just create that comment. You are being sincere, right?

536
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,590
Oh huh? Everytime I take a step, I say "Cha Soo Hyeon."

537
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:44,280
What do you mean when I'm walking by saying "Soo Hyeon, Cha Soo Hyeon"?

538
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,240
Walking like this, I'll arrive at my lodging by tomorrow.

539
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,090
Wow, look at his comment.

540
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,640
If you don't like it, I'll stop.

541
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,120
You also improved in playing hard to get.

542
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,860
They say that dating is all about playing hard to get.

543
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,200
Says who?

544
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,130
My dad.

545
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,000
♫ I can’t hide anywhere. I followed to your dream  ♫

546
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,400
♫ Is this what they have been calling love? ♫

547
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,790
Sleep well and have a good first day.

548
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,530
Ah, are you saying that you are going to hang up already?

549
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,690
I got lost while talking to you, too.

550
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,140
If I become a missing child in Sokcho, I'm going to give them your number.

551
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,690
Sounds good. On that excuse, I can go to Sokcho.

552
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,960
Sounds good. You can come.

553
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,900
I'm really going to go.

554
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,550
Fine, hurry up and come.

555
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,650
It's not a lie.

556
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,010
Yes, I said to come.

557
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,950
Then, I'll meet you soon.

558
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,740
Deal! I'll meet you soon.

559
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,320
Yes.

560
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:50,330
♫ Oh, take me on into your arms  ♫

561
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:55,260
♫ I'll go wherever world you're on  ♫

562
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,400
My father moved.

563
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,770
Are you okay?

564
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,870
What can I do?

565
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,770
Since my dad didn't really come home often, it's not really weird.

566
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,330
I'm worried for you.

567
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,940
My mom is a worry.

568
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,220
She's become an abandoned dog.

569
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,380
What? An "abandoned dog?"

570
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,860
She's been abandoned.

571
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,410
But still, saying that your mom is an "abandoned dog" is a bit much.

572
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:32,100
It's just a metaphor. I'm not saying that she's a dog.

573
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,490
Everyone learns that during language class.

574
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,580
I was a reporter. I know all that too.

575
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,840
I'm just saying that I feel bad for both of you.

576
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,010
Hey, kiddo. Everything looks good here. Why don't you order something else too?

577
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:47,410
Ahjussi, then... Can you buy that?

578
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,010
My mom likes that bread.

579
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,200
Ah, who do you take after to be such a good girl?

580
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,370
Jeanne d'Arc?

581
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,570
Your race is totally different, you know?

582
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,810
Then, let's say that I take after you, Ahjussi.

583
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,260
You are messing up the family tree here.

584
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,920
Then, why don't we just say that I'm simply a good girl?

585
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,690
You are totally Kim Seon Joo's daughter. I can totally tell, yeah.

586
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,190
You are surprised, aren't you? I called you out of the blue.

587
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,940
No, ma'am.

588
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,270
It's been quite some time since you've been seeing my son.

589
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,810
I have been too indifferent.

590
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:26,030
I guess our relationships will grow into something special. Please be comfortable around me.

591
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,930
Well ...

592
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,750
I broke up with CEO Jeong.

593
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,630
Can I ask you ...

594
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,270
why you broke up with him?

595
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,430
It's not in my place to say.

596
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,750
Let's have a talk for a moment.

597
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,150
How much money did you pay her?

598
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,340
What do you mean?

599
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,460
To make it look so convincing that you were in love with that girl that you'd get divorced...

600
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,730
How much money did it cost?

601
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,210
"Why would he keep the woman in his heart when he said he didn't have feelings for her?"

602
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,020
"Does he miss her out of a mere lingering affection?"

603
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,880
"Is that why he's been waiting for Cha Soo Hyeon?"

604
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,600
"Should I take care of Jang Soo Ha for him?"

605
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,560
Did you want to let Cha Soo Hyeon out of this house that much?

606
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,070
So much that you'd even lie to me?

607
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:52,400
So, from the beginning, you put Jang Soo Ha in that place, in order to let her go?

608
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,920
In the end, that "thing" has

609
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,840
made you like this.

610
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,130
She doesn't know about this.

611
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,920
It was all on me. That's what I wanted.

612
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,190
Go get some rest.

613
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:37,600
This is Kim Jin Hyeok. He will be working with us starting from today.

614
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,050
Nice to meet you all.

615
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,680
It's my first time working at a front desk. I will learn from you.

616
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,880
Yes.

617
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,760
I'm looking forward to working with you.

618
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,870
Ddeokgook* is a seasonal dish, right?
(Rice cake soup, auspicious food for a prosperous new year)

619
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:53,150
Yes, it is, CEO. We're planning to serve it in the menu for a week around New Year.

620
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,170
Since we have some time, instead of last year's vendor,

621
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,070
I wish you'd look into a new place to get ddeok (rice cake). Its texture was too soft.

622
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:02,070
Ah, yes. I will look into that.

623
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,170
Please let us taste it first.

624
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,950
Yes, you are all set. Thank you.

625
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,600
Sunbae-nim, I'm just going to take a phone call.

626
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,390
Go ahead.

627
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:20,890
Hello, this is Kim Jin Hyeok.

628
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:25,980
Yes. I would like you to check the DJ and band schedule one more time for the party tomorrow.

629
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,690
Yes, the order status for the masks too.

630
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:37,740
I'm sorry that I couldn't wrap it up myself. Yes. Yes.

631
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,530
- Kim Jin Hyeok?
- Yes!

632
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,350
I'm counting on you.

633
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:44,280
Yes.

634
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,990
Manager wants you to pick up the manual before you get off work.

635
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,260
Ah, yes, Sunbaenim.

636
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,990

Kim Jin Hyeok from Headquarters Public Relations to Sokcho Dongwha Room Management

637
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:16,390
♫  You can't start entering ♫

638
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:23,820
♫  into my heart like this. ♫

639
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:30,970
♫ I'm living next to you ♫

640
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:38,410
♫  whom I liked ♫

♫  to anyone. ♫

643
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,070
I miss her so much.

644
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,050
Donghwa Hotel

645
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,270
2018 Year-End Party

646
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,690
The planner is sent to Sokcho. What is this?

647
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,060
Masquerade Party

648
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,420
Pick one for you.

649
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,890
For me?

650
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:56,890
You will be coming to inspect later. Are you planning to stand out in a crowd of masked people?

651
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,950
I'm just going for a quick second.

652
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:03,260
We— No. Kim Jin Hyeok put in a lot of effort.

653
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,250
Until his last day here.

654
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:09,570
I hope you, too, would have some fun tonight.

655
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,360
Is everything going alright?

656
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,570
I'm expecting it to be fantastic.

657
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,120
I guess this is the best for not showing my face.

658
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,080
Free giveaways for the raffles are ready, right?

659
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,170
Yes, including gifts cards for the hotel and buffet, and champagne. We have everything ready.

660
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:29,980
Okay.

661
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,420
What do you think about the size, Department Head?

662
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,870
- That's perfect.
- All right.

663
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,830
Donghwa Resort Sokcho

664
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,890
You can check out by 11:00AM tomorrow.

665
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,330
The elevators are behind you.

666
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:46,210
Enjoy your time.

667
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,750
Kim Jin Hyeok.

668
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,150
Manager Nam?

669
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:52,840
The end-of-year party at the headquarters is chaotic. What are you doing here?

670
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,160
You planned that party. It's a mess with poor arrangement.

671
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,550
What's going on?

672
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,080
I'm from headquarters.

673
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,840
I need to take Kim Jin Hyeok to headquarters right now.

674
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,490
Department Head Kim is looking for you. Hurry and let's leave.

675
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:06,610
Right now?

676
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,250
Then, when? Should we go after midnight?

677
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,030
Let the party be ruined?

678
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,730
CEO's really upset right now.

679
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:14,140
I will fill you in on our way.

680
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,470
Jin Hyeok, he says the CEO is upset.

681
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:19,660
We can't be in trouble. Hurry and go.

682
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,570
Yes.

683
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,390
Thank you.

684
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,510
Get in.

685
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:39,360
I will sit in the front. I will drive.

686
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,540
I'm not here for Kim Jin Hyeok.

687
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,600
I'm here to escort my CEO's boyfriend.

688
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,950
Hurry. Get in.

689
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,680
Ah, it's a bit awkward.

690
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,070
I hope there are many pretty girls.

691
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,830
Hey, Jin Myeong. Don't you think it was too much for me to take a day off for this?

692
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,360
It's you who is too much!

693
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,310
Let's play hard tonight.

694
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,680
- Let's get it, bro!
- Let's get it?

695
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,090
- Let's go, let's go.
- Let's get it!

696
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:48,520
- Did you talk to Hye In?
- Yeah, she told me to come upstairs.

697
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,940
- Oppa!
- Whoa, Hye In!

698
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,460
Why are you looking so pretty?

699
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,030
You two look great, dressed up like that.

700
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,120
- We will take care of this place tonight.
- Yup, we will.

701
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,720
Here. Put this on.

702
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,160
What is this?

703
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,240
Ah, my face is too good looking to be covered with such thing. But since it's a concept...

704
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,670
How many times do I have to tell you? The more you cover your face, the better.

705
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,920
- Come. Let's go.
- Let's go.

706
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,600
Why are you so pretty tonight?

707
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,240
- Good evening.
- Yes.

708
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,270
Pick one you like and put it on.

709
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,160
- This one.
- Ah, this one.

710
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,130
Thank you.

711
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,760
Please enjoy.

712
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:38,890
No matter how much you cover up, the royal family vibe is too stunning.

713
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:43,280
Ah, it's so exciting.

714
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,360
This kind of event is just awesome, awesome. Who do you think planned this?

715
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,360
Kim Jin Hyeok did.

716
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,230
What the... It's "Gapboonsa" (slang; abbreviation of "It's gotten awkward all of sudden" = wet blanket)

717
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,000
What?

718
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,940
I mean, it's getting awkward all of sudden.

719
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,780
No, it's "Gapboonjjan." It's getting sad.

720
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:03,940
Do I have to cover my beauty? It's upsetting me, really.

721
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,750
Why don't you put it on before we get off?

722
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:46,950
If we are together, people will know you are the CEO, so bye.

723
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:57,060
Jin Hyeok, wait a minute.

724
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,520
You don't even know the concept of the party you planned?

725
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,750
This is my gift.

726
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,820
Thank you.

727
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,000
What is this?

728
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,430
How could people think so one-sidedly?

729
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:43,110
Adieu, 2018.

730
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,510
Hey, Jin Myeong. Is there a straw?

731
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,480
No, there is no straw here. Just lift your mask a bit and drink!

732
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,070
Thank you for celebrating the end of the year with us at Donghwa.

733
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:55,440
So, everyone has received the mask they requested, right?

734
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,790
Yes!

735
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,650
No errors, right?

736
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:02,170
Our Donghwa Hotel is this accurate.

737
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:06,840
Then, here's to hoping that a destined match is someone under these masks.

738
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,660
Let's start the evening's festivities.

739
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,370
Hey.

740
00:55:55,660 --> 00:56:00,520
What in the world? There's a face that can't get covered.

741
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,800
Is that you, Seon Joo?

742
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,590
Oppa, just take it off. I feel bad for the mask.

743
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,660
No one recognizes me with a mask on!

744
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,960
I can totally recognize it's Nam Myeong Sik from a 100 meters away. Are you presbyopic?

745
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:14,950
You look better covered, as well.

746
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,610
I'm so thankful I could die.

747
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:20,910
Since I'm single now, I'm wondering where my prince charming is.

748
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,560
I guess I'll go get wasted.

749
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,170
She's so immature for her age.

750
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,550
It's recognizable from afar! How good is that?

751
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:42,310
Donghwa Hotel 2018 End of the Year Party

752
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:13,790
Ladies and gentlemen. The long awaited new year is just a minute away.

753
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,750
Before we shoot the new year firecrackers, I will count down the last 20 seconds left in this year.

754
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:25,580
If you have found a suitable partner, don't let them go now.

755
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:30,480
The count down will begin!

756
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:38,590
20, 19, 18,

757
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:43,390
17, 16, 15,

758
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:48,020
14, 13, 12,

759
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:51,150
11, 10,

760
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:53,830
9, 8,

761
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:56,560
7, 6, 5,

762
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:00,550
4, 3, 2,

763
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:03,800
2, 1.

764
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,920
Happy New Year!

765
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,960
With Donghwa
Havana Party

766
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:25,780
I hope you enjoy these jazz and salsa performances in celebration of the 2019 Havana hotel.

767
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,030
We welcome you to the heat and passion of Cuba.

Encounter
~ Preview ~

812
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,670
It became news when I woke up.

813
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:46,170
It's something I brought from Cuba. I just kept them to use as props for shooting later.

814
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:50,090
It will be a good chance to end it all at once.

815
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:51,870
Come on! Answer, Jin Hyeok!

816
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:54,140
Where are you?

817
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:05,640
Epilogue

818
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:10,670
Secretary Kim, find out what outfit CEO Cha Soo Hyeon wore to work today.

819
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,020
Hello. I apologize for calling during your lunch break.

820
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:29,330
I'm just calling because of the Donghwa Hotel end of the year party.

821
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,800
Yes. The staff there has fulfilled all of the plans arranged.

822
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,910
I have just one more request.

823
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:41,860
It's for a female, and I hope to have their entire face covered.

824
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,130
She would probably prefer not being identified.

825
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:50,510
Yes. I can send you a sketch.

826
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:54,010
Yes. I'll leave it up to you. Thank you.

827
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:55,720
Bye.

828
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,080
Important Points: 1. Cover the whole face, 2. Comfortably handheld, 3. Neutral color
