1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,690
Encounter

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,050
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,710
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,120
Boyfriend

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,420
Kim Jin Hyeok.

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,340
Ah, I ended up coming all the way to this neighborhood.

7
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,520
I don't know anyone here, though.

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,060
I was about to call you to meet up with me.

9
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,820
Why are you here?

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,200
Because of my woman

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,440
whom I fell for at first sight

12
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,190
and am still in love with.

13
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,660
That person is someone

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,190
whom anyone would fall in love with.

15
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,940
"That person"?

16
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,120
However,

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,500
I think that you're being one-sided by calling her your woman. I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,400
Whether it's a one-sided opinion or something proven by facts,

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,380
let's wait and see.

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,380
What are you trying to say?

21
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,350
You can't handle her.

22
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,510
An ordinary man who's barely turned thirty years old should date someone on his own level.

23
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,660
There's no right and wrong in one person loving another person.

24
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,420
CEO Jeong ... Loving someone because they're worthy of love ...

25
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,610
doesn't exist in this world.

26
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,750
Love has already begun before you turn around to consider whether it's the right person.

27
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,520
If there's something that I have to endure to protect that person,

28
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,890
I won't avoid it, whatever it is.

29
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,880
Isn't that foolish?

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,580
It's courage.

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,010
I see. Thanks to your courage and fighting spirit,

32
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,150
I'm also full of fighting spirit.

33
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,280
Let's wait and see together what's going to happen

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,720
because of that courage of yours.

35
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,000
Is there anything else that I need to hear?

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,600
No. Let's take our time discussing the rest.

37
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,760
Because I'll be seeing you often.

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,630
Then I'm going.

39
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,960
It's cold.

40
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm sorry for coming to see you so suddenly.

41
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,880
It's alright. I should have come to you, but I was worried that you would feel uncomfortable.

42
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,910
So I just sent the wine.

43
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,480
I enjoyed it thanks to you. Thank you.

44
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Don't mention it.

45
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,950
I'm not good at speaking.

46
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,160
I cannot beat around the bush.

47
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,190
Please speak comfortably.

48
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,630
When Jin Hyeok first came out in the articles,

49
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,850
I thought that it wasn't true, so I didn't ask about it.

50
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,960
I don't think his feelings for you are shallow.

51
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,730
I'm thinking a lot about what I should do about this.

52
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,560
I'm very unusual, aren't I?

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,110
Whether it's a problem of being special or ordinary,

54
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,590
I cannot speak thoughtlessly.

55
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Jin Hyeok has such a deep heart. Since you've expressed yourself that way,

56
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,320
I think I know why he's such a deep-hearted person.

57
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,590
My son is better than me.

58
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,960
I asked Jin Hyeok about it.

59
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,380
I asked him if it was something I should support or be worried about.

60
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,470
He is asking me to support you, of course.

61
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,550
But a parent's heart always worries first.

62
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,140
You know that both you and Jin Hyeok will have a hard time.

63
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,350
Don't you, CEO?

64
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,150
If you two are going to just suffer heartache,

65
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,560
then I'm wondering whether it's right for you two to keep developing feelings for each other.

66
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,460
I didn't come to give you a hard time.

67
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,980
It's all right.

69
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,720
Of course you feel that way. Because you're a parent.

70
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,630
I wish things would work out just because you two like each other.

71
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,680
But the road in front of you looks too dangerous to keep going just based on your feelings.

72
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,620
So is it right for me to support you like Jin Hyeok asked me to?

73
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:05,660
I know that you're calling me special because I'm lacking.

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,930
It will be difficult,

75
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,850
but I hope that you'll watch over us.

76
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,360
It's the fighter going into the ring who suffers, not the audience.

77
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,940
Episode 12

78
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,620
My coordinates are set to one meter away from Cha Soo Hyeon.

79
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,560
I'll always be there.

80
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,870
Soo Hyeon

81
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,270
Let me see you.

82
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,700
It's a new world, isn't it?

83
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,150
This is spicy and chewy. This is pretty good.

84
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,200
I told you so.

85
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,260
Oh? What is this?

86
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,620
You should do your best. Look at this.

87
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,630
There's so much meat left.

88
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,630
Watch closely.

89
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,610
You have to eat this much off for me to say you did your best.

90
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,580
You look like a pig. I'm not going to eat like that.

91
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,630
I was touched.

92
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,090
I was just asking for you to video call,

93
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,280
but you really showed me your face.

94
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,230
I don't look that great on screen.

95
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,660
Today of all days, it's really awesome.

96
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,590
We must have been thinking alike.

97
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,070
Today of all days, I also especially wanted to see you.

98
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,800
Really?

99
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,130
If our relationship is at this level, then it is safe.

100
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,510
Our relationship isn't the type to be affected just because someone shows up.

101
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,050
Did you go on a blind date?

102
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,360
Even if you go on a hundred blind dates, I don't think anyone like me will show up.

103
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,730
- Wrong!
- What?

104
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,890
You're saying that there is?

105
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,530
I'm saying that there's no way I'd even go on a blind date. Goodness.

106
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,920
Alright, let's start the second half.

107
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,210
Rice balls are a work of art with chicken feet.

108
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,280
I only ate one piece of chicken feet, but I feel like I'm having a full-course meal.

109
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,420
Knock, knock. Please open the door.

110
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,740
It's going in. Ah.

111
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,710
Aigo, you eat so well. I'm proud of you.

112
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,490
It's really delicious!

113
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,800
Right?

114
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,370
Soo Hyeon.

115
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,600
Why do you like me?

116
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,440
Is something wrong?

117
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,990
You're acting a little strange today.

118
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,130
Don't change the subject.

119
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm being serious.

120
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,070
Why do you like Kim Jin Hyeok?

121
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,970
I like you because you're Kim Jin Hyeok.

122
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,720
Because you're the one and only Kim Jin Hyeok in the world.

123
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,890
Wow.

124
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,330
I thought I'd stay up all night, but now I think I'll sleep just fine.

125
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,630
Something is definitely up. You're acting strange.

126
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,420
Today of all days, I strangely want to stay with you.

127
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,320
I should go sleep at your house.

128
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,900
I came for nothing. Go home. It's late.

129
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,730
No, no. I'll come and put you to sleep. I'll leave quietly as soon as you fall asleep.

130
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,550
- I sleep well on my own.
- By taking sleeping pills?

131
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I'm the human sleeping pill.

132
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,220
You're looking at a human sleeping pill.

133
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,500
Wait, when are you planning to leave if you go there this late?

134
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,920
Wait, CEO. What are you imagining?

135
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,380
Then what are you imagining, Jin Hyeok?

136
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,850
No, I mean when you fall asleep...

137
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,450
I'll just put you to sleep and then watch you sleeping well and leave.

138
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,980
I'm just wondering when you're going to go home if you come over to my house this late at night.

139
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,780
Leave now.

140
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,920
I can't sleep.

141
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,740
Move over to the side. Hurry up.

142
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,710
Oh, your mattress is awesome.

143
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,490
I can't sleep like this. I'm worried.

144
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,370
I'm behaving so well, so what are you worried about? I feel so wronged.

145
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,790
Just drink a cup of tea and go. Hurry up and get up.

146
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,710
I have lot of teas at home, so do you really want me to drink tea here?

147
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,550
I was really tired today, but I'm waking up since you're being like this.

148
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,610
You're heavy. Move!

149
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,040
It's cold out and I can't even help you to fall asleep, although I came all this way.

150
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,900
And I can't even live up to my title of human sleeping pill.

151
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,160
But...

152
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,890
This is really comfortable. It feels like my spot.

153
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,900
Even Secretary Jang hasn't slept here. This bed has never been used by two people.

154
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,100
So it finally met the rightful owner.

155
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,950
Yes, it feels good.

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,570
I think I can fall asleep easily. I may fall asleep first.

157
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,010
Get up before you fall asleep, uh?

158
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,040
Oh! Quickly leave. Quickly leave.

159
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,300
Don't be so excited. Just go ahead and go to sleep.

160
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,750
Be excit— What are you talking about. Really!

161
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,670
Just stay like this for a while.

162
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,850
I'm feeling wonderful right now.

163
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,100
It'd be great to fall asleep like this every day.

164
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,700
That day will come for us, right?

165
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,220
What? Why don't you answer?

166
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,850
Just imagining it I like it.

167
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:33,610
♫ The morning sun rise, it takes me away ♫

168
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:39,460
♫ As I am staring at the light you hold ♫

169
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:47,690
♫ The feeling of adore, oh take me on to you  ♫

170
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,650
♫ I can’t hide anywhere. I followed to your dream ♫

171
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,990
♫ Is this what they have been calling love ♫

172
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:10,560
♫ And it just goes on, oh take me on to you ♫

173
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,590
♫ When the light of yours shines down so beautiful ♫

174
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,050
♫ I laugh, I sing, with you ♫

175
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,000
♫ Oh it’s like when stars fall around you ♫

176
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,460
♫ You take my heart away ♫

177
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:43,120
♫ Oh take me on down on river ♫

178
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,980
♫ I'll go wherever it leads to you ♫

179
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:54,220
♫ Oh take me on into your arms ♫

180
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,830
♫ I'll go wherever world you’re on ♫

181
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,980
Is he really a human sleeping pill?

182
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,220
He's more like a human stimulant.

183
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,340
I was worried that you were losing interest in this company.

184
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,150
Today you are attending the general board meeting.

185
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,270
It's an important agenda. I should show up.

186
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,000
I never expected

187
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,150
that you'd make such a decision.

188
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,190
I did it in order for the hotel to survive. Alright, then.

189
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,700
So, who is going to be the Co-CEO?

190
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,490
I saw.

191
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,750
- It's rumored that CEO Jeong Woo Seok is coming.
- What?

192
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,120
What kind of nonsense is that?

193
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,700
- What about the Taegyeong Electronics CEO position?
- He will do them both.

194
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,220
Both?

195
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,520
Let's wait and see together what's going to happen because of that courage of yours.

196
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,970
Let's take our time discussing the rest. Because I'll be seeing you often.

197
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,650
Are you really all right?

198
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,210
No. Not really.

199
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,800
Well, I don't know much about this kind of company business,

200
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,810
but is it right for them to call a stockholder meeting and make a one-sided decision like this?

201
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,290
Until now, under the leadership of which CEO has this hotel become as successful as it is? What is this "Co-CEO"?

202
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,720
Reading a Life-Changing Book

203
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,740
Thank you.

204
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,960
This is head-splitting.

205
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,130
How is the CEO?

206
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,610
You already know. She gets quieter the harder things get.

207
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,720
If she continues with them like this, she'll end up being hospitalized.

208
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,730
All of a sudden, what is all of this?

209
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,690
She's made it this far without much problem.

210
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,420
That's just a mask. Because she's doing too well.

211
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,160
My goodness, I'm sick and tired of Chairwoman Kim.

212
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,080
But the word is that this is not Chairwoman Kim's plan.

213
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,710
It seems as if Director Choi went around meeting with the Taegyeong stockholders.

214
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,400
What about CEO's side stockholders?

215
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,960
Who met with them to persuade them?

216
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,130
Well, it is true that when Chairwoman Kim ...

217
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:06,820
tried to persuade the CEO's stockholders and steal them, they were not the kind of people to be easily persuaded.

218
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,410
This time, why are they abandoning the CEO?

219
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,970
Man, these disloyal guys.

220
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,190
There is a rumor that CEO Jeong Woo Seok is coming.

221
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,540
Is it true?

222
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,970
Why would that guy come?

223
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,610
Why is he forcing his way in?

224
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,900
Jin Hyeok!

225
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,040
Jo Hye In!

226
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,060
The mood seems like the coming of a new CEO.

227
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,040
Donghwa Hotel CEO Cha Soo Hyeon

228
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,110
Thank you for accepting me as a CEO of Donghwa Hotel.

229
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,030
Since I have no background knowledge on managing a hotel,

230
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,720
I totally understand your concern.

231
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,710
By collaborating with CEO Cha Soo Hyeon as a co-CEO,

232
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,760
I will do my best to manage the hotel.

233
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,260
The majority has voted for you, but there are people who are against you.

234
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,330
What is the reason for you coming this far, CEO?

235
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,020
I'm saying it is for the secure management of Donghwa Hotel.

236
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,650
Bringing the hotel this far from the status of a fallen 4-star hotel

237
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,820
is CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's achievement.

238
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,650
I acknowledge that.

239
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,830
Isn't it too much for you to step into this already well-managed hotel?

240
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,450
However, the decision has already been made. This is the time and place to welcome him.

241
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,310
Why do you have to say that?

242
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,170
Not everyone has agreed!

243
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,050
Not too long ago

244
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,760
there was an issue with the Cuba hotel.

245
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,320
Who was the one who solved that issue?

246
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,290
Was it CEO Cha Soo Hyeon?

247
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,260
I heard it was due to the remarkable effort of one of the new employees.

248
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:34,300
Do you really think the hotel is being managed well?

249
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,260
I believe the combined management knowledge of two CEOs

250
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,120
will have a synergistic effect.

251
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,110
I expected you to come to the welcoming meeting, but you must still be uncomfortable.

252
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,480
What's going to happen to Taegyeong Electronics while you are here?

253
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,040
I'm a better multitasker than you think.

254
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,500
Adding the hotel management will not cause me to break down.

255
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,850
What are your intentions?

256
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,540
If you ask me about my intentions,

257
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,820
it's to stick to you in order to protect you.

258
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,430
Why do I need your protection?

259
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,500
Because it seems you are being blown away by the wind.

260
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,380
What I mean is that as we drink tea together often like this,

261
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,320
we can discuss the healthy future of Donghwa Hotel.

262
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,710
Taegyeon— Or rather ...

263
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:51,600
It's shameful for you to enter this company using the backing of your mother.

264
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm not doing that. I created this scenario on my own.

265
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,960
Please don't use the term "using the backing of your mother."

266
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,910
My mother will probably faint from excessive shock.

267
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,460
- What are you trying to do?
- I want to help you, CEO Cha.

268
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,080
Are you thinking this will help me?

269
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,470
Whether it helps or not, give me some time.

270
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,530
From now on, if you have some business to discuss with me, make an appointment through my secretary.

271
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,160
Let's try that.

272
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,090
Since this is the first day, shall we have lunch together?

273
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,350
If you are finished talking about business, please leave,

274
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,760
CEO Jeong Woo Seok.

275
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,550
If I have a question, I will call you.

276
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,110
You should call the relevant department.

277
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,670
Then, shall I go to the relevant department?

278
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,610
Hello.

279
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,620
Hello.

280
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,800
I came by too suddenly, didn't I?

281
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,290
It seems the heart of hotel business is the Marketing Team. I came to say hello.

282
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,030
I heard that there was a skilled employee who resolved the problem with the hotel in Cuba.

283
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,910
I look forward to working with you in the future.

284
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,200
Please don't mention it.

285
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,640
I just had a good opportunity.

286
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,130
Capable and modest employee, you keep getting more good modifiers.

287
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,380
You compliment me too much. Thank you.

288
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,840
I don't know much about hotels, but I'll try my best.

289
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,290
Please take care of me, everyone.

290
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,660
What kind of flower are you looking for?

291
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,320
One that is comforting. And that isn't too big.

292
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,700
Then how about this one?

293
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,500
It's called lemon cypress. When you touch it this way, it gives off a specific smell.

294
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,850
It's a plant rich in phytoncide. It'll make you feel better.

295
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,850
Think of it as my hair and stroke it.

296
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,020
A good scent will come from it.

297
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,040
It smells really good.

298
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,380
I also feel like I'm calming down. I'm touched.

299
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,530
Think of it as a miniature Kim Jin Hyeok and give it your adoration.

300
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,010
Hye In, are you done editing the report for the CEO?

301
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes.

302
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,500
Here.

303
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,860
Good job.

304
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,120
- I'm going to give the report to the CEO.
- Yes, ma'am.

305
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,440
Goodbye.

306
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,750
- Let's speak frankly now that the department head isn't here.
- Don't do it.

307
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,620
Don't do what? Jin Hyeok.

308
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,420
Yes?

309
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,770
Isn't CEO Jeong Woo Seok honestly really petty?

310
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,460
It's not as if you're going to get scared and quit just because he pushed his way in here like that.

311
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,880
What does CEO Jeong Woo Seok coming here have to do with Jin Hyeok?

312
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,220
It's not the first time that Taegyeong Group has tried to take this hotel.

313
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,360
This is a travel app that our hotel has formed a partnership with.

314
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,930
I am planning this White Day* event with them exclusively
(On March 14, men buy a gift to the woman who bought them chocolates on Valentine's day.)

315
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,100
and working on the first collaboration.

316
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,700
Credit card issued in Korea

317
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,910
Booking confirmed

318
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,040
Did you really pay for it?

319
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,760
We'll have to try it out to the end to see whether it's good or not.

320
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,600
But what do you think about adding a few pictures of the cooking process on the event's banner?

321
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,660
I think there would be a better reaction if we show it in person.

322
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,780
I've already set up a photo shoot with the patisserie team.

323
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,050
Alright.

324
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,000
CEO. Are you alright?

325
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,170
You're not alright, are you?

326
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,170
- I'm alright.
- No way.

327
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,130
Touch this.

328
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,600
If you're not feeling alright, then you will.

329
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,590
I'm not sure about that.

330
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,290
Manager Nam is here. Should I tell him to wait a little while?

331
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,410
No, we're done.

332
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,640
I'll head on out, CEO.

333
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,290
If someone greets you in a friendly way, you should accept it in a friendly way.

334
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,330
That's her charm.

335
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,800
Did you find anything out?

336
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,750
This is Assistant Manager Kim's phone call records. I looked through them.

337
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,830
I found a contact he made a lot of calls to before he caused the trouble.

338
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,730
And he made three calls after he caused the trouble.

339
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,460
He changed his number, so it belongs to someone else now.

340
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,400
But I think we have to find the original owner to get some answers.

341
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,560
- Thank you, Ahjussi.
- This much is nothing.

342
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,920
Wow, there's a tree that resembles me!

343
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,900
It's fluffy and cute.

344
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:04,900
- Do you think it's your fault?
- Yeah.

345
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,490
Taegyeong Group has tried to get Donghwa Hotel many times. It's not your fault.

346
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,420
CEO Jeong Woo Seok came to see me.

347
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,840
You?

348
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,560
He said that I should wait and see

349
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,520
how things will happen from now on.

350
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,320
I didn't know what he meant at that time.

351
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,860
But this was it.

352
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,730
I really don't understand.

353
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,580
They divorced such a long time ago. Why is he going this far after all this time?

354
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,960
Don't worry about it. He's on a different level than you.

355
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,810
I'm worried that the CEO is having a hard time. I'm fine.

356
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,150
Hey, I was short $20 earlier.

357
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,700
You bought tangerines this afternoon, remember?

358
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,820
Be careful!

359
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,230
What about this one? Is the color too bright?

360
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,190
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Aigoo.

361
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,780
Our nice Hye In got angry. Hye In, is something wrong?

362
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,920
Seriously. I didn't break anything, so why are you getting angry?

363
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,490
So this is our relationship, Jo Hye In.

364
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,130
- Sorry.
- Hey.

365
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,630
A lot happened at the hotel today.

366
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,590
Ah, that's right. It's hard to earn a living.

367
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,090
That's why I'm also stressed out. Because I'm working to get paid by you.

368
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,630
Hey, you know what? If you went somewhere else to work, you'd be kicked out in less than half a day.

369
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,860
- Should I really go somewhere else then?
- Aigoo, farewell then.
- Hey!

370
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,930
Here.

371
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,000
What's this? You're causing the pain and then giving the cure?

372
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,210
Ah, alcoholic beverage? It is an alcoholic beverage.
(A play on the words "giving the cure")

373
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,650
- Ah, seriously. That was so not funny.
- What? Am I the only one who found it funny?

374
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,760
Don't be upset, Hye In.

375
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,100
Yes?

376
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,770
Oh, you must be busy.

377
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,900
I asked you to come here because I had absolutely not ttime.

378
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,630
Well, CEO Cha doesn't have anything on her schedule.

379
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,800
I see.

380
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,290
Soo Hyeon is a mess because Jeong Woo Seok came there, isn't she?

381
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:58,000
But she's enduring it better than I thought. And she's even eating well. I'm proud of her.

382
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,130
Really? Soo Hyeon seems to have changed a lot recently.

383
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,430
Should I say that she looks like she's got some guts?

384
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,520
Hyungnim, you don't know your daughter very well.

385
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,520
She's always been gutsy and bold.

386
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,490
She's just becoming more provoked to show it now.

387
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:20,070
I am worried that Taegyeong is showing its true color now, Hyungnim.

388
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,310
I'm worried that she's going to get caught and devoured again.

389
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,810
She can't be left to get preyed on again. She's got a father here.

390
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,290
The election is right around the corner, Hyungnim, so you can't just act the way you want.

391
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:35,320
The election is important. But could it be more important than my child?

392
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,100
Did you eat?

393
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,400
Yes.

394
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,570
It feels real now that we keep running into each other like this, doesn't it? When I said that we'd see each other often.

395
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,420
I don't think it's something worth wondering whether it feels real or not.

396
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,960
Ah. I guess you haven't caught on yet.

397
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,570
Should I say that it's too big of an issue to be thought of as a normal situation?

398
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,820
There are a lot of things that I can do now.

399
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,530
Even if you don't want it to, it will feel real to you.

400
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,760
Who are you doing it for?

401
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,790
It seems like you're only doing this for your own benefit.

402
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,620
That's right. It's for me.

403
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,140
On that day... you said that you still loved her.

404
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,930
So you remember.

405
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,060
Is this something that you do to someone you love?

406
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,040
It's desperation.

407
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,160
My desperate desire to keep her safe because I can't stand by and watch. That kind of desperation.

408
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,100
Between your courage and my desperation,

409
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,970
in either case, it will be resolved.

410
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:45,000
This isn't right. This hotel is CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's life.

411
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:50,130
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon is my life.

412
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,130
You got your answer, right?

413
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:57,800
I can't know about the time you've spent or the feelings that you've felt until now.

414
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,960
I won't judge you haphazardly. However,

415
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,610
I don't think I can welcome feelings that are going to hurt someone.

416
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,080
So?

417
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,520
I do not have wealth, respect, or power like you, CEO.

418
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,200
I'm still an ordinary man who's barely turned thirty years old.

419
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,370
I'm going to protect her in my own way.

420
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,330
Kim Jin Hyeok, we're the same yet different.

421
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,110
Why we're the same and how we differ...

422
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,370
I hope that you learn with time.

423
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,470
I'll look forward to you persuading me.

424
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,070
Donghwa Hotel Promotion Event

425
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,870
I just poured everything into it.

426
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:57,360
It's a hotel I received as my divorce settlement, but it was everything to me.

427
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,100
CEO

428
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,960
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon

429
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,210
What is it that you have to say that you called me out?

430
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,880
- Are you alright?
- Me? About what?

431
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,300
You like my brother.

432
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,400
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

433
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,840
Why? Are you embarrassed?

434
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,510
What are you saying? Aren't you going to eat? I'm going to eat it all.

435
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,610
In your third year of high school and your fourth year of college.

436
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:02,130
I wondered if your gaze toward my brother would change when he went to the military.

437
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,870
But it didn't and you were still the same. Who are you trying to fool here?

438
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,910
Stop acting up really. I told you, it's not like that.

439
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,410
Don't be too much like that.

440
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,390
What becomes of that precious time?

441
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:18,120
Ah, that's right. I'll come back after making a phone call. Keep eating.

442
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,560
Blow your nose. Don't sniffle like that.

443
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,220
It's frustrating.

444
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,400
It's frustrating? Aigoo...

445
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,730
I feel sorry for you.

446
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,860
Can't everyone live coolly, like me?

447
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,090
What should I do? Should I set up a dating profile up for you?

448
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,120
Aren't I going to meet someone like Dae Chan?

449
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,410
You and your imagination.

450
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,310
If you tell your brother, I'm going to kill you.

451
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,170
Let's go inside quickly. It's cold.

452
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,440
Our chicken is going to become cold.

453
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,470
Aigoo, it's so cold.

454
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,530
Please add cheese and salad to the steak sandwich.

455
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,050
Are there any vegetables that you don't want me to put into your sandwich?

456
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,180
Please put everything. I'm going to pack it to-go.

457
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,500
Yes, I will add up the bill.

458
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,020
If I didn't ask you if you ate dinner, you would have starved again.

459
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,470
What do you do leaving your boyfriend alone?

460
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,260
You should call him to buy something for you in times like this.

461
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,200
Well, he comes even though I don't say anything.

462
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,140
Are you petting it a lot?

463
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,380
Yes, the scent is really good.

464
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,010
Then, why do you still seem low-spirited?

465
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:09,440
I don't feel low-spirited. I'm even eating the sandwich well.

466
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,690
If I say that I'm sorry,

467
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,060
you will get mad, right?

468
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,920
Sorry towards whom? And why?

469
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,580
Me. Towards you.

470
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,310
Why?

471
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,450
I feel that it's because I'm staying by your side

472
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,510
that these things are happening.

473
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,920
The fact that I remained at Taegyeong,

474
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,310
the fact that I am still at war with Taegyeong,

475
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,440
is that all something that you created?

476
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,640
It's unfortunate that you are in a war.

477
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,610
Because I feel like my feelings are putting you in a tough situation.
.♫ You're already entering my heart like this ♫

478
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:22,190
♫ Your sparkling eyes shine and ♫

479
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:30,570
These feelings of yours are healing to me.
♫ they shake my heart ♫

480
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:37,610
If perhaps you weren't here, I would have been scared and uneasy.
♫ The more I like you ♫

481
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,170
♫ The more I depend on you  ♫

482
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,740
You said that the meaning of love became clear because of me, right?

483
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,850
♫ The heart I'm unwilling to lose ♫

484
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,740
Because of you, Jin Hyeok,
♫ The heart which is unwilling to depart ♫

485
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:56,070
I've also almost forgotten what fear is.
♫ The heart which is unwilling to depart ♫

486
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,260
I learned about love from reading books.

487
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,990
Now, I can clearly understand.

488
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:16,610
Because I'm afraid... I'm afraid that you might get hurt.

489
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,850
Until the day you eternally sleep,

490
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,460
I will protect you.

491
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,710
I love you.

492
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:33,530
♫ The more I like you ♫

493
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:42,580
I ... treasure you a lot.

494
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,670
♫ My feeling grows bigger ♫

495
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,070
♫ The heart that is unwilling to depart ♫

496
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,520
♫ No matter what happens ♫

497
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,510
I love you.
♫ My heart will never ever ♫

498
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:01,220
♫ go to you ♫

499
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,690
Jin Hyeok!

500
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,360
Where are you? Home?

501
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,560
In my office.

502
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,140
It's the weekend. Why?

503
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,860
It's because someone won't hang out with me.

504
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,110
Ah... then you should have told me. I have over 100 plans for hanging out with you.

505
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,230
Your bluff is really...

506
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,650
Where are you? You seem to be outside.

507
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,200
I'm waiting for the bus.

508
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,040
I'm on my way to Teacher Lee's house. She said she hurt her leg.

509
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,560
You said that she hurt it?

510
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,400
- She said that she sprained her foot.
- Ow...

511
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,290
How did that happen?

512
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,840
If you see her, convey my greetings.

513
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,530
I will.

514
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,130
Should I come to hang out with you?

515
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,860
Today, I have quite a lot of work.

516
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,740
When am I going to show you all 100 of my plans?

517
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:58,710
Ah well, I'll show them all to you until you become a grandma.

518
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,500
I like it. I must live long.

519
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,580
Ah, the bus is here. I'll call you later.

520
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,370
Wow, this place is really delicious.

521
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,170
How do you know about this place?

522
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:39,010
These days, these good food spots are all over social media.

523
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,620
Is your store temporarily closed today?

524
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,990
Jin Myeong is managing it.

525
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,870
Thank you for taking out time.

526
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:52,000
Ah well... I felt bad that you left last time without even eating.

527
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,820
No, no. After some thought,

528
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,360
I totally understand your position.

529
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,710
I didn't do anything good either.

530
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,800
So, I wanted to ask.

531
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,890
Let's start seeing each other in a leisurely way.

532
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,980
What is this?

533
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,810
Jang Mi Jin. After going to the market at daybreak,

534
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:31,250
I bought a rose that's like you.

535
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,920
From: Lee Dae Chan.

536
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,040
Let's do that.

537
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,450
However, let's not have high expectations. Whether it's you or me.

538
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,890
This seems like an outfit with a lot of expectations.

539
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,050
What are you talking about? This is just my normal outfit.

540
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:54,990
Since the company ambience is not so great, this is my slightly calm down outfit.

541
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:01,890
Do you normally dress so pretty like that to work?

542
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:05,310
It seems even your hairstyle changed.

543
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:09,090
Even your head is really pretty. When I was young, my mother...

544
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,840
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

545
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,570
Eat well. It's delicious.

546
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,820
Oh, it's cold.

547
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,020
Chan's Whelks

548
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,370
Just a moment.

549
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,100
Mi Jin!

550
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,740
Lee Dae Chan

551
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,930
Yes, hello?

552
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,320
I...

553
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,790
I suddenly had a stomachache...

554
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,870
No! No, no, no... I'm really alright.

555
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:13,300
Then, I'll give you a call later.

556
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,730
Jang Mi Jin!

557
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,220
Oh... yes.

558
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,970
It's cold. Come quickly.

559
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,040
Yes, yes....

560
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,350
The bathroom...

561
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,610
What are you going to do since you are sick?

562
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:45,680
I didn't know what sickness you had, so I just said that you had indigestion.

563
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,480
This. Have this.

564
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,250
- Yes.
- Aigoo, my goodness.

565
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,410
Our Jang Mi Jin became nervous because she was going on a first date with me.

566
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,600
Hurry, I told you to take it.

567
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,330
Ah, right. You just have to take 2 capsules.

568
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,800
That's right. Aigoo.

569
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,400
You are doing well, you are doing well.

570
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,690
Aigoo. Our Jang Mi Jin is a baby.

571
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,850
You have to feed her medicine.

572
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,550
I forgot it.

573
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,560
Aigoo, you came?

574
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,540
Oh, what is this?

575
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,540
I thought that I should convey my greetings personally.

576
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,730
Aigoo, Jin Hyeok!

577
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,120
You are happy seeing the CEO.

578
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,550
I'm happy seeing your mother's side dishes.

579
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,810
Why did she pack so much? Oh my goodness.

580
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,370
This is worth getting my leg hurt for.

581
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,580
Would you also like to give it a try?

582
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:43,810
Ah, that's right. You also couldn't finish your ox bone soup.

583
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:47,920
It seems like your stomach is really small. You must be lucky.

584
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,260
I also need to be on a diet.

585
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,370
I think I fell from the roof because I was heavy.

586
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,340
- Is your foot alright?
- Yes.

587
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,390
Hey, invite the CEO someday.

588
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,350
She will probably fall head over heels for your mother's cooking.

589
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,470
Ah, that sounds great.

590
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,710
How about it? Should we plan a date?

591
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,410
Why are you pondering about so much?

592
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,660
You just have to go for things like that.

593
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,980
If you keep thinking about what to do, you can't cross the line.

594
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,760
When there's an opportunity, let's go together.

595
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,080
Alright.

596
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,960
Aigoo.

597
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,520
Your mom's cooking must be great.

598
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,910
Looking at it before, the visuals seemed great.

599
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:31,540
When Jin Myeong and I were younger, we didn't know.

600
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,350
But the more days we ate outside, the more I felt it.

601
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,300
Wow,

602
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,400
my mom is a general.

603
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:43,660
I was always envious of people who came home to their mother preparing the meals.

604
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,820
My mother doesn't cook.

605
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,540
Then, come over to my house.

606
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,560
She prepares it so quickly, but it's delicious.

607
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,570
I'm angry because it seems like it would be so delicious.

608
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,040
Ah, why are you angry?

609
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,420
See, Teacher Lee was just closing up all the side dish containers.

610
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,520
I was so saddened.

611
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,660
Did she do an endoscopy to know whether my stomach is big or not? She should have waited for my answer!

612
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,700
How nice would it have been if she asked me to taste it if it was delicious?

613
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,460
Ox-bone soup is ox-bone soup. And a home-cooked meal is a home-cooked meal.

614
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,480
How filling is it just to have a taste of it?

615
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,500
When you are like this, you are really cute.

616
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,700
You seem like a student, a student.

617
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,950
Like a middle school student?

618
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,940
Don't joke around.

619
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,910
I understand.

620
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,260
I don't know why I have such a weakness for home-cooked meals.

621
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,920
You are so cute, Cha Soo Hyeon.

622
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,080
- Eat deliciously.
- Yes, sell a lot.

623
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,440
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.

624
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,830
Aigoo, is your foot alright?

625
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:51,860
It's not a serious injury or anything.

626
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,770
They say that I can take the cast off the day after tomorrow.

627
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,860
Aigoo, I'm glad it's nothing serious.

628
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,390
While returning your dish containers,

629
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:02,710
I am also thinking of bringing you some good tea,

630
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,120
so can I come over and get a meal from you for the first time in a while?

631
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:10,270
You're the one who isn't moving from there. You're always welcome at our place.

632
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,130
I'll have to tell Jin Hyeok's mom to make something.

633
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:16,910
Ah, what should I do? I'm already salivating.

634
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,900
Ah, by the way.

635
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:25,440
Is it burdensome for Jin Hyeok's company CEO to eat together with us?

636
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,130
I bragged that Jin Hyeok's mother is good at cooking.

637
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:33,390
Did you meet her?

638
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,850
She comes here sometimes.

639
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:38,450
She came the day you sent side dishes, too.

640
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,750
You already know everything...

641
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,390
I heard it from Jin Hyeok.

642
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,650
It is unusual to see you here.

643
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,130
Why did you overdo it?

644
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,020
I thought I'd wrap it up cleanly.

645
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,030
If the lawyers keep exchanging document papers back and forth,

646
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,600
when will this war end?

647
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,990
I can trust that you will wrap it up the way I think, right?

648
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,650
I don't know how you persuaded the directors favoring Cha Soo Hyeon.

649
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,270
If you are going against my plan

650
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,060
and being over-zealous,

651
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,840
I won't go easy on you, even if you're my son.

652
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,700
Please continue to watch me.

653
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,630
Let's make something clear.

654
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,460
Cha Soo Hyeon...

655
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,230
will never come to this house again.

656
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,300
Why can't you answer me?

657
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,850
You never know what will happen,

658
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,390
so you shouldn't say never.

659
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:52,460
Don't bring a messed-up illegitimate child to my house.

660
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,850
Then Taegyeong will be a laughing stock.

661
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:58,060
Since it turned out this way,

662
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,920
I guess you just need to organize the hotel well.

663
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,500
Please leave the hotel to me.

664
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,740
Yes, I will.

665
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,070
Yes?

666
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,200
I don't need to check it. We've been doing this for a few years now.

667
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,960
Please send it right away.

668
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,790
You can send it to CEO Cha Soo Hyeon of Donghwa Hotel.

669
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,990
Yes.

670
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,610
Yes, then...

671
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,580
Sending what?

672
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,600
The clothes she'll wear on your father's memorial day.

673
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,800
- Mother.
- Why are you surprised? We do this every year.

674
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,510
You are telling me you can't let her come to the house.

675
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,670
Then it's not right for you to have her attend on his memorial day.

676
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,490
I must have her attend this year.

677
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:45,540
Please stop.

678
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,440
Oddly,

679
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,210
your father's memorial day this year

680
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:53,370
will be a very symbolic day, I think.

681
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,520
Whether Cha Soo Hyeon attends or not

682
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,100
will become a very important issue.

683
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,850
What do you mean?

684
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,800
If she doesn't attend this memorial day,

685
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,130
it means she's finished with us.

686
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,500
And if she turns her back on us,

687
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,560
would I just sit back and watch Cha Jong Hyeon and Cha Soo Hyeon?

688
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,130
The two will be facing some hardship.

689
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:23,650
Can smart Cha Soo Hyeon really not come?

690
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,460
It'll be fun.

691
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,320
This makes me think of when I was at the boarding house.

692
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,050
The busiest employees would order carp bread like this.

693
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,200
The smell of the bread would just hit you in the store.

694
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,420
It reminded me of our family.

695
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,780
- It's very human-like, isn't it?
- Why'd you get five?

696
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,330
Families can start weakening if there's one left over after everyone already had one.

697
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,920
Mom, get a knife so you can cut this last one into four for us to eat.

698
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,310
You three split it among yourselves. You should go get some more from the store.

699
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,020
Ah, there is no family affectionate ties.

700
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,470
There isn't.

701
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,360
Teacher Lee called me today.

702
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,130
You should make your braised kimchi. She likes it.

703
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,970
Ah, fine then. That's not hard to do.

704
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,070
I wanted to see her anyway, so this works out well.

705
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,120
The day after tomorrow,

706
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,070
her cast gets taken off, so she's all better.

707
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,620
That's a relief. She recovered quickly.

708
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,690
Then shall we do it on that day?

709
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:26,740
Let's tell her to come here the day when she gets her cast taken off.

710
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,590
Let's do that, then.

711
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:30,160
About that, what's it called?

712
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,320
How about we tell that CEO to come too?

713
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,720
What?

714
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:37,530
We enjoyed drinking her wine, so we should greet her.

715
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,600
That's a big event.

716
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,890
Why bother?

717
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:47,680
That will be so awkward for her.

718
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,000
Ask her if she has time.

719
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,930
Ask her. Quickly. Ask her quickly.

720
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:53,300
Yes.

721
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,600
You really... why would that person come to our house?

722
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,080
She has so many nice restaurants at her hotel.

723
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,650
What's wrong with our house? People all live the same.

724
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:06,110
They give and receive things and live with affection.

725
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,170
That's right, do not worry about it, Mom.

726
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,990
We don't know if she'll come or not if we invite her.

727
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,730
Usually, when meeting a boyfriend's parents—

728
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,150
You don't have any other brother but me.

729
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,220
Ah, if you give me something you were eating,

730
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,370
then I'll enjoy eating it too.

731
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,490
Tomorrow, do you have time for dinner?

732
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:41,160
Teacher Lee is coming over for dinner, so I was wondering what you think about coming to eat with us if you have the time.

733
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:52,120
Then I'm wondering if it's right for you two to keep developing feelings for each other.

734
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:58,460
I know that you calling me special is because I'm lacking.

735
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,890
It will be difficult,

736
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:05,170
but I hope that you'll watch over us.

737
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,830
Sounds good.

738
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,630
Finally I'm meeting your family, right?

739
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,870
I'm so nervous.

740
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:26,530
What do you think it'll be like to come to my house?

741
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,390
First, I'll send you the address.

742
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:32,360
Park somewhere nearby and call me. I'll come get you.

743
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:37,720
I'm extremely nervous.

744
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,760
Should I take a look?

745
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,640
It should be formal and not too heavy. It shouldn't be too bright since it's winter.

746
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:05,090
I think it will be rude if it's too bright. So what kind of outfit is best?

747
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:08,160
Outfit... Where are you going?

748
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,530
I have an important appointment.

749
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,030
When do you need it?

750
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,850
Tomorrow evening.

751
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,730
Why?

752
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:21,770
Tomorrow is Chairman Han Nam Don's death anniversary.

753
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,630
They sent you an outfit and for now it's left in the car.

754
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:32,400
so what do you think about going just for this time?

755
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,820
CEO Jeong Woo Seok barged his way in like this. It would be best to be careful right now.

756
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,030
I understand. Go back to work.

757
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:43,210
Yes.

758
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,070
Manager Nam!

759
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:03,900
Hey, it's been a while.

760
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,780
Hello.

761
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,700
I was upset thinking that you'd forgotten about me because you were hanging out with the CEO.

762
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,360
Of course not.

763
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,060
Where are you going?

764
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,300
I'm going to separate the trash.

765
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,300
Ah, the office youngest is indeed the youngest. Right?

766
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,660
Yes.

767
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:25,190
Manager Nam, it's been a long time.

768
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,930
I wanted to come and say hello to you, but we ended up meeting here.

769
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,140
Why would you greet me?

770
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,480
I should greet you since you're someone that CEO Cha depends on a lot.

771
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,990
See you tomorrow, Manager Nam.

772
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,790
They got in touch with you regarding Father's death anniversary tomorrow, right?

773
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,000
Please escort CEO Cha well.

774
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,280
You've always done so, but I'm asking you to do so tomorrow as well.

775
00:56:55,930 --> 00:57:00,520
Whether it's your courage or my desperation, in either case, it will be resolved.

776
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,670
I'm going to protect her in my own way.

777
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:13,680
Manager Nam, can I drive the CEO back home tonight?

778
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,360
Of course you can. Why not?

779
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:35,230
Where should I take you?

780
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,440
I have some sad news.

781
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:57,400
Teacher Lee said that something urgent suddenly came up tomorrow.

782
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,810
The home-cooked meal went out the window.

783
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,650
We can just pick another day.

784
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:58,770
You said that the meaning of love became clear because of me, right?

785
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:04,920
Let's wait and see together what will happen because of that courage of yours.

786
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,880
I love you.

787
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,740
I'm sorry.

788
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,680
You can answer it comfortably.

789
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,790
I don't have to.

790
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,150
Am I his part-timer?

791
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:52,270
It's that whelks guy. He said that since Jin Hyeok's family is having a guest over,

792
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,470
Kim Jin Hyeok's younger brother can't come do his part-time job.

793
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:57,160
He's asking me to come and work in his place. Seriously.

794
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,640
He's sure funny.

795
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,750
Today, visitors are coming over?

796
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,890
Yes, that's what I heard.

797
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,720
Why?

798
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,070
Nothing. I'll look into this a bit more and sign it.

799
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:13,230
Yes. When you're done signing them, please call me.

800
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:21,070
Teacher Lee said something urgent suddenly came up tomorrow.

801
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,200
We can just reschedule it for another day.

802
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:32,340
I'm sad because you're in the middle of a war. Because it seems like my feelings are making things difficult for you.

803
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:38,180
Banpo-dong Madam

804
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,470
Banpo-dong Madam

805
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,360
Yes?

806
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,070
Are you at the hairdresser's?

807
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:00,080
No.

808
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,390
Why are you still acting like that?

809
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:05,100
Soo Hyeon, please.

810
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:09,720
Just go only for today. Think of your dad.

811
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,750
Please just bear with it for today and go!

812
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:15,630
Only until the presidential election. Alright?

813
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,080
Soo Hyeon!

814
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:35,830
I am no longer a member of Taegyeong Group.

815
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:38,300
There is no reason for you to do this.

816
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:44,460
Don't think that just because you got divorced that the two families severed the relationship.

817
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:50,600
Even when you die, you are a member of Taegyeong Group.

818
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,970
Once you've become a member of this family,

819
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,690
you are a member of Taegyeong Group until you die. Keep that in mind.

820
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:03,010
Just go only for today. Think of your dad.

821
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,630
Please just endure it for today and go!

822
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:12,160
Today, visitors are coming over?

823
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,800
Will CEO Cha Soo Hyeon show up?

824
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,740
It'll be awesome if she does, and it'll be big news if she doesn't.

825
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:57,090
Ah, but are you sure that the CEO can't come because something came up at work?

826
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:57,750
Yes.

827
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:01,520
Well, Dae Chan asked Secretary Jang to work part-time in my place.

828
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,410
But the CEO had to go deal with her evil ex-mother-in-law?

829
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:08,330
Or some household event? She said they had to go there together.

830
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:12,580
It's not like that. She had to hold an important meeting at the company.

831
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:16,470
Call Teacher Lee and see if she's almost here.

832
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:17,970
Yes.

833
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:46,170
Manager Nam, I'm going down now.

834
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:19,080
Hey! That's CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's car, right?

835
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,040
I think that's right!

836
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,790
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon!

837
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,810
CEO! CEO!

838
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,140
Please get out and say a few words!

839
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,880
CEO! CEO!

840
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,680
CEO Cha Soo Hyeon's car has arrived.

841
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:50,320
Teacher Lee said that she'd be right over, didn't she? Goodness, the soup is going to get all cold.

842
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,210
- You left some for Dae Chan, right, Mom?
- Yeah.

843
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:55,200
- I left him a lot. I'll pack it up later, so you take it to him.
- Okay.

844
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,550
Why is Teacher Lee taking so long to get here?

845
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,110
That must be Teacher Lee.

846
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:02,490
I'll go.

847
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,930
It looks delicious.

848
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,090
Teacher Lee, there must be a lot of traffic—

849
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,720
The event was canceled.

850
01:05:53,720 --> 01:06:01,840
♫  Another long day is about to begin ♫

851
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,800
♫  Today is passing slower than yesterday ♫

852
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:16,490
♫  As much as I long for you and you have grown in my heart  ♫

853
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:17,830
♫  Today is passing slowly ♫

854
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:20,810
I'm in big trouble.

855
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,510
Why?

856
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:30,570
There is no exit.
♫  Even though it may appear strange  ♫

857
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,770
From you...
♫  when I am approaching like this ♫

858
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:37,360
There's no way to escape from you.

859
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:50,030
♫  My heart is just going with that feeling to you  ♫

860
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:57,370
♫  Tell me anytime when you want to see me ♫

861
01:06:57,370 --> 01:07:03,350
♫ So that you can see me anywhere ♫

862
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:07,010
♫ I will stay right here ♫

863
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:10,770
♫ Now I won't hesitate ♫

864
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:14,260
♫ Stay at my side. ♫

865
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:21,270
♫  For me it has to be you. ♫

866
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:27,100
♫ After a long time passes and passes again ♫

867
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:33,970
♫ Even if everything of mine all disappears ♫

868
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:37,640
♫ If you will stay with me ♫

869
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,240
♫ If you will hold my hand ♫

870
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:46,450
♫ I will never be missing you again ♫

871
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:58,260
♫  Tell me anytime when you want to see me ♫

872
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:05,260
♫  You cannot be without me for even a second ♫

873
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,940
♫  So that you can see me anywhere ♫
