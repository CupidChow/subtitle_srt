1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,750
Encounter

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,370
Song Hye Kyo

3
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,690
Park Bo Gum

4
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,030
Boyfriend

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,130
Who that person is, and whether it is really a romance or not,

6
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,810
you haven't made an official statement yet.

7
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,940
What kind of relationship is it exactly?

8
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,960
We are in a 'some' relationship.

9
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,080
We are in a 'some' relationship...

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,880
- Jin Hyeok! Let's clean up!
- Yes.

11
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,560
Run. Come on, come on.

12
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,140
You've gone crazy, haven't you?

13
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,780
If you see it that way, there is nothing I can do about it.

14
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,550
Alright. Let's say that you just went crazy momentarily. Call Chairwoman Kim immediately.

15
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,130
No. Let's go to Chairman Kim's house together.

16
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,950
Let's go there and beg for forgiveness and tell her you lost your mind for a moment.

17
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,710
I could only do that if I had really lost my mind.

18
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,370
A person in their right mind cannot live that way, as if they are not a human being.

19
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,040
I warned you, didn't I?

20
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,120
I told you to live as a useful child.

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,840
I have lived as a useful child until this point.

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,650
But now, I plan to live my own life.

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,960
Episode 7

24
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,430
You haven't left yet?

25
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,520
I'm going to go back to Seoul after cleaning things up a bit. What a mess.

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,540
Our CEO is charismatic. I like it!

27
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,500
You can laugh?

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,010
When I think about what is ahead, my head hurts.

29
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,140
What you mean your head hurts? One person is liking another. Why does your head hurt?

30
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,150
It must be so nice to have your heart at ease. How are you so positive, with no plan ahead?

31
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,020
What about you? You don't like what's happening?

32
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,010
It's like cider (refreshing).

33
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,290
- What about CEO?
- She's on her way. But her mom dragged her away first.

34
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,670
That's what I'm talking about. This is such a headache.

35
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,080
I'm just saying, that woman's (Soo Hyeon's mother) whole life is a giant headache.

36
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,100
What are we going to do now? I just don't see a way out of this.

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,720
I'll be going back up to Seoul now.

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,310
- Bye Manager Nam and Secretary Jang.
- Bye.

39
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,820
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,600
- What are we going to do now?
- Go home and get a good night's sleep, of course.

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,710
- Will you be able to sleep?
- Yeah. I won't be able to sleep, right?

42
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,490
Because I'm too excited.

43
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,150
We are just not on the same page, are we, Ahjussi? Agh!

44
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,050
♫ I don't know anything except love ♫

45
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,990
I know it's a tiring task, but let's clean up together or later you'll be more tired.

46
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,430
Yes!

47
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,210
Was it okay today?

48
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,870
Yes. I'm going to ask them to clean up.

49
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,040
Good job.

50
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,820
We are in a 'some' relationship.

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,490
Jin Hyeok

52
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,000
Call Jin Hyeok

53
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,460
- Yes, CEO.
- Where are you?

54
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,670
I am at the company. We are cleaning up.

55
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,870
Can you meet with me for a moment? I'll come down.

56
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,930
What? The whole Public Relations team is here.

57
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,740
I wanted to tell everyone they did a good job and greet everyone.

58
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,760
So I'll come down.

59
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,380
You're all working so hard and so late into the night.

60
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,120
Today's grand opening event exceeded expectations. I want to thank all of you.

61
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,050
CEO, why'd you come all the way here? You must be tired.

62
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,410
I have some things to wrap up.

63
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,280
We are also diligently wrapping things up.

64
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,950
What are you wrapping up? It's late. Let's go.

65
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,910
- It's okay to clean things up slowly.
- You said we should finish up today—

66
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,350
What? When? When did she say that? Shall we all leave?

67
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,190
- Section Chief, let's go.
- Yes. Let's go.

68
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,880
Jin Hyeok, turn off the lights when you leave.

69
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,670
I respect you so much, CEO.

70
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,970
Good—

71
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,390
It must be fun to have so many people working together.

72
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,790
The CEO office is so quiet.

73
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,060
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

74
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,420
Why are you worried? "You were pretty cool." That should be enough.

75
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,450
But there were a lot of reporters.

76
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,130
- CEO, from now on—
- Jin Hyeok.

77
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,330
Why do you only worry about me?

78
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm used to this kind of attention, but you're not.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,300
I'm worried that I might've made

80
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,620
things worse for you.

81
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,190
So we are each worrying about the other.

82
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,190
All of the things you have to deal with because of me, that was bothering me.

83
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,410
You see,

84
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,880
I have been living with only a vague sense of who I am.

85
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,230
Assemblyman Cha Jong Hyeon's daughter, Taegyeong Group's divorced daughter-in-law, Donghwa Hotel's CEO ...

86
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,000
Today is the first day.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,220
I'm not the Cha Soo Hyeon who was sold off to Taegyeong Group

88
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,220
and I'm not Cha Soo Hyeon who lives because of a hotel.

89
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,480
I am also not Cha Soo Hyeon who allows the person she likes to be mistreated without reason.

90
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,460
Today, for the first time, my inner self feels relieved.

91
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,590
I feel like I threw one good punch,

92
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,870
so don't worry.

93
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,140
Oh, I'm so hungry. I ate nothing all day.

94
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,150
Jin Hyeok, did you eat something?

95
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,540
Don't say it. Do you have squid again?

96
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,500
Once again, it's all thanks to Assistant Manager Park.

97
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,450
Assistant Manager Park supplied the squid last time too.

98
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,190
I'm so thankful to him, each time.

99
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,830
At this point, it appears Assistant Manager Park is a fan of yours, and not mine.

100
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,230
I thought we were going to split it. Ah, so hungry.

101
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,250
Should I spit it out?

102
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,840
No, I'm joking.

103
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,200
We are in a 'some' relationship.

104
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,510
It's quieter than we expected, right?

105
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,690
I went through quite a bit, trying to block the articles.

106
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,700
I'm glad. This caused me a lot of worry, as well.

107
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,340
The reporter. The one who asked the foolish question.

108
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,790
Yes?

109
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,070
Yes. Yes.

110
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,720
For me to find out who planted that reporter there

111
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,560
one night was enough.

112
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,180
I don't know what you mean...

113
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,010
Alright. Let's say that you weren't the one who planted him.

114
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,620
But you still need to take care of it, right?

115
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,560
Get rid of Kim Jin Hyeok.

116
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,760
Send him to the countryside, make him stay there for a bit, and then kick him out.

117
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,980
If we suddenly do this, I don't think CEO Cha will just sit still.

118
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,160
When you planned all this, didn't you have a conclusion in mind?

119
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,750
Did you point your sword at me

120
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,050
with no plan whatsoever?

121
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,530
Chairman! How dare I do such a thing to you—

122
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,090
Exactly. How dare you.

123
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,130
Clean it up properly.

124
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,630
Where are you going? Shall I help you?

125
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,420
No. I'm going to get some water.

126
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,770
- Me too. Let's go together. I'm thirsty.
- Assistant Manager Park, you can have a seat.

127
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,170
No need to thank me.

128
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,770
Just think of it as my wish for you to be happy.

129
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,650
Thank you.

130
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,930
It's quite disappointing, you know.

131
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,900
Sorry?

132
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,580
Between us... greeting each other so formally like this is too much, don't you think?

133
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,780
So annoying.

134
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,490
Please don't forget that the most trustworthy

135
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,100
sunbae in this team is me, Goo Eun Jin.

136
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,340
- Jin Hyeok.
- Yes?

137
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,040
This won't do. These two people will terrorize you all day today.

138
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,280
There are promotion gifts for the Sokcho event in our conference room.

139
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,350
Please go sort out and make a list of VIP guests who couldn't make it to the event.

140
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,630
We have to personally deliver them starting tomorrow.

141
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,520
- Will do that, Department Head.
- Let's go.

142
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,300
Why don't you sit down, Assistant Manager Park?

143
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,990
I'm really good with that kind of task, you know.

144
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,370
- Goo Eun Jin.
- Yes?

145
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,530
How about if Hye In helps Jin Hyeok?

146
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,330
Yes.

147
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,400
Why are you so desperate?

148
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,550
Does love change?

149
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,770
We deliver all these in person?

150
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,480
Yeah. Even though you might think these promotion gifts are nothing, this is one way to manage our customers.

151
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Like showing our sincere appreciation?

152
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,810
Our Public Relations Team does so many different things.

153
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,200
- This is the entire list, right?
- Yeah.

154
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,930
CEO was very cool.

155
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,230
I was really surprised, too.

156
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,680
No, your heart must have fluttered.

157
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,670
By the way, something makes me worried.

158
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,030
Like what?

159
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,110
I've met this strange person recently.

160
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,670
This man... I don't know how he got my number, but he called and

161
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,710
- asked me to meet him, saying it was about you, Kim Jin Hyeok.
- Me?

162
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,130
Someone uploaded on our anonymous forum a slanderous post about CEO not long ago, remember?

163
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,020
He told me to write one, saying that would get me promoted.

164
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,060
But it wasn't me who wrote that.

165
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:35,300
It's strange, isn't it? He already knew that

166
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,330
you were the one with CEO in the news article.

167
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,370
Who can it be? Why?

168
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,560
It's so obvious! It must be Taegyeong.

169
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,010
That's why I said I'm worried for you. You might be having hard times like this.

170
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,440
Keep your guard up and watch out. They are scary people.

171
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,960
But Hye In... Why did they ask you to write that?

172
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,790
You are my friend after all.

173
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,260
I must have looked like I had a lot to complain about this company.

174
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,500
Cuba's Future Hospitality and Tourism Business Obstacles

175
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,080
Your evening appointment got canceled, CEO.

176
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,630
It seems like the leader has a meeting with the orchestra.

177
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,340
Reschedule it for another day, then.

178
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,780
Yes, ma'am.

179
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,640
Should we have dinner together?

180
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,330
Should we have dinner together?

181
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,900
Kim Jin Hyeok.

182
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,080
May I ask who you are?

183
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,270
I'm CEO Jeong Woo Seok's secretary.

184
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,340
Could you spare us some time?

185
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,010
Please set up an appointment for later. I already have plans.

186
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,900
It won't take long.

187
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,260
It's not as if we are in a 'some' relationship or anything.

188
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,410
I wanted to... confirm something.

189
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,190
Please go ahead.

190
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,070
Well... I mean that Sokcho "happening."

191
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,870
Is that for real?

192
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,470
When one person has taken a chance to sincerely express feelings,

193
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,030
I can't call it a "happening."

194
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,060
So you are saying that it is true.

195
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,390
Have you confirmed everything then?

196
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,080
Somewhat.

197
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,800
I also have something to confirm.

198
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,920
What could be the reason you wanted to confirm that?

199
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,480
The reason?

200
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,440
Out of an oppa's* heart.
("oppa" means older brother but is also used for one's boyfriend)

201
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,820
Well, then... It's freezing.

202
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,900
Out of an oppa's heart. This is similar to love, isn't it?

203
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,320
That's... what I'd think. Yes.

204
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,520
What's the point of caring for my skin?

205
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,690
There is no one who will see or care.

206
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,750
And someone is on a date.

207
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,900
New chat request has arrived.

208
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,020
Member Lee Dae Chan has sent you a chat request.

209
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,840
Why don't we meet in person?

210
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,600
Oh my!

211
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,030
If I get rejected, let's just delete this account.

212
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,430
Ah, seriously. Wait a little bit.

213
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,840
I'm busy but I will make some time.

214
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,860
It's here, here, here.

215
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,140
I told you! You have to wait and be patient!

216
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,690
How can this thing make me so nervous? Should I workout in the meantime?

217
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,620
No, why don't you shave first?

218
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,730
- Beverages on the house.
- On the house?

219
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,340
Your colleagues must be giving you a hard time, right?

220
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,970
I'm constantly getting looks of jealousy.

221
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,470
The back of my head tingles.

222
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,820
It's quieter than I expected.

223
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,550
I thought it would be on the news and everything, making some serious noise.

224
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,150
It appears that someone who's not happy with all this might have blocked all the articles.

225
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,060
What a shame. The headline could have been awesome.

226
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,540
"CEO Cha and her 'some.'"

227
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,560
I'm not even a celebrity, but I am making so much of a fuss with my 'some' relationship.

228
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,580
Since you have brought it up, CEO ...

229
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,120
I'm going to stop being in a 'some' relationship with you.

230
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,890
Are you saying that we should end things now?

231
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,480
Yes.

232
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,150
- How can you, I mean—
- I am certain now.

233
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,160
When your doubt recedes, and your feelings of liking become more certain

234
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,050
that's when you should end the 'some' relationship.

235
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,510
You can quit. I will continue to be in the 'some' relationship.

236
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,660
What do you mean? We should start (a new relationship) together.

237
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,070
You were the one who made a joke first.

238
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,170
I will stop joking around now.

239
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,300
Then, from now, why don't we sincerely think about our future?

240
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,320
What should we do for fun?

241
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,300
Is there anything you want to do?

242
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,770
Food tour around Mangwon-dong.

243
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,750
Secretary Jang would always brag about that. She never takes me with her though.

244
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,260
Deal! Let's go together. Right...

245
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,830
Can you skate? It's winter. Should we go skating sometime?

246
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,790
I have no athletic ability. I'm not good at it.

247
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,360
You can learn. There is a skating rink in an amusement park. Do you want to go to the amusement park?

248
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,950
I'm not good with rides. I'm scared.

249
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,400
Then we'll skip anything active... Oh!

250
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,880
I have something that I really want to do.

251
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,350
I want to go to a bookstore and read books all day.

252
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,750
Buy each other a book.

253
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,560
Then we switch and read each other's books.

254
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,030
- Getting along well.
- Oh.

255
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,050
If it's not your cup of tea, then never mind.

256
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,590
No, no. Let's do everything. Anyway, I don't think we can actually do them all.

257
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,230
Why can't we?

258
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,400
The skating rink. The amusement park. It's just ...

259
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,240
Right, right...

260
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,610
CEO, well...

261
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,980
What could an "oppa's heart" mean?

262
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,180
Well, I'm not sure. It must mean that he adores someone, right? Why?

263
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,200
How does that mean he's adoring someone?

264
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,120
It's him supporting someone to do well, no?

265
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,460
Are you getting mad at me?

266
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,370
No.

267
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,620
- Are you upset?
- No.

268
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,630
I think you're upset.

269
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,680
No, I'm not upset.

270
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,000
I will cut it for you. Let me do it.

271
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,220
I can do it on my own.

272
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,510
Then... Open your mouth.

273
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,350
Give me some then.

274
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,050
What is this?

275
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,020
I got you.

276
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,800
Ah, seriously.

277
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,080
I heard that there will be an urgent board meeting tomorrow, CEO.

278
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,460
I think you should attend.

279
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,980
I called you because I believe it's time to resolve some things.

280
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,500
I count on you, Attorney Jeong.

281
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,990
Before coming here,

282
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,400
I took a look at the divorce settlement agreement again.

283
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,220
It would be great if you could tell me what you mean by "resolving things."

284
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,760
Article 3 Clause 4. Since there were some scandalous incidents

285
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,280
around Dongwha Hotel's CEO Cha, we should retrieve everything.

286
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,770
The word "scandalous" can be subjective.

287
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,610
It could end up being a long battle.

288
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,810
I'm ready to face a long battle. But for sure,

289
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,010
this must be a winning battle.

290
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,680
Yes, ma'am. I understand what you are saying.

291
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,880
It could damage the side of Assemblyman Cha Jong Hyeon, too.

292
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,200
Do you have alternative plans? The election is in a couple of months.

293
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,720
It's giving me a headache since

294
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,470
Assemblyman Cha Jong Hyeon has been acting strange these days.

295
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,040
I'm saying that a racehorse that doesn't listen to its jockey can be dangerous.

296
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,760
Should I include that in the plan?

297
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,150
No, not for now.

298
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,830
Let me pull on the bridle first.

299
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,790
- Done?
- Yes.

300
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,390
The meeting won't be short, right?

301
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,970
I'm not sure. Our Department Head is usually a loose cannon.

302
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,350
Okay, then. I will add an extra shot for my cup.

303
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,840
Alright!

304
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,250
Let's have some coffee while we have a meeting.

305
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,220
I want to make changes.

306
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,990
Night shifts are ahead of us.

307
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,650
About our end-of-year party, you know.

308
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,270
This drawing lots and orchestra performance... Aren't these too cliché? Nothing new.

309
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,490
Other hotels must do them too.

310
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,240
There is not much time left. Are you saying that we should make a new plan?

311
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,760
Good for you, Section Chief Lee. How do you always get my intention?

312
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,300
But still... A Pansori* carol performance that you like is a bit...
(folk storytelling performed by a singer and a drummer)

313
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,850
Do you all think so?

314
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,450
Assistant Park, this coffee smells really good, right?

315
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,490
Yes, right. It does.

316
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:35,140
So, I'm saying... Why don't we offer some new ideas?

317
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,960
Jin Hyeok.

318
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,160
You should focus. You might welcome the new year while working night shifts.

319
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,660
How about a masquerade ball?

320
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,510
A masquerade ball?

321
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,310
Yes. We do that a lot on Halloween but

322
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,830
I think it would be fun to do that for the end-of-year party.

323
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,510
Young customers who are not interested in hotel events

324
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,490
might be interested in this one. Don't you think so?

325
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,500
A masquerade ball...

326
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,980
Can you make a detailed plan?

327
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,020
Yes. I will work on it.

328
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,300
You've dug your own grave.

329
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,700
What you did at the Sokcho hotel last time,

330
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,710
I don't think it gave an appropriate image from our hotel's CEO.

331
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,010
First of all, I regret that the exposure of my personal life

332
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,410
at a public event became a matter of concern.

333
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,530
I'm taking this opportunity to express my apology.

334
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,120
There were many Dongwha staff members and celebrities there, too.

335
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,950
It's just a matter of time for the rumors to spread. Don't we need a plan?

336
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,480
I agree.

337
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,760
In order to prevent any more time and effort consuming issue-triggering incidents,

338
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,710
I believe we need a fundamental solution.

339
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,930
Your re-appointment date is approaching.

340
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,980
Don't you think you need to clean up in several ways?

341
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,170
Thank you for your concerns.

342
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,980
From now on, there won't be any more incidents

343
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,450
involving the CEO's personal life that damage the company's reputation.

344
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,470
Also, from now on, please make sure there is

345
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,550
an agenda item which truly requires the convening of an emergency board meeting.

346
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,140
I heard there will be an emergency board meeting today.

347
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,500
I bet the agenda is about CEO's official statement on her 'some' relationship. Don't you think so?

348
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,330
Well, to be honest, you have done nothing wrong.

349
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,750
CEO was careless. She dug her own grave.

350
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,750
It seems like all the board members are against her.

351
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,320
I'm not sure she'd be alright.

352
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,130
In order to prevent any more bizarre time and effort consuming issue-triggering incidents,

353
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,780
I believe we need a fundamental solution.

354
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,700
Your re-appointment date is approaching.

355
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,860
Don't you think you need to clean up in several ways?

356
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,050
Dress code

357
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,980
Mask conceptual images

358
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,570
Working night shift?

359
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,030
Yes, I was working on the end-of-year party project.

360
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,740
The end-of-year party...

361
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,810
Can you be sure that you'll still be working here?

362
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Kim Jin Hyeok, there will soon be a new personnel appointment.

363
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,040
You will be transferred to the Sokcho hotel.

364
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,350
What is the reason for this unexpected appointment?

365
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,700
CEO Cha and you made this mess. And you ask me for the reason?

366
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,650
That has nothing to do with work.

367
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,730
Thinking that it's a totally separate matter... That's the problem.

368
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,650
How can you say it has nothing to do with work?

369
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,300
If there is any more speculation about her, it will put CEO Cha in a very tough place.

370
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,870
Do you think a CEO's position is safe and stable?

371
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,560
Because of you, CEO Cha's position could be

372
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,360
in danger, you naive guy...

373
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,610
Personnel appointment? Where do you think the order came from?

374
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,270
Me? Do you think I'm capable of doing that?

375
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,220
How many shares do you think CEO Cha holds in the Dongwha Hotel?

376
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,750
With Taegyeong's one little cough, that position can be blown away.

377
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,190
We barely stopped further hassles by transferring you to Sokcho, so

378
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,980
let's behave well. Alright?

379
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,730
Don't you ever go complain to CEO Cha, saying it's unfair and all that.

380
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,450
That will make it even harder for CEO Cha.

381
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,750
Was there any corruption involved in your recruitment when you got hired?

382
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,370
No, absolutely not.

383
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,530
Everyone here is saying that and believes that.

384
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,870
You should prove that it wasn't like that.

385
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,030
Everything will be taken care of when CEO Cha goes on a business trip to Shanghai.

386
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,080
Whether you transfer or quit work...

387
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,380
It's up to you, Kim Jin Hyeok.

388
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,020
Working on the end-of-year party project...

389
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,640
They are coming together?

390
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,500
Hello.

391
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,740
Hello ... out of nowhere ... My stomach is, my stomach...

392
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,270
CEO, let me go to the restroom really quickly—

393
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,650
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes.

394
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,090
I will be back soon.

395
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,370
Oh, Jin Hyeok. It's pretty bad, both upper and lower..

396
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,030
I don't think I can drive tonight. Can you drive the car?

397
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,720
My stomach... Ow. I think it will take some time.

398
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,630
I'm sorry. Drive CEO home and

399
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,570
give me a call. Yes, I will get some meds and

400
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,350
I will wait for you near there. Thank you.

401
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,010
That was good acting.

402
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,630
Did you work night shift?

403
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,850
I did some research on the hotel's end-of-year party.

404
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,100
I can't believe the end-of-year party is around the corner.

405
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,940
Being a new public relations employee, you must be having a hard time.

406
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,300
It's fun, though. It's thrilling.

407
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,600
How many shares do you think CEO Cha holds in the Dongwha Hotel?

408
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,880
With Taegyeong's one little cough, that position can be blown away.

409
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,770
We barely stopped further hassles by transferring you to Sokcho,

410
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,010
so let's behave well.

411
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,840
CEO.

412
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:45,710
I think people live off good memories rather than bad ones.

413
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,580
What makes you say that all of sudden?

414
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,580
My mother had been really sick, so she had been hospitalized for a few months, you know?

415
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,610
It was really hard on my family.

416
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,080
Looking back, though,

417
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,100
I don't think anyone showed tiredness on their faces.

418
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,380
Not even my mom did.

419
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,440
Because our happy memories were more,

420
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,060
I think we were able to endure well.

421
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,380
We'll be able to do that too, right?

422
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,460
It must be hard at work. Right?

423
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,150
No, not at all. You know how the PR team's spirit is like.

424
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,040
It's great.

425
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,900
But why are you saying those things?

426
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,880
Just in case there might be a situation

427
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,260
where we'll have to endure some things, let's fight through.

428
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:44,710
Let's fight through with the good memories we made from Cuba until today.

429
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,980
You're strange today.

430
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,840
I know, right?

431
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:06,610
♬  The morning sunrise, it takes me away  ♬

432
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:12,650
♬  As I'm staring at the light you hold  ♬

433
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,110
♫ The feeling ♫

434
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,810
Hey, your brother got into a really great company.

435
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:21,980
Your brother has never created any trouble while growing up, but I was called to the school daily because of you.

436
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,090
Today's day one.

437
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:29,930
I am not Cha Soo Hyeon who allows the person she likes to be mistreated without reason.

438
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,740
♬  You know you keep me alive ♬

439
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,290
♬  You're my reasons for everything I do  ♬

440
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:46,820
♬  The other half of me  ♬

441
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:53,270
♬  Oh, take me on down a river  ♬

442
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,580
♬  I'll go wherever it leads to you ♬
 Travelling time from Sokcho to Seoul

443
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,020
Two and one-half hours by express bus

444
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:04,800
Two and one-half hours.
♬  Oh, take me on into your arms ♬

445
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,490
♬  I'll go wherever world you're on  ♬

446
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,940
It's close.

447
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,280
It's close.

448
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,710
- Ji Woo!
- Ahjusshi, where are you?

449
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,780
- Are you with my mom?
- No.

450
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,890
Why do you look so down?

451
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:54,090
- Ahjusshi.
- Yes?

452
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:59,410
My dad. I think he has a woman.

453
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,460
Huh?

454
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,790
I saw it. A photo.

455
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,100
A strange photo of my dad and another woman.

456
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,790
I saw it all.

457
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,780
Just pretend like you don't know.

458
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,870
I don't even have the courage to pretend like I do know.

459
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,650
Soo Hyeon's mother

460
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,060
Yes, call me later if it's something that'll take a while. I have a meeting.

461
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,990
Clear your schedule for tonight.

462
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,530
I can't. I have a party meeting tonight.

463
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,170
It's something more important than a party meeting that will have no use even if you hold 100 of them.

464
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,190
I'll send you the location, so go there.

465
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,690
How angry do I have to get in order for you to stop?

466
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,810
I don't want to be Soo Hyeon's mom anymore, looking at how things are now.

467
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:04,220
Are you going to let Soo Hyeon get swallowed up by Chairwoman Kim?

468
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,570
Take some breaks in between. Drink this. Why are you working so hard, as if there's no tomorrow?

469
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:37,380
Once I get onto something, I become obsessed with it.

470
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,600
Thank you. I'll drink it well.

471
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,290
You don't have to do this. You have insurance.

472
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,650
You're the man who's stolen the heart of the CEO.

473
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,460
Are you jealous, Assistant Manager Park?

474
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,530
Wh-what?

475
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,690
I'm asking if you're jealous of Kim Jin Hyeok, the man who stole her heart.

476
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,820
Honestly, aren't you jealous too?

477
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,000
I'll go make some copies of this.

478
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,650
Alright, you do that.

479
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,490
You only know if you've gone the whole nine yards.

480
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:13,410
Whether the clouds will follow the sunshine or not.

481
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,560
Wow, I guess you must be studying idioms these days.

482
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,300
Do you really have to study to know these kinds of things? Even my son in kindergarten knows it, you fool.

483
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,570
If you take what I've said as a joke so literally, it's a bit—

484
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:28,450
How ignorant must you have looked for him to say that?

485
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,650
I also entered after passing the test—

486
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,420
You think I became an assistant manager by playing games?

487
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,950
Why do you keep clicking your tongue?

488
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:45,580
Mr. Cha would freak out if he knew I was here.

489
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,820
Would he even come?

490
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:52,220
We need to start testing the waters like this, to begin the process of them joining the Hwamin Party.

491
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,780
If you take off like that, isn't it rude?

492
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,300
Is there someone here who's less busy than you?

493
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,990
Everyone went out of their way to take time out for this, so you should eat.

494
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,440
Because of that ridiculous talk of joining parties,

495
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,000
it seems as if I might have to fast.

496
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,190
Eat? Hah!

497
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:18,250
Cha Soo Hyeon. The daughter who is losing you votes, Assemblyman Cha Jong Hyeon.

498
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,910
Don't you need those votes back, even if it's by merging with the Hwamin Party?

499
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,200
Currently, not a single person can predict

500
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,080
whether I'll lose

501
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,500
or win more votes because of my daughter's situation.

502
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,110
Haven't we made things worse with each other right now?

503
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,220
The raw fish is good today.

504
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,930
Dine with your heart at ease.

505
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,400
Was this meeting planned?

506
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,590
What did you talk about with Assemblyman Kim?

507
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,010
CEO Kim of the Hwamin party went in before you.

508
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,640
Was it an opportunity for you to talk about merging parties?

509
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,370
It was an opportunity to confirm that we do not want to merge parties.

510
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,060
Well, then.

511
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,860
Assemblyman, a word, please!

512
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,580
A word, please!

513
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,730
Assemblyman!

514
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:28,640
Where do you think the order came from?

515
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,390
Is it that the staff training is terrible, or are you being rude because you have the CEO's support?

516
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:38,680
We barely stopped further hassles by transferring you to Sokcho, so let's behave well. Alright?

517
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:45,260
It's a hotel that I received as my divorce settlement, but it was everything to me.

518
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,770
I have been living with only a vague sense of who I am.

519
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,260
Today is day one.

520
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,470
I'm going to stop being in a 'some' relationship with you.

521
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,000
Are you saying that we should end things?

522
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,250
I am certain now.

523
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,110
When your doubt recedes, and your feelings of liking become more certain,

524
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,580
that's when you should end the 'some' relationship.

525
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,010
Give it to me.

526
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,700
Happy birthday to you.

527
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,320
I really miss her.

528
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,820
How could I not have a single photo of her in my phone?

529
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,470
32 Hannam 3rd street Cheongdam-dong

530
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,270
One hour and forty minutes

531
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,200
It's close.

532
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,050
Jin Hyeok?

533
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:27,060
You're much closer to my neighborhood than I thought.

534
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,360
It's a perfect distance for running.

535
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,260
Then I guess I'll have to run that distance some time too.

536
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,970
No, no. It might be a bit far for you.

537
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,790
Since you've made it this far, would you like some water or something?

538
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,250
No, I'm not thirsty at all.

539
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,290
I don't know if I would call that not being thirsty.

540
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,660
The water tastes good.

541
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,600
- Should I give you another bottle?
- No, it's enough.

542
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,300
Wait here for a bit.

543
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,940
Looks like there is no more.

544
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,640
You're flustered because I came suddenly, right?

545
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,010
It's not that. It's... because it's the first time.

546
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:21,790
It's the first time anyone has visited me at my home, so I don't know what to do.

547
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:28,140
Secretary Jang visits me sometimes, but she just leaves on her own, so...

548
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,040
Don't worry, I'll leave on my own, when the time is right.

549
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,290
I think this is nicer than a model home.

550
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,280
I've never been inside such a great home.

551
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,420
It may be large, but there is no warmth.

552
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,910
Don't you get bored, living in such a large house alone?

553
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:54,540
Who knows? Time passes when I am working.

554
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,800
So tell me now.

555
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,790
It's such a cold day, so how did you come to run all the way here?

556
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:19,960
At first, I was planning only to run to the Han River.

557
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,030
Seeing the Han River made me think of you, CEO.

558
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:31,520
So I looked through my phone and realized that I don't have a single photo of you in there.

559
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:35,820
I thought that if I ran towards you,

560
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,360
then I'll be too tired and my feelings of missing you will disappear.

561
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,200
So I ran some more.

562
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,650
I was tired to death,

563
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,330
but then I missed you even more.

564
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:54,320
But then maybe you felt pity for me, because just at that exact time, you appeared.

565
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,750
It's daebak, isn't it?

566
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,500
You always run towards me, Jin Hyeok.

567
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,170
To Sokcho and to my house.

568
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,040
Am I like a stalker?

569
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:11,110
Let's say that you are like a boyfriend.

570
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,380
Boyfriend.

571
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,710
Suddenly it feels like spring.

572
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,590
So, let's take a photo, you and me.

573
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:40,480
Here?

574
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,420
Yes. I told you, I ran all the way here because I didn't have a photo of you.

575
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,440
Let me look at the mirror, first...

576
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,180
You don't need to, you look pretty.

577
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,410
This is so sudden...

578
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:51,830
Here we go. One, two, three!

579
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,180
One more time.

580
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,060
One, two, three!

581
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,110
You're taking so many.

582
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:03,030
I want to have a lot. One, two, three!

583
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:12,760
♫ in my eyes, as I look at you ♫

584
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,050
♫ when love is reflected in them ♫

585
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,850
♫ like the falling stars ♫

586
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:25,100
♫ those beautiful moments  ♫

587
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,050
You always run towards me, Jin Hyeok.

588
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:31,660
To Sokcho and to my home.

589
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,630
♫ it becomes engraved in my heart ♫

590
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:39,210
♫ it becomes stained ♫

591
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:43,720
♫ I know I belong to you ♫

592
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,750
Do they call this a mismatch?

593
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,020
No.

594
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,950
It's a collaboration.

595
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,920
Collaboration...

596
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,870
♫ I hope that this is forever ♫

597
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:59,280
♫ now I belong ♫

598
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,420
♫ to you ♫

599
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,180
♫ my feeling grows deeper and deeper ♫

600
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,180
Let's say that you are like a boyfriend.

601
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,460
Boyfriend.

602
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,140
Suddenly it feels like spring.

603
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,530
♫ that I am by your side ♫

604
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,750
♫ so that you can believe that ♫

605
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,510
♫ I want to do that ♫

606
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,850
♫ I know ♫

607
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,150
Donghwa Hotel, End-of-Year Party, Masquerade
Concept

608
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:07,080
You have class with Chef Jang today, don't you?

609
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,530
Yes.

610
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:14,510
Visit Teacher Kim's shop and change into the outfit I prepared for you before you go.

611
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,120
The article came out,

612
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,810
so everyone else taking the class will be looking forward to seeing your face.

613
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,800
Your husband is having an affair, so they will want to see what you look like.

614
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:34,060
At times like this, you must not look untidy, ever. Smile even more,

615
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,620
but only just so, lest you look silly.

616
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,420
Yes.

617
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,430
So many eyes are on you.

618
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:57,550
How about going to work on time, especially on days like today?

619
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:02,040
Soo Hyeon, let's get divorced.

620
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,820
Please grant my request.

621
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:44,490
It's not even my birthday. Why?

622
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:47,880
I think we should stop having uncomfortable meetings like this.

623
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,350
I am grateful for what you have done up to now.

624
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,260
Let's say the reason that we broke up is a difference in personalities.

625
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,380
Yes.

626
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,360
I feel I will always remember today, whenever I see them.

627
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,570
This is a farewell, after all.

628
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
- Enjoy your meal.
- Yes.

629
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:38,390
Only one bottle each today. I'm not used to drinking in the afternoon.

630
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,860
With the articles about the merger of political parties, you must be seething. You're having a drink during the day.

631
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,580
Why become upset at such a ridiculous article?

632
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,180
I have to see you.

633
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:50,520
Then shall you and I sit in a café, with earphones on our ears?

634
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,350
Yes, it is weird for men to have coffee together, isn't it?

635
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:54,830
Seon Joo, welcome.

636
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:57,980
Why would you summon me on a weekend afternoon?

637
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,020
It's been a long time.

638
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,460
The TV screen works magic. Ahjussi, you look aged in real life.

639
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,160
She is as rude as ever, please understand.

640
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,250
We are all getting older together, so must I put on airs?

641
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,190
If you say you are getting old like me, you are the one who's losing out.

642
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,240
So what is on the agenda for this meeting?

643
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,050
Has the news already spread that I signed my divorce papers?

644
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,230
What is she talking about?

645
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,650
Both of you should be relieved of your duties now.

646
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,650
What did my brother say when he left us?

647
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:29,700
He even wrote on his suicide note, "Please take care of my young Seon Joo."

648
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,760
You guys have no conscience. You don't take care of me.

649
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,290
I don't think one bottle each will be enough today.

650
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:46,530
Assemblyman, will the two parties really merge?

651
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,190
My oppa is about to have afternoon drinks in heaven.

652
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:52,390
What do you know about politics? Let's talk about something else.

653
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:56,960
What don't I know? Honestly, if my oppa hadn't used a gun to leave us early,

654
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,800
Ahjussi, you wouldn't have gone on strike denouncing the suppression of the media.

655
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,520
Why are you bringing that up now?

656
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,360
No, she is right.

657
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,750
That was how I became the "citizen's anchorman," and how I was recruited into political circles.

658
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,690
Everything she is saying is correct. So what's wrong?

659
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:11,900
Oppa, you are the bigger coward.

660
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,550
Ahjussi at least fought in my oppa's place.

661
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:19,590
Manager Nam, I mean, Nam Young Shik, you gave up on being a journalist and disappeared.

662
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:21,390
Ah, seriously! Give me that bottle.

663
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,220
You can have soda.

664
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:27,620
She says we're getting old together. Pour her one.

665
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,870
Ahjussi, you sure know how to hold a grudge.

666
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:51,970
Jang Soo Fruits

667
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,020
It's so cold, why did you come?

668
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,130
Because it's cold, I wanted you to finish sooner and go home.

669
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,150
Did you take your cold medicine?

670
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:02,760
I got a shot, and I get better right away.

671
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,690
That is a relief.

672
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,590
How is work?

673
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,920
I'm having fun.

674
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,910
Your face doesn't look like you're having fun.

675
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:24,730
Dad, a novelist that I like wrote

676
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:29,800
that to love someone, you must make an effort.

677
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,540
That's... very hard.

678
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:41,910
That is what the word "effort" means. You are not finished.

679
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:43,390
It's saying to exert yourself.

680
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:45,450
It is hard.

681
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,200
So is our son starting to love someone?

682
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,950
I guess so?

683
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,630
I'm always sorry that Mom and Dad haven't been able to help you very much,

684
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:06,170
and you've had to work so hard.

685
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:10,830
What do you mean? I think of myself as a "gold spoon."*
(*born into privilege)

686
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:15,630
You're a learned man. Do you not know the difference between "dirt spoon" and "gold spoon?" How are you a "gold spoon"?

687
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:22,400
Dad. There were a lot of kids who took out loans to go to college because they couldn't pay their tuition.

688
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,380
Those guys are still paying off their debt.

689
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,330
You paid for my tuition during all of my years at college,

690
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:35,280
you fed me, and you let me sleep under a roof. That's being privileged to me.

691
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:42,780
If there's one thing your mom and I did well, it's giving birth to an amazing son.

692
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,480
Hey, Dad.

693
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,930
I've been transferred to Sokcho.

694
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:59,760
Sokcho? Why so far away?

695
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,900
They said the public relations team is like that.

696
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,520
It's a field that has to know about all their locations, so there's a lot of moving.

697
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:09,540
Even so... it's just after you entered the company. Mom will be shocked.

698
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,940
That's why I'm telling you beforehand.

699
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,290
Help Mom out, alright?

700
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,740
Let's go. Let's go help her.

701
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,690
You're surprised, right?

702
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,180
It's a joke, right? Honey?

703
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,680
Why would we joke about something like this? It's not even funny.

704
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,920
But why? It hasn't been that long since you started working at the company.

705
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,030
The hotel at Sokcho is really starting to do well, but I guess they don't have enough workers.

706
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,400
So that's why they've selected the new workers to move there.

707
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,700
It's a handful of people, chosen from all across the nation.

708
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,540
Did you do something wrong?

709
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,310
What?

710
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:00,820
Stop talking nonsense.

711
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,280
It's because it's a little strange.

712
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,290
That thing. What is it? A pair of woman's shoes in your room.

713
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,980
Woman's shoes?

714
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,530
I thought it was a gift for me so I tried them on, but they didn't fit.

715
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:19,360
Are you, perhaps, saying that you got moved to a different location and planning on starting a shoe business?

716
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,310
My mother's imagination is quite something else. Why would I start a business?

717
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:28,830
He can only sell fruit kind of well; what business—

718
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:29,940
What are the woman's shoes in your room?

719
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,760
Huh? Oh, the thing is...

720
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:41,040
It's something from Cuba. I just kept them to use as props for shooting later.

721
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,990
Really?

722
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:47,050
I thought of every possible scenario.

723
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:52,010
I'm going to Sokcho Hotel to help out for just a bit. Don't think of anything else, Mom.

724
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,980
But still, it's so far.

725
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:00,210
Does that area have something with you? You even served the military in Gangwon-do.

726
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,460
Huh, I guess so. There is some sort of fated connection.

727
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,150
Nonsense.

728
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,250
What's wrong with you today, Honey?

729
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,560
What? Why?

730
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,420
What? It's because I'm hungry.

731
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,720
Are you hungry?

732
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,060
Is it already this late?

733
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:23,380
Public Personnel Announcement
Division: Personnel appointment | Date: Dec. 27th
Name: Kim Jin Hyeok

734
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,310
Before Issuance: Head Office Public Relations Office
After Issuance: Sokcho Dongwha Room Management Team

735
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,030
Why would he get moved all of a sudden?

736
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,060
Is Kim Jin Hyeok getting kicked out to Sokcho?

737
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,520
This... Would the CEO know?

738
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,970
She's away on a business trip.

739
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:37,110
The timing's really unpleasant.

740
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,130
- Kim Jin Hyeok.
- Yes?

741
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:44,200
Since when did you know?

742
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,730
About what?

743
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,610
About your being sent away to Sokcho.

744
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,960
I came to know about it this morning.

745
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,850
This is not the face of someone who found out this morning.

746
00:58:54,850 --> 00:59:00,490
Is that why you worked overnight? To finish up the end-of-year project before you leave?

747
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,780
I wanted to finish off well.

748
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,450
Because it's the first task I was given here.

749
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:09,640
So you knew about it all along. You should've talked to me about it beforehand!

750
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,130
Well, it's the same Donghwa Hotel.

751
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:14,890
I'll learn a lot about work there and return.

752
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:37,490
Department Head! May I use your phone for a minute?

753
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,310
My phone? Why?

754
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,710
It's something important.

755
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,320
Please unlock it.

756
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,410
You're really strange today.

757
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,560
What's wrong?

758
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,430
I'll give it right back.

759
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:07,580
Department Head Kim Seon Joo

760
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,080
Yes, Department Head.

761
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,600
Hello, I'm Jo Hye In from the public relations team.

762
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,120
Excuse my rudeness.

763
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,920
What's the matter?

764
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,730
I have something to tell you.

765
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,590
Yes.

766
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,170
Yes.

767
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:31,320
Yes.

768
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,030
I understand. Then...

769
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,060
Being a new Public Relations employee, you must be having a hard time.

770
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,560
It's fun, though. It's thrilling.

771
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,610
Why do you only worry about me?

772
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:56,250
I think people live off good memories rather than bad ones.

773
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,730
We'll be able to do that too, right?

774
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:03,030
Just in case there might be a situation where we'll have to endure some things,

775
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:09,270
let's fight through with the good memories we made, from Cuba until today.

776
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,850
I ran all the way over here because I didn't have a single photo of you.

777
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:12,920
Let me look at the mirror first.

778
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,410
You don't need to, you look pretty.

779
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:22,240
I feel bad that I might've made things worse for you.

780
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,720
Manager Nam.

781
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,830
Yes, CEO.
