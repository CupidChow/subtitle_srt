The person that you're trying
to reach is not available.

00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,366
Please leave a message after the beep.

KANG NAM-SIK

5
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,133
Good afternoon, Miss.

6
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,593
Hello.
Wait, what is this all about?

7
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,680
Well, we're here on behalf
of the Southern District Court.

8
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,516
We have an order to start seizing
your property. Please excuse me.

9
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,434
To start seizing?

10
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,522
CONFISCATED ITEM

11
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,457
Could you at least just leave me the car?

12
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,842
Thank you for cooperating.

What else do I do?

15
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,367
Everyone coming in today
is an executive.

16
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,912
This is my chance to meet everyone.
I don't think I can skip it.

17
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,207
And so? You couldn't have scheduled
a match when it wasn't your birthday?

18
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,001
Even when it's the president
who asks to play with you?

19
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,795
Well, anyway,
I'll be back as soon as I can.

20
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,881
All right, then. Go.

21
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,798
I'm sorry.

22
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,786
I thought my life was over.

23
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,455
I thought it was the end of everything.

24
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,430
-Hey.
-Hey, Dimi.

25
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,517
-When are you coming to the States?
-I'll check my schedule. I'll contact you.

26
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,977
Why? What's there for you?

27
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,606
Mmm, just to buy a yacht, of course.
Dimi says he's found a really nice one.

28
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,524
How about you guys?

29
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,692
Are you coming together?

30
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,194
One is plenty.

31
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:05,948
Hey, Dimitri, he likes cars
with little horses more than yachts.

32
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,034
-Oh, you mean Ferrari?
-Yeah!

33
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,952
Who doesn't love it?

34
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,496
-Hey.
-Hey.

35
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,040
-Let's get drunk! Come on!
-Yeah. See you guys.

36
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,709
Yo! Yo, Dimi, are you crazy?

37
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,045
You really need
to stop working out so much, yeah?

38
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,213
Wow.

39
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,882
What's the play for tomorrow?
Are you going?

40
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,176
-I'm definitely going with Ho-chan, yeah.
-To where?

41
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,096
-Rex.
-Rex.

42
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,391
Where is Rex?

43
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,518
"A" is what we want to describe,

44
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,978
"B" is the object we use
to depict the initial subject

45
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,855
by comparing similarities.

46
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,816
Oh, we'll stop here for today.

47
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,404
All right, Class Sky.
Let's do our class cheer, okay?

48
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,865
We are Sky!
Hear us roar, shout Sky!

49
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,575
Good job. Pack up.

50
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,578
-What should we get to eat?
-Want to get some tteokbokki?

51
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,374
Hey, no phones!

52
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,708
-I'm sorry.
-Bye.

53
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,422
I could hear your class
all the way from my office.

54
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,840
You've only been here for a year,

55
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,676
but everyone already seems
to love you, Ms. Seo.

56
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,760
Hardly.

57
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,522
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR NEW MEMBERSHIP! - REX

58
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,316
Rex?

59
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,873
Why are you driving so fast, huh?

60
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,249
It wasn't that fast.

61
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,917
-You have the invite?
-Of course.

62
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,669
Hey! Here's our invite.

63
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,254
Here you are.

64
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,876
That's Baek Jae-hui!

65
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,586
-Oh yeah.
-The news anchor, right?

66
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,962
Better looking in person.

67
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,506
Good evening, everyone.

68
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,925
A special welcome to our supercar owners.

69
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,761
My name is Baek Jae-hui,
and I'm your host for tonight.

70
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,100
We want to try something
very special this year.

71
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:42,647
Tonight we offer you the chance
to try a drop of heaven.

72
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,398
Romanée-Conti.

73
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,319
We have prepared a taste testing
of the 2013 vintage for you all.

74
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,280
Now, let me introduce tonight's star.

75
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,282
Rex's leader, our CEO,

76
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,909
welcome Ms. Choi Yoo-sun.

77
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,588
Good evening.

78
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,590
I am Choi Yoo-sun.

79
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,595
It is truly my honor
to host the very elite of South Korea,

80
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,222
our leaders in culture, economy,

81
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,141
and nearly every aspect
of our modern-day society

82
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,060
as well as those living in luxury.

83
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,356
Today's event has been specially prepared
with you in mind.

84
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,857
I hope you all enjoy,

85
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,944
and I wish everyone
a wonderful time tonight.

86
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,446
Thank you so much.

87
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,087
Oh yeah.

88
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,966
You were a Harvard graduate
and then went on to Goldman Sachs.

89
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,802
I guess I should immediately find
a beautiful bride for you.

90
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,015
You know, he just opened
his third plastic surgery clinic.

91
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,349
And he's back on the market.

92
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,728
-Well, congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

93
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,564
Ms. Choi,
I just opened my own dermatology clinic.

94
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,107
Come by any time.

95
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,944
-Wow, Ms. Choi is something special.
-Meaning what?

96
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,739
You know the marriage between
the Cheongbo Group and the NK mall?

97
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,282
-Mmm.
-I see that you find…

98
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,075
They say she made that happen.

99
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,994
-I know this means a lot.
-No way.

100
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,164
It's true. She's the biggest
player in arranging marriages and careers.

101
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,499
-She's coming.
-Oh okay.

102
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,297
You said that you were going
to bring your friend tonight.

103
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,590
Any chance of them joining us?

104
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,384
Ah, Hyung-ju. He won't remarry.

105
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,554
Even when they say that,
they usually enjoy themselves, don't they?

106
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,724
And you are?

107
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,850
Uh, yes.

108
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,395
Mr. Choi Sung-jae, the CEO of Lionsoft.
We all went to college together.

109
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,397
-A pleasure.
-It's lovely to meet you.

110
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,566
He's no longer single.

111
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,402
-He's useless to you, Ms. Choi.
-I'm sorry,

112
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,737
but I am currently married.

113
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,239
I'll be sure to contact you
if things don't work out.

114
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,409
Please, don't. I really do hope
that you have a happy marriage.

115
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,163
I'm sorry, but could you possibly
introduce me to Baek Jae-hui?

116
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,917
Could you reach out to me
after the event?

117
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,670
I will absolutely
give you a call.

118
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,173
-Oh!
-Oh my God!

119
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,638
All righty, I think this event
was more successful than last year's.

120
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,599
Would you at least consider
finally putting out a press release?

121
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,728
You know that would be useless.
These people don't like to be exposed.

122
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,064
But we receive so many new guests.

123
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,650
And many were even A-list celebrities.

124
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,818
The better the product,

125
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,487
the more cautious
and confidential we have to be.

126
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,574
-Don't you see?
-Yes, of course.

127
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,868
Good evening, Ms. Choi.

128
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,456
My name is Jin Yoo-hui.

129
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,457
HYEONGANG
JIN YOO-HUI

130
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,585
I am actually a Rex member.

131
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,463
-So you're a lawyer, Ms. Jin?
-Yes.

132
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,341
If you ever need help,
please don't hesitate to ever reach out.

133
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,428
-I will try to help as much as I can.
-I really appreciate that.

134
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,638
I look forward
to working with you, Ms. Choi.

135
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,639
Well…

136
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,167
Min-ji.

137
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,127
Oh.

138
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,588
-Uh…
-Hey, dinner?

139
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,631
I ate. What's Min-ji doing?

140
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,135
-Oh, she was tired. She's in bed.
-Oh, okay.

141
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,361
What's that?

142
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,116
I was wondering if this was you.

143
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,161
How much longer are you
going to live like this, huh?

144
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,622
Try to get a new start
before your birthday.

145
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,207
Before you turn gray.

146
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,959
Oh, Mom, do you really think
that I should be looking right now?

147
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,462
Come on, this was expensive.

148
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,507
Stop making up excuses
and schedule a consultation.

149
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,050
How much did you pay?

150
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,557
That's insane! Ten million won
is a massive amount of money.

151
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,434
Seriously, when is anything free?

152
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,188
If you want to marry a rich man,
then you need to at least invest that.

153
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:38,192
And also, that was quite the bargain.

154
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,278
They also had a membership
for 200-million-won.

155
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,656
-How did you get the money?
-Goodnight.

156
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,700
-Ah, ah.
-Did you sell your ring?

157
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,286
It was annoying.
It kept getting in the way while I cooked.

158
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,872
How could you sell that ring?
It was from Dad.

159
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,749
Go back and buy it now.

160
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,711
No, because even if I sell everything,

161
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,298
I will regret nothing
if it makes your life a little better.

162
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,510
Hey, Mom!

163
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,934
Hey, Yeong-seo.

164
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,562
Hey, Hye-seung. Are you okay?

165
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,730
I wanted to check in
after what happened with Min-ji.

166
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,648
Huh?

167
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,734
What's wrong?

168
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,819
You didn't hear?

169
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,031
So-eun has just told me that some kids…

170
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,951
Min-ji overheard them talking about her
while walking by.

171
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,787
-About her father?
-Yeah.

172
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,207
Min-ji got mad and apparently,
she started fighting with them.

173
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,458
People just can't let it go.

174
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,919
It's like every time
you're about to forget about it…

175
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,965
Sorry. I'll call you back.

176
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,356
Did you get into a fight at school?

177
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,319
What if you were to transfer?

178
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,697
We can go where nobody knows us.

179
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,907
No way.

180
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,243
How much longer are you going
to tolerate their bullying?

181
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,038
It's whatever. I'm staying.

182
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,083
Who are the bullies?
I'll talk to their parents.

183
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,045
Please don't.
They're really not worth the trouble, Mom.

184
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,131
They're just a bunch of losers

185
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,675
that only bully me
because they're jealous of me.

186
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,428
If you try to get involved,
it will only make things worse.

187
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,932
Why don't we take it easy today?

188
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,519
I really need to study,
so that we can live how we used to.

189
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,652
I'm going to Hankuk, okay?

190
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,613
I'll show them
that I'm better than all of them.

191
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,390
Let's get a divorce.

192
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,504
What? Can you repeat that?

193
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,049
Let's get divorced.

194
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,633
Have you been drinking?

195
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,471
That's not even funny to joke about.

196
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,310
I'm sorry.

197
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,573
I've been so…

198
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,620
Is there another woman?

199
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,923
I'm sorry. I really am a bastard.

200
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,552
-You don't get to quit.
-Honey…

201
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,516
It's not easy for me either.

202
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,143
I've thought about this for a while.

203
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,272
Shut up, will you?
Min-ji will hear.

204
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,241
What did I do to you
that was so wrong?

205
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,867
Min-ji's the smartest kid in her school,

206
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,994
and you've been promoted
to executive director.

207
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,205
I made sure the house was clean.

208
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,166
And I even made sure
to take care of your mother too.

209
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,626
For these past 15 years,

210
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,630
the only thing I've ever done for me
was attending graduate school.

211
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,843
All you have ever done
was focus on your own work.

212
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,095
Why are you doing this to me?

213
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,975
You're right. I know.

214
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,854
You're a good wife,
and I'm very grateful for that.

215
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,149
But I can't change how my heart feels.

216
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,109
I don't get it either.

217
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,864
Min-ji deserves this too?

218
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,532
Abandoning your daughter?

219
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,076
Min-ji will always have
the care she needs from me.

220
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,289
Please, no.

221
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,040
No!

222
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,808
TEAM LEADER
JIN YOO-HUI

223
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:46,935
EXIT

224
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,812
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO EXIT?
CONFIRM

225
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,907
What are you doing?

226
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,910
Destroying evidence.

227
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,580
Oh, funny.

228
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,583
Very funny.

229
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,335
MOVE THIS CONVERSATION TO THE TRASH?

230
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,325
How have you been?

231
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,079
You can go home now.

232
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,040
I'll do whatever you want.

233
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,002
You were absolutely right.

234
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,881
Life is too short for this.

235
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,386
I don't like it either,
but I hate that your heart

236
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,179
will always be somewhere else…

237
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,224
while you're with me.

238
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,437
Go.

239
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,648
We can get divorced.

240
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,657
INCOMING CALL
MR. KANG NAM-SIK

241
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,800
MISSED CALL

242
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,266
I need to talk to you.

243
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,895
-Why are you avoiding me?
-I've been a little too busy with work.

244
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,022
Why, huh? What is it?

245
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,481
About the money.

246
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,277
I'm gonna cut my losses with this dog,
so take the money out for me.

247
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,362
Didn't you say it dropped 30 percent?

248
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,281
Should be about 500-million-won.

249
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,742
It's not there right now.

250
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,833
-What are you saying?
-Something urgent came up, so I used it.

251
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,045
No, you can't be serious.
That money was for my alimony.

252
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,839
I need you to give me that money
so that I can divorce my wife.

253
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,758
So don't get a divorce.

254
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,803
-What?
-I said, don't get a divorce

255
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,305
Why are you acting like this?

256
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,266
You didn't know it's illegal
to use someone else's bank account?

257
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,853
You're the one that told me to do that.
You said it was safer.

258
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,772
So you did it anyways?

259
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,982
You shouldn't have been so greedy.

260
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,736
Why are you doing this to me?

261
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,947
Why did you tell me to divorce
if you're gonna act this way?

262
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,033
Says who?

263
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,953
Never did I ask you to get a divorce.

264
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,377
As for the money,

265
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,837
it's all under my name,
so it belongs to me.

266
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,114
I'LL GO HOME WHEN I'M DONE
WE NEED TO TALK SOME MORE

267
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,825
Yoo-hui? Yoo-hui?

268
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,996
So apparently,
the audit teams want to talk to us.

269
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,541
The audit team? Why?

270
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,254
Did you say embezzlement?
What are you talking about?

271
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,841
When you were overseeing the acquisition
process of TX engineering,

272
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,884
did their CEO give you one billion won

273
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,803
in exchange for favorable terms
in the merger?

274
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,639
That is a lie. Who'd ever accuse me
of something so risky?

275
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,685
Ms. Jin Yoo-hui
has given us her testimony.

276
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,728
Ms. Jin Yoo-hui?

277
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,735
That one billion won…

278
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,320
It went straight to Ms. Jin Yoo-hui

279
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,739
for arranging favorable terms
for the merger.

280
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,033
You're accusing me
when you've only heard her side?

281
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,953
To be frank, why didn't you do anything
if you knew about it?

282
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,042
The president of TX engineering,
Choi Myeong-woo, has already confessed.

283
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,879
He says that he gave you
one billion won in cash.

284
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,302
President Choi.

285
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,638
President Choi…

286
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,353
Nonsense.

287
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,231
That…

288
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,441
That is all a lie.

289
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,360
I can go grab the books to prove to you.

290
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,655
There's also a lot of stocks
that you bought under Ms. Jin's name.

291
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,783
I hear that's yours too.
Where did that money come from?

292
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,205
It belongs to my mother and me.
My mother was trusting me to keep it safe.

293
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,248
Then why did you buy it
under Ms. Jin's name?

294
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,463
I'll be honest with you.

295
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,883
I discovered that Ms. Jin Yoo-hui
had received the bribe,

296
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,427
but only after the merger was finalized.

297
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,596
So, when I questioned her about it,

298
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,681
she told me
that she urgently needed the money.

299
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,725
Ms. Jin doesn't quite remember it
that way.

300
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,727
TEAM LEADER JIN RECORDING

301
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,105
That night,
I remember getting drinks with Mr. Kang.

302
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,194
And then the next thing
is me waking up in a hotel room.

303
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,821
And all my clothes were taken off.

304
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,281
I was raped.

305
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,869
After, he kept threatening me,
using that night as blackmail.

306
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:38,912
I was mortified,

307
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,915
but I had to do what he told me
if I wanted to keep my job.

308
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,961
Since the existence
of illegal activity is confirmed,

309
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,754
we have to reach out to the prosecutors.

00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,215
The Personnel Committee
will reach a decision

311
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,259
once the investigation is over.

312
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,011
Jin Yoo-hui!

313
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,597
You have to talk to me.

314
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,060
-I have nothing to say to you.
-What? Sexual assault? Blackmail?

315
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,563
When did I ever do that?

316
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,357
You were the one who started the affair!
You came on to me!

317
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,152
Where are you going?
Jin Yoo-hui, where are you going?

318
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,114
Jin Yoo-hui! Why are you doing this?

319
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,533
Is this a game to you? Is that it?

320
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,994
Say something. Say something!

DIVORCE REGISTRATION

322
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,229
Hello, welcome.

323
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,586
Why did you call me here?

324
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,052
Can you please control
your husband a little better?

325
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:18,970
I'm sorry, what?

326
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,347
Your husband, he..

327
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,643
tried abusing his position at work
to blackmail me.

328
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,854
And now he won't stop asking me every day
to marry him.

329
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,940
Would you please tell your husband
to quit bothering me?

330
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,486
God, do you have any idea
how much it hurts me?

331
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,534
I thought that you two were in love.

332
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,494
Love?

333
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,872
You call that love?

334
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,085
Listen, your husband…

335
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,173
is a disgusting rapist.

336
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,641
I had no idea
that you could do something so terrible.

337
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,434
How could you do that to her?

338
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,436
Are you even human?

339
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,562
I swear.

340
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,023
It's only lies.

341
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,358
I…

342
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,194
Why don't you believe I'm innocent?

343
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,488
Wha… Why is my own wife…

NAM-SIK

347
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,897
-Yes?
-Hello?

348
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,191
Am I speaking to Mr. Kang Nam-sik?

349
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,109
Yes, that's me.

350
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,903
This is the Gangnam Police Station.

351
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,615
A complaint has been filed against you
for sexual assault.

352
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,743
You're required to report
to the station tomorrow for questioning.

353
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:48,953
Mr. Kang…

354
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,125
I'm going to sue.

355
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,710
Mr. Kang.

356
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,087
You have no way to prove she is lying.

357
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,089
She's saying she was raped.

358
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,550
All of our text messages
and phone calls we've had.

359
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,676
We could recover those.

360
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,471
And if she says she was coerced,
what'll you do then?

361
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,807
Let's not make this
a bigger deal than it is.

362
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,101
Listen, I'll find a place for you to go.
Let's take care of this quietly.

363
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,896
Since the existence of illegal activity
is confirmed,

364
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,357
we have to reach out to the prosecutors.

365
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,212
Tell me,
were you sleeping with Mr. Kang as well?

366
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,131
Don't accuse me when he was the one
who was harassing me.

367
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,758
Why don't you

368
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,427
find him guilty already and fire him?

369
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,849
Damn, he really was great.

370
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,812
Why did you have to ask me
to get married to you?

INCOMING CALL

374
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,853
Hey, it's me.

375
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,814
I'm sorry.

376
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,816
Honestly…

377
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,652
I'm so sorry.

378
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,741
Jin Yoo-hui has tricked me

379
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,202
into covering up her tracks.

380
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,955
She used me.

381
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,834
And now it looks like I did it.

382
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,716
I really lost everything.

383
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,677
My whole career…

384
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,846
the house…

385
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,059
And you as well.

386
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,023
I was so stupid to get scammed
by someone like her.

387
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,112
Why are you crying?
You were so happy when you first left me.

388
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:30,949
I really…

389
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,409
do feel so guilty.

390
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,082
I really am very sorry for both…

391
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,376
you and Min-ji.

392
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,296
Please take care.

393
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,634
Thank you for everything, Hye-seung.
And please tell…

394
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,886
Min-ji that…

395
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,058
that her daddy loves her so very much.

396
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,728
Goodbye now.

397
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,898

Hey, Yeong-seo.

00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:36,014
I'm at your house now,

How do you feel?

407
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:50,022
Yeah, this is pretty incredible.
Let's begin the open beta for today.

408
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,150
What? Without doing any closed testing?

409
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,443
Do you want everyone to see the bugs
that are still in it?

410
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,529
But that just means we can fix it faster.

411
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,656
If not,
can you actually finish it on time?

412
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,201
If anything goes wrong, the whole thing
might just die in beta testing.

413
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,580
Global embarrassment means
we won't even be able to launch the game.

414
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,540
Can you really have
that little confidence?

415
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,375
You're supposed to be
the head of development.

416
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,336
-Aw, come on, boss!
-Mouthing off again. Let's fire him.

417
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,548
-You can't be serious, Mr. Lee.
-Do it. I'm positive.

418
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,633
Do I bet on things that I'm not sure of?

419
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,179
If anyone's opposed, they can resign now.
I'll personally sign it.

So what do you think?

424
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,581
These are the youngest members

Don't look,
but I think that's Lee Hyung-ju.

00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,425
He's the CEO of Hibull.

429

One of the highest grossing companies
in the world.

430
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,852
Do you have anyone like this?

431
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,312
Uh…

432
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:16,567
Really attractive, also young-looking,
a 40-year-old divorcée.

433
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,488
A tech entrepreneur who owns
one of the highest grossing companies.

434
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,532
There are no members like that
at our company at all.

435
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:25,660
Is that so?

436
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,579
May I ask why you're interested
in divorce members?

437
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,705
Someone like yourself

438
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,999
wouldn't have any problem
finding a wealthy bachelor.

439
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,920
I can find a man like that on my own
without your assistance.

440
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,380
Why would I need Rex for that?

441
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,717
I want the highest Black Level member.

442
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,599
My family can be
a little tricky sometimes.

443
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,726
From what I have heard,

444
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,397
you've arranged nearly half
of the top 100 business marriages.

445
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,108
I even heard that some company presidents

446
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,444
entrust their grandchildren's marriages
to you. Is that true?

447
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,781
I must apologize,
but that is confidential.

448
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,574
I cannot discuss it further with you.

CERTIFICATE OF EMPLOYMENT

450
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,796
You know, it's pretty difficult
to be an instructor these days.

451
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,549
Honestly, you really need
to have something like this

452
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,426
for the board to offer you
an adjunct position.

453
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,887
Who else could actually help you, Ms. Seo?

454
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,889
I'm the only one
who can help you with this.

455
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,934
Thank you so much, Professor.

456
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,566
Oh, that's good, that's good.
Here, drink up.

457
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,614
Oh.

458
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,450
Oh, that is strong.

459
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:06,302
It is so nice to speak to someone
who is a bit older.

460
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:11,307
Kids these days… I have no idea
what's going on in their head.

461
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,226
Do you understand me, Ms. Seo?

462
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,275
Shall we go?

463
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,573
I'm not gonna do that.

464
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,122
Only when I become an associate.

465
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:48,135
Do I really need to tell you again?
I don't care if they're divorced.

466
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,932
They only need to be
from a well-known family.

467
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,683
That's all I want from you.

468
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,770
Yes. Black Level.

469
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,325
So.

470
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,327
Let's say hello to each other.

471
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:17,331
Here before us, our global scholar
from Stanford University,

472
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,916
Professor Cha Seok-jin.

473
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,794
Class of 2000 and our own hidden gem.

474
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,212
Professor--

475
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:26,549
And over here
is Professor Jung Mi-jin.

476
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,968
It's nice to meet you. I'm Jung Mi-jin.

477
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,803
I'm Cha Seok-jin.

478
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:35,015
You're still not married?
Or are you divorced?

479
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,476
Honestly, I never really wanted
to get married.

480
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,395
For real?

481
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,480
Eh, then maybe you two
could work something out.

482
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,190
Just like that?

483
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,276
Here. Let's all have a drink

484
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,485
-Here.
-Here.

485
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,863
To Jung Mi-jin and Cha Seok-jin!

486
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,157
Cheers!

487
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,783
It was nice to…

488
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,963
Hye-seung.

489
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,552
It's been a long time.

490
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,096
Yeah.

491
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,848
Have you been well?

492
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,226
-Mm-hmm.
-So why are you here?

493
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,022
I came to meet
the head of the department.

494
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,986
I was told
that you actually had gotten married.

495
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,323
Oh.

496
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,659
I need to get going.

497
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,332
Wait a second.

498
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,879
Here you go.

499
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,298
HANKUK UNIVERSITY
PROF. CHA SEOK-JIN

500
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,675
If you ever need anything.
Whatever it is.

501
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,718
Hmm.

502
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,355
Wait, Ms. Seo.

503
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,440
Thank you for dinner this evening.

504
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,736
If anything opens up, I will contact you.

505
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,197
-Yes, sir.
-And, Ms. Seo,

506
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,992
you should also know that
you're not going to be this young forever.

507
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,915
See you.

508
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,610
Hye-seung.

509
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,828
Hye-seung, hold on.

510
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,675
MARRIAGE AGENCY
RECOMMENDED BY OUR CUSTOMERS

511
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:18,053
Mother, do you really think
you could make me do this?

512
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,473
I'm just trying to make it very clear
to your ex-wife.

513
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,393
She is an embarrassment to me too.

514
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,481
I'm not gonna rush my next marriage
because of her.

515
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,942
You know I'm getting sick and tired
of dealing with women.

516
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,903
So?
You're going to keep living on your own?

517
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,698
Jun-ho is still very young.

518
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,576
At his age, he still needs
a mother's affection. Don't you see that?

519
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,331
Ms. Choi Yoo-sun
will reach out to you soon.

520
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,125
Please, can you just meet with her?
I'm begging you, son.

521
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,891
Hey, how's the studying going?

522
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,434
Don't know.

523
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,852
Hmm.

524
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,604
Jun-ho…

525
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,898
do you want to play a game?

526
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,941
For real?

527
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,743
I don't need a sibling.

528
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,830
-What?
-I'm just saying I don't need a sibling.

529
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,708
Who… who mentioned that?

530
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,881
Why is it that this game only lags
for me, huh?

531
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,492
The chairman had asked me to take it out.

532
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,285
Okay.

533
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,463
Mmm.

534
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,051
You just decided to put up that picture?

535
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,052
Uh-huh.

536
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,431
Seeing that I had the urge
to see my child,

537
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,850
it must be almost my time to die.

538
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,664
They shouldn't be divorced.

539
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:18,043
They shouldn't be too educated
or too invested in their career.

540
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,503
Nor a celebrity.

541
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:23,298
You know, someone who has graduated
from a good college.

542
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,050
A nice young lady

543
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:29,137
who can take good care
of both him and my grandchild.

544
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,855
It's very nice to meet you. Come in.

545
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,985
-Please sit.
-Thanks.

546
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,532
The view here is amazing.

547
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,745
That is why I come here
whenever I want to work alone in silence.

548
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,456
Of course, I usually just play games.

549
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,295
My mother usually does not act like this,

550
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,006
but she's been giving me
a hard time nowadays.

551
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,260
Well, that's only
because she really worries about you.

552
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,930
That being said, my opinions
are very different than my mother's.

553
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:15,517
I don't want to rush into anything,
especially because I'm so busy with work.

554
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:20,939
In my opinion, the CEO makes up
about half of any business, you know?

555
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,190
And that marriage is essential

556
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,860
to strengthen the CEO's position
within the company.

557
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:29,448
So you think that being an unmarried CEO
has a negative impact on the business?

558
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,742
There's a lot of people
that choose to never remarry

559
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,410
and are fine on their own.

560
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,245
A company is a system.

561
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,622
Yes, that's correct.

562
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:41,168
That's why everyone is terrified
that the CEO will bring down the system.

563
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,172
Marriage is a strategy that gives everyone
a sense of trust and security.

564
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:49,509
Globally, most successful people
are in very strong and stable marriages.

565
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,555
-This isn't very convincing.
-Is that so?

566
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,642
So what do you think of this then?

567
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,103
Why don't you see it as a marriage
that makes up for your divorce?

568
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,607
If I'm being honest with you,

569
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,903
what would people even begin to think
when someone like yourself gets divorced?

570
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:11,365
Wouldn't they immediately go
and put the blame solely on your wife?

571
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,204
-You can stop now.
-Now is the time to show them.

572
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,998
To show these people
who recklessly run their mouths.

573
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,836
But also to show the world
just how capable of a man you are.

574
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,213
I'm really sorry,

575
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,799
but I don't trust any women.

576
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:32,678
You can recover your shattered pride

577
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,640
by having a brilliant wife
you can proudly show off

578
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,642
to the entire world.

579
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,646
You have quite
the interesting business, Ms. Choi.

580
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,565
What do you think love is
between a man and a woman?

581
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,694
I don't think that innocent love exists.

582
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:53,031
Love is a business affair
that is realized between two people

583
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,950
by favoring profit over desire.

584
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,037
People always end up choosing
their own ambitions

585
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,289
all while believing that it is true love.

586
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,052
LEE HYUNG-JU

587
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,222
PERSONAL INFORMATION
LEE HYUNG-JU

588
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,145
We just received
a super Black Level member.

589
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,355
They have priority over all levels.

590
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,607
He attended KAIST for graduate studies,

591
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:32,279
he's an only child
with two trillion won in assets.

592
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,449
He's the CEO of the gaming company Hibull,
Mr. Lee Hyung-ju.

593
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,619
What is he looking for in a woman?

594
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,289
The exact opposite
of what his mother wants for him.

595
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,749
Someone in their early 30s.

596
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:47,586
Whether it's a first marriage or not
is not important at all.

597
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,962
I think what he wants

598
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,174
is to find someone
that is easy to talk to and full of love.

599
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:55,385
Okay, then. I'll start a list
of everyone available that matches

600
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,470
regardless of their level.

601
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,181
He is not very enthusiastic
about remarrying.

602
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,517
So it is important that we present him
an attractive candidate

603
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,187
to ensure that this marriage
will be a true success.

604
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,988
Good day. Do you have an appointment?

605
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,073
I don't.

606
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,824
I just want to get a refund.

607
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,577
My mother registered me
without my permission.

608
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,748
Ah, she consulted directly
with our executive director.

609
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:28,418
If you wait a moment, I can let you know
when her current consultation is done.

610
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,092
Okay, I like this a lot.
I want to be introduced.

611
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,428
Did you have any idea
that he would attend?

612
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,848
Hey, Hyung-ju.

613
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,100
Rex?

614
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,603
What can I do? Your mother asked about it.

615
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,021
Why? Did she register?

616
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,773
That's really good.

617
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,858
It's 100 times better
than being alone, man.

618
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,527
Just be honest, aren't you lonely?

619
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,405
That's impossible. How could I have known?

620
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,577
Just make sure to make me look
as nice as possible, please.

621
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,871
There are a lot of great candidates.

622
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,124
So we can't guarantee
that it will work out for sure.

623
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,333
That is why…

624
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,217
I'm asking you like this.

625
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,647
We will try to do our best to help.

626
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,899
-Thank you. I'm counting on you.
-Of course.

627
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,193
All right, then.

628
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,737
Ms. Choi.

629
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,074
Have you been well?

630
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,411
Ah. Ms. Jin Yoo-hui, right?

631
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:11,354
I felt my life was over.
I thought it was the end of everything.

632
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,648
However,

633
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,026
this was only the beginning…

634
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,904
with that woman.
