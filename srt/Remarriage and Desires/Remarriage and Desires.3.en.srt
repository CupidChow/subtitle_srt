1
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,851
Wow.

2
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,074
That man over there,
what does he do for a living?

3
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,869
He's a doctor.
The one next to him is an architect.

4
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,040
The Super Black, is he around?

5
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,087
I don't think he's here yet.

6
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,674
-Hello.
-Oh hello!

7
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,843
Please make me look as good as you can.

8
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,595
Don't worry.

9
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,972
-I'll see you later.
-Sure.

10
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,018
Goddess.

11
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,187
Wow.

12
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,565
Even with that mask on,
you look absolutely radiant.

13
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,652
I appreciate it.

14
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,082
Masks allow everyone
to be free.

15
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,294
Lies and desires

16
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,673
all become the truth

17
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,386
behind the single layer of a mask.

18
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,444
However,

19
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,363
if I know your secret,

20
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,450
the game begins.

21
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:26,039
Professor Seo, I'm counting on you.

22
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,790
You have to ace this.

23
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,794
This project is enough
for three grad students' scholarships.

24
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,299
You realize how difficult it is
for our students, don't you?

25
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,928
I need it
for my research performance report, okay?

26
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,304
Professor Seo.

27
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,226
-She didn't mind taking on the project?
-Of course!

28
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,187
As soon as I brought it up, she thanked me
for giving her the opportunity.

29
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,233
She said she would do her best.
So you don't need to worry.

30
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,567
All right, then.

31
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,282
Not planning on using your looks
as a defense, are you?

32
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,576
It's more like,
"Make your enemy question their judgement

33
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,870
before unleashing the decisive blow."

34
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,039
Basic battle strategy.

35
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,543
Maybe you should take it easy.
Leave something for me too.

36
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,212
Even if I take it easy,

37
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,005
it's only right for the defendant to lose

38
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,882
since they're the ones
who stole the money.

39
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:22,262
And isn't it our job to stop that?
What's only right. Hmm?

40
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,060
Have a drink.
I heard you guys were going to some party.

41
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,813
-You guys going too?
-Well, if I don't go to it, then who will?

42
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,316
-Me. And him.
-I haven't decided yet.

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,736
Let's just party for a day.
It's a perk of being single.

44
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,655
I heard hot girls are coming.

45
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,824
He couldn't come if he wanted to.

46
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,200
-I'm jealous.
-Hey.

47
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,704
Ms. Choi told me that I had to bring you.
So I promised her you were coming.

48
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,497
-Wanna know why?
-Why?

49
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,166
We're basically your sidekicks.

50
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,710
We're handsome plus ones!

51
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,005
Hey, yeah, that's true.

52
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,424
We aren't high status enough.
We need you.

53
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,217
You're coming, right?

54
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,178
-I don't know. Just drink.
-Okay.

55
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,306
-Okay.
-Cheers!

56
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,268
So, you got
the adjunct professor position

57
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,104
thanks to Jin Yoo-hui?
And you're working on her project too?

58
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,357
Wow, she is so sneaky!

59
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,319
Wow! So she shuts you up
just like that, huh?

60
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,946
It's honestly a cheap, dirty shot.

61
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,240
But I can't refuse.

62
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,701
That's what I'm saying!

63
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,369
She did it on purpose.

64
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,956
That despicable woman.
She is tightening her leash on you.

65
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,041
Mom?

66
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,667
Oh, you're back?

67
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,252
What's going on?

68
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,212
Don't worry about it, okay?

69
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,593
Min-ji's back. Let's talk later, okay?

70
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,262
-Wait, Hye-seung.
-Yeah?

71
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,598
I heard she's having a hard time lately.

72
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:53,978
She doesn't talk much at school,
and she can't seem to focus in class.

73
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,397
You should have a talk with her, yeah?

74
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,524
Hmm.

75
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,911
I was planning on going off campus.

76
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,120
So why here?

77
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,538
Just 'cause.

78
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,334
Well, this is Mommy's home turf,
so I'm your guide today.

79
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,505
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello.

80
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,716
Modern fiction…

81
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,010
Oh here, here. Oh here.

82
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,521
Hey, Min-ji.

83
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,606
Okay, so you see
that guy over there in white?

84
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,774
He's totally your type.

85
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,323
Mom, you really teach here?

86
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,784
Of course. And again next semester.

87
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,080
For this time, I'm going back and forth
to help with the professor's project.

88
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,377
-Mom, stand here.
-Right here?

89
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,259
-How's this?
-Yeah.

90
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,721
What? You want to play "school"?

91
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,350
Mom, I'm proud of you, you know.

92
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,394
I'm embarrassed.

93
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,355
I'm sorry, Mom.

94
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,778
For what?

95
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,198
For my grades falling so much.

96
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,119
I should have studied hard,
but I just couldn't study.

97
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,999
I wanted to work hard for you,
but I couldn't stop thinking about Dad.

98
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,085
That's why I wanted to come here.

99
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,421
To get motivated to study again.

100
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,802
When did my daughter
get to be so grown-up?

101
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,184
I'm hungry.

102
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,143
Oh yeah?

103
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,519
Okay, what should we eat?

104
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,106
The faculty dining hall?

105
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,149
The dining hall?

106
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,778
Are all these people professors?

107
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,492
They're professors,
staff members, and grad students.

108
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,119
You're so impressive, Mom.

109
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,122
I'm not impressive.
I'm still just an adjunct.

110
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,374
I need the official title
to be a real professor.

111
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,378
-Still, it's impressive. You're awesome.
-Well, I'm good at what I do.

112
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,548
-Oh, Professor Seo.
-Oh hello.

113
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,883
Your daughter?

114
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,553
My supervising professor.
Yes, this is Min-ji.

115
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,931
Hello sir, I'm Kang Min-ji.

116
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,933
Oh yeah?

117
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,935
-Please, go ahead and eat.
-Sure.

118
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,689
Well, you take after
your mother's good looks.

119
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,233
What grade are you in?

120
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,318
Seventh grade.

121
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,903
That's the scariest grade.

122
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,031
Well, try not to act out too much.

123
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,283
You need to study hard
so you can be like your mother.

124
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,202
Okay.

125
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,411
Yeah.

126
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,913
Oh, Professor Seo.

127
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,122
By the way,

128
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,210
they seemed really happy when I told them
that you are taking on the project.

129
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,421
I didn't realize you had a history
with that company.

130
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,923
Sir, could we talk about this later?

131
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,883
They said your husband used to work there.

132
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,510
Oh man.

133
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,096
Also…

134
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,683
…that lawyer Jin Yoo-hui sure is loyal.

135
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,227
I mean, not everyone
would take care of the family

136
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,813
of a supervisor who's passed away.

137
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,399
Min-ji.

138
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,902
Min-ji!

139
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,406
Mom!
Why was he talking about that woman?

140
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,908
Did you become a professor because of her?

141
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,327
Of all people,
you had to get a handout from her?

142
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,579
It's not like that, Min-ji.

143
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,080
Then what is it like?

144
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,540
Don't you have any pride?

145
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,458
It's because I have a plan too, Min-ji.

146
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,585
What plan?

147
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,964
What plan involves getting help
from the woman who killed Dad?

148
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,218
-Min-ji.
-I don't care anymore!

149
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,596
Everything about this sucks!

150
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,515
Why should I study,
and why should I go to college?

151
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,018
So that I can live
a pathetic life like you?

152
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,853
This is the worst!

153
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,062
Min-ji!

154
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,943
With the party coming up,

155
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,322
there's something important
I want everyone to be aware of.

156
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,907
Because this is going
to be a secret party,

157
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,410
we have to be extra careful
with the security.

158
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,037
If any word gets out,

159
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,538
all of our female members

160
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,124
will only pay attention
to the Super Black Level Member.

161
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,418
There can't be any leaks.

162
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,586
Understood?

163
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,795
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,507
What kind
of Black Level Members will be there?

165
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,677
Mostly men with assets
of several hundred billion won.

166
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,347
Of course, in terms of assets or looks,

167
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,432
he'll be the best of them all.

168
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,185
How am I supposed
to recognize him, though?

169
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,687
We're going to be handing out IDs
like name tags.

170
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,440
So you can tell me his ID then?

171
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,317
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,944
I can't do that.
That's highly confidential.

173
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,904
It's risky.

174
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,328
So, I guess what I had given you last time
wasn't enough for you?

175
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,042
If Ms. Choi were to find out,
I'm sure she'd think it was.

176
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,344
Here.

177
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,395
If everything goes well,
I'll take care of you.

178
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,939
Do you think I'll stop
at a simple designer bag?

179
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,997
JIN YOO-HUI
JUNG MI-JIN

180
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,917
I can get rid
of the restrictions.

181
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,294
Just support my daughter.

182
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,505
Congressman Son Pil-young has really

183
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,299
taken a liking to Mi-jin.

184
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,428
She's like a daughter.

185
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,558
I am Congressman Son Pil-young's
illegitimate daughter.

186
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,935
I'm handing you a knife with this picture.

187
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,323
So, I see that you've narrowed it down
to these two women?

188
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,909
Clearly, Jung Mi-jin is more qualified.

189
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,745
Despite her extensive education,

190
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,748
she seems to lack the skills
to charm her partner.

191
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,501
She's gonna need more coaching
if she's to be on par with Jin Yoo-hui.

192
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,713
Jin Yoo-hui is clearly attractive.

193
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,591
And certainly,
that's one of the most important factors

194
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,885
in being matched
with a Black Level Member.

195
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,387
But she's too headstrong.

196
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,390
Which, I have to say, it does concern me.

197
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,854
Jin Yoo-hui and Seo Hye-seung.
They know each other, don't they?

198
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,357
You were aware of their history?

199
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,027
It's true they've met before.

200
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:03,991
Seo Hye-seung's husband used to work
at the same company as Jin Yoo-hui.

201
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,162
Bring me both of their member profiles.

202
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,015
JIN YOO-HUI

203
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,769
CONTACT
JIN YOO-HUI

204
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,445
Why hasn't he gone
on any blind dates all this time?

205
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,073
I'm working very hard
to pick someone special for him.

206
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,659
What's taking you so long?

207
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,120
It's not just anyone.
It's your daughter-in-law.

208
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,414
Doesn't that warrant
the extra effort, dear?

209
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,626
So this was in my room.

210
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,212
Tell him to check it out.

211
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,131
He can see for himself.

212
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,676
He can go and pick out a woman he likes.

213
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,554
But this is an event
for people looking to remarry.

214
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,973
Plenty of unmarried women
will be there too, no?

215
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,433
All of the rich guys
are going to be invited.

216
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,977
You think only moms will show up?

217
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,396
It's not that I didn't consider it,

218
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,606
but Professor Cha
has never been interested

219
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,358
in these types of events.

220
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:24,363
When are you going
to give me a grandchild?

221
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:28,951
Everyone else has pictures and videos
of their grandchildren on their phones.

222
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,662
They're showing them to everyone
to brag about it.

223
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,581
What's the rush, dear?

224
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,749
I'm sure Professor Cha
will take care of it.

225
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,877
I'll go to that party.

226
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,169
Hmm?

227
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,839
When is it?

228
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,056
Clear your schedule for a day.

229
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,976
There's somewhere I want to go with you.

230
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,731
You should know where our land is,

231
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,484
and you should know
where our buildings are.

232
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,739
After all, who knows when I'll die?

233
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,241
Please don't say that.

234
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,119
So get married already.

235
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:18,167
Let me see the face of the grandchild
who will inherit it before I die.

236
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,763
INCOMING CALL

237
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,479
Yes?

238
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,522
Is this Ms. Jin Yoo-hui?

239
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,983
Speaking. Who's this?

240
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,694
I'm Mr. Kang Nam-sik's daughter.

241
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,788
-Why are you calling?
-Can we meet right now?

242
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,124
I have something to tell you.
Come out of your building.

243
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,336
If you don't come out, I'll come in.

244
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,713
Is there really any reason for us to meet?

245
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,091
Even if you don't have one, I do.

246
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,009
What?

247
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,886
If you don't come out,
I'll come back tomorrow.

248
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,930
And the day after that.

249
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,057
I'll come back every day to protest.

250
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,102
What do you think
I'm gonna write on my sign?

251
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,188
Okay, fine.

252
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,824
That you?

253
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,707
Get out.

254
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,639
Okay, what did you want to say?

255
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,099
Don't mess with my mom.

256
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,562
-Hmm?
-Don't hang around my mom

257
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,272
because of that project or whatever.

258
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,734
Your father always spoke well of you.
Said you were brave.

259
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,737
But you're not brave,
you're just reckless.

260
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,780
Don't you dare talk about my father!

261
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,955
Listen here.

262
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:26,795
Your father was a worthless criminal
who threatened and raped me to cover up…

263
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,214
…his corruption.

264
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,760
Don't insult my dad.
He wasn't that kind of person!

265
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,558
Do you want to hear more about it?

266
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,436
About what your father did to me before?

267
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,819
Do you want to know

268
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,323
exactly what he did to my body?

269
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,331
You can tell your mom

270
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,000
that I won't let it slide
if she keeps pulling this stuff.

271
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,260
Take a cab home.

272
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,861
No…

273
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,446
No…

274
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,326
Mom…

275
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,131
What is it now?

276
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,385
-What are you trying to do?
-What?

277
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,929
Can you do a better job
of raising your daughter?

278
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,265
You're not making any sense.

279
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,601
Your daughter came all the way
to my workplace to threaten me today.

280
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,605
Where is Min-ji now?

281
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,899
I swear,
if you did anything to my daughter!

282
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,569
I sent her home in one piece today,

283
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,571
but from now on,
you better keep an eye on her.

284
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm warning you.

285
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,202
If I get angry, who knows what I'll do.

286
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,371
What's that supposed to mean?

287
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,709
Hello?

288
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,505
Min-ji…

289
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,883
MY LOVELY DAUGHTER

290
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,104
Min-ji!

291
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,147
Min-ji?

292
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,024
Min-ji!

293
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,362
-She's not here?
-No, no!

294
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,490
So-eun doesn't know where she is either.

295
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,284
MY LOVELY DAUGHTER

296
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,746
The person
you're trying to reach is not available…

297
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,997
What about her grandmother?

298
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,671
Mom, is Min-ji with you?

299
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,982
RISING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

300
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,987
SON PIL-YOUNG!
APPROVAL RATING THROUGH THE ROOF!

301
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:49,998
Hey, Dad.

302
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,795
It's me, Yoo-hui.

303
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,338
I'm your daughter.

304
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,343
What are you talking about?
I don't have a daughter like you.

305
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,011
Kim Eun-seon, remember?

306
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,932
You let my mom win the trial.

307
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,977
That's why she said
she started liking you.

308
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,144
You have to remember.

309
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,605
I'm not your father.

310
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,108
But it's true. You are my real father.

311
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,193
No, I'm not. Now go away.

312
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,865
Honey.

313
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,118
Who is this?

314
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,747
Uh, I don't know.
She was wandering around.

315
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,257
Here. Take a cab and get yourself home.
Your parents must be waiting.

316
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,717
Here, go on.

317
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,014
Get inside.

318
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,630
I heard that you met Ms. Choi.
How did it go?

319
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,759
What can I say? She's very meticulous.

320
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,762
She didn't accept the offer right away.

321
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,514
Just give it time.

322
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,683
The more desire a person has,

323
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,519
the weaker they are
when faced with profit.

324
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,604
That's right.

325
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,732
Like how you've gotten here
by not giving in to the temptation

326
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:42,277
to run in presidential elections.
Instead, you chose to wait patiently.

327
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,156
How is your wife doing?

328
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,492
She's okay.

329
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,788
When her condition worsens,
I bring her back, again and again.

330
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,749
That must be hard for you both.

331
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,464
When would be a good time
to run for president?

332
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,383
What's the VIP say?

333
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,386
The VIP would like
for you to run right now.

334
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,598
Realistically,
you should be campaigning by next month.

335
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,229
Ms. Go,

336
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,648
take good care of our VIP.

337
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,195
-Eat some more.
-Okay.

338
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,470
Did you find Min-ji?

339
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,933
Jamsu Bridge?

340
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,940
Just tell me, is Min-ji okay?

341
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,777
Excuse me.

342
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,238
Min-ji!

343
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,619
You okay?

344
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,789
You should probably take her
to the hospital. She said she fell.

345
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,543
Thank you so much.

346
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,211
Of course.

347
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,796
Oh gosh…

348
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,928
Tell me what happened to you, huh?

349
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,972
Did that woman do this to you?

350
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,517
Why on earth would you go to see her?

351
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,187
I was scared that something bad

352
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,190
would happen to you too.

353
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,443
I just wanted to

354
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,405
tell that woman that my dad
wasn't that kind of person.

355
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,161
That no matter what she said about him,

356
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,039
that I knew that he was truly a good man.

357
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,336
But that woman…

358
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,760
I still trust Dad.

359
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,516
Dad wasn't that kind of person, right?

360
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,273
Of course not.

361
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,110
Your dad was not like that.

362
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,156
That lady was just lying to you.

363
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,505
Ugh, my poor baby.

364
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,343
Why did you have to go see her
in the first place?

365
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,178
That vicious woman.

366
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,765
Min-ji.

367
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,393
If you act like this,

368
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,979
you'll only make things harder
on yourself.

369
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,953
You see that?
What happened to your daughter?

370
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,913
How could you,

371
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,875
with a woman like that?

372
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,146
INCOMING CALL
MANAGER HWANG SUNG-HUI

373
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,067
Yes, hello?

374
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,907
A party?

375
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,202
Yes. It's going to be
a secret masquerade event

376
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,747
exclusively for our higher-level members.

377
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,958
But I was able to pull some strings
to get you an invitation too.

378
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,129
I'm not qualified. It's okay.

379
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,257
Of course you don't actually qualify,

380
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,469
but if you're interested
in attending the event,

381
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,054
I'll put in a good word and get you in.

382
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,181
I don't really…

383
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,228
Will…

384
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,190
Jin Yoo-hui be there?

385
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,150
Ms. Jin Yoo-hui?

386
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,113
Yes, I believe she'll be attending too.

387
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,200
Okay.

388
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,118
I'll go.

389
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:46,039
All right, then.
I'll send you the invitation.

390
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,564
-Hey, this is pretty realistic.
-Hmm.

391
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,692
And super detailed.
Nicely made.

392
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,693
Huh.

393
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,528
I have a sword.

394
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,154
Whoa.

395
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,198
Wait, where is it? I just…

396
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,955
Whoa, whoa!

397
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,833
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

398
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,960
Ah! Ah

399
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,713
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

400
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,048
Turn it off, turn it off. You died.

401
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,342
Whoa.

402
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,928
That feels so realistic.

403
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:46,474
Ah. Hey,
shouldn't the sword be a bit longer?

404
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,892
With a monster that huge,

405
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,979
do you think someone who's not athletic
can even attack at all?

406
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,441
Dude, this is gonna be stuck
in development forever.

407
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,985
Did you know,
there are companies in the States

408
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:01,197
that are developing technology
so you can play with your eye movements?

409
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,533
If we can possibly buy out
one of those start-ups,

410
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,701
it'll be much faster.

411
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,327
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

412
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,204
Then why don't you buy them, huh?

413
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,164
Huh?

414
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,750
-I'm out.
-Where are you going?

415
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,795
-I have to wear two masks today.
-Wait, wha--

416
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,214
Hey, clean up. And figure this out.

417
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,925
-Wh… what? Figure out what?
-You can do it.

418
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,385
-You can do it!
-Come on, man!

419
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,471
-See ya.
-Hyung-ju, wait!

420
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,951
Hello. Yes, ma'am.

421
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,479
What are you gonna do
about that woman?

422
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:19,776
I'm going to arrange a finale so grand,
she can never show her face again.

423
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,800
That must be Mr. Zeus.

424
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,019
What?

425
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,524
I want you to switch the IDs
for Zeus and Hermes.

426
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,695
Word has probably already spread
that Zeus is a Super Black Member.

427
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,738
So switch them around.

428
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,533
Cha Seok-jin will be Zeus.

429
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,202
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,495
But then…

431
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,706
…who is this person Cha Seok-jin?

432
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,667
He's a Black Level member
I'm managing personally.

433
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,294
If you do this, though,

434
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,213
all the female members
will immediately go to Zeus.

435
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,008
I want to see
how Cha Seok-jin handles himself

436
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,468
with women.

437
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,518
Hello there.

438
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,939
-Mr. Zeus?
-Yes.

439
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,317
Do you happen to like tonight's wine?

440
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,111
Of course.

441
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,631
Hey, he's here.

442
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,925
Over here.

443
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,406
Oh. I think they're starting.

444
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,413
I am Gaia, Choi Yoo-sun.

445
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,042
Just as the gods
have created other gods before

446
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,919
at the very beginning of time.

447
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:48,424
Tonight, these masks will grant you
a new primal freedom.

448
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,388
Your secret, delicate selves

449
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,016
free to explore
to your own hearts content.

450
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,229
To discover each other's charms
to your own heart's content.

451
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,400
And to fall in love
to your own heart's content.

452
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,070
Now I would like
to welcome you all to the paradise

453
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,197
of the gods.

454
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,661
-Whoo-hoo!
-Yes!

455
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,820
Red.

456
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,414
There's no way.

457
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,585
Hello, goddess.

458
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,627
Sorry.

459
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,216
Hey, come on.

460
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,762
-It's not easy, man.
-You need to be more gentle.

461
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,804
You try it.

462
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,098
-Watch and learn.
-Nice.

463
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,066
Would you like to dance with me?

464
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,777
Next time.

465
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,862
Would you like…

466
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,000
Oh!

467
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,354
Looks like you're a lonely hunter.

468
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,525
Oh, I've only ever hunted online,

469
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,736
so this is a serious reality check
for me.

470
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,115
I can help you out.

471
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,714
If a person
who was always in the spotlight

472
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,633
is suddenly hidden behind a mask

473
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,594
in a place where no one knows
who they truly are,

474
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,472
they'll inevitably
become awkward and lonely.

475
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,685
Anyone who approaches them with kindness
in a moment like that will certainly be

476
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,728
very difficult to forget.

477
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,619
YOUNG-SEO: IS SHE THERE?

478
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,210
I DON'T KNOW, I'M LOOKING FOR HER

479
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,009
Come on, we should dance too.

480
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,303
-Me dance?
-Yeah.

481
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,556
-I really wish I could.
-Oh, come on. Just try it.

482
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,642
Are you all right?

483
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,104
You're really quite the dancer.

484
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:19,982
You're beautiful.

485
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,234
Why, thank you.

486
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,827
Aphrodite likes
to leave herself exposed, right?

487
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,162
Just as you'd expect…

488
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,375
from the goddess of lust, who seduces men.

489
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,483
INCOMING CALL
MOM

490
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,343
MY JUN-HO

491
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,912
-Hey.
-How are you?

492
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,291
Calling to say hi.

493
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,252
It's lonely drinking alone.

494
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,505
Where are you? I can come to you.

495
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,008
No. It's fine.

496
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,429
Jun-ho's not taking my calls.

497
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,140
It's my first time calling him.

498
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,058
Why wouldn't he pick up?

499
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,228
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause he's with his dad.

500
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,397
I'm waiting, but he's not calling back.

501
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,485
He wouldn't be with Hyung-ju.
I think Hyung-ju went to that Rex party.

502
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:32,323
-Rex?
-Yeah. He became a member a while ago.

503
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,492
I think he's going
with Jin-su and Ho-chan.

504
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,828
Sounds like he's having fun.

505
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,456
So he's trying to remarry?

506
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,710
Mmm. I heard his mother
is really pushing him to do it.

507
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,462
Oh yeah?

508
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,845
Am I making things worse?

509
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,722
No.

510
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,600
Why should I care?
It has nothing to do with me.

511
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,813
I'm getting sleepy. I should go to bed.

512
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,857
Yeah, get some rest.

513
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,876
Ugh.

514
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,003
Boo.

515
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,297
Oh, come on.
How could you not sink that one?

516
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,632
Wow.

517
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,634
Hey, tell that to him.

518
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,513
Aphrodite, you see that shot?
Good luck.

519
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,530
-Oh my God!
-Nice!

520
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,115
Nice shot.

521
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,034
I thought you said
this was your first time.

522
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,202
It really is my first time.

523
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,372
Mr. Zeus, do you think you could teach me
how to hold a cue stick too?

524
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,958
-I'm having a hard time.
-Sure, come over here.

525
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,043
Come on.

526
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,505
-Put your left hand like this.
-Like this?

527
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,633
-Hey, I'll be right back.
-I need a drink.

528
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,847
I saw you down there.
You seemed like a good dancer.

529
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,515
Were you in the entertainment industry?

530
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,683
A lawyer.

531
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,893
Oh, you're a lawyer. That's nice.

532
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,563
Good time for the future
of South Korean law.

533
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,189
So what firm are you at?

534
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,027
If you really want to know,

535
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,070
you're going to
have to ask my manager for that.

536
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,199
Okay.

537
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,497
You know, when we were dancing,
it felt so good.

538
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,416
Did you feel anything special?

539
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,001
Uh, feel?

540
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,795
Power. P-O-W-E-R, power.

541
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,174
Talking to you, Selena,
I just want to take it off.

542
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,383
Oh, I mean my mask.

543
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,347
-You must work out a lot.
-Oh, you scared me.

544
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,183
-Wanna feel this side too?
-Ah.

545
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,227
Perfect. Let's try one more.

546
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,939
Oh.

547
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,695
Here.

548
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,073
-Oh, thank you.
-Don't mention it.

549
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:23,619
It seems like you're much more
than just a good dancer.

550
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,954
Are you in the industry, or…

551
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,790
Oh.

552
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,959
-I'm not in that kind of field.
-Then what do you actually do?

553
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,673
We should go.

554
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,425
It's kind of hot in here.

555
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,724
Mr. Zeus, it's your turn.

556
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,434
Oh yes, one moment.

557
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,947
Mr. Hermes?

558
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,031
Yeah?

559
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,034
Another drink?

560
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,337
I think it's cold enough in here.

561
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,382
I'm a lawyer.

562
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,591
A lawyer?

563
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,677
Impressive.

564
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,055
I'll make sure to call you
if I'm ever in trouble.

565
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,181
You should.

566
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,267
Mmm.

567
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:32,604
Since you're in business,
you must get sued quite a bit.

568
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,606
Business?

569
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,403
Just seemed like a businessman.

570
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,114
I'm not.

571
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,451
Okay.

572
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,911
I'm not a businessman.

573
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,456
Ah.

574
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,667
Well, it is a masquerade, after all.

575
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,461
It would ruin the fun
to find out too much.

576
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,263
The less you know someone…

577
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,726
the more enticing they seem.

578
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,615
I should be going now.

579
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:41,757
Wait a minute.

580
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,556
You've been acting strange.

581
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,768
Why have you been so interested in me?

582
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:53,936
I don't know.

583
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,439
I'm just here trying to enjoy this party.

584
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,275
I guess you know who Zeus is too, huh?

585
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,863
Are you jealous of me?

586
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,994
Is that why you were making such a scene?

587
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:17,751
So I take it he must be the best
of the Super Black Members here tonight.

588
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,837
That makes sense.

589
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,674
That's why you were acting like a moth
drawn to a flame.

590
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,761
And what's so special about you

591
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,013
that you had to follow us
all the way here?

592
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:34,518
Mr. Zeus hasn't even bothered
to glance in your direction.

593
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,938
Sounds like you've got it all wrong.

594
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,525
What I'm interested in isn't Mr. Zeus.

595
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,487
Best of luck to you.

596
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,156
Wait, who are you?

597
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,002
All right.

598
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,254
-Here, come here. Oh!
-Oh my God. Pull it up.

599
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,132
Oh my God. What if they see me? Oh my…

600
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,552
-That way. Let's go! Here.
-Hurry!

601
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,346
It's so uncomfortable.

602
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,059
I'm glad someone else finds
these masks uncomfortable as well.

603
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:20,188
Oh. I guess I'm just not used to it.
It feels really awkward.

604
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,900
Uh, Mr. Zeus,

605
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,569
it looked like you were
pretty popular with the women back there.

606
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,237
I know, right?

607
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,781
Turns out they actually like me better
behind the mask.

608
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,451
Now that I'm looking at you,

609
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,995
I get the sense we might be cut
from the same cloth.

610
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,206
Perhaps we have a lot in common.

611
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,291
Think so?

612
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,417
If we get the chance,

613
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,628
I think we should hang out
outside of here too

614
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,587
without the masks.

615
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,088
Why not?

616
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,090
Must be fate, right?

617
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:48,717
Yeah.

618
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,011
-Mr. Zeus--
-Uh, excuse me.

619
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:52,638
Oh.

620
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,598
I'm sorry.

621
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,655
You look lonely, priestess.

622
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,493
What do you do for work, Ms. Athena?

623
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,746
I teach children.

624
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,414
And I read books.

625
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,874
Books are great.

626
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,543
A job where you read? I envy you.

627
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,257
What do you do, Mr. Hermes?

628
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,550
Uh, well…

629
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,178
Mmm. I play games,

630
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:36,640
and I guess
I watch people make games. Yeah.

631
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,976
I should be jealous.

632
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,770
I really need to read more books.
What are you reading lately?

633
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:46,483
Well, there's "Heungbu and Nolbu."
"Kongjwi and Patjwi."

634
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,901
What about "Chunhyangjeon"?

635
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,863
There's a lot you can learn
from the classics.

636
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,116
Absolutely. They have sayings like,

637
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,869
"Don't bite off more than you can chew."
"Loyalty always pays you back."

638
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,706
The classics are the origin
of storytelling.

639
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,959
Human greed, schemes, conflict,

640
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:09,006
along with stories of heroes
and rags-to-riches.

641
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:10,549
You're right.

642
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:14,302
I think games are especially interesting

643
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,514
because they excite primal instincts,

644
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,891
such as heroism, greed, and competition.

645
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,685
You seem to know a lot about this.

646
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,937
Do you write stories for a living?

647
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,106
No, I majored in mythology.

648
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,025
Oh, mythology.

649
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,903
Mr. Hermes, I was looking for you.

650
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,655
Oh yes.

651
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,365
Tell me what you two were talking about.

652
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:39,870
We were talking about the relationship
between storytelling, mythology and games.

653
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,622
Ms. Athena majored
in mythology, apparently.

654
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,416
A very important topic.

655
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,753
The gaming business will only become
more and more important from now on.

656
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:51,339
Gaming is very closely related
to the new industrial revolution.

657
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,675
You're very interested in games.

658
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,218
I'll have one of these, please.

659
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,513
I did a few semesters
of related research at Harvard.

660
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,683
My supervising professor, Scott Gerald,
is an authority in the field.

661
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,689
So, uh, did you study mythology
in Europe, Ms. Athena?

662
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:11,359
Oh no. I've actually never been abroad.

663
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,111
Uh…

664
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,281
I thought you majored
in Greek and Roman mythology.

665
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,116
What's your department?

666
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,826
Korean Lit.

667
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,413
Well, uh,
I've never studied abroad either.

668
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,749
I guess we're buddies.

669
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,584
-Mr. Hermes?
-Yeah?

670
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,212
-Cheers.
-Sure. Cheers.

671
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,469
Ms. Athena.

672
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,597
You know,

673
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,060
you remind me a lot of someone
I used to know. Especially your voice.

674
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,979
Is that the best pickup line you've got?

675
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,982
Sorry to disappoint.

676
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,653
But I really did think so,
from the moment I saw you.

677
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,697
But she's married now
and has a good life.

678
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,745
Now that you say that,
it reminds me of my ex-boyfriend.

679
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,832
He left suddenly to study abroad.

680
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,708
I felt so betrayed by him.

681
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,046
Even at the end
he should have said goodbye.

682
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,591
I'm so sorry. Are you--

683
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,135
Mr. Zeus.

684
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,720
What are you doing here?

685
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,972
Oh hey.

686
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,223
We were just talking.

687
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,814
Why don't we finish our talk?

688
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,899
Sure. Why not?

689
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,029
Ooh. Are you all right?

690
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,580
Take my hand.

691
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,543
Thank you.

692
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,888
-Do you want a drink?
-Sure.

693
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,361
So, did everyone have a good time?

694
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,364
Happy to hear it.

695
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:25,702
And did you find anyone
who caught your attention?

696
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,707
It must be dreadfully uncomfortable
to keep your masks on.

697
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,960
So now, if you would please,

698
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,547
we will proceed with the final event
of tonight's masquerade.

699
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,550
When I call each of you by your name,

700
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,302
please take off your mask

701
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,095
and reveal

702
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,347
your face.

703
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:55,774
After the party ends,
you can find the person you liked

704
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,360
on the app that we'll text you a link for.

705
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,779
Now, when you hear your name,

706
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:03,740
please stand up
and briefly introduce yourself.

707
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,076
The first person I will call is

708
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,119
Mr. Eros.

709
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:09,955
That's me.

710
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,126
Hello. What a beautiful night.

711
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,673
I'm a dermatologist
working in Cheongdam-dong.

712
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,175
If you have any concerns about your skin,

713
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,178
feel free to drop by.
Have a great evening.

714
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,597
Whoo!

715
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,018
Next up, Ms. Nike.

716
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,902
Good evening, everyone.
I'm working as a local news anchor.

717
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,529
-Nice to meet you all.
-That's her.

718
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,536
Mr. Poseidon.

719
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,542
Hello there. I run an accounting firm.

720
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,502
Thank you.

721
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,924
Mr. Dionysus.

722
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:03,842
Whoo!

723
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:07,804
Hello.

724
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,015
I'm a lawyer.

725
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,184
My door is open to anyone who needs it.
Thank you.

726
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,189
The queen of the goddesses, Ms. Hera.

727
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,321
Hello.

728
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,781
I'm working as a college professor.

729
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:38,501
She might be the true goddess
of beauty in real life,

730
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,627
Ms. Aphrodite.

731
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,017
Hello, everyone. I'm a lawyer
and part of a legal team.

732
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,186
Thank you very much.

733
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,945
Next, Ms. Selena.

734
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,575
Ms. Selena?

735
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,952
Please take off your mask.

736
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,999
I, uh, I think…

737
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,545
I'll take off my mask
a little bit later.

738
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,588
Oh.

739
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,841
Do you need some time to prepare yourself?

740
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,219
You'll still need
to take it off eventually, but…

741
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,721
we can delay your turn
until the very end.

742
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,891
All right, next,

743
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,020
goddess of wisdom, Ms. Athena.

744
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,704
Hye-seung.

745
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,338
Hello.

746
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,882
I teach students for a living.

747
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:16,015
And I have a special reason
for coming here tonight.

748
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,603
I wanted to tell you…

749
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,274
the truth about something I went through.

750
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,068
Something that happened to me.

751
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:36,119
And to tell you all about the woman…

752
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,915
who took everything from me.
