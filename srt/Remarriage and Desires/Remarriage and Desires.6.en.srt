1
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,007
I see you currently live
in Apgujeong-dong.

2
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,884
Could you tell me again how old you are?

3
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,261
I'm 21. I'm a sophomore.

4
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,847
Uh, and you want to get married already?

5
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,224
I want my daughter
to date someone special.

6
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,352
I want her to meet someone
of the same status.

7
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,566
So I guess we should change direction
if the world keeps moving like this.

8
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,486
There's nothing wrong
with preparing ahead of time.

9
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,488
Money is power, after all.

10
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,573
INFLOW ROUTES OF MEMBERS BY AGE

11
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,369
We've seen a significant increase
in female members.

12
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,498
It seems there's a rumor going around
that Mr. Lee is a client.

13
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,417
Even our female members in their 20s
want to be with him

14
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,211
and don't care
that he's been married before.

15
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,128
These are young women

16
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,923
who've grown up witnessing
and understanding their social class

17
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,758
is determined by who their father is.

18
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,052
But now,
it can change based on their husbands.

19
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,513
If that's the case,
to encourage more new memberships,

20
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,432
wouldn't we want to showcase Mr. Lee
as a potential suitor?

21
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,684
What a terrific idea.

22
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,312
Rex's programs could be sampled.

23
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,108
Just like you would try food
in a grocery store.

24
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:53,822
Rex is a secret fortress that
was primarily built on class and privacy.

25
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:57,242
And each one of you
is defending that fortress alongside me.

26
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,952
Ms. Hwang, our director.

27
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,745
Our manager, Ms. Kim.

28
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,873
And our other manager, Ms. Han.

29
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,127
You're aware that I have
the highest expectations for you all.

30
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,420
Is that clear to you?

31
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,632
Ms. Choi.

32
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,437
Do you think any
of this makes sense to you?

33
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,273
Why would he keep letting her
into his home

34
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,941
even when I told him
to watch out for her?

35
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:34,487
That is true. It's a bit more worrying
than we expected, isn't it?

36
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,447
What if instead,

37
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,867
you thought about being introduced
to someone else?

38
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,119
That may be our best option
to resolve this for you.

39
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,036
No.

40
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,998
Shouldn't you be trying
to find a way to make this happen?

41
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,959
Jin Yoo-hui.

42
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,920
Let's be honest with each other, shall we?

43
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:55,508
Is there another reason that you are fixed
on this obsession with Mr. Lee?

44
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,637
If your goal is to simply
marry a Black Level member,

45
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,640
then I could easily match you
with any other person you wish.

46
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,562
Like some old man?

47
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,773
Who else would there be for me?

48
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,484
No.

49
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:18,531
I'm going to have the most undeniably
perfect family with the perfect husband.

50
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,617
And I will…

51
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,333
make sure she sees it.

52
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,088
Ma'am, next time you need a car,
give me a call.

53
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,174
-Oh yeah.
-Thank you.

54
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,688
Where can you move to
by selling your car?

55
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,735
What else can I do?
I'm not just going to let that woman win.

56
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,155
A small studio if I have to.

57
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,298
I told you never to come back.
Didn't you understand me?

58
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,010
So tell me, do you really think that you
have a chance when going against me?

59
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,720
I don't know
how much you have left in you,

60
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,890
but I have the one fatal bullet
that I can put through your head.

61
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,351
Your life is now in my hands.

62
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,144
Why wouldn't I destroy you?

63
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,313
It never works the way you want it.

64
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,732
So no, Hyung-ju will never be yours.

65
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,692
You're wrong.

66
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,153
Lee Hyung-ju will eventually
be on his knees just like you will.

67
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,659
Just like your husband.

68
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,996
Don't try to kid yourself.

69
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,624
You must really think
that you're so special, don't you?

70
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,086
But we both know all of those men
were just following their desires.

71
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,004
They…

72
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,299
only briefly wanted your body,

73
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,800
and couldn't care less about you.

74
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:01,759
Enough!

75
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,760
You little…

76
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,449
Why do you keep coming back?
I have nothing to say.

77
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:28,036
Sir, listen,
please let me ask you one more time.

78
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,666
You should already know
that your word is far more important

79
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,293
than what anyone else can say.

80
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,461
Far more than my own.

81
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,967
Don't you know whose fault it is
that you're in here suffering like this?

82
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,345
This is all because of Jin Yoo-hui.

83
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,057
Just like my husband,

84
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,393
you were also a victim who was used
by that woman for her own gain.

85
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,271
Do you know what Jin Yoo-hui
is trying to do right now?

86
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,734
Trying to find another rich man
as if nothing had happened to you at all.

87
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,405
So please, help me.

88
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,828
You should go.

89
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,040
You really think I want
to rot in here even longer

90
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,750
because I'm accused of perjury?

91
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,794
Sir, please wait!

92
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,944
-Are you all packed up?
-Not yet, there's a little left.

93
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,905
But mom, what's this?
I think it's Dad's.

94
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,615
It's nothing really.

95
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,910
Get rid of what you can.
We won't have enough room for it all.

96
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,501
Oh, Young-Seo, come in.
The door's already open.

97
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,672
You have to be gone
by tomorrow.

98
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,259
So, did you happen to find a new home?

99
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,053
This is still my house for today. Get out.

100
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,514
Hey, I didn't want to resort
to this either.

101
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,517
It's not too late to give up your pride
and beg me to let you stay.

102
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,726
Did you hear me? Get out now!

103
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,145
Mom?

104
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,688
Hello again.

105
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,566
It really is a shame.

106
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,153
If your mother had just stayed quiet,
you probably could have kept living here.

107
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,697
What, Mom? Is she the one
who's kicking us out of our house?

108
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,739
Min-ji, go to your room.

109
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,242
Give me a call.
I'll let you have until the end of today.

110
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,704
Hold on! Why do you keep doing this to us?

111
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,622
How can you call yourself human?

112
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,500
Fine. Step on us all you want.
I'll let you do it for now.

113
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,837
But, when I grow up,
I'm gonna make you pay for it.

114
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,423
I will never forgive you
till the day I die.

115
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,217
I guess you do have something
that still matters.

116
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,052
What do you mean by that?

117
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,596
I'm saying you should…

118
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,223
protect what's precious.

119
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,257
Hye-seung.

120
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,304
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, mister.

121
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,514
Oh, Min-ji.

122
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,432
Have you packed up already?

123
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,478
Jin Yoo-hui put our house up for sale,
and she's kicking us out.

124
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,772
What are we supposed to do now?

125
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,279
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
You don't have to move.

126
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,076
This place is mine now.

127
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,328
How?

128
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,454
What do you mean by that?

129
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,372
Oh yeah.

130
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,501
I paid off what you owed
and bought back your apartment.

131
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,962
Here.

132
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,846
What are you doing? Start unpacking.

133
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,194
Min-ji seemed
to have been really surprised.

134
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,991
I hope I didn't offend you.

135
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,327
No, I'm just embarrassed.

136
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,454
I can't even refuse.

137
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,627
I'm in no position
to protect what's left of my pride.

138
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,673
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

139
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,300
Thank you very much.

140
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,969
You don't have to talk to me like that.

141
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,097
You can now rest easy.

142
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,017
I'm taking off.

143
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,785
They did what?

144
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,206
So that's why their eviction
was cancelled yesterday?

145
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,880
All right, then. Thank you.

146
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,555
Really persistent, aren't you?

147
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,228
Mr. Lee.

148
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,023
-Oh, what's up?
-Sir.

149
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,280
-How are you, sir?
-Uh…

150
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:00,034
Why are you so surprised?
So happy to see her?

151
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,161
Ms. Jin joined our company recently.

152
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,455
She's been helping us
with the Action Blitz acquisition.

153
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,749
I'll do all I can to support you then.

154
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,584
Look at all her energy, right?

155
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,336
Huh.

156
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,004
Very reassuring.

157
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,339
Please, take a seat.

158
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,257
-Go ahead, sit.
-Mm-hmm.

159
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,970
-Uh, Hyung-ju.
-Yeah?

160
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,473
Ms. Jin wanted me to give this to you.

161
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,187
Does this mean there's something wrong?

162
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,231
Oh no, nothing like that.

163
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,442
She's made some good points.
She'll tell you about it.

164
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,612
And with that, I'm heading out.
I've got a meeting.

165
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,406
-You have to go?
-Mm-hmm.

166
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,157
-See you at the office.
-Bye.

167
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,119
-See you later.
-Yeah.

168
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,998
Ah, please take a look.

169
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,625
Yeah.

170
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,845
You've provided a very keen analysis.

171
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,013
I never even considered
anything like this.

172
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,060
Hibull is as important to me
as it is to you.

173
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,979
If you overlook a trap like that,

174
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,148
then you'll be left
with bigger problems later on.

175
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,359
Then I better get moving with acquisition
before people start talking about it.

176
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,528
Oh, of course.

177
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,947
I owe you once again. Thank you so much.

178
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,949
It's quite alright.

179
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,952
How about you pay me back
with a meal, then?

180
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,126
I was surprised to see Ms. Seo
at your house the other day.

181
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,503
I thought for sure she wouldn't be there.

182
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,175
You know that rumor you told me about?
The one where she's targeting men.

183
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,302
I realized it was entirely baseless.

184
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,637
So I don't know where you heard
that accusation from,

185
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,140
but Ms. Seo is a kind person.

186
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,563
By any chance,
are you interested in her?

187
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,818
She's just my son's tutor. Nothing more.

188
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,950
Mr. Lee wants to marry a trophy wife.

189
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,495
So you're saying I'm not a trophy to him?

190
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,040
What did Jung Mi-jin promise
to give you in return?

191
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,878
No matter who it is,
if I set my mind to it

192
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,256
I can destroy them
regardless of what they offer you.

193
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,259
Ms. Choi.

194
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,095
Support me instead.

195
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,265
I can give you so much more.

196
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,440
Should we just lay everything out
on the table right now?

197
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,277
How many women are you considering
as potential wives?

198
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,155
What are you asking me?

199
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,450
I'm saying that I would prefer
if we had feelings for each other,

200
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,869
but it's okay
if that's not the case for you.

201
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,122
Don't you think that someone like me

202
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,166
would even have a chance
at being your wife?

203
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,462
I know that if we were married,
I'd be capable of supporting you.

204
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,756
Oh.

205
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,802
If I'm being honest,
I have no plans to marry just yet.

206
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,680
And I didn't intend on becoming
a member of Rex either.

207
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,182
But you will have to choose someone
eventually to marry, right?

208
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,187
I would like you to know

209
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,358
that I'll be waiting
at the very front of that line for you.

210
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,615
Hello, Mr. Park.

211
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,244
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I can do dinner tonight.

212
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:34,248
I signed up for those Executive Courses.
So I should be going now.

213
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,709
Yeah, I can call you later.

214
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,554
The opening address
for the Executive Courses

215
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,139
begins at five today.

216
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,684
May I ask why you need it?

217
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,644
Show me Jin and Lee Hyung-ju.

218
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,147
They're going to have
a family meeting together later.

219
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,065
Thank you very much, Ms. Hwang.

220
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:08,073
Our lecture on owner risk case studies
and their countermeasures

221
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,284
will be delivered
by Professor Jung Mi-jin.

222
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:17,416
Our lecture on director foreign investment
and risk management strategies

223
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,044
will be delivered
by Professor Cha Seok-jin.

224
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,590
Last but not least,
we will receive a lecture

225
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,177
on Leadership in Mythology
led by Professor Seo Hye-seung.

226
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,852
To begin,

227
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,355
I will take everyone
through a brief introduction

228
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,107
of the contents
that make up our curriculum.

229
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,443
-I think it went well.
-Yes.

230
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,325
HANKUK UNIVERSITY BUSINESS SCHOOL
EXECUTIVE COURSES OPENING CEREMONY

231
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,039
It's funny all of us
were at the masquerade party.

232
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,291
I was Zeus, actually.

233
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,389
Did you two have a lot of fun
watching me make a fool of myself?

234
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,475
-Uh…
-Uh, no, of course not, Mr. Hermes.

235
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,230
Well, does it even matter? It's just nice
that we're all here now together.

236
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,774
-It's great.
-It is really great. Really great.

237
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,276
Well, we all know
what brought us here tonight.

238
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,656
It's because our Professor Cha
takes such good care of Professor Seo.

239
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,825
-Right.
-I think you're misunderstanding.

240
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:37,746
Professor Seo was specifically asked
to join to improve the lectures we have.

241
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,125
Oh, here I thought you were doting
on your first love.

242
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,837
You seem to have a lot of interest in me.

243
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,729
Mr. Lee's in there. Why is that?

244
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,190
Let's find out.

245
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,572
Look who I ran into
outside in the hallway.

246
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:15,576
When I told her Mr. Lee was here,
she said that she had to see you.

247
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,828
What are you doing here?

248
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,873
I had a meeting with a client of mine.

249
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,708
Ms. Aphrodite…

250
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,296
How incredible is it
that all of us who were at the same party

251
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,006
are now here together?

252
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,800
But what are you doing here,
Ms. Seo Hye-seung?

253
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,137
Professor Seo was giving
a special lecture on Mythology

254
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,847
to improve the quality of our lectures.

255
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,848
Hmm.

256
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,102
It seems like you really do wear
a lot of hats, Ms. Seo.

257
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,231
That's only because my life
has had a lot of twists and turns.

258
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,777
That's actually why I wanted to…

259
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,113
finally tell my story at the party.

260
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,825
Oh, I forgot.
You couldn't because of Poseidon, right?

261
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,743
Oh.

262
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:02,122
What was your story about again?
Something about some woman?

263
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,667
Looks like
I have another chance to tell you all.

264
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,712
I had wanted to forget it
because it's so painful.

265
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,340
But that woman

266
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,384
used to be my husband's coworker.

267
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,807
My husband was having an affair with her.

268
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,766
An affair?

269
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,604
He even asked me for a divorce
because of how much he loved that woman.

270
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,897
But it turns out

271
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,984
she didn't actually love my husband.

272
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,903
Turns out that she only wanted to use him.

273
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,740
Couldn't this story be better told
in a more private setting?

274
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,659
I don't think this is
the right place for it.

275
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,078
Oh really? I think it's perfect.

276
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,913
Yeah, I agree.

277
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,749
It's not like
we're out in public or anything, right?

278
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,584
Yeah. No, you're right.

279
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,337
So, then?

280
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,588
Then that woman…

281
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,591
was also at that party.

282
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,428
So wait, who is she supposed to be?

283
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,848
That woman is…

284
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,483
…Ms. Jin Yoo-hui.

285
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:22,161
If I were to openly talk at all
about that woman here,

286
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,955
could I end up facing
any legal repercussions?

287
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,765
You could potentially get sued
for defamation, according to article 307.

288
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,310
Even if any
of those accusations were true,

289
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,604
you could still face up
to two years in prison time,

290
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,814
or a fine of up to five million won.

291
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,358
And if it's false,
the punishment is much more severe.

292
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:57,988
You could face serious repercussions.
Possibly up to five years of prison.

293
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,241
Ah. Is that so?

294
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,619
I'm glad that

295
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,331
I asked you about the repercussions, then.

296
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,215
Oh.

297
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,425
They have the same lectures, then.

298
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,804
Mr. Lee never said anything,
so I have no idea.

299
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,806
That'll be very good.

300
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,893
They can see each other often
while they're working.

301
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,563
Spending time together in person
is always better.

302
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,982
Absolutely.

303
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,401
Since both of you are already here,

304
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,862
should I see if those two
are free to meet up?

305
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,454
You should have told them the truth.

306
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,707
This isn't just you. It's Mr. Lee as well.

307
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,792
I know.

308
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,254
I really do want to be honest
and say everything.

309
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,339
-But--
-Hye-seung.

310
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,385
I only wish that you would tell everyone
for your own sake.

311
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,054
Yeah, Mom. We're just finishing.

312
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,807
Yeah. Okay, we'll be there.

313
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,727
Mr. Lee--

314
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,355
Did you know both of our mothers
are having dinner in this hotel

315
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,398
right at this moment?

316
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,152
They want us to come downstairs together.

317
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,585
How are you enjoying your food, Mrs. Noh?

318
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,254
It's delicious.

319
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,260
Good evening, Mrs. Noh.

320
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,887
Are you here alone?

321
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,267
He said he had
an urgent meeting to get to.

322
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,269
Hmm.

323
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,856
I think that Mr. Lee
is trying to be thoughtful

324
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,275
so that you three can talk comfortably.

325
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,901
Ah, still.

326
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,945
He should not have.

327
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,286
MR. LEE

328
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,301
Ms. Seo.

329
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,013
-Are you on your way home?
-Uh, yeah.

330
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,681
I'll give you a ride. Please, get in.

331
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,808
It's really fine.
The bus is almost here.

332
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,478
So what? Let's go.

333
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,313
There's a car waiting. Jump in quickly.

334
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,371
MOTHER

335
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,297
Mr. Lee, your mother's calling.

336
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,678
I don't want to talk to her right now.

337
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,767
Thank you for coming.

338
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,395
Thank you for coming.

339
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,704
Congratulations.

340
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,999
You can finally be who you truly are.

341
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,333
Ah.

342
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,421
Here you go.

343
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:31,178
I've always wanted to know
who my father really is.

344
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,013
DNA EXAM RESULT REPORT

345
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:36,057
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY: 99.9995%

346
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,438
When you said that it wasn't possible,
I had hoped so too.

347
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,773
But look at that.

348
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,320
Some little peasant girl turned out
to be the child of a married politician.

349
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,448
Won't this be quite the shock
to your voters?

350
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,052
How did you even manage
to talk to someone like that?

351
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,179
Do you know him well?

352
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,185
Mr. Ju.

353
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,733
Don't you dream of becoming a congressman?

354
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,701
I got a perfect score in Korean.
I'm first place in school.

355
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,954
Amazing!

356
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,040
That's incredible!
You did such a great job! Up high!

357
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,879
I'm so proud of you.

358
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,595
Wanna tell her?

359
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,681
Not now.

360
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,893
The day

361
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,396
that I actually went to see my mom…

362
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,605
Hey, you're here.

363
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,148
…I found her with someone else.

364
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,485
A man.

365
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,321
Oh.

366
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,368
I'm sure that she had
a good reason to be with him.

367
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,246
Lee Jun-ho!

368
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,333
I heard you got the top score
in your school. That's amazing!

369
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,127
Nice work.

370
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,421
You never said anything
when I got perfect grades in math.

371
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,591
-This guy.
-My grandson is an impressive young man.

372
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,011
And Ms. Seo
didn't do too bad either.

373
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,139
Thank you for working
so hard for us.

374
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,725
Dinners being prepared,
so please stay and eat with us tonight.

375
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,311
Oh. Okay.

376
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,772
Thank you so much, Ms. Seo.

377
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,483
If there's any way
that I can pay you back…

378
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,571
Jun-ho,
should we let Ms. Seo come with us?

379
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,697
Can we, Dad?

380
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,501
-Mmm!
-Do you like it?

381
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,462
Yeah, it's so good, Jun-ho.

382
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,007
Oh cool.

383
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,150
Whoa!

384
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,236
-Did I do it?
-You did it! Good job!

385
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,571
Ah!

386
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,949
Did you get hurt?

387
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,912
Let me see.

388
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,415
-Is there a first aid kit somewhere?
-Let me go check, all right?

389
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,167
Hey Jun-ho, you need to be more careful.

390
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,715
It's okay.

391
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,515
The bleeding seems to have stopped.
Can you still feel it?

392
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,267
How deep was the wound?

393
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,728
This might take a while to heal.

394
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,939
Does it still sting?

395
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,861
-Hey, what are you doing? Come here.
-Right.

396
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,288
It's okay.

397
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,378
Now make sure it doesn't get wet, hmm?

398
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,756
I don't want it to get worse,
so please be careful for me.

399
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,259
My goodness.

400
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,263
That's going to hurt for a while.

401
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,482
Uh, this, uh…
Wait, so you have to do this?

402
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,612
It's been way too long
since I saw Jun-ho laugh

403
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,072
this much with anyone.

404
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,867
It's the same for Min-ji.

405
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:09,164
Now that they're laughing,
I feel like I can finally breathe.

406
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,550
Oh!

407
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,785
Min-ji, this is a present from my dad.

408
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,204
What? Really? You're kidding!

409
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,955
Is this car really ours?

410
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,832
Yep.

411
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,463
Thanks to your hard work,
our Jun-ho has confidence.

412
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,506
So please, don't say no.

413
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,965
Mr. Lee, I can't accept.

414
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:01,925
Whoa!

415
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,385
Whoa, this is amazing!

416
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,055
Ms. Seo,
please come check it out for yourself.

417
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:07,972
No.

418
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,643
I'm sorry,
but your thanks is more than enough.

419
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,311
I was just doing my job.

420
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:15,939
Then…

421
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,611
why don't you at least keep it with you
as long as you're still our tutor, okay?

422
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,073
Please go take her home, okay?

423
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,825
-Yes, sir.
-Jun-ho.

424
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,452
-Ms. Seo, please come check out the car.
-What? No.

425
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,580
-Come on, Ms. Seo. Ms. Seo, just get in.
-Come on, Mom. Get in!

426
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,290
-Look at this.
-Just go look.

427
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,876
Come on, get in. Get in for me.

428
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,976
Min-ji must be happy
to have Ms. Seo as her mom.

429
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,153
Let's go. What do you want to eat?

430
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,253
MIN-JI: THANK YOU
FOR THE GREAT FOOD TODAY!

431
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,171
SEOK-JIN: DID YOU LIKE IT?
I ENJOYED MEETING YOU

432
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,961
I won't set you up with anyone else.

433
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,048
I'm going to help you get the person
that you truly want.

434
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,883
What are you talking about?

435
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:10,345
Soon you will come to realize
that we can help each other

436
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,512
to achieve our goals.

437
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,526
Hi, how are you?

438
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,865
I'm Jin Yoo-hui.

439
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,494
Oh yes. How are you?
Please, come in.

440
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,793
You must be one of Mr. Ju's coworkers.

441
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,336
Did you just start?

442
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,880
Yes, Mr. Ju
had a meeting this morning.

443
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,965
So I came alone.

444
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,801
Ah, here you go.
Here's the material I mentioned.

445
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,427
Take a seat.

446
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,395
As a shareholder of Hibull,

447
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,523
I wanted to ensure you knew
about the changes in shareholders.

448
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,608
Not to mention
that I've been instructed to do so.

449
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,901
Yeah.

450
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,655
Well, I suppose
it doesn't do any harm to know.

451
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:15,535
I probably shouldn't tell you,
but Mr. Ju is very worried about Mr. Lee.

452
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,203
Mr. Lee?

453
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,288
Oh, you didn't know that?

454
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,917
I guess he can't really tell you
because they're friends.

455
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,462
But I think you should
know everything about it,

456
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,631
seeing that you're Jun-ho's mother.

457
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,802
What is it?

458
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:37,181
I think there's a reason to be concerned
about the woman tutoring Jun-ho right now.

459
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,727
There's talk
that she intentionally approached Mr. Lee.

460
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,565
And that she's even beginning
to act like Jun-ho's mother as well.

461
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,236
Thank you.

462
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,449
I understand.

463
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,545
Welcome, Ms. Seo.

464
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,547
Please, follow me.

465
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,184
Hye-seung.

466
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,271
Please have a seat.

467
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,441
Since you already know each other,
I'll skip the introduction.

468
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,609
I'll get right to it.

469
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,320
This is going to be
your first official date

470
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,573
as two Rex members
who have been matched by our system.

471
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:36,991
What are you saying?

472
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,410
Just so you know,

473
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,623
Professor Cha here is legally my son.

474
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,169
So I made sure to put a lot of thought
into who he's dating

475
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,254
so he can meet the best woman for him.

476
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,966
What that means for you, Ms. Seo,

477
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,385
you are the one Rex member

478
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,013
that I trust the most
out of all of our valued members.

479
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,561
What are you two doing here?

480
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,025
These two members
are going on their first date.

481
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,860
Good for them.

482
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,280
I've always imagined that these two
would be a perfect match together.

483
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,783
Are you two also out on a date tonight?

484
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,662
-Yes.
-How lovely.

485
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:28,042
Then I hope everyone has a wonderful time.

486
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,224
She did that on purpose.

487
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,853
I think Ms. Choi is nervous
about my relationship to Mr. Lee,

488
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,188
since I'm still visiting Mr. Lee's home.

489
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:54,026
But I don't know why she would want
to try to match me up with you.

490
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,405
Your father is going to hate this.

491
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,199
I knew that those two
would get together in the end.

492
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,412
The other professors
always gossiped about it,

493
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,581
but apparently,
those two were a pretty popular couple

494
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,291
back when they were in college.

495
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,085
Everyone thought
that they would get married.

496
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:15,756
But then, Professor Cha left suddenly
to go study abroad at Stanford.

497
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,802
Don't you think it's strange, though?

498
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,598
That they just happened
to reunite again at that party.

499
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,893
Is this what people refer to as "fate"?

500
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,440
So you had to move back
to your father's place

501
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,567
because it was your mother's last wish.

502
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,238
That must have been really hard to do.

503
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,200
It was, at first.

504
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,662
Because everything my father owns
used to be my mother's.

505
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,873
She told me to get it back from him.

506
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,210
But Ms. Choi isn't…

507
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,213
an easy opponent.

508
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,758
-There's no way she'll just hand it over.
-I know.

509
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,469
She won't be easy to fight.

510
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,388
Right now, I just don't know
what's more important to me.

511
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,142
Even if I win the fight…

512
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,190
what would that mean for me?

513
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,568
Seok-jin.

514
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,405
I wish that you would have a happy life

515
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,618
where you don't need power or money.

516
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,205
You deserve to find happiness
without all that burden.

517
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,505
Care for some coffee before you go?

518
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,882
No, I'm sorry.
Min-ji's waiting for me at home.

519
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,427
Ah, I didn't think about that.
Then I can give you a ride?

520
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,722
-It's all right. I drove my car.
-Car?

521
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,520
Because of Jun-ho, Mr. Lee loaned me--

522
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,854
And we meet once again.

523
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,359
-Did you two have a lot to talk about?
-Yeah.

524
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,070
We're actually taking off now.

525
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,918
We're leaving now too.

526
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,965
Then, I guess we'll see you later.

527
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,763
The doors
are now closing.

528
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,268
I think those two
look really great together.

529
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,906
If you are

530
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,869
interested in Mr. Lee, by any chance,

531
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,120
please don't.

532
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,666
You'll only get hurt.

533
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,919
If it wasn't for Jin Yoo,
I wouldn't have a reason to.

534
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,796
So don't worry about that.

535
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,542
Why are you here?

536
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,759
It's been too long. I heard you've been
having fun on all your dates.

537
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,262
-Jun-ho is coming with me.
-What?

538
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,848
He's not answering any
of my calls anymore.

539
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,767
Did you tell him to ignore me?

540
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,311
What are you talking about right now?
Take Jun-ho where?

541
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,230
You're seeing some girl.

542
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,276
Ah.

543
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,404
I'm guessing that's her.

544
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,406
This the tutor?

545
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,950
Aren't you embarrassed
by your behavior in front of my child?

546
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,326
And you're a teacher?

547
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,956
I guess you're just using him long enough
to get something nice out of him.

548
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:17,873
Come on, enough.

549
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,006
If you wanna play,
at least have some class.

550
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,300
There are people watching you.

551
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,885
Have you finally lost your mind?

552
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,471
-Move now.
-Who do you think you are?

553
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,100
Why do you have the right to come in here
and insult my child's teacher?

554
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,185
A teacher?

555
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,772
Juno's only been hurt by you, and now
you think you're gonna take him away?

556
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,024
You think you have the right
to call yourself his mother?

557
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,528
Of course. That's the reason
that you're sleeping with the tutor, huh?

558
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,029
Because you're such a great father.

559
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,197
Heo Jung-in!

560
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,202
You are the worst mistake of my life.

561
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,871
The only reason I've ever put up with you

562
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,457
is solely
because you gave birth to Jun-ho.

563
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,750
But this will be the last time.

564
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,379
If you ever set foot in this house again,

565
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,965
you will not leave here alive.

566
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,134
Go ahead and do it.

567
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,846
Get out.

568
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,849
Before I have someone drag you out.

569
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,102
I'm leaving. On my own.

570
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,175
I'm sorry.

571
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,678
Can you…

572
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,432
spare some of your time?

573
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,615
Do you know how many times
I've imagined killing that woman myself?

574
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,825
Maybe a few hundred

575
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,870
No, probably more like several thousand.

576
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,710
I didn't realize that your past
was just as painful as my own.

577
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,588
It must have been very hard for you.

578
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,135
Would it be easier
to forgive her if she just died?

579
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,057
Isn't forgiveness

580
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,062
something that is always asked for

581
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,732
by those who have betrayed us the most?

582
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,070
There has never been…

583
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,033
a moment where I have ever forgiven
what he did.

584
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,518
Why did you and Mr. Cha ever break up?

585
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,064
Seems like
he still regrets breaking up even today.

586
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,612
It's just out of pity
and because he regrets it.

587
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,031
Maybe he's sympathetic.

588
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,870
We broke up more than 15 years ago.

589
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:43,954
And so?

590
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,374
Maybe he's still in love with you.

591
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,420
Hey Ms. Seo,

592
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,173
you're still very attractive.

593
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,843
You must be really drunk then.

594
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,639
I'm not just saying it because I'm drunk.

595
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,392
Well then, thank you for the compliment.

596
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,951
Then, what if you went out
with me and not Mr Cha?

597
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,541
Don't you want to date someone like me?

598
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,050
I'm just kidding.

599
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:40,719
Cheers.

600
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,695
How could he say something so cruel to me?

601
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,115
To the woman who gave birth to his child.

602
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,412
And in front of that woman.
It's humiliating.

603
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,915
I'll never forgive him for this.

604
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,006
And you shouldn't.

605
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,264
Are you crazy?

606
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:56,462
I have said a lot
that I wouldn't normally say out loud.

607
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,213
I'm sorry.

608
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,049
But also…

609
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,303
I feel a lot better
after saying all of this to you.

610
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,265
I feel like I can finally breathe.

611
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,142
Thank you.

612
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,439
I really didn't even do that much for you.

613
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:21,111
But, I am happy to hear
that you're feeling better.

614
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:26,867
I really don't like being in debt,
so if you ever need anything from me

615
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,245
please feel free
to reach out to me anytime, okay?

616
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,088
Mr. Lee, please.

617
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,847
I need your help right now.

618
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,729
Even when his ex-wife
embarrassed her like that,

619
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,815
she still would not leave him.

620
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,401
Is there something else
that I can do?

621
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,946
I don't think Ms. Seo
is really interested in

622
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,615
simply messing
with your plans to marry him.

623
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:56,665
I believe what Ms. Seo
wants to accomplish is nothing more

624
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,586
than to see you completely destroyed.

625
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,217
Is that so?

626
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,651
Hello. I'm Lee Hyung-ju.

627
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,696
LAWYER
JIN YOO-HUI

628
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,374
YOU ARE INVITED TO THE CHATEAU DELOUIS DAY
LEE HYUNG-JU

629
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,299
YOU ARE INVITED TO THE CHATEAU DELOUIS DAY
LEE HYUNG-JU

630
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,398
YOU ARE INVITED TO THE CHATEAU DELOUIS DAY
LEE HYUNG-JU

631
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,201
ENTER YOUR DESTINATION FLOOR

632
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,257
When did you
get out of prison?

633
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,258
Where's my money?

634
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,677
What do you mean "your money"?

635
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,429
Why, you just…

636
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,808
So.

637
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,601
She'll be at the party?

638
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,894
Yeah.

639
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,231
And with just one word from you,
she'll be gone forever.

640
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:46,942
Help me just this one time.

641
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:50,362
If you do that for me,
then I'll pay whatever you want.

642
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,669
Seok-jin is really going out with a girl?

643
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,422
Tell me about this woman.

644
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,592
I wanna be there with you
when you finally get to meet her.

645
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,679
What does she do?

646
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,639
This woman has a doctorate

647
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,933
and is lecturing
at the University right now.

648
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,644
She's smart and very pretty.

649
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,731
A professor?

650
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,861
-And family?
-You will meet her soon.

651
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,157
That feels so nice.

652
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,147
How did I not know

653
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,650
that Ms. Choi is your stepmother?

654
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,491
-Why haven't you said anything before?
-Should I be proud of it?

655
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:24,581
Anyway, is the woman
that you like not coming today?

656
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,468
Congressman.

657
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,388
Hello. Good evening.

658
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,724
I wasn't expecting to see you.

659
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,478
Yeah, it's always good to see you.

660
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,731
You must be very busy
with the upcoming election.

661
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,650
Yes, so I can't stay long.

662
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,111
I thought I would stop in
for a little while, though.

663
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:56,947
So I see.

664
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,574
Have a wonderful night, then.

665
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,577
Till next time, Mr. Son.

666
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,212
All right, then.

667
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,174
-How is your business doing?
-Great, thanks to you.

668
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:21,680
And so we meet again, Ms. Jin.
How are you still so sexy?

669
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,974
Hey, what? I can't help it.

670
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,851
You're still so beautiful.

671
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,687
Have you been well, Mr. Park?

672
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,188
Yeah!

673
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,400
I've heard quite a lot about you.
I'm Choi Sung-jae.

674
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:34,818
Ah.

675
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:36,987
Jin Yoo-hui.

676
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,240
Whoa!

677
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,218
How amazing!

678
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,232
Hye-seung.

679
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,816
Oh.

680
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,445
Wow, you look incredible.

681
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,364
I almost didn't recognize you.

682
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,826
That drone show is amazing, isn't it?

683
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,304
JIN YOO-HUI: ARE YOU HERE?

684
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,024
-Good evening, everyone. I'm Lee Hyung-ju.
-Yeah!

685
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,823
Next to me is the owner of the winery,
Mr. Jean-Philippe.

686
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:48,660
And all of our special dishes for tonight
will be served by Chef Riesling.

687
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,375
I would like to express
my sincere gratitude

688
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,003
to all my honored guests
who have accepted tonight's invitation.

689
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,006
This night, I wish to share with you,

690
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,675
certain bottles of wine
that are my pride and joy.

691
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,303
Only 50 bottles are produced every year,

692
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,222
and I just brought them over from France
to share with you.

693
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,309
Please let me introduce
the Chateau Delouis.

694
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,693
There's a guest that I want to give
this evening's first glass to.

695
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,322
Congressman Son, would you please join me?

696
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,128
Sir, if you would,
please lead everyone in a toast.

697
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,886
Sure. I am Son Pil-young.

698
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,513
What a wonderful night.

699
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:54,100
I would like to express my thanks
to the CEO of Hibull,

700
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,354
Lee Hyung-ju,
for inviting me here tonight.

701
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,940
Let us please raise our glasses
for their success!

702
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,864
-To Hibull!
-To Hibull!

703
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,834
To us all.

704
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,636
The wine's really good.
The best that I've ever had.

705
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,597
I'm glad you like it. It really is great.

706
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,352
This wine is my favorite.

707
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,357
What a lovely dress.

708
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,444
Thank you. It was a gift
from someone with great taste.

709
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,989
Good evening, everyone.

710
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,409
Please let me introduce you.

711
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:56,162
This is my husband,
Chairman Cha Yong-hwan.

712
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,708
Thank you for inviting me
to such a special event like this.

713
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,170
The wine
was really outstanding.

714
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,213
Thank you, sir.

715
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,175
Remember how I told you
that Professor Cha's special friend

716
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,385
would be here as well?

717
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,303
Your friend?

718
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,931
Yes, father. She's a friend from college.

719
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,266
Mmm.

720
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,601
Hello, sir. I'm Seo Hye-seung.

721
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:22,897
So you're the woman
who Seok-jin is seeing right now?

722
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,026
But I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

723
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,903
Professor Cha and I are just good friends.

724
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,409
See you later. Thank you, sir.

725
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,453
Wait, father.

726
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,330
Let me officially introduce you.

727
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,294
This is the woman that I love.

728
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,628
Mmm.

729
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:52,635
She's raising her beautiful daughter
on her own.

730
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:54,679
What?

731
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:58,516
Would remarrying be so bad?
What's important is that she's kind.

732
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,937
And all the while I was trying
to find him a bride,

733
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:07,066
I didn't even know that there was someone
he had already given his heart to.

734
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,445
I mean… What do you mean? What are you…

735
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,989
Professor Cha,
let's save this conversation.

736
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:17,202
No, now. My father wants to know,
so I'm going to tell him the truth.

737
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:20,997
-I'm not going to avoid this.
-I'm sorry. Let's talk later.

738
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,292
Wait, Hye-seung!

739
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,337
Come on, let go.

740
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,340
Ms. Seo is here
as my special guest for this evening.

741
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,724
She's told me that there's something
she really wishes to tell Ms. Jin.

742
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,106
Mr. Lee, how many times
do I have to tell you?

743
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,651
This woman is trying to deceive yet again.
Can't you see that?

744
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,445
She sought you
because she wants your fortune.

745
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,365
I guess we'll have to hear her story.

746
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:57,492
Fine.

747
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,286
I'll show you proof she's lying.

748
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,668
Oh.
Do you mean Mr. Lee's house?

749
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,712
Of course she knowingly went
to the CEO of Hibull's house.

750
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,881
I was with her
when she discussed the position

751
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,592
with the president of the university
on the phone.

752
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:18,846
Ms. Seo volunteered herself
to be a tutor for that house.

753
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:24,477
Ms. Seo, are you going
to keep lying to all of us?

754
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,231
You knew from the very beginning
it was the CEO of Hibull's house.

755
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:30,817
You're right.

756
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,819
I knew whose house it was.

757
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,196
But you know more than anyone
why I volunteered to go.

758
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,447
Jin Yoo-hui.

759
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,659
Why don't you tell everyone
about the affair

760
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,704
so people know why Hye-seung
had no other option but to do so.

761
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:43,788
Affair?

762
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,291
An affair?

763
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:50,128
Are you talking about an affair
with a disgusting criminal?

764
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,672
I am obviously the victim here.

765
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,299
Are you serious?

766
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,181
Look.

767
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,559
This is the ring

768
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:07,687
that my husband was wearing
up until the moment that he died.

769
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,607
Do you know what was engraved onto it?

770
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,864
Your initials, along with my husbands.

771
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:24,370
What are you…
What are you talking about right now?

772
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:28,124
I even checked the serial number
to see who purchased this ring.

773
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,751
And do you want to know who bought it?

774
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:31,836
Jin Yoo-hui.

775
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:33,463
It was you.

776
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:39,177
This is all a lie. She's lying to you all!
This is just a ploy!

777
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:43,056
Do you even know the reason why my husband
actually decided to kill himself?

778
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,766
-Do you?
-She's lying.

779
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,977
Those are all lies.

780
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:53,691
I'm glad to hear
that Choi Myeong agreed to help you.

781
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:59,447
Seo Hye-seung will be absolutely destroyed
in front of everyone at the party.

782
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,532
Hyung-ju, too.

783
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,909
And in the end…

784
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,038
he'll come right back to me.

785
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,209
What are you saying?
What do you mean "lies"?

786
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,087
You already know
the truth about all of this.

787
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,672
Just like my husband,

788
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,507
you were also tricked
and used by this woman.

789
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,677
-She ended up betraying you just the same.
-Stop that.

790
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,512
Mr. Kang pressured
and black-mailed Mr. Choi

791
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,722
into giving him over a billion won.

792
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:25,807
And because of that,

793
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,685
he lost his entire family
and all that he owned.

794
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,897
You're the only person
who knows the entire truth.

795
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,191
Sir, this was incredibly unfair to you!

796
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,069
Unfair to me?

797
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,364
Things should be fair.

798
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,493
Should I tell them the truth?

799
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:55,795
Oh my God.

800
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,257
Don't you know whose fault this is?

801
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,177
I see you haven't changed at all.

802
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,178
Hmm?

803
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,933
I want to know
what the truth is.

804
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:10,768
The truth?

805
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,146
The entire and unblemished truth.

806
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:16,607
If you tell me what really happened,
I'll get you your freedom.

807
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,943
The choice is yours.

808
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,655
You were the one
who first seduced me before you decided

809
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,282
to steal the company's money.

810
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,909
And it was your idea
to pin it all on Kang Nam-sik!

811
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,707
So you seduced him on purpose,
and then what? Accused him of rape?

812
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,002
You're not just a bitch,

813
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,295
you're a murderer!

814
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,422
What the hell
are you talking about right now?

815
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,924
Okay.

816
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,260
So then,

817
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:51,017
let's see if people will still believe you
after listening to this.

818
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,229
We need to start tying up
any loose ends with Mr. Kang.

819
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,857
Things are starting
to get pretty heated at work.

820
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,318
I already took the money from his account,

821
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:03,029
so he'll get all the blame
if something goes wrong.

822
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,072
It won't affect us at all.

823
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,284
I've made arrangements
to get rid of him if things go wrong.

824
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,203
So don't worry, Mr. Choi,

825
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,538
all you have to do
is get rid of any documents

826
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,332
that connect us to the company.

827
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:21,798
They're making this up.

828
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:24,926
They're all lying.

829
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,302
Tell me now.

830
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:29,263
That woman made you do this, didn't she?
Huh? She did!

831
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,487
Jin Yoo-hui,
on behalf of the Southern District Court,

832
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:48,783
you're under arrest on accounts
of embezzlement and malfeasance. Let's go.

833
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,287
Get off of me! Let go!
No! Let go of me!
