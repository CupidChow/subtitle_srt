1
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,309
Ugh, rough day. Get home safe.

2
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,613
Who are you?

3
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,782
So this is the man.

4
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,492
This is the man

5
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,411
you want so badly, Jin Yoo-hui.

6
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,539
-You're Jun-ho's dad?
-Yes.

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,835
Nice to meet you.
I'm Seo Hye-seung, Jun-ho's Korean tutor.

8
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,753
Starting today.

9
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,882
Oh, I forgot my mother
had said you were starting today.

10
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,884
Nice to finally meet you.
I'm Jun-ho's father.

11
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,555
We finished our first lesson just now.
Jun-ho is really quick to catch on.

12
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,349
Oh, that's good.

13
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,437
All right, then.
I wish you luck with my son.

14
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,022
I will try to do my best.

15
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,696
Hello, Ms. Jin Yoo-hui.

16
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,700
Uh, you know me.

17
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,787
Always having a great time,
even when I'm working.

18
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,082
But since the trial I've been working on
is finally finished now,

19
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,752
I can't stop thinking about you
for some reason.

20
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,462
Oh, I'm honored to hear that.

21
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,342
Do you want to meet up?

22
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,678
When would be the best time for you?

23
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,098
I have a lot going on
the next couple of days.

24
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,308
I'll let you know later
when I'll be free.

25
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,567
I will never…

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,277
let you get…

27
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,238
exactly what you want.

28
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,701
-Oh, you're home.
-Yeah.

29
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,660
Hey, Mom.

30
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:44,038
About that tutor who was just here.
Where did you get her from?

31
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,957
Why? Do you know her from somewhere?

32
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,543
No, I don't.
She just seems really familiar, though.

33
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,296
Well, the president of Hankuk University
recommended her.

34
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,631
Oh, I see.

35
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,718
-Well, I'm going to bed.
-Mm-hmm.

36
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,721
After speaking with her today,

37
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,640
it seems like Ms. Jin Yoo-hui
and Mr Lee Hyung-ju

38
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,350
are headed in the right direction.

39
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,894
Have they planned a second date yet?

40
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,689
They haven't just yet, but she says
they're planning to in the near future.

41
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,442
In regards
to Jung Mi-jin's beauty care program,

42
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,153
I want to make sure
you reserve the secret package.

43
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,572
-Sorry?
-Please be sure you're following up.

44
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,700
Of course, ma'am.

45
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,047
-Are you Ms. Jin Yoo-hui?
-Yes, I am.

46
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,223
Mr. Lee picked this model
for you right before he left.

47
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,601
Would you like to try it on?

48
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,229
Sure.

49
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,857
It's a two-carat diamond

50
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,402
with a six-pronged platinum setting.

51
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,329
This is such an unexpected gift.

52
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,207
I can't thank you enough for it.

53
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,918
It's nothing really.
I'm just happy you accepted it.

54
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,838
I'm just not used to receiving gifts.

55
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,092
Can I take you out for a round of golf?

56
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,218
Mmm, Pebble Beach is nice,

57
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,720
but I also enjoy golfing
in Thailand as well.

58
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,182
Hmm. Okay, let's go soon.

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,435
I'll schedule a tee time, then.

60
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,939
So you know,
you'll need to practice a lot…

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,484
if you want to win.

62
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,615
For sure.

63
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,493
Then let's make sure
to drink some good wine today.

64
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,619
It'll be on me.

65
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,538
It's this way.

66
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you nervous?

67
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,504
I put in a good word for you,
so you don't need to worry.

68
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,922
Mmm.

69
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,802
Mythology?

70
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,306
Why are we adding it
to the executive schedule?

71
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,641
I really don't know.

72
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,768
But Professor Cha
was really pushing for it.

73
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,688
He wants it as a lecture series.

74
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,108
Who is the instructor?
Which professor is it?

75
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,236
She's not a professor. An adjunct.

76
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821
Are you kidding me?

77
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,449
As department head,

78
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,784
why don't you make sure
we only present the very best?

79
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,163
How could I when Professor Cha
says he won't do it without her?

80
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,749
Shh!

81
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,792
Uh, what is it?

82
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,130
Uh, you two are together, I see.

83
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,175
This is the head
of our business department.

84
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,135
And over here,
Professor Jung Mi-jin.

85
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,846
I'm Seo Hye-seung.

86
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,600
Please take my name off the list.
I need some time to think about it.

87
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,479
What are you talking about?
Whether or not you're doing it?

88
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,898
It's just
I don't think our standards align.

89
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,777
Standards?

90
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,449
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,701
I didn't think Professor Jung
would be so opposed.

92
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,287
Do they actually want me here?

93
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,164
What?

94
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,917
I'm not a full-time professor,
and I haven't given many lectures.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,335
Did you pull a favor for me?

96
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,545
Hye-seung,
you're more than qualified for this.

97
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,048
You shouldn't think like that.

98
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,967
I met up with Lee Hyung-ju.

99
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,512
He was looking for some business advice.

100
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,930
From what I could tell,

101
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,349
Jin Yoo-hui and he
are getting along pretty well.

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,228
Would it be too hard to forget this woman?

103
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,688
I will never forget
what that woman has done to me.

104
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,149
Okay.

105
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,280
-Would you want to grab dinner tonight?
-Another day. See you soon.

106
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,544
Looks like your ride is here.
Please, get home safe.

107
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,882
Oh, I already told your driver
he could head on home.

108
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,635
What?

109
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,388
I was kind of hoping
that we could grab another drink.

110
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,266
My place has some good whiskey.

111
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,025
I'm sorry, but I can't go.

112
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,194
I have an important meeting
early in the morning.

113
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,446
Oh, is that so?

114
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,158
Come drive with me.
I can drop you off.

115
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,660
Not tonight. I'll take a taxi home.
Drive home safely.

116
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:36,789
Oh, it's really no trouble for me.
Come on, let me give you a ride home.

117
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,672
Hey, Jun-ho.

118
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,884
Why do you want to go
to medical school so badly?

119
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,927
I thought you'd want
to follow your dad's footsteps

120
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,596
and go to school
for business or engineering.

121
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,556
I want that too, sort of.

122
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,603
There's many people out with severe trauma
that have poor healthcare.

123
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,481
Because the more treatments they get,
the more money it costs.

124
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,941
I want to be able to change that
by becoming a doctor

125
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,359
and give back like my grandpa did.

126
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,153
So you want to be a doctor just like him?

127
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,112
Yeah.

128
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,907
He was a really great doctor. I swear.

129
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,242
But he died after getting sick

130
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,578
because he was taking care
of a lot of patients

131
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,413
in a village that didn't have any doctors.

132
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,290
He sounds like he was an incredible guy.

133
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,960
I think you've got a great heart, Jun-ho.

134
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,714
Let's work hard together
so that dream can come true.

135
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,133
Okay.

136
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,432
Can you please excuse us, sir?

137
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,649
Thank you for taking me back home.

138
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,610
I had a nice ride too.

139
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,448
That woman there…

140
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,996
She's my son Jun-ho's tutor.
Do you know her from somewhere?

141
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,581
She's a tutor now?

142
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,836
Don't you also recognize that woman
from the Rex party?

143
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,338
That's Ms. Athena.

144
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,882
Ms. Athena?

145
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:22,895
Huh.

146
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,314
I know I'd seen her before.

147
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,483
I guess she's got her eyes on you now.

148
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,485
What do you mean?

149
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,072
She has quite a reputation
for using rich men.

150
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,740
After seducing the men,

151
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,868
she takes their money
and threatens them to keep them silent.

152
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,705
Apparently, she's trapped a lot of guys.

153
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,833
And now she's tutoring?

154
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,004
Are you positive
she didn't approach you intentionally?

155
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,338
Should I look into it for you?

156
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,926
No, wait.

157
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,805
Should I have maybe
not told you about that?

158
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,807
No, no, no. Just get home safe.

159
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,429
You can go home now.

160
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,473
Thank you for tonight.

161
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,856
I'm sorry about that.
I should've kept better track of it.

162
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,032
What are you doing?

163
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,577
Didn't you come here
expecting something like this, Ms. Athena?

164
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,038
How do you know that name?

165
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,748
Because I was at the party as well.

166
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,377
Seriously.
You're acting like you didn't know?

167
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,338
Are you asking if I deliberately came here
because I knew you lived here?

168
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,175
Did Ms. Choi really ask you
to come and approach me like this?

169
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,010
I can't believe how rude you're being.

170
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,721
I won't try to find a reason
to stay and tutor at a place

171
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,598
that doesn't treat me with respect.

172
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,271
It's really okay. You can tell me.

173
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,357
That's why you took the job. Am I right?

174
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,320
Just as you are to Jun-ho, I'm as much
of a mother to my own daughter.

175
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,198
I would never do something
that would make my daughter ashamed of me.

176
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,701
Once Jun-ho's exams are over,
I'm done here.

177
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,045
-What do you think you're doing?
-Didn't I tell you to disappear?

178
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,465
Didn't I tell you that I never wanted
to talk to you again?

179
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,467
You're trying to get close
by going undercover as a tutor.

180
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,094
He needs to know
what kind of a person you really are.

181
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,306
Lee Hyung-ju is going to know
the entire truth about your past.

182
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,143
Didn't I tell you I'm totally different?

183
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,521
If you continue to piss me off,
do you know that I will bury you?

184
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,398
Try it. See what happens.

185
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,526
If I'm going down, I promise
that I'm taking you down with me.

186
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,072
You really think Lee Hyung-ju
would even listen to you?

187
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,366
Even if you cry
and tell him it's not true?

188
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,121
Honestly, do you think
he'd seriously believe anything you say?

189
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,626
So it was you, then.

190
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,753
You and your dirty lies.

191
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,172
Listen closely,
I'm only telling you once more.

192
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,803
Don't forget your husband raped me,
and I was his victim.

193
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,808
If you keep trying to go down this path,
I will sue you. So watch your back.

194
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,483
You and your daughter are not living
on the streets thanks to my kindness.

195
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,235
Don't forget, hmm?

196
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,421
Ms. Seo Hye-seung?

197
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:00,840
Yes.

198
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,009
Cha Seok-jin is a professor
in our department.

199
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,929
He just brought in Ms. Seo
as an adjunct professor.

200
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,182
It was pretty outrageous.

201
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,436
Tell me, how exactly
does Professor Cha know Ms. Seo?

202
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,272
They've been friends since college.

203
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,483
You have no idea how much
he takes care of her.

204
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,576
CEO OF HIBULL
CEO OF LIONSOFT

205
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,125
INVESTMENT AGREEMENT

206
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,044
Lionsoft has purchased 8.7 percent
of Hibull's shares,

207
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,838
becoming the second-largest shareholder.

208
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,982
You should recruit me
to join Howon.

209
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,066
Recruit?

210
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,027
What are you saying?

211
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,447
Well,
Howon is Hibull's legal advisor right now.

212
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:07,865
I'm…

213
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,994
I'm currently seeing Mr. Lee Hyung-ju.

214
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,078
Privately.

215
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,039
Oh. Really?

216
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,917
I'll be able to help with Mr. Lee,

217
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,836
and Howon and Hibull
will have an even stronger relationship

218
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,129
thanks to me.

219
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,048
Is that okay?

220
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,424
If you say so,

221
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,509
then I'll recruit you.

222
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,474
Ms. Choi.

223
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,977
I've been waiting
and have put my total trust in you.

224
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,188
But why is there still no progress?

225
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,274
Please, continue to wait patiently, ma'am.

226
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,069
If you want
to have a good daughter-in-law,

227
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,948
good things will only come
to those who learn to wait.

228
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,453
Fine, then.

229
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,872
This one has to be perfect.

230
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,541
Not only as a wife,
but also as a mother.

231
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,337
At first, I wanted to make sure
that both of them are happy, but now…

232
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,382
I just want
to find my grandchild a mother.

233
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,761
That's why I'm involved,
even if he's nearly an adult himself.

234
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,974
If this goes well,
I'll make sure you're rewarded well.

235
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:20,187
What can be more rewarding
than helping two people find each other?

236
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,826
Is that so?

237
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,536
I was getting worried

238
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,122
because you kept telling my daughter
to just wait.

239
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,332
But it seems like it's the right time.

240
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,670
The right time
is something only I get to decide.

241
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,754
So I see.

242
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,257
Just get them together,

243
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,136
and when that happens,
I'll release the land in Hanam

244
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,387
for your development.

245
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,148
How are your dates
with Ms. Jin going?

246
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,693
She's very passionate, you know?

247
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,403
For some reason,

248
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,739
my ears seem to be hearing
something that's lacking.

249
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,283
I don't know.

250
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,829
If that's the case, I may have

251
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,834
just found the next perfect match
for you to meet up with.

252
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,323
PRINCIPLE BEHIND TEA CEREMONY

253
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,285
Mr. Lee won't be the one
to make the first move,

254
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,496
so we'll need assistance from his mother.

255
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,749
Maybe sharing a hobby
will make her like you.

256
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,391
You do know that I'm never going
to trust a woman again.

257
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,103
They don't mean anything
more than sex to me.

258
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,105
What's the point
of meeting any of them?

259
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,024
I'm not asking you to try and find love.

260
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,234
You want sex?

261
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:34,363
That's something anyone in your position
should rightfully be able to enjoy.

262
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,574
However, there is such a thing
as branding for a CEO.

263
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,784
If you care about Hibull

264
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,286
and how it is valued
by the rest of the world,

265
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,247
then you will need to show off

266
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:47,626
a perfect wife to erase all that pain
from your first marriage,

267
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,170
and create the perfect picture
of a wholesome family.

268
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,339
Even if it is not real.

269
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,180
I'm saying you need a trophy
and not true love.

270
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,272
Come in.

271
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,860
What do you think?
Like the new view?

272
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,696
I absolutely love it.
Thank you so much for this.

273
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,990
I just booked our tee time.
I'll message you the info.

274
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:18,991
Thanks.

275
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,075
Oh!

276
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,661
Please don't tell Mr. Lee
about it, though. Surprise.

277
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,414
Surprise.

278
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,748
-I'll see ya.
-Thanks.

279
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:35,883
How are the preparations for Jung Mi-jin
and Lee Hyung-ju's date going?

280
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:40,262
The preparations must be thorough
because they are important members of Rex.

281
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,850
It's okay if it's not what we usually do.
Does anyone have any new ideas?

282
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,103
We could fill
the entire sky lounge with flowers

283
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,688
just like they do in rom-coms.

284
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:54,693
Or we should do something that makes
them feel comfortable around each other.

285
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,279
Something like a round of golf.

286
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,616
International Circuit.

287
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,826
Let's go ahead and reserve it.

288
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,246
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Hyung-ju.

289
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,850
Do you still think that you have a chance
at beating us today?

290
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,728
Do you really need
to practice that much? Seriously?

291
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,397
Oh hey! Over here.

292
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,358
-Oh hey.
-Wow, of course.

293
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,237
Where is Mr. Lee today?

294
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,739
Hyung-ju said something urgent came up
and had to bail.

295
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,741
He said he'll be here next time.

296
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,536
Hey, this is lawyer Jin Yoo-hui.

297
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,916
Let's get it going.

298
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,547
By the way,
how do you know Professor Cha?

299
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,341
I just happened to meet him recently.

300
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,927
He's a really impressive man, I believe.

301
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,723
I heard he was an advisor

302
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,475
for a big international consulting group
when he was in the States.

303
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,353
He told me that he's giving a series
of lectures for entrepreneurs soon.

304
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,272
I look forward to checking it out.

305
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,774
-Do you mean the Executive Courses?
-Yeah.

306
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,070
I actually teach there as well.

307
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,613
Oh.

308
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,410
I had a lot of fun today thanks to you.

309
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,079
Racing was so much fun
I didn't notice that time flew by.

310
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,414
If you've got time,

311
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,125
would you like to grab a drink somewhere?

312
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,047
Another day.
I've got a lot going on tomorrow.

313
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,407
Jun-ho,
good luck on your exams.

314
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,825
You've got this! Good luck!

315
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,371
Hey Min-ji, drink this before you go.

316
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,501
I'm quitting that tutoring job.

317
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,545
-Really?
-Because

318
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,422
I just want to focus on caring for you.

319
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,261
Did you have a nice time
yesterday evening?

320
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,389
Yeah, I had a good time with her.

321
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,599
Ms. Jung is a business professor,

322
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:16,019
so I imagine that you two
must have had quite a bit in common.

323
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:20,482
She's professional like you
and incredibly intelligent.

324
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,611
Intelligent women will be able to give you
a sense of stability and trust.

325
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,446
Those are some of the important qualities

326
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,491
that a successful businessman's wife
should have, you know?

327
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,912
Do you have any intention
of continuing to see her?

328
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,872
Just like you said so,

329
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,709
she wouldn't be
a terrible trophy wife for me.

330
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,670
Hey, Mom.

331
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,424
I think he likes me.
He wants to see me again.

332
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,008
'That's good to hear.

333
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,637
I'll arrange a meeting
with Congressman Son soon.

334
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,393
The two of them
looked really great together.

335
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,812
Oh, is that so?

336
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,232
I quite like her myself.
She seems like a nice young lady.

337
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,650
It's great that she's a professor.

338
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,279
I'm sure she'll be a good mother
to your grandson as well.

339
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,615
Middle school really is when children need
to be around their mothers.

340
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,909
It's a very vulnerable period
of childhood.

341
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:17,664
At the moment, all we have is a tutor
who's been working very hard with Jun-ho,

342
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,126
-but that's quite different from a mother.
-You got him a private tutor?

343
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:25,464
A family like yours should take
special consideration when hiring anyone.

344
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,717
You'll need to keep an eye on her,
especially if she's unmarried, you know?

345
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,886
Oh, I won't need to worry about that.

346
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,222
Although, Ms. Seo is recently widowed,

347
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,101
she has shown nothing but kindness
for my family.

348
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,437
Well, she graduated from Hankuk

349
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,772
and now teaches
at the academy in Daechi-dong.

350
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,858
I promise you, she's a very good teacher.

351
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,320
I'm sorry, but what was her name again?

352
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,530
Oh. Seo Hye-seung.

353
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,288
You must be hungry.
Let's start eating, ma'am.

354
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,332
Yes, let's.

355
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,845
Going anywhere?
Not out to tutor, I hope.

356
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,558
Life just can't seem to work out
the way you want it to, can it?

357
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,644
Not sure.

358
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,689
I'm still deciding if today is the day
that I tell him the truth about you.

359
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,607
Is that okay?

360
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,567
And what makes you think he'd believe you?

361
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,444
Should I try to see if he will anyways?

362
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,781
This is my last warning.
Be sure to think it over.

363
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,367
Because I will make sure
to take everything from you.

364
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,410
Your threats will not work on me.

365
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,008
Do it.

366
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,302
Get it ready to go on the market.

367
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,181
-Oh my goodness.
-Thank you, Grandma.

368
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,434
Oh, welcome, Ms. Seo.

369
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,852
Hello.

370
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,272
Take a look.

371
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,148
100
KOREAN FINAL EXAM

372
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:09,901
Wow.

373
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,032
Thank you for all your hard work.

374
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,867
Oh.

375
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,081
I never doubted you for a second.
I'm so proud of you.

376
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:27,043
My mom would be really surprised.
This is the best I've ever done in Korean.

377
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,713
Why don't you tell your mother the news?

378
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:32,924
Why?

379
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,554
My dad. I really don't want to betray him.

380
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,891
How are you betraying him?
You each have your own lives, right?

381
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,936
Even if your dad doesn't like your mother,
you're allowed your own choice.

382
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,563
Right, but--

383
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,315
It's a relationship made by destiny.

384
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,359
It means it's one that will last forever.

385
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,863
So even if you end up
doing something wrong,

386
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,364
everything will be forgiven,

387
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,700
and you'll always continue
to love each other.

388
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,667
Oh!

389
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,835
Ms. Seo.

390
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,005
Please join us.
I've just finished making dinner.

391
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,215
I need to go. I'm sorry, but…

392
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,761
today's lesson
will be my last one with Jun-ho.

393
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,555
Thank you for having me here.

394
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,891
But Ms. Seo.

395
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,394
Ms. Seo, why so sudden?
Why are you leaving us now?

396
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:31,191
I had agreed with Mr. Lee to tutor Jun-ho
only until his exams had finished.

397
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,904
Jun-ho, I'm rooting for you, okay?

398
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,072
Please take care.

399
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,218
Why do you think
you can make her quit

400
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,928
when I'm the one who hired her?

401
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,472
It's bad enough
that Jun-ho doesn't have a mother,

402
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,933
but he finally started
to accept her as his teacher.

403
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,476
Why did you make her quit, huh?

404
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,689
Why did you do that?

405
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,732
What did Ms. Seo do
that it was that bad, huh?

406
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,318
I promise I'll get
a better tutor than her.

407
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,195
Never. No.

408
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,823
There's no other teacher
that gets me like Ms. Seo.

409
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,243
How is she the only teacher that gets you?
Why do you like her that much?

410
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,994
Our souls just understand each other.

411
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,788
What? Soul?

412
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,540
Well…

413
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,084
I just feel comfortable like with Mom.

414
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,422
It's not like you'll get it
even if I tell you.

415
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,883
It's whatever. Just bring her back, okay?

416
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,188
Do you know Seo Hye-seung?

417
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,817
Oh, you two have met?

418
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,570
She's a friend from college.

419
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,072
Oh, I see now.

420
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,410
But why did you act
like you didn't know her at all?

421
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,579
That's because…

422
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,290
she's not the type
to go to a place like that.

423
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,208
What do you mean by that?

424
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,295
She's too busy raising her daughter
on her own.

425
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,172
She doesn't have time to date.

426
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,632
She only joined Rex
because her mother signed her up.

427
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,051
And apparently, she…

428
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,680
…she came
to the party because…

429
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,893
she had something to say,
not because she wanted a husband.

430
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,324
Hey, Mom, I've got groceries.

431
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,284
Ah, hey, you're back.

432
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,787
Oh thanks.

433
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,624
Look at these chives. They look so fresh.

434
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,542
Oh yeah.

435
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,544
Hi, who is this?

436
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,008
Eviction?

437
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,636
What do you mean?

438
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,514
What's going on?
You're being evicted?

439
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,516
How can you ask us
to just leave without notice?

440
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,267
Where are we supposed to go?

441
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,520
No, I need my security deposit now,

442
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,522
or I'm not going to be able
to find anywhere else.

443
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,441
How can you seriously demand
that we leave without the deposit?

444
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,486
-Are you there?
-Mom, are we getting kicked out?

445
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,739
This is complete nonsense.
They can't evict you without notice.

446
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,324
Mom!

447
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:31,120
I'll take care of it.
You don't need to worry.

448
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,542
LAW FIRM HYOSEONG

449
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,169
-Ms. Jin Yoo-hui ordered it?
-Yes.

450
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,256
How can she just take our house
and sell it like that?

451
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,382
With what authority?

452
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,009
Look here.

453
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,555
She ordered a provisional seizure
under her company’s name.

454
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,642
If you want to take care of this,
then Ms. Jin needs to undo it herself.

455
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,322
Are you done thinking things over?

456
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,824
Come in.

457
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,452
Take a seat.

458
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:30,889
And so,

459
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,099
what's the problem?

460
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:37,729
I came here because I never got the chance
to respond to what you said.

461
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,231
Which was?

462
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,734
When you said you'd file
for legal compensation

463
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,737
against what my husband
allegedly did to you.

464
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,201
So you're finally starting to realize
the tricky position you're in?

465
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,287
Let's say, hypothetically,
you were to get sued

466
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,331
in addition to losing your house,

467
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,042
how can you live with Min-ji?

468
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,669
You are right. I'd lose her.

469
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,465
So it's time to stop messing with me
and just quietly disappear.

470
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,051
Only then will I make the lawsuit go away.

471
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,554
Go on, file it.

472
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,515
Say that again.

473
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,186
Back then, nobody would listen
to what my husband had to say,

474
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,939
because even I hated him so much.

475
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:25,944
But now I finally get
what you really meant that day.

476
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,821
Saying that I gave up too quickly.

477
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,659
So I'm not giving up this time.

478
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,077
Even with the lawsuit.

479
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,828
Not until I win.

480
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,249
Not until the whole world knows the truth.

481
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,627
I'm seeing this through until the end.

482
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,597
Think about it carefully.

483
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,685
Think about all…

484
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,524
that your husband and I have ever…

485
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,321
done in this house together.

486
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,623
Oh!

487
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,542
Hey, what are you doing? Huh?

488
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,387
You're…

489
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,723
the devil.

490
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,730
Yeah, I probably am.

491
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,401
What are you gonna do about it?

492
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,655
Even if I won't be able to kill you…

493
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,409
I promise I can make you wish
you were dead.

494
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,038
Watch out.

495
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,638
Hey, come back here.

496
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,969
INCOMING CALL

497
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,718
How are you?
Please, come this way.

498
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,184
I was a bit harsh to you, wasn't I?

499
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,355
I was very rude to you the other day.

500
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,691
I'm so sorry.

501
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,236
It's just I have a hard time
trusting other people.

502
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,821
Women, particularly.

503
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:02,160
I think I may have misjudged you before.
Please forgive me.

504
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,206
When you told me
that you wouldn't do anything

505
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,625
that your daughter would be ashamed of,

506
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,170
that really resonated with me,
to be honest.

507
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,212
Oh.

508
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,840
You could even say

509
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,384
my only son Jun-ho
is like my Achilles' heel.

510
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:23,431
It seems he's really
taken quite a liking to you.

511
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,434
Even though I'm his father,
I keep upsetting him.

512
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,147
I know I have no right,

513
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:35,651
but I would really like it
if you came back just for Jun-ho at least.

514
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,570
Please come back, Ms. Seo.

515
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,448
I'll think about it.

516
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,035
Yeah.

517
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,370
Please, go ahead and eat.

518
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,922
SEO HYE-SEUNG

519
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,511
Why did I even have to come over here?

520
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,645
Why are you here?

521
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,440
Are you here for apartment 302?

522
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,944
Uh, my friend lives in apartment 302.

523
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,821
But I guess she's not here now.
So go ahead.

524
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,491
302 is where I live.

525
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,077
Are you a friend of my mom's?

526
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:27,870
Your mom?

527
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,001
Oh, I see it.

528
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,462
You're practically your mother's twin,
you know? Min-ji?

529
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,257
Yeah, I'm Kang Min-ji.

530
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,844
But how can you prove
that you're really my mom’s friend?

531
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,096
Just a second.

532
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,599
Your mother and I
went to college together.

533
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,310
Look here, now we work together.

534
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,480
HANKUK UNIVERSITY
PROFESSOR CHA SEOK-JIN

535
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,731
Cha Seok-jin?

536
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,317
Uh-huh, Professor.
Professor Cha.

537
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,570
It doesn't seem
like you've had dinner yet.

538
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,657
If you're okay with it,
we can go and get something tasty.

539
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,493
Mmm, of course!

540
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,958
What were you planning on saying
at the party?

541
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,085
I'm curious.

542
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,005
Didn't you want everyone
in the room to hear it?

543
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,215
So tell me now.

544
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,384
I'd like to know what it was.

545
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,971
So one day,

546
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,641
my husband asked me for a divorce.

547
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,145
He was seeing someone else.

548
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,565
He even went as far as covering up crimes
that she had committed.

549
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,860
He was completely devoted to her.

550
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,822
But when the company faced an audit,

551
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,951
it wasn't enough for her
to put the blame on my husband,

552
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,162
she also

553
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,623
accused him of being a rapist.

554
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,837
And since he was driven
to the edge of a cliff,

555
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,881
my husband made a drastic choice.

556
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,472
So I guess
he couldn't forgive himself either

557
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,683
for loving someone

558
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,186
who could be that ruthless.

559
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:17,938
That woman…

560
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,985
was she at the party that night?

561
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:24,945
Who is she?

562
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,866
Honestly, until yesterday,

563
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:34,330
all I ever wanted to do
was tell the world about her.

564
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,626
But today, I've changed my mind.

565
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,586
But why?

566
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,632
That won't ever be enough for her.

567
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,804
She took everything from me
and my daughter.

568
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,140
It can't just end that easily for her.

569
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,020
So when I see that she's at her happiest,

570
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,232
I will destroy her.

571
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,530
Until that happens,
I won't tell anyone the truth.

572
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,038
Must be hard to carry that alone, Ms. Seo.

573
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,083
For me, after my wife's affair,

574
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,960
the pain slowly disappeared
as time went by.

575
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,963
Being lonely
is actually a lot more bearable

576
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,133
when I'm outside
surrounded by nature like this.

577
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,848
Do people that have everything
really feel lonely?

578
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,062
Even though I have everything…

579
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,109
I still don't have anyone.

580
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,128
Leave us, please.

581
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,469
I heard that Mr. Lee went on a blind date.

582
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,346
While it's nice to try,

583
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,141
what's the point
of having him meet with other girls

584
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,101
when I'm the only one
who already has his heart?

585
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,979
Do you really think that ring was a gift?

586
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,149
I'm a little disappointed

587
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,319
by what you thought
that night really meant.

588
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,655
If there really wasn't
a special connection between us,

589
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,408
we would have just
said our goodbyes and left.

590
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,912
Leaving a strong impression
gave me a chance to something more.

591
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,498
So then, you shouldn't
have accepted the ring, Ms. Jin.

592
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,001
You're not as patient
as I expected you to be.

593
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,085
I'm disappointed in you.

594
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,883
I'm thinking that the ring might have been
some kind of test of sorts.

595
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,261
I know what I'm doing
when it comes to Mr. Lee,

596
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,096
so I don't need you to get into my head.

597
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,766
I think you need to focus
and start paying more attention

598
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,226
to what Ms. Seo has been up to.

599
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,270
I hear that she's been
getting pretty close to him.

600
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,023
That she's been coming
and going as she likes.

601
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,359
Seo Hye-seung
has been properly taken care of.

602
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,735
I promise you.

603
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,282
So you don't need to worry about her.

604
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,133
Think of this as a way to show my thanks.

605
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,846
I really can't. I've gotten more
than enough from your mother.

606
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,140
This is really for Jun-ho,
so please take it.

607
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,017
Please drive her back to her place.

608
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,688
No, I can't. I'll just take your thanks.

609
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,022
Thank you so much.

610
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,656
JIN YOO-HUI: CAN WE MEET?
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU

611
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,180
MR. LEE HYUNG-JU

612
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,731
Hi, Mr. Lee.

613
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,692
Ms. Seo, I'm sorry to bother you,

614
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,070
but Jun-ho's missing
and might be on his way to see you.

615
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,196
What?

616
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,115
If you see him,
let me know, and I'll send over a driver.

617
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:24,870
I'll be sure to talk with Jun-ho.
Try not to worry too much.

618
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,246
Bye.

619
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,882
Mr. Lee.

620
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,178
-A Ms. Jin Yoo-hui has arrived to see you.
-Now?

621
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:42,763
What should I tell her?

622
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,768
Okay, you can let her in.

623
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,103
Yes, sir.

624
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,408
Jun-ho!

625
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,588
Can I ask what you're doing here so late?

626
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,716
Because you seem to forgot
how to use your phone.

627
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,801
Oh.

628
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,928
I'm sorry,
I must have forgotten to text you back.

629
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,597
Please, come in. Have a seat.

630
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,277
I only accepted this
because I thought it was a gift,

631
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,739
but I guess I was a little naive.

632
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:47,870
If this was meant to be a payment,
then I respectfully refuse.

633
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,340
I can't believe
just how obscenely arrogant you are.

634
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,509
Do you think that I'm someone
who needs to be tested

635
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,927
to see if I'm after your money?

636
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,721
That's a little harsh, don't you think?

637
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,809
If I said it's a gift,
you should accept it as a gift.

638
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,979
Why are you interpreting it
as something malicious?

639
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,355
Because Mr. Lee.

640
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,818
I know you like things black and white,
so let me set this straight for you.

641
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,114
Since the very beginning,
I've never been interested in you.

642
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,243
Ms. Choi kept recommending,
so I thought I would just meet you,

643
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,246
but it seems you don't even have
the smallest ounce of respect for others.

644
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,415
So listen to me very carefully.

645
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,626
I had a good time that night
because I wanted to.

646
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,835
Not 'cause of you, it was me.

647
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,213
And now,

648
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,342
it's going to be me
that ends all of this. You get me?

649
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,186
What made you come out here?

650
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,605
You told your dad
you were staying at my house?

651
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,944
Come on, tell me.
Something's going on with you, right?

652
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,947
I finally talked to my mom
about my grade in Korean.

653
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,741
She said come over to visit her apartment.

654
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,495
Oh yeah? That's good to hear.
So are you coming back from your mother's?

655
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,748
Why?

656
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,999
It seems like…

657
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,795
that she's living
a pretty good life on her own.

658
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:26,426
"She's getting along fine without me,"
I just keep telling myself that, you know?

659
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,847
So I don't have to see her.

660
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,604
How about we go and get something to eat?

661
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,816
That's okay.
I just want to go home and play games.

662
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,651
Hmm.

663
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,502
Thank you for the ride.

664
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,672
It's no trouble.
Please call me if you ever need to talk.

665
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:04,631
Okay.

666
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,217
Ms. Seo.

667
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,428
Yeah?

668
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,434
Don't you ever start to get lonely

669
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,270
drinking by yourself?

670
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,069
Can I get you a glass of wine?

671
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,863
What would you like?

672
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,115
Mmm…

673
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,868
I can go pick one.

674
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,963
You know, since we just broke up…

675
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,760
why don't we just be friends?

676
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,598
Drinking buddies.

677
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,518
Well, it would seem
we have similar tastes in wine.

678
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,270
Yeah.

679
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,273
Let's be drinking buddies.

680
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,945
-Ms. Seo, just play one round, please?
-What?

681
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,237
I swear I'll go easy on you.

682
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,782
Fine, but you can't ask me
to go easy on you.

683
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,995
When I was in elementary school,
I basically lived at the arcade with Dad.

684
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,331
-Oh really?
-Yeah, it was so much fun.
