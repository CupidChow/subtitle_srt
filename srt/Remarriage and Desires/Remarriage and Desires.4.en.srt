1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,134
All right, next.

2
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,054
Goddess of wisdom, Ms. Athena.

3
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,446
Hye-seung.

4
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,497
Hello.

5
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,667
I teach students for a living.

6
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:49,007
And I have a special reason
for coming here tonight.

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,304
I wanted to tell you the truth
about something I went through.

8
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,140
Something that happened to me.

9
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,813
And to tell you all about the woman…

10
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,610
who took everything from me.

11
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,617
That woman is--

12
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,412
Are you crazy?

13
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:20,955
Why are you here?

14
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,291
What's it to you?
I'm allowed to be here too.

15
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,127
Who do you think you are,
coming to an event like this?

16
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,796
Are you seducing other men?

17
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,007
If I seduce other men or not,
what does that have to do with you?

18
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,551
Who do you think you are, my husband?

19
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,222
We wouldn't be divorced
if you hadn't cheated on me. Am I right?

20
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,891
And who's the one
who cheated first, you son of a bitch?

21
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,059
-Son of a bitch?
-Hey!

22
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,648
Hey! Come here.

23
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,941
Kim Bin!

24
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,110
-Let go.
-What, are you a thug?

25
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,319
Get lost!

26
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,863
Is this how you treat
your members? I wanna see the CEO.

27
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,573
-Come on, man.
-Hey, Kim Bin.

28
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,866
Let go, asshole!

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,828
-Sir, you can't act like this here.
-What do you want? Come at me!

30
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,787
You okay?

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,581
Masks allow everyone
to be free.

32
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,959
-Kim Bin!
-Excuse me, sir, here.

33
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,961
Lies and desire

34
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,381
…all become the truth

35
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,552
behind the single layer of a mask.

36
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,520
Hye-seung,

37
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,148
you look beautiful tonight.

38
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,406
Would you like to have a cup of tea
with me tomorrow?

39
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,867
Meet me at my office?

40
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,254
Hey, wait up.

41
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,934
Hyung-ju,
we're going to Jin-su's place.

42
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,310
Damn, man.

43
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,603
You're all right.

44
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,898
Is this what you call being thorough?

45
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,442
You didn't even run
a proper background check.

46
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,446
I did,
I just didn't realize they were married.

47
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,365
They didn't mention
that kind of thing earlier.

48
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,866
Oh, is that your excuse?

49
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,785
Ms. Hwang.

50
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,707
Who were the managers in charge tonight?

51
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,922
Thank you for all of your hard work today.

52
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:48,473
How did Ms. Seo even know to come?
You said she wouldn't be there.

53
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,351
There's nobody
who could've invited her

54
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,477
other than Ms. Choi.

55
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,574
Choi Yoo-sun?

56
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,329
Wait, what?
How does something like that happen?

57
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,664
Ugh, I should have gone with you!

58
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,919
I should have gone and just grabbed
that bitch by the hair like this.

59
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,756
I'm going to see Ms. Choi tomorrow.

60
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,595
And I'm going to tell her
what Jin- Yoo-hui is like.

61
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,808
-What she did to us.
-Yeah. Good idea.

62
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,895
You go tomorrow
and tell her everything.

63
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,901
Wow, look at you guys.

64
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,362
If only it weren't for that mess…

65
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:50,034
…I'd be in some hotel room right now
making love to Selena for the fourth time.

66
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,702
-You're such a dumbass.
-Ah!

67
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,497
Hey, you know that Aphrodite?

68
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,999
She's the opposition lawyer
for the trial I'm on right now.

69
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,086
Junior lawyer.
It totally caught me off guard.

70
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,506
How can a lawyer be so sexy, huh?
She's so damn hot.

71
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,801
You know how awful she is in court?
She uses her looks on the judges.

72
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,179
Oh man. I love girls who do that. Come on.

73
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,474
-Oh please.
-Who are you gonna pick? That Hera? Hera?

74
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,018
Yeah, she seemed all right.

75
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,480
Oh my god. I just got a text from Rex.

76
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,440
VOTING INSTRUCTIONS

77
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,776
-Who are you guys gonna pick?
-I don't know. You?

78
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,819
I pick…

79
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,613
all of them.

80
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,242
That way I have a better chance, right?

81
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,702
Hyung-ju, what about you, huh?

82
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,872
I'm not sure.

83
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,348
Now that you say that,
It reminds of my ex-boyfriend.

84
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,642
He left suddenly to study abroad.

85
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,395
I felt so betrayed by him.

86
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,232
Even at the end,
he should have said goodbye.

87
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:17,538
SEO HYE-SEUNG

88
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,559
This car is awesome!
Wow, listen to that engine!

89
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,811
Thanks, Jung-in.

90
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,146
So you'll stop whining?

91
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,942
You think that was about a car?
You went to a hotel with some other guy.

92
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,153
Are you jealous? Huh?

93
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,239
Did you sleep with him?

94
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,491
Mmm.

95
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,284
What? You really did?

96
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,787
Oh.

97
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,544
-Hey, pull over.
-There?

98
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,796
It's right by the road.

99
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,471
That's what makes it fun.

100
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,113
Jun-ho, are you asleep?

101
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,412
Can you even breathe under there?

102
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,839
When will this poor boy get a mother
to take care of him?

103
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,635
What's the use in having all that money
or a house as big as a stadium

104
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,014
when it's just as cold as ice?

105
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,625
Babe, hold on! Hyung-ju!

106
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,632
DIVORCE REGISTRATION

107
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,383
Look at the next page.

108
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,012
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

109
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,515
I've done everything I could.
Don't try to get more.

110
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:46,771
How could you just do this to me
without even talking to me about it.

111
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,772
Talk about what?

112
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,607
Was it good with that bastard?

113
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,359
You were the one who made me lonely.

114
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,153
You spent half the year
out of the country.

115
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,656
When you were here,
you were always working.

116
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,991
Did it ever occur to you
that you made me like this?

117
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,076
So what?

118
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,707
Forgive me.

119
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,585
I gave you plenty of time.
You shouldn't have taken it so far!

120
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,337
I really messed up.

121
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,214
Forgive me this once.

122
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,424
What's even left for me
to forgive at this point?

123
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,093
I've decided to just let you go.

124
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,929
Go out and be together
with anyone you want. I don't care.

125
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,681
That's how you wanted to live anyway.

126
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,767
Sure.

127
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,144
I've always been this kind of a woman.

128
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,023
I was so lonely every night
I'd just wander.

129
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,733
I couldn't help myself, could I?

130
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,654
Now if there's anything else,
tell it to Ho-chan.

131
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,339
Excuse me, ma'am.

132
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,175
Hey, what's going on?

133
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,971
I hear Hermes is the Super Black Member,
not Zeus. Is that true?

134
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,015
-Who said that?
-Uh, well, you know, people.

135
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,559
Is that what everyone thinks?

136
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,311
I guess I'm the only one.

137
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,482
Do you have any idea who Hermes picked?

138
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,359
I don't know.

139
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,987
I'll keep it a secret.

140
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,824
-I still don't know.
-Wait…

141
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,828
Did you check?

142
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,996
Yes, I checked.

143
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,583
And I'm positive that Mr. Hermes
was really the Super Black Member.

144
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,460
Okay, so who did he pick?

145
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,503
I'm afraid I didn't get the name,

146
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,756
but he definitely picked someone.

147
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,675
Who is that person?

148
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,676
Yeah.

149
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,095
What?

150
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,265
What do you mean Zeus didn't pick me?

151
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,727
But why? I'm the complete package.

152
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,021
CHOI YOO-SUN

153
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:58,986
Ms. Choi.

154
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,703
Here are the results
from the members' choices yesterday.

155
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,541
They aren't what I expected either.

156
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,212
Why did he pick Seo Hye-seung
over all the women who've never married?

157
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,088
LEE HYUNG-JU (HERMES)
ATHENA (SEO HYE-SEUNG)

158
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,050
Once he knows her background,
he won't lay up with her.

159
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,384
Probably not.

160
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,471
Because people all feel the same way.

161
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:30,100
Everyone says
they value love overall but look.

162
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,936
ZEUS, ZEUS, ZEUS

163
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,899
I guess it's just human nature.

164
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,858
Ms. Choi.

165
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,738
When you told me to change
the IDs for Zeus and Hermes,

166
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,407
I thought you did it
to support Jung Mi-jin.

167
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,284
But I don't see why

168
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,995
she didn't pick Mr. Hermes
for herself, though.

169
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,589
So are you saying I shouldn't pick him?

170
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,633
Why not?

171
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:06,887
Because a relationship with a man
is a long-term affair.

172
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,849
Then why did you tell me
to show him some kindness?

173
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,226
Kindness that's more genuine than others

174
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,562
has the power
to create a sense of stability.

175
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,399
That sense will eventually break down
the barriers to his heart.

176
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,109
Naturally, of course.

177
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,196
If you want something,
you must first take a step back.

178
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,666
Professor Jung.

179
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,134
Wow.

180
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,178
Queen of the gods, Hera.

181
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,146
STAFF CONTACT INFORMATION
SEO HYE-SEUNG

182
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,481
ADJUNCT PROFESSOR
MAJOR: KOREAN LITERATURE

183
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,579
Hello? This is Choi Yoo-sun.

184
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,248
I have the results from yesterday's votes.

185
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,085
I was wondering if we could meet up
and talk for a bit.

186
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,756
Excellent. Then I'll see you soon.

187
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,386
Who are you going to recommend for him?

188
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,020
Ma'am, Ms. Seo Hye-seung
is here to see you.

189
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,897
Tell her to come in.

190
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,115
Welcome back.

191
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,826
Please, sit.

192
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,507
It seems that at the event last night,

193
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,718
you weren't just there
to simply enjoy the party, Ms. Seung.

194
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,847
Didn't you invite me there

195
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,558
because there was something
you wanted to know?

196
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,145
All right, let's hear your story.

197
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,821
That woman and my husband
were having an affair.

198
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,742
She was a lawyer at his company.

199
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,913
They worked together,
but she was embezzling money.

200
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,331
And to cover it up,

201
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,418
that woman seduced my husband.

202
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,212
I guess she fooled him completely

203
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,510
because he told me he wanted a divorce
so he could live with her instead.

204
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,848
But, of course…

205
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,728
once she realized
she was about to get caught,

206
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,024
she blamed all of her crimes
on my husband

207
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,402
and claimed that he had raped her.

208
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,575
My husband committed suicide.

209
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,955
Then, not long ago,

210
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,624
I just happened to run into her.

211
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,252
Here.

212
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,630
The woman standing right next to you.

213
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,299
Jin Yoo-hui.

214
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,218
So what?

215
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,764
What exactly is the problem here?

216
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,060
Do you think that a woman like that
is qualified to be here?

217
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,645
How could you possibly recommend her
to be someone's wife?

218
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:48,192
At Rex, our legal team runs
meticulous background checks on everyone.

219
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,320
If there are no legal disqualifications,
I have no reason to kick her out.

220
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,238
That woman is a murderer.

221
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,244
You think your husband
was stolen from you?

222
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,415
Do you ever think that, maybe,
you failed to keep him?

223
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,169
Don't you think kicking her out
is the ethical thing to do?

224
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,422
Okay, fine. Let's say I do kick her out.

225
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,928
At the moment, there are more
than 800 marriage agencies in the country.

226
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,181
Are you going to continue
to chase her from all of them?

227
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,562
Listen to me.

228
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,066
You need to get stronger.

229
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,985
No matter what it costs you.

230
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,824
Strong enough to keep
the entire world under your foot.

231
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,125
After all,

232
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,670
isn't that the best revenge?

233
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,145
One day

234
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,314
your words are going
to come back to haunt you.

235
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,405
Well, then. I'll be waiting.

236
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,420
Back again?

237
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,591
Are you here for a repeat
of the masquerade?

238
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,720
You look like you just filed
a lawsuit or something.

239
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,264
How'd it go? Feel better?

240
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,850
I have already told you.

241
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,813
Now matter how much you try to threaten me
and follow my every move,

242
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,065
the whole world is on my side.

243
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,277
Even if that's true, there's one thing
that even you can't deny.

244
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,113
No matter what you do, or where you go,

245
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,449
you'll never be able to get rid of me.

246
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,577
We're going to be together forever.

247
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,245
Until one of us is dead.

248
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,748
That won't bring your dead husband back.

249
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,007
Do whatever you want.

250
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,052
Maybe we'll even be friends.

251
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,318
Hello, Ms. Choi.

252
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,073
Yesterday was rough, wasn't it?

253
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,659
Welcome.

254
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,994
Can I help you with something?

255
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,083
I'm so thankful to you for throwing
the masquerade party all for me.

256
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,543
Oh.

257
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,296
I just saw Ms. Seo
as she was making her way out of here.

258
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,466
Seems like our fates are tied.

259
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,428
I hope Ms. Seo can find a good man
for herself soon.

260
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,931
I just hope that she can find happiness.

261
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,102
I saw that the man you picked
was Mr. Hermes

262
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,813
It was.

263
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,024
I followed him around
the entire time, but…

264
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,444
I don't think it made enough
of an impression.

265
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,738
Ms. Choi.

266
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,741
I put the power in your hands.

267
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,744
From here on out,

268
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,956
I ensure that you'll get a share
of everything I stand to gain.

269
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,794
Wouldn't it be such a shame
to give that up?

270
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,643
So then, who is Mr. Hermes
going to be matched with?

271
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,897
It's likely that you
will be the one who's recommended for him.

272
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,899
I was under the impression
that Ms. Aphrodite

273
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,776
would be the strongest competitor, though.

274
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,363
Ms. Choi isn't planning to recommend her.

275
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:04,948
Why not?

276
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,368
Because out of all the contenders,

277
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,662
you're the perfect candidate
for a potential wife.

278
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,583
And what happens
if Mr. Hermes keeps insisting on her?

279
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,126
I wouldn't worry about that.

280
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,587
In my 20 years of experience,

281
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,674
members at that level are never interested
in meeting the women with children.

282
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:47,366
I'm so sorry. I know you went out
of your way to attend the event that day.

283
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,744
Aw, it's fine. I actually had fun.

284
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,456
It felt like I was in the world
of Greek mythology.

285
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,376
It was definitely
a new experience for me.

286
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,503
It's very kind of you to say that.

287
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:04,216
So, I did see that your choice
for the evening was Ms. Athena.

288
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,426
Was there something about her
that caught your interest?

289
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,971
Oh, well, I've always been partial
to the goddess of wisdom.

290
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,226
Also, I'm quite curious
to hear the rest of her life story.

291
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,685
I'm so sorry,

292
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,523
but Ms. Athena did not list you
as one of her choices.

293
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,024
Oh, really?

294
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,486
She's also 41 and has a child.

295
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,115
-Ms. Athena has a child?
-Indeed.

296
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,368
But there is one woman
who named you as her choice.

297
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,287
Oh!

298
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,123
Hera, right?

299
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,877
Well, I'm afraid
I have more bad news for you then.

300
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,047
Ms. Hera has forfeited.

301
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,925
Oh okay, I see.

302
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,720
That's such a shame, though.
She was acting so nice to me.

303
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,889
So, who is it?

304
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,392
It was Ms. Aphrodite who picked you.

305
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,351
Huh?

306
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,939
But we didn't get along at all.
Are you sure she really picked me?

307
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,776
Wow, now that's a twist.

308
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,696
She's a lawyer, right?

309
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:13,326
Thirty-five years old, never married.
She's on the legal team at a corporation.

310
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,495
She graduated
from a decent law school in Seoul.

311
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,706
-Her parents are divorced…
-Mmm.

312
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,417
…and her mother owns a bakery
just outside of Seoul.

313
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,295
Of course,
she may not be the perfect candidate,

314
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,755
but as you saw that night,

315
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,717
she's a very attractive woman
who garnered the most votes

316
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,343
from all of the male members.

317
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,473
It's just so strange, though. Isn't it?

318
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,392
One of them was so kind
but didn't even bother to pick me.

319
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,729
And the one who did,
gave me the cold shoulder.

320
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,648
Just when I thought I understood
what women wanted.

321
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,027
But the most important thing
is your choice, sir.

322
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,989
If you wish,
I'll be more than happy to connect you

323
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,575
with absolutely any woman
of your choosing.

324
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,122
Tell me who you would like to see.

325
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,710
I would like to meet with Ms. Aphrodite.

326
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,465
Very well. I'll be in touch very soon
to set up a date for you.

327
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,511
Goodbye.

328
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:13,929
Also…

329
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,059
there is one more person
who I'd really like to meet as well.

330
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,604
Someone who made the biggest impression
on me at the masquerade.

331
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,565
And who would that person be, sir?

332
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,527
That'd be Mr. Zeus.

333
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,329
Arrange a date for him with Jin Yoo-hui.

334
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,540
Oh.What a surprise.

335
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,125
And finish up with Seo Hye-seung quickly.

336
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,364
To what do I owe this honor?

337
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,782
The Rex secret party.

338
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,617
I was there too.

339
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,918
Are you disappointed?

340
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,091
I never imagined that you would be there.

341
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,052
Did you…

342
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,221
get divorced?

343
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,600
I was widowed.

344
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,853
I'm sorry.

345
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,650
I asked around.
They said you were an adjunct.

346
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,735
Do you do anything else?

347
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,237
I teach at a prep school.

348
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,743
-Is there anything I can help with--
-No, nothing. I can support myself.

349
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,416
What…

350
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,712
were you going to say
to everyone that night?

351
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,800
I can't stop wondering
what's happened all these years.

352
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,264
Okay.

353
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,184
You don't have to tell me about it.

354
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,393
That night,

355
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,606
I noticed Aphrodite
was hanging around you.

356
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,067
Are you interested in her?

357
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,904
-Interested?
-It's none of my business, but…

358
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,449
I hope you don't start seeing her.

359
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,409
That woman…

360
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,581
is the reason my husband's dead.

361
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,383
Math, 100.

362
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,218
Science, 100.

363
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,095
History, 100.

364
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,472
English, 91.

365
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,973
Korean…

366
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,517
Seventy-two?

367
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,437
I told you.
I'm just bad at Korean, you know?

368
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,272
I guess I'm just too much
of a science person.

369
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,024
You take after your dad.

370
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,569
Still, good job.

371
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:26,996
So.

372
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,958
Tell me, how were the matching results?

373
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,168
I bet a lot of girls liked you, huh?

374
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:37,132
There is one member
who chose Professor Cha, but she didn't--

375
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,550
There was only one?

376
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,637
These broads must
have terrible taste in men.

377
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,183
-And what?
-Well, she has a child.

378
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,270
What? A child? God dammit!

379
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,774
And who did you pick?

380
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,695
Why didn't you pick anyone?

381
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,905
Did you not see any members
that you were interested in?

382
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,200
You didn't pick anyone?
What? You don't want a wife?

383
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,162
Of course I do.

384
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:12,459
Go on.
Go get something for me to put on.

385
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,003
Yes, dear.

386
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,309
There were lots of girls
that liked you, right?

387
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,394
You were the most popular.

388
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,982
Look at you. You're so handsome.

389
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,777
What kind of…

390
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,331
That night,

391
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,666
I noticed Aphrodite
was hanging around you.

392
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,960
I hope you don't start seeing her.

393
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,086
That woman…

394
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,465
is the reason my husband's dead.

395
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,643
Mr. Hermes asked me
for your contact information.

396
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,815
He wants to meet you.
Are you all right with that?

397
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,694
Sure, go ahead.

398
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,033
His real name is Mr. Lee Hyung-ju.

399
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,634
I did everything that you told me to do.

400
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,470
So then why are you still pushing me
for somebody else?

401
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,807
In this market,
it's assumed you'll meet many people

402
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,726
in order to find
the best possible match for yourself.

403
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:58,231
But the most brilliant gem
is never the first to be revealed.

404
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,151
Would you understand if I told you
that this was a strategy

405
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,528
to make you more attractive?

406
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,201
When a man starts liking a woman,
he will forget everyone else.

407
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,995
Is that right?

408
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,582
Desire isn't such a simple emotion,

409
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,459
especially when it comes to marriage.

410
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,045
You must be as careful as you can.

411
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:25,884
Then…

412
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,638
what do I have to do
to captivate a man's desire?

413
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,976
It would certainly be easier
if I could tell you that.

414
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,521
But the truth is, it doesn't matter
if you don't know what to do.

415
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,356
The most important thing…

416
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,775
is to be as real as you can

417
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,403
without revealing your true self,
you know?

418
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,406
That's what matters to you.

419
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,168
INCOMING CALL
MANAGER HWANG SUNG-HUI

420
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,255
Yes?

421
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,007
Hello, Ms. Seo.

422
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,802
I'm calling to tell you about
the matching results from the masquerade.

423
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,264
There's someone
who would really like to meet with you.

424
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,100
Should I go ahead
and set the date for you?

425
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,896
I'm just not that interested
at the moment.

426
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:20,813
Ms. Seo.

427
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:25,068
Why don't you just give it a chance?
Just try meeting with him once.

428
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,821
Even if you don't get married,
you could still become good friends.

429
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,160
All right. Tell me who he is.

430
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,845
You made a great impression that night.

431
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,431
I like women who are educated.

432
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,351
Well, thank you
for thinking so highly of me.

433
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,563
I heard you're a dentist.

434
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,522
Yeah.

435
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:49,027
That's why I've been staring
at your teeth this whole time.

436
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,944
Very healthy.

437
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,489
That's exactly how I feel
about correct spelling.

438
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,700
It's a work habit.

439
00:33:55,783 --> 00:34:00,663
I guess I should watch what I text you,
like "your" and "you're."

440
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,262
We meet again, Ms. Aphrodite.

441
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,097
Lee Hyung-ju.

442
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,688
I'm Jin Yoo-hui.

443
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,737
I hear both of them
have arrived.

444
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,947
So Hye-seung's meeting us today too?

445
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,410
All right, then.
Make sure to check in on them.

446
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,871
But Ms. Choi,

447
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,624
in my personal opinion

448
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,835
Jung Min-jin is a better match
for Lee Hyung-ju.

449
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,756
Do you think that he
and Jin Yoo-hui will work out?

450
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,800
After spending some time together,

451
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,929
I'm sure they'll wanna get
to know each other better.

452
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,348
You mean tonight?

453
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,974
But it's their first date.

454
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,728
Do you think Jin Yoo-hui
will really act that way?

455
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,233
It's Jin Yoo-hui.

456
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,070
You were being so cold to me that day.

457
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,948
I thought, "Jeez, she must really not
be into me or something."

458
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,075
I wasn't.

459
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,870
But… Then why did you end up picking me?

460
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,459
I just felt bad for you.
You looked so lonely.

461
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,796
So, it was out of pity. I understand now.

462
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,634
Well, then. Um, how am I doing so far?

463
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,763
Who knows? I need some time.

464
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,976
That's true. It takes time.

465
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,815
I heard that you're in charge
of a gaming company.

466
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,609
-What's your company called?
-Uh, it's called Hibull, and--

467
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,446
What's wrong?

468
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,952
I've spent my entire paycheck
on Hibull games.

469
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,037
Yeah?

470
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,126
Oh sorry. I didn't realize
you were a valued customer.

471
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,878
Please, eat.

472
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,176
I heard that the members
at higher levels

473
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,721
prefer to meet with people
who are young and childless.

474
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,598
So I'm a bit surprised.

475
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,516
What's wrong with having a kid?

476
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,059
I have two myself.

477
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,605
You can't judge a book by its cover.

478
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,608
I knew you were the one
when I first saw you.

479
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:39,155
Would you like to have another whiskey
in the sky lounge?

480
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,990
I reserved a bottle.

481
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,534
-Right now?
-Let's go.

482
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,622
I think I've had enough already.
Let's call it a night.

483
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,498
Let's do it. Let's go.

484
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,376
Uh…

485
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,926
Yeah.

486
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:17,109
Lee Hyung-ju and Jin Yoo-hui
are on a blind date right now.

487
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,699
Is Choi Yoo-sun actually trustworthy?

488
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,911
You need to make her someone
you can trust.

489
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:32,667
When you're powerful,
you need people you can trust.

490
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,462
There's no point in feeling betrayed.

491
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,548
That just means you lost power.

492
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,428
The reason that Sangwon Group betrayed us

493
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,223
is because we didn't
have any power, right?

494
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,559
Don't just hope they'll trust you.

495
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:55,106
If you become someone they need,
trust will follow.

496
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,246
What are we doing here?

497
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,331
Aren't we on the same page?

498
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,875
What do you mean?

499
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,962
You must know what this is.
It's not like we're kids.

500
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,338
What are you doing?

501
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,048
I mean, what's the problem?

502
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,592
Aren't we here to have some fun together?

503
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,805
Where are you going?
We're not done.

504
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,267
I even booked a room for us.

505
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,393
Let go!

506
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,689
Should I call the staff?

507
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,483
Okay, fine. How much do you want?

508
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,738
Why are you acting all innocent
when you know what this is?

509
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,367
I bought dinner and drinks,
and you ate it up. So what gives?

510
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,125
Yeah, Seok-jin. Are you here?

511
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,128
Come to the sky lounge. This man's crazy.

512
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,095
So, you're a self-made businessman.

513
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,265
I thought you came from a rich family.

514
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,561
My family used to be dirt-poor,

515
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,230
so I'm not really into guys
who are born rich.

516
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,774
That phrase "dirt-poor,"

517
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,526
you… you don't seem
like that kind of person to me, though.

518
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,820
-Really?
-Yeah.

519
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,364
But my family was so poor.

520
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,408
-Hmm.
-My mom used to be a dancer.

521
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,204
My father was a lawyer,
but he passed away when I was younger.

522
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,207
We ended up having to eat instant noodles
most of the time.

523
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,543
Which are delicious, but yeah, still. Mmm.

524
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,295
They didn't bother me back then.

525
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,798
My mother was struggling,
so she remarried,

526
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,009
but I didn't get along with my stepfather.

527
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,637
I acted out a bit as a teenager.

528
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,100
Um, so then,
how did you become a lawyer?

529
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,936
It was this rich girl that I knew.

530
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,522
She always used to look down
on me at school.

531
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,107
She thought she was the better student.

532
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,276
And that brought out
my competitive streak.

533
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,738
"I don't know about anything else,
but I'm the better student."

534
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,411
I guess once I got to college,
I started wanting more.

535
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,289
I thought, "What's the best thing
I can do from now on?"

536
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,836
Something that's also good for the world.

537
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,754
Something I can feel proud of.

538
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,136
-The answer was obvious to me.
-Practicing law?

539
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:31,971
Mm-hmm.

540
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,850
I wanted to become a great lawyer
like my father was.

541
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,812
So I take it your father
was a very good lawyer then?

542
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,606
So they say.

543
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,609
You mean, like he defended
and fought for the weak?

544
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,070
-Or always tried to help those in need--
-No.

545
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,947
I mean, he had a high win rate.

546
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,867
Of course. A lawyer needs a high win rate.

547
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,334
Hye-seung!

548
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,045
Hye-seung, you okay? Huh?

549
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,547
Where's that son of a bitch?

550
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,886
That was what he wanted all along.

551
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,930
It makes sense.

552
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,850
He was okay with everything.

553
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,643
Why would you date someone like…

554
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,274
I'm sorry for bothering you.

555
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,320
I didn't want to call the police.

556
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,455
You must've been shocked.

557
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,670
Why doesn't it ever work out for me?

558
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,633
I actually went on a blind date

559
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,761
'cause I wanted revenge.

560
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,349
Someone said I had to become stronger…

561
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,853
if I wanted to take her down.

562
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,233
Even if I had
to borrow power from a man.

563
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,866
It doesn't matter. Let's go.
I'm sick of complaining.

564
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:17,910
Before you go…

565
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,163
can we talk about something?

566
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,124
I guess we were there for a while?

567
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,628
That's okay, the wine was good.

568
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,433
Hey, uh…

569
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,352
Hmm?

570
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,356
…do you want to grab another drink?

571
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,158
Did I ever tell you about my brother?

572
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,292
This is putting it nicely, but my father…

573
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,920
was a tyrant who beat my mother.

574
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,591
For a long time, and quite violently.

575
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,634
So, ever since he was young,

576
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,929
my brother got beaten every time
he tried to protect our mother.

577
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,516
But he couldn't win.

578
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,520
Why would your father
do something like that to her?

579
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,608
It was shame.

580
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,737
My father couldn't stand
that he was a normal guy

581
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,946
married to a princess.

582
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,160
And on that day,

583
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,788
he swung a golf club at my mother.

584
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,959
My brother saw it coming
and leaped in before I could stop him.

585
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,337
He beat my father
until he almost killed him.

586
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,132
Then he left the house…

587
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,136
got drunk and drove his car into a median.

588
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,096
That was the last of him.

589
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,390
From then on, my mother…

590
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:08,729
spent the rest of her life in a hospital
after doing her best to follow him.

591
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,564
Eventually…

592
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,194
my mother went to be
with the son she loved so much.

593
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,406
How come you never told me
about any of this?

594
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,660
Were we not close enough
for you to tell me?

595
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,912
I just wanted to run away from everything.

596
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,081
If I had stayed there any longer…

597
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,252
I might've killed my father.

598
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,673
If you really were in that much pain,
I should've been there for you.

599
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,590
No.

600
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,510
It was only right to let you go.

601
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,972
When I heard that you had got married,
I felt better for some reason.

602
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,350
So…

603
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,690
I really hoped that you'd be happy.

604
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,195
You didn't even give me a chance.

605
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,201
Hye-seung…

606
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,413
-how would you like to become a lecturer?
-Hmm?

607
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,458
The school has put together a program
designed for top executives.

608
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,670
They’re looking for instructors.
Of course, only if you want.

609
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,464
I can recommend you. If you like.

610
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,592
I'm serious.
You don't believe me?

611
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,094
-I'm serious.
-Really?

612
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,641
-What?
-Nothing.

613
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,521
-Hey, cheers.
-Yes. Oh, did I order this? Huh?

614
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,439
Yeah.

615
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,608
Which game is your favorite one?

616
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,819
Aphrodite, with Lee Hyung-ju?

617
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,572
Lee Hyung-ju? Who's that?

618
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,199
Hermes. The CEO of Hibull.

619
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,452
I like Monopoly.

620
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,953
-Monopoly?
-Yeah.

621
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:49,997
Me too, actually.

622
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,000
I've always struggled financially
in the past, but…

623
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,002
-He's the CEO?
-Mmm.

624
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,713
But Jin Yoo-hui was after you that night.

625
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,298
So why is she with him?

626
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,592
She must
have mistaken me for him.

627
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,344
Our IDs were switched right before.

628
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:08,265
That's why she thought
I was a businessman.

629
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,657
I had so much fun tonight.

630
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,576
I laughed a lot, thanks to you.

631
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:31,955
I hope that I gave you
a better impression of me.

632
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,416
Oh!

633
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,896
It's here.

634
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,732
Hyung-ju.

635
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,571
I find you to be very handsome.

636
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,426
MANAGER HWANG SUNG-HUI

637
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,846
Hello, Ms. Seo.

638
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,181
How was your date last night?
Did it go well?

639
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,350
How could you set me up
with someone like him?

640
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,728
He was just looking for a one-night stand.

641
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,147
He was?

642
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,150
But I don't…

643
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,319
I'm so sorry about that, Ms. Seo.

644
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,404
I had no idea that he would--

645
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,619
What is going on?

646
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,914
Mr. Lee?

647
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,457
This is Choi Yoo-sun.

648
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,418
Did you have a good time yesterday?

649
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,587
Yes, I had a great time.

650
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:48,550
I imagine that you found Ms. Jin Yoo-hui
rather attractive.

651
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,969
What was your impression of her?

652
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,763
Mmm, she was charming.

653
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,680
That's good.

654
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,975
So I imagine you'd want
to continue seeing her.

655
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,686
Uh, yes. Let me see how it goes first.

656
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,813
All right, then.

657
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:06,068
We'll schedule the next date
and get back to you, okay?

658
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:15,994
Really?

659
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,372
Yes, I've been keeping an ear out for you,

660
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,958
and I think he's already fallen hard,
you know?

661
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:25,087
-It's going really well so far.
-Yes, all right.

662
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,723
-Hi.
-Hello, Professor.

663
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,188
Professor, the department chair
said he would like to see you.

664
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,606
Oh.

665
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:49,861
Professor!

666
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,656
Oh. Yes?

667
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:57,452
If this project doesn't go well,
I can't come back next semester.

668
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,377
-Professor.
-Ah, Professor Seo.

669
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,464
So…

670
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,677
They want someone else
in charge of research.

671
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,679
They're not satisfied
with the project results.

672
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,596
What?

673
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,599
I told them I couldn't do it,
but they insisted.

674
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,893
I thought they said
that they wanted it to be you, right?

675
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,812
How are the results not good enough?

676
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:27,107
That's what I'm saying.
There's nothing wrong with them.

677
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,276
By any chance,

678
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,697
did something happen between you
and Ms. Jin Yoo-hui recently?

679
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:42,080
I'm very worried
that they're going to abandon the project.

680
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:48,628
Professor Seo, I'll definitely make sure
to give you a major course next semester--

681
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,506
Will the students be okay
if I quit the project?

682
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,593
-Their scholarships?
-Of course! They'll be fine.

683
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:01,850
Yes? Hello, sir!

684
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,812
You must be so busy.
How can I help you?

685
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,314
What?

686
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,275
Did you say a tutor?

687
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,948
There's one more thing to discuss.

688
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,577
Thinking long-term,
I'm wondering what the execs think

689
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,455
about a potential partnership
with Lionsoft.

690
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,998
To acquire A.B. in the United States.

691
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,418
When you say A.B,
are you talking about Action Blitz?

692
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,214
Aren't they, like, way bigger?

693
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,382
That's right. The largest in the US.

694
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,634
Whoa.

695
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,180
So…

696
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,810
So? Did they agree?

697
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,896
No, they hated it. Said we'd go under.

698
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,357
I've actually never seen my employees
look like that.

699
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,692
Thank goodness
they're not out of their mind, at least.

700
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,694
Those young people
should have more ambition.

701
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,947
It's sink or swim. Right, Hyung-ju?

702
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,657
That's what I'm saying.

703
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,284
But you'll do it anyway?

704
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:05,038
Hey. Do you two know
what I have in common with Steve Jobs?

705
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,625
The board of directors
is always against us.

706
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,586
-But it always turns out fine.
-Steve Jobs got kicked out in the end.

707
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,505
And he made a triumphant return.

708
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,175
If Sung-jae and I join forces,
we'll have a chance.

709
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,470
-That's a very good point.
-Let's write up the agreement.

710
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,557
-I'll convince the board of directors.
-Let's do it.

711
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:27,102
And Ho-chan, meet with both legal teams
about acquisition.

712
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,437
Make sure that I don't
have to sue this guy one day.

713
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,774
Ah, yes sir, Mr. bosses. Sir.

714
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,984
Bravo!

715
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,027
This is a historic moment.

716
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,446
Yeah!

717
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,842
Life is
still so unpredictable…

718
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,111
-Ugh, rough day. Get home safely.
-See you tomorrow, sir.

719
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,243
Just as I hit rock bottom…

720
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,081
Just when it seemed
like I had no hope left to lose…

721
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,458
Who are you?

722
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,502
-You're Jun-ho's dad?
-Yes.

723
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,296
Nice to meet you.

724
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:40,300
I'm Seo Hye-seung.
Jun-ho's Korean tutor starting today.

725
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,554
Fate reaches out
to me yet again.
