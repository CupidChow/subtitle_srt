1
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,452
What did the doctor say?

2
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,958
They won't know anything
until she's conscious.

3
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,840
Don't worry about it. Min-ji will wake up.

4
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,344
I'm gonna meet with the driver
who caused the accident.

5
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,595
No, don't.

6
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,015
I can take care of it.

7
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,184
Don't worry about me.

8
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,228
How can I not worry about you?

9
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,399
When things got rough for me,
the thought of you got me through it.

10
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,820
Am I not what you need right now?

11
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,286
You don't have time
to be sitting here like this.

12
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,746
You should probably go.

13
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,979
What is this picture?

14
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,656
Is Jin Yoo-hui the one

15
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,034
behind Min-ji's accident?

16
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,886
Find out exactly
what happened with the accident.

17
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,845
Who's the driver,

18
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,097
and what's his relationship
with Jin Yoo-hui?

19
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,229
Hello there.

20
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,400
Please, sit.

21
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,744
I want details about Min-ji's accident.

22
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,831
Don't leave anything out.
Tell me everything.

23
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,126
All right.

24
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,672
I do this for you,
what will you give me in return?

25
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,134
What do you want from me?

26
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,554
I want you to give up

27
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,474
Lee Hyung-ju.

28
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,439
I… never had him in the first place.

29
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,858
Really?

30
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,199
Open it.

31
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,918
It looks like Jin Yoo-hui
paid off the man's gambling debts

32
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,419
for a price.

33
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,091
I could…

34
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,178
make sure that Jin Yoo-hui
rots in prison for life.

35
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,974
That is,

36
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,603
if you agree never to see Mr. Lee again.

37
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,941
Do we have a deal?

38
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,155
No deal.

39
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,742
That's not enough.

40
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,582
I want you…

41
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,627
to kill her.

42
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,560
Hyung-ju.

43
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,777
What the hell do you think you're doing?

44
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,323
You're not even human.
How could you do that to a child?

45
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,951
-What do you mean by that?
-Wanna play dumb?

46
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,330
You're the one behind Min-ji's accident.

47
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,083
You have proof?

48
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,253
There are photos of you
meeting with the driver who did it.

49
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,756
I don't think the civil affairs secretary
would lie about that.

50
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,258
I don't know
who's telling you all these crazy things,

51
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,635
but that man, he's my client.

52
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,513
Is it a crime for a lawyer
to meet with a client?

53
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,766
You really think
I'll marry you after all of this?

54
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,894
Mr. Lee, pull yourself together.

55
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,273
Do you really think I'm begging you
to marry me right now?

56
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,109
If you really want to save Hibull,

57
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,029
then you're the one who should be begging
for marriage, not me.

58
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,783
I'm the only one
who can help you right now.

59
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,952
You know that I'm the only person
who can possibly save you from this hell.

60
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,497
Just wait.

61
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,041
You're going to pay for this.

62
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,042
I know

63
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,379
because I'm going to make sure of it.

64
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,152
Go Ae-ran. Are you sure
that she's really on your side?

65
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,320
What are you talking about?

66
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,239
Go Ae-ran is trying to frame me for murder

67
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,741
so she can marry off
her daughter Jung Mi-jin to Lee Hyung-ju.

68
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,968
Please restore everything
that's on this.

69
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,179
Yes, ma'am.
Uh, please just fill this out first.

70
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,682
YONGSAN DATA RESCUE CENTER

71
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,784
I thought I told you not to mess
with Jin Yoo-hui right now.

72
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,538
What were you thinking
telling Seo Hye-seung something like that?

73
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,665
How much longer
do you plan to protect her?

74
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,505
Are you blind? Do you even know
what Jin Yoo-hui has been up to recently?

75
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,383
Did she really do this?

76
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,470
Would I really make up
something like this?

77
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,764
Even without me,

78
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,643
it was just a matter of time
before the mother found out.

79
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:03,149
Jin Yoo-hui promised me
that I'd never hear from her again

80
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,984
if she got Lee Hyung-ju.

81
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,362
This means you need
to have a talk with Mi-jin.

82
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,823
Tell her to give him up.

83
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,701
-I can't.
-Stop it!

84
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,621
Do you trust Jin Yoo-hui?

85
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,418
Elections are just around the corner.

86
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,922
Once word gets out
about what Jin Yoo-hui did…

87
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,053
…you know it's inevitable
that all fingers will point to you

88
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:33,888
when this is done.

89
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,894
I just need to make it to the election.

90
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,811
After that--

91
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,023
So, you're really going
to have her marry him?

92
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,486
You think that Hye-seung
is gonna sit by and watch?

93
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,073
Do you know

94
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,035
what that woman asked me to do?

95
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,747
She asked me to kill Jin Yoo-hui.

96
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,665
What?

97
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,959
Jin Yoo-hui crossed the line.

98
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,920
What mother
would just stand by watching idly

99
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,297
and not defend her child?

100
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,807
Then let me ask you,

101
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,935
between Jin Yoo-hui and Seo Hye-seung,

102
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,939
who is the bigger threat?

103
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,653
A bomb…

104
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,532
must be defused before it goes off.

105
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,709
Please. Please just wake up.

106
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,128
We're all so worried about you.

107
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,174
I'll be right back. So-eun is home.

108
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,759
Okay, thanks. I'll call you.

109
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,345
-Mm-hmm.
-Right. Go on home.

110
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,391
Thank you so much
for coming to be with us.

111
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,851
Not at all, ma'am.

112
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,108
Mom…

113
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,282
Mom…

114
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,287
Min-ji! Min-ji!

115
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,288
Can you hear me?

116
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,082
I'll call the doctor!

117
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,752
Min-ji. It's grandma.

118
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:32,673
Oh! Min-ji is going to live.

119
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,552
-She's going to live!
-Min-ji.

120
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,472
Oh!

121
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,807
-Min-ji! Oh, Mom.
-Dear God.

122
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,352
Thank you, God.

123
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,605
Min-ji!

124
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,738
I'm so glad
that Min-ji's awake.

125
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,865
They said she just needs
some physical therapy.

126
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,952
You must have been so worried.

127
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,039
Ah.

128
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,043
And I'm gathering
some more evidence on Jin Yoo-hui.

129
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,962
Thank you, but from now on, I can handle--

130
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,005
No.

131
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,465
I need to know as well.

132
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,134
It's for me too.

133
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,803
Well, hello.

134
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,931
Hey.

135
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,351
So I heard that you were a huge help.
Thank you.

136
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,521
Thanks to you,
Min-ji is finally awake now.

137
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:33,025
You see?
I knew she'd be fine. What a relief.

138
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,903
Mmm. Thank you.

139
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,200
How are things going with Hibull?

140
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,412
Heard, um, you're in
a pretty tough situation right now.

141
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,959
Well, I'm taking things
one step at a time.

142
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,425
You can head out.
I think I'm good now.

143
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,261
I'll get going, then.

144
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,605
He's really a good guy.

145
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,237
Are you…

146
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,741
seeing each other again?

147
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,453
No, it's not like that.

148
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,923
APPROVAL RATING BY PARTY

149
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,759
Come in.

150
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,727
And you said you never wanted
to see me again.

151
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,312
Are you out of your mind?

152
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,939
You messed with Seo Hye-seung's daughter?

153
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,693
Who did?

154
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,196
Was it me?

155
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,866
You don't understand the gravity
of what you've done, do you?

156
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,164
Don't do anything from now on.
That's a warning.

157
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,752
Why? Are you going to kill me?

158
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,171
Oh, well,

159
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,798
considering how in three months,

160
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,300
you'll be the most powerful man
in the country,

161
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,928
why should you be afraid?

162
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,890
It's easy to kill someone
without anybody finding out.

163
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,397
But,

164
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,691
I'm not going down alone.

165
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,819
Are you threatening me right now?

166
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,822
What do you mean by that?

167
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,867
I thought that I made it clear last time,
but I think you've forgotten.

168
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,330
If you actually want to become president,

169
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,042
you need to bring Lee Hyung-ju
to his knees.

170
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,046
This is the final deal between us.

171
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,552
A JUST AND FAIR SOUTH KOREA
SON PIL-YOUNG

172
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,795
Ah.

173
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,963
Mr. Yoon.

174
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,550
This is Son Pil-young.

175
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,470
This is
the latest project we've launched.

176
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,973
Allow me to explain the details

177
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,684
with visuals in the presentation
that we've prepared.

178
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,026
Sir, we're in trouble.

179
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,447
We're from the Prosecutors' Office.

180
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,992
We'll be carrying out a search
regarding tax evasion allegations

181
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,621
related to the investment agreements
between Hibull and Lionsoft.

182
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,414
-What?
-All right, let's go.

183
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,210
Let's go.

184
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,297
What's happening?

185
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,188
NATIONAL TAX SERVICE BEGINS
A TAX INVESTIGATION ON HIBULL

186
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,290
Hello. Ms. Choi?

187
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,463
That thing… you mentioned before.

188
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,300
Is that still on the table?

189
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,637
I'm guessing you've decided.

190
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,514
I'll do it.

191
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,684
I'll marry Mr. Cha.

192
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,228
I'm glad to hear that.

193
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,563
If you make sure

194
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,607
that Jin Yoo-hui goes to trial.

195
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,443
We're going to be family soon.

196
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,863
I wouldn't betray your trust
on our first deal.

197
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,573
Don't worry about me,

198
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,867
I'll keep my promise to you

199
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,911
if you keep yours.

200
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,871
Okay.

201
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,958
Just give me a few days.

202
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,084
Also,

203
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,840
make sure that all of this stays
between the two of us.

204
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,635
Yes, of course.

205
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,406
Hye-seung.

206
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,539
Seok-jin.

207
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,086
Please help Mr. Lee.

208
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,880
I think

209
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,176
it'll be hard for him
to get through this on his own.

210
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,811
I guess…

211
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,483
you must really love him.

212
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,654
Hurts more than I expected.

213
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,619
Do you want to get married?

214
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,462
Remember

215
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,132
just how happy we were back then?

216
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,970
Do you think that we

217
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,475
could ever be that happy again?

218
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,984
I've waited so long for this, but…

219
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,408
feels like I lost.

220
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,041
Let's do it. Yeah.

221
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,381
If your heart is somewhere else,
I'll just…

222
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,842
have to win it back.

223
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,140
I will…

224
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,311
just have to love you more.

225
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,399
I'd love to be married.

226
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,236
To you.

227
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,869
THE 22ND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
MAJOR EVENTS

228
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:24,955
Hmm.

229
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,546
I'm busy. Let's make this quick.

230
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,758
So I hear that the National Tax Service

231
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:41,096
is considering prosecuting
over the tax evasion charges.

232
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,309
Tell me, how have you been running
that company of yours?

233
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,855
Well, it doesn't matter. Listen to me.

234
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,986
Stop trying to hold out.
Just marry Jin Yoo-hui already.

235
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,071
Mr. Son,

236
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,991
why are you doing all this for her?
What's your relationship?

237
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,660
I'll give you one week. I'll be waiting.

238
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,892
Just marry Jin Yoo-hui already.

239
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,771
I'll give you one week. I'll be waiting.

240
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,657
SEO HYE-SEUNG

241
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,427
Please restore everything
that's on this.

242
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,013
Yes, ma'am.
Uh, please just fill this out first.

243
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,569
She told me to just endure it
even when my stepfather was beating me up.

244
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,738
Some mother she was.

245
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,324
What about your biological father?

246
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,244
You don't talk
or know anything about his life?

247
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,956
Know anything?
I know all about it.

248
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,041
I see him on TV all the time.

249
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,794
What do you mean by that?

250
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,962
See? Look.

251
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,214
He's even on right now.

252
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,926
What do you think?

253
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,178
That's my father.

254
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,514
Doesn't he look like me?

255
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,225
What?

256
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,729
He said he would get divorced
when my mother was having me.

257
00:21:54,896 --> 00:22:00,027
But then, when three months had passed,
he ran off and married someone else.

258
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,615
A presidential candidate
claiming to be morally perfect

259
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,367
with a child out of wedlock.

260
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,912
I mean, he abandoned me
because he wanted to succeed.

261
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,457
I would sure like to see him try.

262
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,083
In the end…

263
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,379
I'll be the one who destroys him.

264
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,303
This was it.

265
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,679
Son Pil-young.

266
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,441
You what?

267
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,109
Hye-seung and I…

268
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,987
are getting married.

269
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,368
Do you actually expect me to believe that?

270
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,577
You know that Ms. Seo and I--

271
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,246
What can you actually do
for Hye-seung right now?

272
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,207
Can you stay by her side?

273
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,418
I heard that your mother was against it.

274
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,505
Did you ever consider
how that might end up hurting Hye-seung?

275
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,302
That's… It'll be fine
once the company is safe.

276
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,720
Lee Hyung-ju.

277
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,808
Hye-seung's entire life is falling apart.

278
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,768
Her husband, Min-ji.

279
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,395
And now Hye-seung as well.

280
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,731
All because of that woman.

281
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,527
Why should Hye-seung
have to go through that?

282
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,906
I honestly have zero interest
in whom you end up getting married to.

283
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,491
I just want Hye-seung to be…

284
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,373
What's important to me
is to know she's happy.

285
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,965
If you care about her…

286
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,762
then please let her go.

287
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,454
A JUST AND FAIR SOUTH KOREA
SON PIL-YOUNG

288
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,008
What brings you
all the way here?

289
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,343
Let me just get straight to the point.

290
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,262
You know Jin Yoo-hui.

291
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,100
-So what?
-She's your daughter, right?

292
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,230
I don't intend to create a scandal
out of a politician's personal life,

293
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,191
but your daughter

294
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,943
tried to kill my daughter.

295
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,571
She tried to commit murder.

296
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,449
So now, it's become a "personal issue."

297
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,452
What on earth are you talking about?

298
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,746
How dare you come in here like that?

299
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,789
I'm trying to give you a chance.

300
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:05,003
Make sure that Jin Yoo-hui rots in prison
for what she did to my family.

301
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,005
If you don't,

302
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,716
then I'm going to reveal everything
to the media.

303
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,843
Are you really threatening me?

304
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,055
You think I haven't seen plenty
of crazy people like you

305
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,806
in 30 years in politics?

306
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,518
How dare you come in here
with such nonsense?

307
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,478
Is anyone there?

308
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,355
So you're going
to feign ignorance to the end?

309
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,858
Hello?
Get this crazy bitch out of here now!

310
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,028
Apologies, sir.

311
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,657
Time to go.

312
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,786
Just wait.

313
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,082
I'm going to make you pay
for all your crimes.

314
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,109
What are you doing here
when your daughter's--

315
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,574
I warned you, didn't I?

316
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,368
I told you that if you messed
with my daughter,

317
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,120
that I was going to kill you.

318
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,372
What are you gonna do about it?

319
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,667
I'm the one who warned you.

320
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,378
To play dead and do nothing.

321
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,133
Remember, you're the one
who did this to your daughter, not me.

322
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,015
I was going to kill you, but…

323
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,642
that seems too easy.

324
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,397
You said

325
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,692
you're going to destroy
Son Pil-young, right?

326
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,486
No. I'm going to do it for you.

327
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,281
I'll make sure that you

328
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,452
and Son Pil-young both
get exactly what you deserve.

329
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,454
Watch out.

330
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:27,437
We can't let it go on.
Seo Hye-seung has to be dealt with.

331
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,398
Ae-ran,

332
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,777
who do you think I'll be most grateful to
when I win this thing?

333
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,654
It's three months.

334
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,490
If we can just make it to the elections,

335
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,784
then we'll have all the power, okay?

336
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,370
Uh-huh.

337
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:45,872
Okay.

338
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,256
Thank you.

339
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,925
With this, Congressman,

340
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,387
I'll consider your debt repaid.

341
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,916
I guess you don't bother keeping
your client's information private?

342
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,044
I don't know what you're talking about,
but please be more respectful.

343
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,963
Why did you tell Seo Hye-seung

344
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,550
about my personal history
with Son Pil-young?

345
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,845
It seems this has nothing to do with me.

346
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:42,887
Goodnight.

347
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,556
If you act like this,

348
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,102
you really think Rex will be safe?

349
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,187
Ms. Choi,

350
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,023
you'll regret this.

351
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,136
What did you want to say?

352
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,598
I heard that you went
to talk to Congressman Son.

353
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,267
I admire your audacity.

354
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,938
You knew already, didn't you?
About his relationship with her.

355
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,900
That's why you were trying to match

356
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,235
a person like Jin Yoo-hui
with someone like Mr. Lee.

357
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,820
I'm a businesswoman.

358
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,364
I work with powerful people.

359
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,117
People who are worth a lot of money.

360
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,411
It won't work out for you.

361
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:53,416
With Son Pil-young and Jin Yoo-hui,
I'm not going to leave them alone.

362
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,794
I'm going to reveal everything.

363
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,839
What kind of people they are,
what kind of things they've done.

364
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,095
So if I understand correctly,
you've decided to start a fight

365
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,432
that you have no chance of winning at all.

366
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,897
Who do you think put Mr. Lee
in the position that he's in right now?

367
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,364
Another reason not to forgive her.

368
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,742
I'm never going to back down.

369
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,870
If you must, then I won't stop you.

370
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,833
But make sure you do it right.

371
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:39,087
Make sure that she can't
ever challenge you again. You hear me?

372
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,719
We at ACBL fully understood
your objection to Mr. Choi Sung-jae.

373
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,514
So we'll deputize our best person in Korea

374
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,599
and have him make the decision
on this one.

375
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,517
Who's that?

376
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,018
Professor Cha Seok-jin

377
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,354
from the business school
at Hankuk University.

378
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,482
Understood.

379
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,945
The rest of the details will be discussed
with Professor Cha Seok-jin.

380
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,592
Please make sure this goes well.
I'm counting on you.

381
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,052
Don't worry.
I'll make sure of it.

382
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,721
Looking forward
to working with you.

383
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,763
Sure.

384
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,227
See you at the meeting.

385
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,488
What's Choi Sung-jae doing here?

386
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,409
What kind of a person are you?

387
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,746
I don't like to mix personal connections
with my business life.

388
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,791
I am only going
to be making objective decisions.

389
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,753
Don't you think
that I'll be the best for Hibull?

390
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,051
I hope you keep that promise.

391
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,888
Both to me and to Choi Sung-jae.

392
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,174
Min-ji. Aren't you cold?

393
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,594
-You want to go inside?
-A little later, yeah.

394
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,262
Mm-hmm. Okay.

395
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,985
MR. LEE HYUNG-JU

396
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,780
Hello?

397
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,950
How's Min-ji?

398
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,829
She's gotten a lot better
with physical therapy.

399
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:21,499
That's good to hear.
You can finally relax a bit now.

400
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:22,959
Yeah.

401
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,295
When I saw Min-ji for the first time,

402
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,634
I thought, "Wow, this must be
what it feels like to have a daughter."

403
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,097
After only having a son
who doesn't talk very much,

404
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,516
everything Min-ji said sounded so nice.

405
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,269
I really wished she were my daughter.

406
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,064
Don't worry.

407
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,779
It'll take some time for sure,
but my company will get back to normal.

408
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,950
And I'll be all right as well.

409
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,999
So, Hye-seung, please forget about this.

410
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,419
And try to be happy.

411
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,671
All right?

412
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,339
All right.

413
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,469
Mr. Lee, I want you to be happy too.

414
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,349
I will.

415
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,481
What are your intentions
by giving Professor Cha all of your shares

416
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,482
in the company?

417
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,693
-Who said that?
-I'm asking you if it's true.

418
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,865
You have no right to ask me about that.

419
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,244
You remember how you promised me

420
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,539
that you would get Seok-jin married
to Jung Mi-jin?

421
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,415
No?

422
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,459
Seo Hye-seung?

423
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,712
Did you ignore what I said?

424
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,007
Did you think that you would get anything
from me after that?

425
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,434
I am still your wife.

426
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,314
I am your loyal wife who's lived with you
for the last 15 years.

427
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,821
That's why I gave you Rex, right?

428
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,824
Do not be so greedy.

429
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,493
I'm warning you.

430
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,912
That company's mine.
Don't you dare touch it.

431
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,207
What? Warn me?

432
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,376
How dare you say that!

433
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,170
You have no clue what I've endured!

434
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:17,425
How I've endured all of those 15 years.

435
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,469
Whether you hit me or cursed at me.

436
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,431
Have you ever wondered why I didn't say
a single word all of this time?

437
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,350
Why do you think I did all those things

438
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:31,939
for some… for some dirty old man like you
who can't even walk properly?

439
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,151
You… You…

440
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,486
Look at that!

441
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,865
Finally showing your true colors, huh?

442
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,326
You wicked, evil bitch.

443
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,786
Is that why you approached me
in the first place?

444
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,747
Get out.

445
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,375
Get the hell out of my house!

446
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,350
Why should I?

447
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,603
This is my house.

448
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,430
Hello, Mr. Jang.

449
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,017
I sent you an email. I'm Seo Hye-seung.

450
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,941
Yes, this is Jang Pil-won.

451
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,530
And yeah,
I got the… the email you sent me.

452
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,753
-You still haven't heard from Hye-seung?
-Not yet.

453
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:44,382
And her phone seems like
it's still turned off.

454
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,928
We've reported her missing for now,
but we couldn't just sit there and wait.

455
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,348
I know I shouldn't have,
but that's why I called you. I'm sorry.

456
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,392
No, I'm glad you called me.

457
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,977
I'll just make some calls about it first.

458
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,606
Thank you.

459
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,572
Oh, Hye-seung.

460
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,411
-Hye-seung.
-You okay?

461
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,792
Hey.

462
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,086
No, I can't just wait for the police.

463
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,672
Right now,
start off by tracking Ms. Seo's cellphone.

464
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,708
CONGRESSMAN SON PIL-YOUNG

465
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,407
It's finished, sir.

466
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,534
That's very good.

467
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,350
CONGRESSMAN SON PIL-YOUNG

468
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,190
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING YOU WANTED.
DON'T EVER SHOW UP AGAIN.

469
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,130
Okay, thanks.

470
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,051
Yeah, please ask around there too.

471
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,691
MS. SEO HYE-SEUNG
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

472
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,845
Well, it's been a while.

473
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,389
I didn't think I'd hear from you.

474
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,891
Why don't we go inside?

475
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,283
What are we doing here?

476
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,244
A press conference.

477
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,122
What press conference?

478
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,001
-I'm going to announce our marriage.
-What?

479
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,296
I know that it's just a contract marriage,

480
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,632
but we should still mark
such an important occasion.

481
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,468
We should gather the press
and make a big announcement.

482
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,599
Uh, I mean…

483
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,019
You could have at least given me
some warning.

484
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,147
I don't believe I'm quite ready yet.

485
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,526
I've prepared everything
in the waiting room.

486
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,614
We don't have a lot of time,
so go and get changed.

487
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,412
I had never realized that you've
got such a romantic side to you, Hyung-ju.

488
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,417
This way, please.

489
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,529
You look absolutely beautiful.
You'll be the star of tonight.

490
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,044
Let's go.

491
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,761
There they are.

492
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,229
Hello, everyone. I'm Lee Hyung-ju.

493
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,942
First, I'd like to thank all the reporters
who came out tonight.

494
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,945
I know you're extremely busy,
and I appreciate it.

495
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,577
However,

496
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,913
as I mentioned previously,

497
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,624
I've prepared a special gift
for you tonight.

498
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,127
You will not regret making time
for this conference.

499
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,638
Breaking news.
The shocking truth has been revealed

500
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,139
about Mr. Son Pil-young.

501
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,726
The popular presidential candidate
had a child out of wedlock.

502
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,269
His illegitimate daughter, Ms. Jin.

503
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,731
is a woman in her 30s
currently working at a major law firm.

504
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,107
Even more shocking,

505
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,277
a victim has reported
that presidential candidate Mr. Son

506
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,280
attempted to murder
with Ms. Jin as his accomplice.

507
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,157
These reports have been verified,

508
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,159
and significant repercussions
are expected.

509
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,329
What? I'm on my way!

510
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,789
Not so fast!

511
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,670
The breaking news is right here.
Where are you going?

512
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,811
The daughter that Mr. Son Pil-young
tucked away to save face.

513
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,397
This monster
whose actions killed a husband

514
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,149
and who tried to kill
that man's wife and daughter,

515
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,944
using her despicable father's power.

516
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:48,198
That monster is this woman,
Ms. Jin Yoo-hui.

517
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,832
Are you saying
that you're Jin Yoo-hui, the lawyer?

518
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:00,586
If Congressman Son is really your father,
then who is your mother?

519
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:04,047
Is it true that you conspired
to commit murder with Congressman Son?

520
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:09,303
Lee Hyung-ju,
what do you think you're doing?

521
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,474
Jin Yoo-hui, it's all over now.

522
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,768
No.

523
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,356
It's all a lie.

524
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,322
This man is lying to all of you right now!

525
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,712
A victim has reported
that presidential candidate Mr. Son

526
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:47,174
attempted to murder her
with Ms. Jin as his accomplice.

527
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,259
These reports have been verified,

528
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,511
and significant repercussions
are expected.

529
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,931
It's finished, sir.

530
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:55,974
That's very good.

531
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,079
Ae-ran.

532
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:30,342
We need to get out of here.
The reporters will be here any minute.

533
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,011
Block the press first.
Send out a rebuttal.

534
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,347
Say it's an obvious political maneuver.

535
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,057
The election's less
than three months away.

536
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,101
We should be doing whatever we can
to make it to--

537
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,854
You know better than I do
that it's useless to keep trying.

538
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,065
What do you mean?

539
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,947
But that… that video…
It's the one you sent me.

540
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,156
I did…

541
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,785
warn you, didn't I?

542
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,124
I told you that

543
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,170
we would all be taken down
if you associated with Jin Yoo-hui.

544
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:13,176
You weren't listening to me.
What could I do?

545
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,013
I had to save myself.

546
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,765
How dare you, Ae-ran?

547
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,645
How dare you betray me like that?

548
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,024
How dare you!

549
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,778
Who was it?
Whose orders are you taking? Huh?

550
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,239
Who? Tell me!

551
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,241
Who? Who is it?

552
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,452
Let her go.

553
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,873
It's all over now.

554
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,626
How… But how did you…

555
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:55,052
Did Congressman Son
tell you to kill me?

556
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,262
Ms. Seo.

557
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,766
Remember, I did warn you

558
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,477
to keep your head down.

559
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:08,565
Mr. Lee has already told the police
everything about Congressman Son

560
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:10,859
and Jin Yoo-hui.

561
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:17,866
Who do you think they'll blame
if all of a sudden I were to disappear?

562
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,162
You think he still has any chance

563
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,167
of becoming the next president
under these circumstances?

564
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:33,381
How much longer can you support someone
who's so unstable?

565
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:40,806
Don't you care
about your daughter's future?

566
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:11,503
You were the only person
who could have stopped Jin Yoo-hui.

567
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,422
But you were blinded by power,

568
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,675
and in the end,
destroyed your child's life as well.

569
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,010
And because of that,

570
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,805
everything you've built for yourself
has crumbled too.

571
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,725
But that's life. Fair, isn't it?

572
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:31,189
No. Out of my way.
I'm a detective. Move!

573
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,440
Out of my way!

574
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,486
Gangnam Police.
Detective Lee Yun-seok.

575
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,779
Son Pil-young,

576
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,532
I'm placing you under arrest
for attempted murder

577
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,284
and obstruction of justice.

578
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:48,456
You have the right to remain silent,
and you have the right to an attorney.

579
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:52,460
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

580
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,671
Let's go. Take him in.

581
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,176
Take him away.

582
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,235
Amidst the revelation
that front-runner Son Pil-young

583
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,946
and his illegitimate daughter,
lawyer Jin Yoo-hui,

584
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,742
interfered with business at Hibull,
Korea's leading gaming company,

585
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:27,495
reports that Rex, a high quality
marriage agency, brought it all down,

586
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,372
drawing the attention of the media.

587
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,583
Rex knows…

588
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,878
Ms. Choi, we have a problem.

589
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:38,465
The big corruption scandal
at Rex involving Congressman Son

590
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,674
has shocked the world.

591
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,844
As of now, this story is still developing.
Please stay tuned.

592
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,058
Let's go.

593
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:51,978
Careful.

594
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,522
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

595
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,233
Get in.

596
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,177
A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
WITH HOPE FOR TOMORROW

597
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,441
I didn't realize we were close enough
for a visit.

598
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,947
What? Curious about how I looked?

599
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,450
Well, are you finally happy now?

600
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,369
I could ask you the same thing.

601
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,915
Do you truly feel happy now that
you've done everything you wanted to?

602
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,087
This can't really be
the outcome you wanted.

603
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,756
"Why am I in here?"

604
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,555
"Why did I act like that?"

605
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,101
Did you really think I would be repenting?

606
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:15,895
Well,

607
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,024
I actually feel great right now.

608
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:24,779
I realized I've achieved a lifelong goal
I'd forgotten about for so long.

609
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,448
All thanks to you.

610
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,618
My goal in life was always

611
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,580
to completely destroy
my own father, Son Pil-young.

612
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,792
Didn't matter how it happened.
I got what I wanted.

613
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,921
So then, what about your life?

614
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,090
Did that mean nothing to you?

615
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,345
Do you not feel bad for yourself?

616
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,722
No, I do.

617
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,060
I utterly pity myself.

618
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,611
But if only it weren't
for you intervening,

619
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,742
I could've been happier
than I could even imagine.

620
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,620
You really think so?

621
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,917
You think you would have ended up happy
if you had continued

622
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,252
to satisfy your greed?

623
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:26,716
Happy?

624
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:37,185
Every human being longs for that
which she does not yet have.

625
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,314
It's just basic human nature

626
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:46,319
to do whatever it must take
in order to get what you truly want.

627
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,322
Right.

628
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,494
Why don't you think long and hard
about where you've ended up

629
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,413
by doing "whatever it takes."

630
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,598
Don't be ridiculous.

631
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,275
This is only the beginning for me.

632
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,306
Your son is getting married tomorrow.

633
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,683
Not to Jung Mi-jin,

634
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,895
but to Seo Hye-seung.

635
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,648
What a pity

636
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,235
that she's not the daughter-in-law
you wanted.

637
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,907
And that your company…

638
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,286
is mine now.

639
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,373
I'm afraid I've worked out a deal
with your son.

640
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,001
We had to do it behind your back.

641
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,718
For the last 15 years,

642
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,931
you treated me like I was less than human.

643
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,767
But, look.

644
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,939
In the end, I've won.

645
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,350
Sorry, I, uh…

646
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,229
I shouldn't be crying.

647
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:03,368
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

648
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,176
I've always imagined how you'd look.

649
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,223
You're even prettier.

650
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,438
Hye-seung.

651
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,985
I want you to be happy.

652
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,727
Will you…

653
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:55,938
marry me?

654
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,043
Who are you?

655
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:45,131
Should you say that
to a customer? A bit rude.

656
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,799
I'm sorry, but Rex--

657
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,301
You can't close up shop now.

658
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,766
I mean, not when you have a customer.

659
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:01,063
I don't--

660
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,691
You could take this opportunity
to start over.

661
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:06,068
Well, after all,

662
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,529
do you only want old people
for customers?

663
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,034
Get with the times.
Why don't you just start all over with me?

664
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,760
Well, then, what is it that you want?

665
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,804
Hmm.

666
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,937
I want what you want.
