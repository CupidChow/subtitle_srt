1
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,861
I want to thank you.

2
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,032
You don't need to thank me.

3
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,077
It's only right
that bad people get what they deserve.

4
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,664
Even though everything turned out
the way I wanted,

5
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,043
I'm not happy.

6
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,590
What was I trying so hard to achieve?

7
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,553
I thought getting revenge
would make me feel better.

8
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,515
Probably because
you've been through so much.

9
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,726
You've gotten used to the pain.

10
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,442
I have no idea
where I'm supposed to go from here,

11
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,780
but I'm going to live my life now.

12
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,080
I know I'm going to be all right,

13
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,251
but I'm still worried about you.

14
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,131
I'm worried I only made things
harder for you.

15
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,341
I'm going to be fine.

16
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,095
Just knowing that you managed
to get your revenge…

17
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,264
That's good enough for me.

18
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,937
Now it's finally your turn to be happy.

19
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,859
And I'll be by your side.

20
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:26,331
We received quite a few complaints
from members who were at the masquerade.

21
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,124
They're questioning our screening process

22
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,919
since a criminal like Jin Yoo-hui
was able to get into the party.

23
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,130
Many members are also complaining
about how we sort by level.

24
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,468
They want to know how Seo Hye-seung
matched with a Black Level member.

25
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,846
There are also complaints about
our management of personal information.

26
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,558
Why don't we issue an apology statement
to our members, Ms. Choi?

27
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,354
"We take full responsibility."

28
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,066
"We're going to make sure
that it never happens again."

29
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,734
Like that?

30
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,907
What they need right now isn't an apology.

31
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,493
It's a wedding with a Black level member.

32
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,790
Do you understand
what our priority must be?

33
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,174
I am sorry.

34
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:20,969
I…

35
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,222
I'm a horrible person.

36
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,852
I let Jin Yoo-hui take advantage of me.

37
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:31,980
I…

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,984
I'm so, so sorry.

39
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,326
Please get up.

40
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,709
You know, in the end,
you did still help me.

41
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,920
That couldn't have been easy for you.

42
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,015
What are you
so worried about, ma'am?

43
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:11,102
He likes her very much.
You should marry the two of them.

44
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,188
What do you mean?

45
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,984
Do you really think I came to you
to talk about a girl like that?

46
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,862
It's never going to happen.

47
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,573
I'll have to take care of my own son.

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,577
Just make sure you get Professor Jung.
How much incentive do you need?

49
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,997
I don't know.

50
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:36,544
Unfortunately, it's not that easy
to fix something that's such a mess.

51
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,717
Just make it happen, whatever the cost.

52
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,527
How have you been?

53
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,364
One minute.

54
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,742
What? Are you surprised?

55
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,952
I didn't expect to see you here.

56
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,665
Did you think that I'd be rotting
in a dirty prison cell?

57
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,751
Isn't that how it goes?

58
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,381
Causing such a scene
all for a woman like that…

59
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,842
Mr. Lee, you're such a fool.

60
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,846
If that's all you have to say,
I'm leaving then.

61
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,349
Yes, fine. I lost this round.

62
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,687
But now, it's time for round two.

63
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,149
So I guess we will have to see…

64
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,403
who wins this time.

65
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,554
I made sure
that Jin Yoo-hui was acquitted.

66
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,890
Well, good job.

67
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,475
However,

68
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,061
I've discovered something interesting.

69
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,732
I guess Eun-ju must have died

70
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,985
thinking she was
the only woman you ever loved.

71
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,238
Let's get one thing clear.

72
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:32,743
If Jin Yoo-hui gets in the way
of your presidential run or my daughter,

73
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,078
mark my words,

74
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,748
I'll make sure she regrets it forever.

75
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,990
Thanks to you,

76
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:15,077
I think Jun-ho has become
more confident in his Korean.

77
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,415
I think it's more than enough
to end tutoring now.

78
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,505
I've always been careful
not to trust people too quickly,

79
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,509
but how was I supposed to know
that someone who seemed so reserved…

80
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,595
…would betray my trust like that?

81
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,096
Mrs. Noh--

82
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,641
Ms. Seo, your approach
was wrong from the start.

83
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,853
You're a member of Rex, aren't you?

84
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,522
Oh, that's--

85
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,690
Let's stop beating around the bush.

86
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,069
I don't ever want to see you here again.

87
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,162
Thank you for your hard work.

88
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,749
I don't want anything from you.

89
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,461
I'm just thankful
for what Mr. Lee has done for me.

90
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,755
People can be so manipulative.

91
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,884
If you continue to meet with my son,

92
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,471
who's to say you won't try
to marry him like the rest?

93
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,560
But what makes you think that I would want
to get married again to Mr. Lee?

94
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,315
I've never even thought
about marrying anyone else.

95
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,111
And that's not going to change
in the future.

96
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,241
-There's no reason for you to worry.
-Ms. Seo, do you mean that?

97
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,576
Yes.

98
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,204
I'm glad to hear
you're thinking about this the right way.

99
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,249
I suppose
I'll have to take your word for it.

100
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,461
Let me just say goodbye to Jun-ho.

101
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,507
I'll tell him. There's no need for you
to contact anyone else in the family.

102
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,303
And this is compensation
for your work, so take it.

103
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,414
INCOMING CALL
MS. CHOI YOO-SUN

104
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,167
Professor Cha told his father

105
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,461
that he wanted
to marry Professor Seo Hye-seung.

106
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,928
There was a bit of an argument,

107
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,514
but what parent could deny their son?

108
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,560
I told them I also support the match.

109
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,481
I have no intention of marrying him.

110
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,693
Please find him a good wife.
One his father is happy with.

111
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,278
That's unexpected.

112
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,698
I have to say,
I do think he's the best match for you.

113
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,949
I don't.

114
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,243
You mean it's the best match for you.

115
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,874
Who's the person who wants to see me?

116
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,558
I told you,
you just can't beat me with the law.

117
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,396
I guess it doesn't mean much in Korea.

118
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,361
Did you bring me here
just to show me that she was released?

119
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,239
I arranged this meeting
so that you two could talk,

120
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,243
have a conversation,
a chance to make peace,

121
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,578
now that the storm has passed.

122
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,996
You want us to make peace?

123
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,208
Isn't that usually reserved for people
who actually deserve forgiveness?

124
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,503
I will never forgive that woman.

125
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,176
I have just one thing to say.

126
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,430
I don't know what kind of life
you're going to live,

127
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,808
but I hope just once,
you’ll be hurt the way that you hurt me.

128
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,438
You need to experience the hell
of your world collapsing.

129
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,107
Oh hell?

130
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,404
You must really believe
that you've hit rock bottom already.

131
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,823
But are you sure?

132
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,248
Do you want me to show you

133
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,626
what hell is really like?

134
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,129
Okay, then.

135
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:40,134
I guess we'll just have to wait and see
who will get there first.

136
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,941
What a shame.

137
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,279
I was hoping that I'd get to see
the two of you reconcile.

138
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,408
I'm glad to see you back so quickly.

139
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,454
Your father really is an impressive man.

140
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,414
Seo Hye-seung.

141
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,666
Lee Hyung-ju.

142
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,799
-What do you think will happen to them?
-I don't know.

143
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,470
The more you have to protect,
the weaker you become.

144
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:31,602
In that sense, it seems that
the situation is now all in your favor.

145
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,326
Stop talking
about Seo Hye-seung!

146
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,578
Don't be stupid
and just marry Jung Mi-jin, okay?

147
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:02,424
You know, I was pretty surprised
to find out I knew a Black Level member.

148
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,680
-So what?
-I'm just so glad to see you.

149
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,017
To my surprise, it turns out
that there is a decent man in this school.

150
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,227
Who knew?

151
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,813
Come on. Let's be friends.

152
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,360
Where are you?

153
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,989
Sure, let's try it.

154
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,627
It's getting colder, right?

155
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,173
I just met with Ms. Choi.

156
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,844
I heard that you fought with your father.

157
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,472
Yeah, but it's my fault.

158
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,018
And after what happened…

159
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,520
I know for sure now.

160
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,859
What I've been wanting
and looking for this entire time…

161
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,863
was you.

162
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,866
Don't say that.

163
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,161
You should marry a woman
your father approves of.

164
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,163
Don't keep fighting with him
because of me.

165
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,959
I've forgiven you now,

166
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,046
and I really do feel thankful.

167
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,505
Hye-seung, I just…

168
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,550
I would like to be by your side.
It's what I want.

169
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,056
In my life…

170
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,645
I've learned a can't rely on a man.
Even if I want to.

171
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,274
When my husband asked me
to get a divorce…

172
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,236
…it came as a complete chock.

173
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,407
I thought that I had accomplished
a lot in my life,

174
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,370
but it turned out I had lost myself.

175
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,543
Now I want to find myself again on my own.

176
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,923
So then…

177
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,385
what about Mr. Lee?

178
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,726
He's just someone I'm grateful for.

179
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,604
That's how I'll remember him.

180
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,586
MR. LEE HYUNG-JU

181
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,058
I'm sorry.

182
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,020
Something came up,
and I can't tutor you anymore.

183
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,314
I wish I could say goodbye in person.

184
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,316
I'm so sorry, Jun-ho.

185
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,112
-Hey, Dad.
-Yeah?

186
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,366
Did something happen with Ms. Seo?
Why'd she quit all of a sudden?

187
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,118
She just quit?

188
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,165
Mother, did you tell Ms. Seo to quit?

189
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,709
What'd you even say to her?

190
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,796
Embarrassing our family
and your company in public

191
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,717
in front of all those people.

192
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,636
Are you out of your mind?

193
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,722
I thought you knew
that she's a good person.

194
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,308
And then what about all those rumors
about Jun-ho's mother?

195
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,185
That has got nothing to do with this.

196
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,269
So?

197
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,981
You need to get married
to stop these rumors from spreading!

198
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,358
Why would Someone like you settle for her?

199
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,751
Ms. Seo,

200
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,046
I'm sorry for what my mother did to you.

201
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,548
It's all right.
You don't need to be sorry.

202
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,967
Jun-ho still wants you as his tutor.

203
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,347
-I'll find a way to make it work, okay?
-No, don't do that.

204
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,976
I want you to stop contacting me.

205
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,065
What? What do you mean by that? Why?

206
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,655
Because of you,
I have the courage to live my life.

207
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,450
I am so grateful for that.

208
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,579
But, I thought

209
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,666
you felt the same way as me.

210
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,668
Was that not true?

211
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,090
Tell me. There must be a reason why.

212
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,552
I just…

213
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,888
I want to live my life in peace
for a while.

214
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:08,605
Then, just maybe,
day by day, time will pass,

215
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,319
and eventually, I'll… I'll be satisfied.

216
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,114
I'll remember you

217
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,075
as someone who helped me

218
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,453
when I was at the lowest I've ever been.

219
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,666
Thank you so much.

220
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,999
I, Son Pil-young,

221
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,127
promise to you, the citizens,

222
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,297
who have lost their hopes and dreams,

223
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,343
I will end inequality and unfairness,

224
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,721
and promote fairness and justice.

225
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,308
I will make this country a place
where law-abiding citizens

226
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,477
can have a good life.

227
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,232
I, Son Pil-young,
promise I will make this happen.

228
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,526
Son Pil-young!
Son Pil-young!

229
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,365
Thank you for your help.

230
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,453
I guess you decided
to take my side, after all, huh?

231
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:52,751
I've never felt it before,
but is this what a father's love is like?

232
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,921
I get a bit emotional.

233
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,925
I want you to know
I'll never help you like that again.

234
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,635
You need to disappear quietly.

235
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,680
I never want to see you again.

236
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,526
THE 22ND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
MAJOR EVENTS

237
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,113
I never wanted to hold
that dirty hand of yours either.

238
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,159
Especially not after everything I've done.

239
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,417
Were you aware that I've dedicated
my entire life just to taking you down?

240
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,883
But not anymore, though.

241
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,805
I found someone
I want to destroy even more than you.

242
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,851
Lee Hyung-ju.

243
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,313
Help me bring him to his knees.

244
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,028
If the first half of my life
was pathetic thanks to a certain someone,

245
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,948
it needs to be brilliant from here on.

246
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,411
And you can become president,
just like you've always dreamed of being.

247
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,465
The day Lee Hyung-ju
is finally ruined, is the day…

248
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,136
you and I will become strangers for good.

249
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,738
Yes, Ms. Choi?

250
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,660
Please prepare a campaign donation

251
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,954
for Son Pil-young.

252
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,831
Yes, ma'am.

253
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,761
Nice shot.

254
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,262
Impressive skills.

255
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,393
You're rather impressive too,
considering your rap sheet.

256
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,063
Mr. Choi.

257
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,943
I'm aware you saw some profit from Hibull.

258
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,154
Are you satisfied with it?

259
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,492
Hyung-ju and I go back for decades.
What kind of question is that?

260
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,412
Then…

261
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,792
what is this clause doing here

262
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,921
on your own friend's contract?

263
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,298
IF THE M&amp;A FALLS THROUGH, LIONSOFT HAS
OPTIONS OF BUYING HIBULL STOCKS

264
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,803
Mr. Lee may not have caught it,
but it's so obvious to me.

265
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,720
This…

266
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,932
this is definitely a trap.

267
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,980
I know you're mad
that Hyung-ju rejected you--

268
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,314
Let's be honest.

269
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,610
I know what you're really interested in.

270
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,155
It's Hibull, isn't it?

271
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,909
Mr. Lee made you feel inferior
for a long time,

272
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,038
so now you're planning on taking him down
and claiming your victory.

273
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,126
Am I right?

274
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:30,135
Wow, you bought up quite a bit
by using different names.

275
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,429
Well…

276
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,474
I'm sure you know where to find me.

277
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,392
That is, when you're ready.

278
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,077
CEO CHOI SUNG-JAE'S
BORROWED-NAME STOCK ACQUISITION OF HIBULL

279
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,900
Okay, thank you.

280
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,889
Hello, my name is…

281
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,020
Seo Hye-seung.

282
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,355
For the next three weeks,

283
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,732
I'll be lecturing
on Leadership in Mythology.

284
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,491
What is the study of humanities?

285
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:17,951
It's like

286
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,039
stopping for a moment
to raise your head and look up at the sky.

287
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,585
It may seem like you're taking a break,

288
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,671
but you're actually looking
at the North Star

289
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,258
to help you understand
the direction in which you're facing.

290
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,805
Professor Seo.

291
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,812
Have you…

292
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:47,856
been well?

293
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,025
Yes.

294
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,486
Has Jun-ho been doing well?

295
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,741
Well, he's a bit sad
that he doesn't get to see you anymore.

296
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,953
Please tell him that I'm sorry.
And that I'm always rooting for him.

297
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,043
I really liked your lecture today.
It was fun.

298
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,794
Glad to hear it.

299
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,590
I'm glad I didn't waste your time.
I know you're a busy man.

300
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,553
Do you…

301
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,431
want to get dinner?

302
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,476
Today, I…

303
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,061
Professor Seo.

304
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,147
We should go. We're late.

305
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,318
Oh, we're just meeting
with the department chair.

306
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,863
Can you give me a second?

307
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,039
Hye-seung wants to stand
on her own from now on.

308
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,500
Please respect her wishes.

309
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,336
Pretty sure that's none of your concern.

310
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,505
I don't want to give up on her yet.

311
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,257
We do have a lot in common.

312
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,177
I know that she was your first love, but…

313
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,388
don't cross the line.

314
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,640
You let me worry about that.

315
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,939
See you at the next lecture. Let's go.

316
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,401
Ms. Seo.

317
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,470
Thank you for getting me out of there.

318
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,055
Mm-hmm.

319
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,016
Want to get dinner?

320
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,730
I can't. I need to get home.
Min-ji's waiting. Good night.

321
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,440
Night.

322
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,382
Please, sit.

323
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,057
So I take it that you feel ready now.

324
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,018
I think so.

325
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,858
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

326
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,861
If the two of you join forces,

327
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,197
then you might as well
be owners of Hibull already.

328
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,324
Let me help you with that.

329
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,284
I have a question for you.

330
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:51,706
I heard that you were briefly
in a relationship with him.

331
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,291
Why are you doing this?

332
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,543
Are you just looking for revenge?

333
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,253
Mmm…

334
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,760
I'm not the type
to let others get the best of me.

335
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,639
And of course, there's the money.

336
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,142
Well, then.

337
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,604
Let's hear the game plan Ms. Jin
has prepared for us.

338
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,419
You should be careful.

339
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,046
Why?

340
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,924
She still wants Lee Hyung-ju.

341
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,010
It's just a feeling.

342
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,059
I heard you gave us
a very generous donation.

343
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,394
Thank you very much.

344
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,648
It's the supporters like yourself
who keep this campaign strong.

345
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:04,070
I hear your approval ratings are high.
Allow me to offer my congratulations.

346
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,656
You know I always support
the winning side, Congressman.

347
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,325
Oh my.

348
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,413
I came here
because I was curious about something.

349
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,876
Your thoughts
on Mr. Lee Hyung-ju's future wife.

350
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,088
I don't know.
I thought that was your job.

351
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,424
Aren't you in charge of his marriage?

352
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,175
Everyone wants him.

353
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,137
I'm just here to guide him
in the best possible direction.

354
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,805
And given that

355
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,350
the outcome of the situation
depends on what you want,

356
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,936
I have no choice but to come and ask you.

357
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,481
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

358
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,277
Well, as far as I'm aware,
you have two choices.

359
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,988
One of those choices, Ms. Jin,

360
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,909
could be a major risk factor
in this upcoming election.

361
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,705
I'm sorry, but in my line of work,

362
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:59,000
you end up finding out everything
about your members.

363
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,587
And in today's society,

364
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,466
information is most valuable.
Even more so than money.

365
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,972
What do you want from me?

366
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,768
Your right-hand woman, Go Ae-ran, asked me

367
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,939
to make sure that her daughter
is the one who marries Mr. Lee.

368
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,778
I was just wondering
if maybe you might feel the same way.

369
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,576
So that's what this is about.

370
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,121
Okay, I see what you're getting at.

371
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,583
I'll definitely keep it in mind,

372
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,877
since you're interested
in my election, that is.

373
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,514
Why don't you ask Professor Jung
to marry you?

374
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,099
Why do you keep trying to make…

375
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,605
Father.

376
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,566
It's my marriage.

377
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,736
I'm not interested in her.

378
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,490
If you marry her,

379
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,076
I promise
I will give you everything I own.

380
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,787
That was your mother's wish, right?

381
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,708
I mean, how many children do I have, huh?

382
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,084
You're all I've got!

383
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,045
All I want is for you
to marry a girl from a good family.

384
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,632
And then you can finally start building
a family of your own.

385
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,428
Then you should have treated my brother
a little better.

386
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,640
If he hadn't died like that,

387
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,601
he'd have been a good son to you.

388
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,529
You don't need
to take on your brother's duty.

389
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,699
You can get married…

390
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,706
to Seo Hye-seung if you want.

391
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,833
Keep your nose
out of our family matters.

392
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,294
I'm going to take care of Mr. Lee.

393
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,296
Whether it's Jung Mi-jin or not.

394
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,131
Just get to the point.

395
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,509
Your inheritance.

396
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,219
Give it up.

397
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,890
You can't have everything in life.

398
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,517
Let's each of us get what we require

399
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,353
for our own happiness.

400
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,029
Fairly…

401
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,158
and peacefully.

402
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,923
-Min-ji, what about breakfast?
-I'm late! I can't!

403
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,132
-Wait, wait!
-Bye!

404
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,676
Here. Hey, drink this at least.

405
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,557
Have fun at school.

406
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,685
-I'm late! Come on!
-Okay.

407
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,729
See you later.

408
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,023
Okay.

409
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,777
The body of Choi Myeong-u,
former CEO of TX Engineering,

410
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,530
was discovered
in the Han River near Mapo Bridge.

411
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,491
The contents of a will
sent to a news station before his death

412
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,744
reveal details that Mr. Lee Hyung-ju,
CEO of Hibull,

413
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,663
the largest gaming company in the country,

414
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:28,376
forced Mr. Choi to give false testimony
against a lawyer identified as Ms. Jin.

415
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,463
Public opinion of Mr. Lee
is becoming increasingly critical

416
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,425
as a result of Mr. Choi Myeong-u's suicide
in the Han River.

417
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,262
On top of this,
rumors regarding Mr. Lee's sponsorship

418
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,305
of celebrities
and relationships with women

419
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,100
are spreading
on several private financial editorials--

420
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,365
Yeah.

421
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,039
Mr. Lee, the pension department

422
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,625
is demanding
an emergency shareholders meeting.

423
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,419
Regarding what exactly?

424
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,046
Your removal as CEO, sir.

425
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,179
You violated the duty of good faith

426
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,098
in the swap agreement
executed by both companies, Mr. Lee.

427
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:29,896
And your actions caused the sudden drop
in Hibull stocks, including our share.

428
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:35,026
The stock price will be normalized
once the rumor turns out to be false.

429
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:39,030
The takeover with Apple
will go over without a hitch.

430
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,366
No, our assessment is different.

431
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,953
We demand that you stand down as CEO
until things calm down.

432
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,206
Pardon?

433
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,333
And I suggest our mutual partner,

434
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:54,086
Mr. Choi Sung-jae, execute the duties
of CEO in the meantime.

435
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,231
Hold on. What's your business here?

436
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,609
I'm here to meet with Mr. Lee Hyung-ju.

437
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,402
I have something urgent to tell him.

438
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,322
I wasn't notified of this.
Do you have an appointment with him?

439
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,039
Ms. Seo.

440
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,042
Ah.

441
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,001
Hello there.

442
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,920
Oh,
are you here to see Hyung-ju?

443
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,130
Yes.
I have to tell him something.

444
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,466
Uh,
Hyung-ju's super busy right now.

445
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,510
I'm pretty sure you can't talk.

446
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,179
I can tell him to call you later
if that works for you.

447
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,392
-Yes. Thank you.
-Sure.

448
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,609
-Mr. Ju.
-Oh, Ms. Jin.

449
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,780
Do you know what Mr. Lee is gonna do?

450
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,992
Uh, he said he's going
to see Congressman Son.

451
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,287
-Oh, is that right?
-Yeah.

452
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,099
You know,
you were very rude to me that day.

453
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,603
-I'm sorry, sir.
-So what are you going to do now?

454
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,233
If you give up control of the company,

455
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,653
it won't be easy to get it back.

456
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,072
That's why I wanted to ask you

457
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,118
if I could possibly use your authority to…

458
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,579
to help me take care of this issue.

459
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,414
Hmm.

460
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,667
Could you do that for me?

461
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,256
All right.

462
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,176
I'll set things in motion.

463
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:12,475
After all, I made you
with the scholarship foundation I built.

464
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,187
I can't just sit and watch you crumble.

465
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,314
Thank you very much, sir.

466
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,649
One condition.

467
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,113
You'll get married to a woman I choose.

468
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,575
What? What are you talking about, sir?

469
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,286
All of this happened because of one woman.

470
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,165
If you want to address
the root of the problem,

471
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,793
you need to marry someone suitable.

472
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,002
Can you understand that?

473
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,091
If you're talking
about Professor Jung Mi-jin,

474
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,759
there's someone else I'm interested in.

475
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,845
Oh, right on time.

476
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,932
Did I miss anything

477
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,976
Well, hello, Mr. Lee.

478
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,858
Gosh, look at you.

479
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,985
The two of you look great together.

480
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,489
I'll talk with the chairman
of the pension fund,

481
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,574
so don't you worry about anything.

482
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:15,496
An excellent businessman like you
shouldn't be mixed up in such rumors.

483
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,790
Sir, I didn't come here
to talk about marriage.

484
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:22,128
Ms. Jin is someone who is very dear to me.

485
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,004
She's talented too.

486
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,508
I thought you would be
a great match for her,

487
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,802
so I've had my eye on this
for a while now.

488
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,764
Oh, would you look at the time.

489
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,392
Well, you two talk.

490
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,686
Take good care of him.

491
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,396
Yes.

492
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,927
HIBULL LEE HYUNG-JU

493
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,971
LEE HYUNG-JU

494
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,224
HIBULL STOCKS PLUMMET
OVER LEE HYUNG-JU'S RUMORS

495
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,813
LEE HYUNG-JU IN TROUBLE
PERSONAL LIFE WRAPPED UP IN RUMORS

496
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,733
HIBULL STOCKS CONTINUING TO NOSEDIVE
OVER THE CEO-RELATED RISK

497
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,282
What do you think you're doing?

498
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,161
What's your relationship with him

499
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,872
that he's going to these lengths for you?

500
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,749
He's…

501
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,961
he's like a father figure to me.

502
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,300
Does that matter right now, though?

503
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,512
What's your move?

504
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,389
Are you really going to let yourself
fall off the cliff?

505
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,307
Or…

506
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,559
take my hand?

507
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,239
Mr. Choi Sung-jae.

508
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,699
How much do you trust him?

509
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,845
Just a moment.

510
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,271
Hyung-ju!

511
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,660
You son of a bitch.

512
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,516
MOTHER

513
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,733
-Please, eat.
-Looks lovely.

514
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:38,324
Oh, there you are!

515
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,327
Long time no see, sir.

516
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,997
Your mother was kind enough
to invite me here to join you.

517
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,542
Last time, you left without saying hello
because you were too busy.

518
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,961
Why don't you say hi to Professor Jung?

519
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,463
Hello there.

520
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,049
I haven't seen you since that party.

521
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,552
We didn't even get a chance
to speak that night.

522
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,432
I hope you ladies
have a wonderful rest of your evening.

523
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,774
Well, please excuse me.

524
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,459
Mother, why do you
have to act like this too?

525
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,878
Calm down, please.

526
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,632
Do you think I wanted
to do this right now?

527
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:40,177
-All of this is for you--
-Just stop it, please!

528
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,179
I feel like I'm losing my mind here.

529
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,483
They came all the way out here. Please…

530
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,736
I want you to think about my reputation.

531
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,655
I beg you.

532
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,048
Yeah, school just let out.

533
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,634
What'd you make for my birthday?

534
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,721
Japchae and galbijjim?

535
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,723
Wow! On my way!

536
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,619
I'm afraid that my mother
caused all this trouble herself.

537
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,537
I'm so sorry.

538
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,458
You must be stressing out
about work these days, aren't you?

539
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,628
So propose to me.

540
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,132
You need me, don't you?

541
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,390
I'm sorry, but I already have feelings
for someone else.

542
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,309
Feelings?

543
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,397
Go ahead and have feelings.

544
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:20,903
I've been in love before too.
They always change in the end.

545
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,698
You know that already, don't you?

546
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,703
I prefer things that don't change.

547
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,121
Like contracts.

548
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,583
We'll have a partnership.

549
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,835
A sound agreement
with a marriage contract.

550
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,964
What do you say?

551
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,761
They look so good together.

552
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,429
Absolutely.

553
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,475
"A match made in heaven".
The phrase really seems to suit them.

554
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:53,936
Oh.

555
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,523
Would you like another glass of wine?
Maybe with dessert?

556
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,192
That sounds lovely.

557
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:07,950
Apparently, Congressman Son told Mr. Lee

558
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,619
that he wanted him to marry Jin Yoo-hui.

559
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,332
Leave it to me.

560
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,251
Of course.

561
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,883
Mmm.

562
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,969
How'd you know it was her birthday?

563
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,971
It showed up on my phone.

564
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,598
-She's not here?
-Mmm.

565
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:32,933
Ah.

566
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,726
I wanted to give it to her myself.

567
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,187
She said she wanted a new phone.

568
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,610
Her mom's friend
can give her a present like this, right?

569
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,407
Yeah, thank you.

570
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,702
Have a good night, okay?

571
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,036
-I'll go.
-Okay.

572
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,373
Min-ji, where are you?

573
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,045
Yes, this is she.

574
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,425
What happened?

575
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,851
Doctor! Please,
you have to save my Min-ji, please!

576
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,061
-I can't have anything happen to her.
-Hye-seung, stop.

577
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,856
-Please save Min-ji!
-Hye-seung! Hye-seung!

578
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,733
Hye-seung!

579
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,692
Calm down.

580
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,777
Hye-seung! Hye-seung!

581
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,280
Min-ji!

582
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,659
It's okay.

583
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,620
It's all right now.

584
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,512
How could you?

585
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,556
Why would you do this?

586
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,767
Please have a seat.

587
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,811
I've dedicated decades of my life to you.

588
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,689
There's nothing
that I haven't done for you.

589
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,778
I even helped Jin Yoo-hui for you,
but now…

590
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,031
you're choosing her
over me and my daughter?

591
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,786
I'm sorry, but now…

592
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,790
the time has come
for me to reap what I've sewed.

593
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,874
I have no choice.

594
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,714
Do you…

595
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,968
think you can win this without me?

596
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,386
Ae-ran…

597
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,513
You need me by your side.

598
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,807
We need to succeed together.

599
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,519
If someone gets in my way…

600
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,230
well…

601
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,818
Choi Myeong-u won't be the last to go.

602
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,623
If she's in coma for more than two weeks,
we can't do much.

603
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,875
What exactly does that mean?

604
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,546
We'll see how things go.

605
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,592
Sir, please save her.

606
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,804
You have to. Please,
can't you do something to save her?

607
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,224
Yes. We'll do everything we can.

608
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,581
What's your move?

609
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,250
Are you really going to let yourself
fall off the cliff?

610
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,168
Or…

611
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:48,587
take my hand?

612
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,422
So propose to me.

613
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,882
You need me, don't you?

614
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,730
Did you meet with Congressman Son?

615
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,732
Is he gonna help?

616
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:13,737
Oh right.

617
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,239
Ms. Seo came by a few days ago.

618
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,702
What? Seo Hye-seung?

619
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,788
I think she was worried about you,

620
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,998
but I sent her away
to avoid any rumors.

621
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,292
You don't have the time
to meet with her anyway, right?

622
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,545
Why did you wait until now
to tell me that?

623
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,509
Min-ji?

624
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,952
Ms. Yoo, how did you get in here?

625
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,164
Your child almost died.

626
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,333
It's a miracle

627
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,794
she's alive.

628
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,006
