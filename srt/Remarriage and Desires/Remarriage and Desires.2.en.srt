1
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,181
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

2
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,364
I am so sorry.

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,744
I know there's nothing I can say
that will make you forgive me.

4
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,455
This decision

5
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,916
will not excuse what I did,

6
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,921
but someday I hope you'll understand
that I've accepted it.

7
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,340
Fully believing it is my fate.

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,803
I want to ask you for forgiveness
in my own way.

9
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,017
I'm leaving this world
holding the happy days

10
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,519
with you and Min-ji

11
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,813
close to my heart.

12
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,152
I'm sorry that I won't be able
to care for you until the end.

13
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,572
Please take care of our Min-ji.

14
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,724
Bring my husband back!

15
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,309
Tell them you set him up!

16
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:45,396
Tell them the truth now!

17
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,148
Let me go!

18
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,359
Bring him back to me now!

19
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,695
Let go of me!

20
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,325
A person who doesn't
have anything left to lose,

21
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,618
has no fear.

22
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,566
Wait, Director.

23
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,445
Please just leave it there, Miss.

24
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,908
It's all right.

25
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,789
Are you okay? Are you hurt at all?

26
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,211
-No.
-You're here for a consultation, right?

27
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,130
Please come and greet our customer.

28
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,966
Well, then.

29
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,803
HIGH QUALITY MARRIAGE

30
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,144
Are you all right?

31
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,317
You seem to have already made
quite the entrance here.

32
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,448
Oh, it's okay. Don't worry.

33
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,618
Try to enjoy a warm cup of tea
and forget all about that.

34
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,580
Trust me, you've made a great decision.

35
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,959
Your mother asked me to go
and take especially good care of you.

36
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,628
Ms. Seo?

37
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,882
Is everything okay?

38
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,886
-Yeah.
-All right.

39
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,055
Let's try to relax and move on.

40
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,766
Oh!

41
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,851
Your education is quite impeccable.

42
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,979
You were a university lecturer,

43
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,148
now a teacher at a private school
with a daughter in middle school.

44
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,651
And your husband used to be an executive.

45
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,197
Your mother said
that he had recently passed away.

46
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,783
He must've been really sick. I'm so sorry.

47
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,454
Listen, your husband

48
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,498
is a disgusting rapist.

49
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,333
Jin Yoo-hui has tricked me

50
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,502
into covering up her tracks.

51
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,671
She used me.

52
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,047
Ms. Jin Yoo-hui, right?

53
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,853
So that woman back there.

54
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,400
What kind of man does a woman like that
plan on trying to marry?

55
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,069
Ah!

56
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,448
I'm sorry, but we value privacy here.

57
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,117
Besides, she's not one of my accounts,
so I don't know.

58
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,037
You know, in your case,
while you are quite beautiful,

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,332
you're older than our usual clients,
and you have a child as well.

60
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,001
It makes your options less than ideal.

61
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,252
Would you take a look at this?

62
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,255
Here is our member grading system.

63
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,758
Our male members our divided
into different levels

64
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,011
based on their assets, education,
and occupation.

65
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,389
Black Level members have assets
greater than 100 billion won.

66
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,975
Secret Level owns
between 50 to 100 billion.

67
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,978
Frankly, both of these levels
are a bit out of your range.

68
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,149
Normally, you can expect to be matched
with someone around the Platinum Level.

69
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,652
That said,
if you add another 20 million won

70
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,946
as an investment to upgrade yourself
to the Diamond Level,

71
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,783
you can meet wealthy men
with 50 billion won or more.

72
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,620
Did the woman earlier?

73
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,456
Does she have a higher ranking than me?

74
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,960
Regardless of how she has lived her life

75
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,171
or who she really is.

76
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,174
Oh, she…

77
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,802
Do you know her?

78
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,060
Ms. Seo.

79
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,193
You're pretty determined
to hold such a grudge.

80
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,862
I guess you're trying
to dig up some dirt on me?

81
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,781
Anyway,

82
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,075
why are you here?

83
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,454
No way. It hasn't been that long
since your husband died.

84
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,500
Shouldn't you be thinking
about your daughter?

85
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,880
If people like you can just come here,
why wouldn't I be able to do the same?

86
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,299
Say it again?

87
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,554
This place can overlook your past
as long as you pay enough. Is that right?

88
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,889
Look, I'm the one who should be upset.

89
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,102
But it's not like an apology
would be enough for me anyways.

90
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,812
He was guilty of a lot of bad things.

91
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,773
He got his money stolen
because he was conned by a woman like you,

92
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,526
and he lied to cover up your corruption.

93
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,654
And even stupidly abandoned his family.

94
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,908
That man has paid the price for his sins.

95
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,496
I guess that you came here
to meet a good man and live a happy life.

96
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,294
Do the people here know
about what you did in the past?

97
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,628
Ms. Seo.

98
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,425
You shouldn't try to drag my name
through the mud. It won't end well.

99
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,427
Hmm?

100
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,220
To be clear, this is a warning.

101
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,507
Jin Yoo-hui.

102
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,383
How could you do this to me?

103
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:33,095
I covered up for all the bribes you took
and even invested my stock with you.

104
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,139
Didn't you want to live together?

105
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,642
You said that you loved me.

106
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,352
So how can you call that rape, huh?

107
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,939
Because you forced me
by pulling your rank, remember that?

108
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,732
You threatened me with it.

109
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,364
Never forget what you just said to me.

110
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,533
I will remember

111
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,452
until the very end too.

112
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,625
You died because of that?

113
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,765
Hey there. It's me.

114
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,686
Was everything okay after I left?

115
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,564
Oh.

116
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,773
That's a relief.

117
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:31,487
Oh, by the way, that woman from earlier,
she seemed awfully familiar.

118
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,825
Did she happen to say
anything strange at all about me?

119
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,412
-Or anything like that?
-I'm not sure.

120
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,914
The executive director
handled her consultation,

121
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,499
but I'll check in with her.

122
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,751
Oh. Thanks.

123
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,175
Of all the places to go.

124
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,512
That bitch is crazy.

125
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,015
All I could do was call her out.

126
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,851
I don't know how to hurt her
like she did to me.

127
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,479
That marriage agency will try
to get her married no matter what.

128
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,858
They probably have quite a few members
with questionable pasts.

129
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,944
I don't think telling them the truth
will really do anything.

130
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,489
What power does the truth have
in this case?

131
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,825
But you can't let her
just get away with it.

132
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,548
Ms. Hwang, um, do you remember
that woman who broke that vase?

133
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,342
Oh, Ms. Seo Hye-seung?

134
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,720
Did she happen to say anything
about Ms. Jin Yoo-hui?

135
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,639
No. Why?

136
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,229
Did the woman earlier…
Does she have a higher ranking than me?

137
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,774
Now that I think about it…

138
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,026
What?

139
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,321
Do they actually know each other?

140
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:04,080
I checked
with the director. She didn't know you.

141
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,874
The woman didn't mention anything.

142
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:07,958
Really?

143
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,506
Well, I'll be seeking legal action
if anything happens.

144
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,715
So make sure you're certain.

145
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,093
Yeah. There's no reason to worry.

146
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,678
Bye.

147
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,391
It seems she might sue
if things get messy.

148
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,352
Who really cares?
Just say you saw nothing.

149
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,520
To Ms. Choi as well?

150
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,674
-Isn't this place awesome?
-Wow, it looks great.

151
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,427
-How about we start eating?
-Yeah.

152
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,223
-Ah, thank you, thank you.
-Mmm.

153
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,310
-Ah! This is incredible.
-Mmm!

154
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,105
When there's about 70 percent marbling
it is considered quality meat,

155
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,940
but this sirloin surpasses that

156
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,901
with 90 percent from the top one percent
of Korean cow.

157
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,738
Yeah? I heard this place was booked
until the end of this year.

158
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,781
Yes, we've been fully booked all year.

159
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,992
Who cares?

160
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:27,246
I reserved a private room
so that we can come whenever, you know?

161
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,206
For real?

162
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,501
Hey there!
Did you really start the feast without me?

163
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,627
-Oh, game boy!
-Hyung-ju.

164
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,421
Game boy, hey, you hungry?

165
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,673
Try a piece now. This godly cut here.

166
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,133
Thanks, but I already ate.

167
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,843
Besides, I'm here for the water.

168
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,344
All right, water it is.

169
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,556
-Sung-jae, you wanted to talk?
-Mmm.

170
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,682
Let's talk outside.

171
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,058
-Outside? Let's go.
-Yeah.

172
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,560
-Where are you going?
-Be right back.

173
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,314
Maybe Jin-su
actually has more money than us.

174
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,694
What did you want to talk about?

175
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,820
Hyung-ju.

176
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,489
What would you say to working together?

177
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,907
What do you mean?

178
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,077
My Lionsoft and your Hibull.

179
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,663
My company wants to invest.

180
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,458
Why would you even think
I would consider that?

181
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,709
Think about it.

182
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,880
When we were both studying in grad school,
we were working on Hibull together.

183
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,467
We only split up
because we had different goals.

184
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,803
PC games versus mobile games.

185
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,306
Right now, our two platforms
are dividing up the market.

186
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,434
That would mean our agreement
is totally meaningless.

187
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,937
The Chinese market
has become so massive too.

188
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,272
If we want to survive
in the international market,

189
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,358
our companies will have to compete.
Don't you think?

190
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,776
But I'm telling you,

191
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,111
if we join forces,

192
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,948
we'll be able to hold our own
In that gigantic pool.

193
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,407
How though?

194
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,536
You know, they're saying Action Blitz
is going on the market.

195
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,038
Wouldn't you want a piece?

196
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,042
Yeah, they're dinosaurs in the industry.
Elephants can't swallow a dinosaur.

197
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,627
That is why

198
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,463
I want the elephants
to band together to make a herd.

199
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,966
So then we'll have solid ground
to acquire them.

200
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,968
You can't be serious.

201
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,302
Don't worry.

202
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,138
Hibull would still
be under your management, of course.

203
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,640
Don't you trust me?

204
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,811
Action Blitz, huh?

205
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,024
If you have a detailed game plan prepared,
I'll take a look at it.

206
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,986
That's all I'm asking for.
Let's go back inside.

207
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,071
-So is that steak as godly as he says?
-Mm-hmm.

208
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,614
Absolutely.

209
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,241
Sorry.

210
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,826
Uh, how much was…

211
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,332
That's a huge difference.
Can't you just give me a little more time?

212
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,792
I promise I'll pay more next month.

213
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,211
Aren't you familiar
with a thing called market price?

214
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,338
This rent has been so cheap in comparison.

215
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,423
Even if I raise the rent,

216
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,384
it would still be less expensive
than anywhere else around here.

217
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,220
I'm really sorry,
but if you could just let this slide--

218
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,139
This was just a courtesy call.

219
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,390
Excuse me, ma'am.

220
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,259
BIRTHDAY FRIENDS
JIN YOO-HUI

221
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,381
MY TREASURE
SEO HYE-SEUNG

222
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,791
I'm here.

223
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:00,936
Hey, Mom.

224
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,774
How do you feel?

225
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,277
Seok-jin.

226
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,862
You're all right.

227
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,448
You're going to be all right.

228
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,036
Go to your… father.

229
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,371
Please recover…

230
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,208
…what's really yours.

231
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,627
Okay?

232
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,172
You can't let anyone take it away.

233
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,930
What the fuck is wrong with you?

234
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,098
Quit!

235
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,892
You little bitch!

236
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,978
Huh?

237
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,523
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Don't you know who I am?

238
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,860
Dad, stop hitting Mom! Stop hitting her!

239
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,987
-Go away!
-No! No!

240
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,031
Damn it, you little shit!

241
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,616
Stop it!

242
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,389
TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL CHURCH
MINISTER YANG JUN-MOK

243
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,562
My name is Choi Yoo-sun.

244
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,066
-Cha Yong-hwan's--
-Is my father-in-law coming, then?

245
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,820
Your father had an urgent meeting come up.

246
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,200
He asked me to come
and express his sincerest condolences.

247
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,451
I understand, Ms. Choi.

248
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,916
Thank you for coming.

249
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,641
Yeah.

250
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,852
How is Seok-jin?

251
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,813
Did you remember to tell him
that I miss seeing my son?

252
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,773
Yes, but, of course.

253
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,401
He just seemed to be pretty busy today.

254
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm just glad
that he was able to be there in time

255
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,865
as she passed away.

256
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,962
I've narrowed it down
to five people.

257
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,173
Isn't she the daughter
of the Minister of Justice?

258
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,509
Yes. I chose them for looks and education
rather than will.

259
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,094
That's very good to hear.

260
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,849
She's a doctor. That's good.

261
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,019
JUNG MI-JIN
NOVEMBER 1990, 32 YEARS OLD

262
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,605
MOTHER: GO AE-RAN
(SECRETARY OF CIVIL AFFAIRS)

263
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,565
She doesn't have a father listed.

264
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,818
But her mother is a government official
at the Blue House.

265
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,159
-Baek Jae-hui, the news anchor?
-Baek Jae-hui would be getting remarried,

266
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,244
however, she has no children
and is quite well known.

267
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,706
Her looks rank her high as well,
so her chances of success are high.

268
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,750
Be careful with this one.
If they end up marrying,

269
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,919
wouldn't that bring
a lot of media attention?

270
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,171
What do you think about Ms. Jin Yoo-hui?

271
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,589
While her family is ordinary,

272
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,675
she's a lawyer, very attractive,
and never married.

273
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,513
I strongly believe she has a high chance
because she's just so charming.

274
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,141
A Secret Level
whose parents have been divorced.

275
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,227
Her mother also runs a bakery.

276
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,481
You certainly made sure
to be thorough with this one, Ms. Kim.

277
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,774
Incredible. Well done.

278
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,858
Thanks.

279
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,485
Ms. Hwang.

280
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,154
He's a very important member.

281
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,615
Please make any needed changes
and take extra care of him.

282
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,116
Yes, of course.

283
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,202
Excellent job, everyone.

284
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,666
Hello. Welcome to Rex.

285
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,376
Hey.

286
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,754
This is for last time.

287
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,631
It's probably not enough,
but it's a start.

288
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,590
Oh.

289
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,511
Oh thanks. I'll make sure
that finances receives this.

290
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,513
Also…

291
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,394
I want to change my account manager
to Ms. Kim Ji-sun if I can do so.

292
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,854
Sure, I can see if it's possible.

293
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,782
Excuse me.

294
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,326
Mrs. Kim is currently at her limit

295
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,203
and is unable
to take on new members right now.

296
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,415
However, we can switch you
to a different manager if you would like.

297
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,917
Would you like us to do that?

298
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,964
Oh no. That's all right.

299
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,900
THURSDAY
SPEECH BY CEO CHOI YOO-SUN

300
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,242
Did they make a decision?

301
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,288
I promise that I've been trying my best,
but I think it's going to be difficult.

302
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,831
What's the problem then?

303
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,043
Ms. Choi prefers members
who come from good families.

304
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,545
Oh also,

305
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,631
Ms. Seo Hye-seung came in
asking to switch her manager.

306
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,176
-But why?
-I don't know.

307
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:28,638
I do know that she specifically asked
for me to be her manager.

308
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,018
So what? So then, what did you do?

309
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,188
Well, since I wasn't available,
she kept her original manager.

310
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,945
Could you arrange me a meeting
with Ms. Choi?

311
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,783
I'm sorry, but she doesn't meet
with anyone unless they're Black Level.

312
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,034
And so what?

313
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,705
I'm asking you to find a way
to meet with her.

314
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,794
"Life is a series of choices."

315
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,005
Many of you
have probably heard this too often.

316
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,050
Marriage, though, is also a choice.

317
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,470
And there are always consequences
that follow those choices,

318
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,057
whether it's a success or a failure.

319
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:17,521
Today, I want to talk about failure
and what it looks like in a marriage.

320
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,939
Let me ask you,

321
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,485
is divorce truly considered a failure?

322
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,948
Or is staying in a terrible marriage
that is filled with regret

323
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,367
the true failure here?

324
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,871
Divorce shouldn't be seen as a failure.

325
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,333
Divorce is an opportunity.

326
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,962
An opportunity that leads to victory.

327
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,005
An opportunity that

328
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,300
can lead to a successful marriage
with someone else.

329
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,347
It's not a marriage based on
the naivety of love,

330
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:58,562
but rather a business-minded choice
setting up the second stage of your life.

331
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,899
Marriage is a business decision first.

332
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,193
-Ms. Choi.
-Yes, please?

333
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,611
So are you telling us that money

334
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,738
is more important than love
when you remarry?

335
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,157
How's that right?

336
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,535
Shouldn't love always come first,
even if it's a second marriage?

337
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,039
Love. Yes, it is important.

338
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,833
Very important, in fact.

339
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:24,588
But instead of trying to change someone
to fit your standards,

340
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,676
you should look for someone
who already fits that criteria.

341
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,513
That is the smartest possible choice
you can make.

342
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,683
And the only path towards
a successful union.

343
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:48,904
SUCCESSFUL REMARRIAGE, VICTORY IN LIFE

344
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,616
Oh.

345
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,789
I'm really sorry about last time.

346
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,418
They told me that you just reimbursed us.
Thank you for that.

347
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,128
I only gave what I could.

348
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,549
I also heard
you cancelled your request for a refund.

349
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,134
That was a wise decision.

350
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,555
I guarantee that you will find
someone great through Rex.

351
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,807
Well then, goodbye.

352
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,603
Ms. Choi.

353
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,280
There's someone
that I want to triumph over.

354
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,536
So much that I want to kill them.
I hate her to death.

355
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,122
What can I do?

356
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,252
You have to become a woman who is…

357
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,170
who is feared.

358
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,089
How do I make them afraid?

359
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,092
With money.

360
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,636
Become wealthy.

361
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,680
But what If I can't do that?

362
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,057
Then try to show them love.

363
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,103
Keep an eye on that desire of yours.

364
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,272
It's greedy.

365
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,026
Until next time.

366
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,239
Ms. Choi?

367
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,792
How can I help you?

368
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,129
If you have the time, by any chance,
could I talk to you for a second?

369
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,048
I'm really sorry,
but I'm needed somewhere else right now.

370
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,843
If you need anything,

371
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,095
please bring it up
with the manager of your account.

372
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,910
I'm seeing you a lot.

373
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,123
What was it you were discussing
with Ms. Choi just then?

374
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,960
Is there a reason I should be reporting
my conversations to you?

375
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,212
You work at the university, don't you?

376
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,675
How would the school react
if they found out about…

377
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,304
what your husband has done?

378
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,269
Why don't we try to avoid any bloodshed?

379
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,284
When he first told me
that he was leaving me for you…

380
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,704
I thought he was pathetic.

381
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,791
But I had to let him go,

382
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,503
especially if that's how he really felt.

383
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,880
But how…

384
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,134
can it be that he fell in love
with someone like you?

385
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,721
In love?

386
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,184
He only loved my body.

387
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,564
Kang Nam-sik was a dirty rapist.

388
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,653
So you say a criminal

389
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,948
really jumped on their own

390
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,826
all while he was trembling in fear?

391
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,285
PUBLICATION CELEBRATION

392
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,370
Being considered
as a presidential candidate,

393
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,080
the actions
of ex-congressman Son Pil-young

394
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,957
are drawing much attention
to this election.

395
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,419
Many major figures in the ruling party
are in attendance at the publication event

396
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,338
for Mr. Son's
recently released book of poetry.

397
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,048
Some speculate that this may be a sign

398
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,760
that Mr. Son has plans
to return to politics.

399
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,516
Thank you.

400
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,186
Good afternoon, Mr. Son.

401
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,396
Chairman Cha sends me
with his warmest congratulations.

402
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,023
Ah, ah, yes, yes!

403
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,566
I'm Yoo-sun, his wife.

404
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,984
Oh, of course.

405
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,445
How has the Chairman been doing?

406
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,905
He's good. About the same as usual.

407
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,407
Good, I hope he gets well soon.

408
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,242
Please give him all my best, will you?

409
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,452
Mmm.

410
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,871
Welcome, director.

411
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,706
-I apologize.
-No, no.

412
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,167
Congratulations, Mr. Son.

413
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,962
Oh! Look who it is!

414
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,547
If it isn't the Ms. Choi.

415
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,382
Have you been well, Congressman?

416
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,967
Ah, the same as always.

417
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:08,473
Is there any way that my daughter
could be connected to a dynasty?

418
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,391
What would I need to make it happen?

419
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,561
Should I send her to some kind
of Ivy League school to get a master's?

420
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,940
An Ivy League education would not matter,
and neither would getting her master's.

421
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,233
What do you mean?

422
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,193
The mother-in-laws of those families

423
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:24,614
don't like it when their daughter-in-laws
are better educated than they are.

424
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,574
They would rather have girls
who will marry young

425
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,493
and who they can later send
to study abroad.

426
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,410
Oh.

427
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,995
Is there anything I can do?

428
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,707
You can try investing
in her physical appearance.

429
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,750
Oh.

430
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,919
Plastic surgery or skin care.

431
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,462
Pilates or ballet.

432
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:43,383
It would certainly give you an advantage
if you focus more on her looks.

433
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,677
Ah, now I see.

434
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,224
-Congratulations, Mr. Son!
-Looks like the big man's here.

435
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,978
The President wanted me
to express how touched he was

436
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,105
after reading your book of poetry.
It was very moving.

437
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,731
Big man on campus.

438
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,442
Isn't that Park Geon-yeong,
the secretary for civil affairs?

439
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,863
No, not Mr. Park.
It's the one next to him,

440
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:08,199
Go Ae-ran,
the senior secretary for civil affairs.

441
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,661
Some people say
that she's Mr. Son's right hand.

442
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,248
Apparently, she and his wife
are from the same hometown.

443
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:42,108
So you say a criminal
really jumped on their own

444
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,570
all while he was trembling in fear?

445
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,785
Ex-Congressman Son
continues to refuse comments

446
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,495
on his possible return to politics,

447
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,498
saying he wants to focus
on taking care of his wife, Choi.

448
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,169
How can you ask me about politics?
Not while my wife is so sick.

449
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,795
As of right now, I have no plans for it.

450
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,589
Mr. Son, give us a comment.

451
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,759
Any comment on the rumor of you running
for the presidential election?

452
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,554
-Please tell us about your plans.
-Do you have any comments?

453
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,436
Publishing the book
was pretty smart.

454
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,563
It made me happy.

455
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,274
Well,
it was pretty well written.

456
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,401
It's all thanks
to you, Ae-ran.

457
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,403
You're the one who inspired me.

458
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,739
That's really nice to hear.

459
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,410
I've always been grateful for you, Ae-ran.

460
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,091
My wife
has been very sick.

461
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:53,012
While I have been involved with politics
for nearly 30 years now…

462
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:57,600
When he becomes powerful,
does that mean we'll be powerful as well?

463
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,102
Truly belong to my…

464
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,771
And that's how I'll get my revenge.

465
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,440
But will that be enough, though?

466
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,402
Your revenge should be harsher.

467
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,324
And that's why you must marry
a Black Level member.

468
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,662
I'll seize the power,
and you'll seize the money.

469
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,416
That's how we regain control
of the Sangwon Group.

470
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,793
It is possible to…

471
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,713
So you said the first match
has yet to be chosen?

472
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,965
Yeah, but I'm at a disadvantage.

473
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,052
They'll probably want
to prioritize choosing someone

474
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,346
who still has both of their parents.

475
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,765
Express well wishes…

476
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,684
I spent most of my life trying…

477
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,812
…to fill a hole left by your father.

478
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,525
Even with that,

479
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,570
I need to be the first
to match with a Black Level.

480
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:55,158
If I can make that happen,
then I'm confident he will fall in love.

481
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,749
Did you meet with Son Pil-young?

482
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,001
What did he say?

483
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,961
He wanted to know how you were doing.

484
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,672
I didn't get to talk to him much.

485
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,134
The line was really long.
He's really popular nowadays.

486
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,761
Did he still remember me?

487
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,512
Have you ever met a politician

488
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,473
who forgets
where they got their money from?

489
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,018
He says that he's not running for office,

490
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,103
but he continues to host
these publication events.

491
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,606
Well, the election is coming up soon.

492
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:31,778
There's definitely no better way than that
to legally accept someone's cash.

493
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,366
Sir,
there's a guest here for you.

494
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,668
So. Did you give your mother
a proper send off?

495
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,047
Yes.

496
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,257
You did good.

497
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,093
How's your health going?

498
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,387
Well, my body's
been breaking down here and there, but…

499
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,058
it wouldn't be strange
even if I dropped dead tomorrow.

500
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,518
You shouldn't say that.

501
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,646
Hey, Father.

502
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,234
I'll move back in with you.

503
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,779
My.
Have you finally matured enough?

504
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,866
Now that you're older, are you starting
to understand how the world works?

505
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:26,541
He says that he's moving back
to live with us.

506
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,625
That's good to hear.

507
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,003
He has been thinking a lot
about his son lately.

508
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,215
But do you think
you'll be comfortable with us?

509
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,008
It can't be ideal
to come back living with us

510
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,718
when you've been on your own for so long.

511
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,220
That's really all right.

512
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,222
Since my mother is gone,

513
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,724
I should stay by my father's side.

514
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,519
Oh my.
That's perfect. Thank you.

515
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:51,482
It feels like things are finally heading
in the right direction.

516
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,706
Yes, who is this?

517
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,459
Yes, that's correct.

518
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,366
Thank you for taking the time to meet me.

519
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,620
My name is Go Ae-ran.

520
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,334
This is a good plot of land.

521
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,298
Since you work at the Blue House,

522
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,675
I assume it's easy
to run background checks.

523
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,303
Despite it being restricted,

524
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,722
the air is fresh here,
and it's close to Seoul.

525
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:09,143
It would be really nice to develop this
into a residential neighborhood.

526
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,901
Do you know why I'm here?

527
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,029
Do you?

528
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:25,660
Your daughter is as beautiful
as her mother is fearless.

529
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,662
I can get rid of the restrictions.

530
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,831
Just support my daughter.

531
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,877
I'm aware that the secretary's power
has quite a bit of authority,

532
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,754
but a huge development project

533
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:40,091
would oppose the current
administrations policies, wouldn't it?

534
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,638
The next regime
will be different.

535
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,974
I can promise you that.

536
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:53,020
Congressman Son Pil-young
has really taken a liking to Mi-jin.

537
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,232
She's like a daughter.

538
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,788
INCOMING CALL
DEPARTMENT CHAIR

539
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,040
Hello, Professor.

540
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,585
Hey, Ms. Seo.
Do you have some time today?

541
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,383
Yes?

542
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,013
-Hi.
-Welcome, Ms. Seo. Please take a seat.

543
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,350
Okay.

544
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,024
Did you get home safely?

545
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,318
Yes.

546
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,779
I apologize.
I had way too much to drink.

547
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,034
And said a lot
of unusual things that day, right?

548
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,663
I have good news for you.

549
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,375
There's an open adjunct position.
You can start next semester.

550
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,921
-Professor, I won't.
-And I told you I would do it for you.

551
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,549
I'm not the type of person
who can go back easily on his word.

552
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,510
Thank you so much, Professor.

553
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,972
Just recently, I snagged a project funded
by a corporation.

554
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,975
So I want you to lead students
on the upcoming project

555
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,728
in addition of giving lectures
to graduate students.

556
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,855
Ah, yes, sir.

557
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,107
Yeah?

558
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,527
Excuse me.

559
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,238
I almost forgot!
Welcome, Ms. Jin.

560
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,868
Ah, this is Professor Seo Hye-seung.

561
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,412
She will be leading the project
with the grad students.

562
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,041
Oh hey. It's really nice to meet you.

563
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,711
I'm Jin Yoo-hui.

564
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,256
It's actually
because of Ms. Jin here

565
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,259
that our department managed to secure
the project you'll be working on.

566
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,970
I've been getting stressed out
about my performance with the school.

567
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,056
Oh, it's no worry.

568
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,934
Honestly, we should be
the ones thanking you for helping out.

569
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,979
Hmm?

570
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,940
Oh hello, sir.

571
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,776
Oh what? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,195
Oh good. Yeah.

573
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,332
We meet again, Professor Seo.

574
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,171
Well, it seems you've done
a lot of research on me.

575
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,798
What do you mean research?

576
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,467
I was only trying to help you out.

577
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,639
I just happened to have a connection
in the company, and since I know you,

578
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,350
I figured it would be nice
if you were the one who got the job.

579
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,894
But why?

580
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,272
From what I heard, you were left sobbing

581
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,691
after your last company
fired you without pay.

582
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,735
Was it enough to live comfortably?

583
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,155
Enough to misinterpret
someone's kindness?

584
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,907
Kindness?

585
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,286
I don't think you have anything like that
inside of you.

586
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,709
It seems that I'm a big enough challenge
that you need to threaten me like this.

587
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,380
I don't have any trouble stopping
someone like you from getting in my way.

588
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,757
My guess is that you're also trying
to find a proper husband

589
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,342
for a lady like yourself.

590
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,723
But I wonder just how impressive
the man is that you're targeting.

591
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,643
Someone from a dynasty?

592
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,271
Well, that's just too bad.

593
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,733
There's no way that a family like that
would ever be able to

594
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,568
accept your scandalous past.

595
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,113
Seeing how your mouth's still running,

596
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,199
I suppose you still have yet
to learn your lesson.

597
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,665
If I were you, I'd be more worried
about your next paycheck than being tough.

598
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:51,300
You must really think that you're the one
who has me on a leash.

599
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,511
But you shouldn't kid yourself.

600
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,555
Because this time, I'm the one
holding the leash around your neck.

601
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,482
Oh ladies, I'm really sorry.

602
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,735
That call took much longer
than I expected.

603
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:10,653
Is that so?

604
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,931
Hye-seung.

605
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:43,936
Dear.

606
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,189
The land in Hanam.

607
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,317
Should we try to develop it?

608
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:54,405
No. There's a restriction
on the site I can't touch.

609
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,824
Maybe in the future,
it could be lifted for Seok-jin.

610
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,284
It could even last

611
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,996
until my grandchildren get older.

612
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,208
So were you going to pass it down
to your grandchildren?

613
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,252
Have you already planned that out as well?

614
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,337
Well, my plans don't matter.

615
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,798
I can't use it
if the country put a restriction on it.

616
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,135
What if I could loosen the restriction?

617
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,136
What?

618
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,806
How could you?

619
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,559
I guess you're free to give it a try.

620
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,768
If I succeed,

621
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,730
I would like a 50 percent stake
in the company

622
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,148
that would be developing the land.

623
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:34,278
You would, of course, still be making
a tremendous amount of profit.

624
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,488
And you'd have more than enough
to share with your son.

625
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,283
Even after giving me 50 percent
of the total earnings.

626
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,909
Absolutely.

627
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:52,046
JUNG MI-JIN

628
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,528
What is it now?

629
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,280
I have something for you that you'll want.

630
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,531
Ms. Jin.

631
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,034
You continue to cross the line.

632
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,750
What is this?

633
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,347
This is Congressman Son Pil-young.

634
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,016
Why on earth
would you show me this picture?

635
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,018
Tell me.

636
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,145
You will let me marry
a Black Level member.

637
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:18,465
I am Congressman Son Pil-young's
illegitimate daughter.

638
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,885
I'm handing you a knife with this picture.

639
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,888
Who you decide to stab with the knife…

640
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,144
is totally up to you, Ms. Choi.

641
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:49,121
We are not going to match anyone.

642
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,958
Instead, we are going to host a party.

643
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,919
Twenty male members from our upper levels

644
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,423
and 20 female members
that include those five there.

645
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,842
They'll have the freedom to choose,

646
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,219
and everyone will be
on an equal playing field.

647
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,681
Ms. Choi, as you already know,
our top members that would be included

648
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,934
are extremely opposed
to revealing their identities.

649
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,686
Especially Black Level members.

650
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,229
How can we do this?

651
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,607
Their identities will never be revealed.

652
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,026
It will be a totally anonymous party.

653
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,861
Everyone is required to wear a mask.

654
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,614
At the very end,

655
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,283
everyone will take off their masks
and reveal who they are.

656
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,994
But until then,
if anyone speaks about the event,

657
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,997
they'll be permanently expelled from Rex.

658
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,918
Make sure that everyone understands.

659
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,670
Now, let's get started.

660
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,215
SUPREME COURT

661
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,217
Is that so?

662
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,260
It's such a relief.

663
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,804
The competition was so strong

664
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,889
that I didn't think
you had much of a chance.

665
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,016
Now everyone is playing on the same level.

666
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,727
Just try your best
to show yourself off to everyone.

667
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,896
In my honest opinion,

668
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,148
I know you're gonna be
the most popular one.

669
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,443
Will that other woman be coming by chance?

670
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,155
Ms. Seo Hye-seung?
There's no way that she will.

671
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:09,368
This party requires certain qualifications
that she clearly doesn't have.

672
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,911
All right, then.

673
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,663
What? For real?

674
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,625
Oh yeah! I thought I couldn't go
because of my divorce.

675
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,254
Oh, for sure. I'll be the prettiest woman
in the entire room.

676
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,798
Yeah.

677
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,592
What do you mean a masquerade?

678
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,928
They didn't set you up
on a date by yourself?

679
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,722
What's really important
is that I meet someone.

680
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,101
So don't worry, Mom.

681
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,522
I'm Jung Mi-jin, all right?

682
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,408
SECRET MASQUERADE
YOU ARE INVITED TO OLYMPUS

683
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,877
I'm really sorry,
but I don't think I can go.

684
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,254
If I'm being honest,

685
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,883
this entire party
was planned specifically for you.

686
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,928
I can always recommend people to you,
but this way,

687
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,181
you can personally come and see
if there's anyone that you may like.

688
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,644
I'm not comfortable with events like this.
Plus, what are people going to think?

689
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,314
You won't have to worry
a thing about discretion.

690
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:24,026
But don't you think the whole masquerade
is a little too silly?

691
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,279
Let me be frank.

692
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,325
I think that we are all living
with masks on.

693
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,621
As we go through our lives,
we keep hiding behind them.

694
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,707
But as we're adding even more and more,

695
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,960
the masks start to reveal
who we truly are.

696
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:48,175
So by putting on a mask,
we're actually removing another mask.

697
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,678
When people see you,

698
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,431
they immediately start treating you
a certain way, don't they?

699
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:59,019
Do you think their treatment
shows their true feelings?

700
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,232
Wouldn't you want the chance
to meet someone

701
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,028
who is completely genuine with you

702
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,741
even when they know nothing
about your wealth?

703
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,783
If I had gone to college,

704
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,997
I think I would've been a professor
or a minister, certainly.

705
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,167
This kid got his intelligence from me.

706
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:06,461
Of course.

707
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,881
How old are you turning this year?

708
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,511
-Forty-two.
-Oh already?

709
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,973
And still not married?
What have you been doing?

710
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,519
Do you at least have a girlfriend
that you're dating?

711
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,688
Not yet.

712
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,942
You need to get married soon,
so I can hold my grandchild.

713
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,778
Come on, you're my only child.

714
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,114
Right. Please, eat.

715
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,116
Yeah, okay.

716
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:40,120
Set him up with someone for me, okay?
You're the professional here.

717
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,123
-Sure.
-And also…

718
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,502
Please, call her "mother" from now on.

719
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,466
There's only four years between us, dear.

720
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,803
Even with four years between you,
a mother is still a mother.

721
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,933
Come on, eat.

722
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,024
That must be Mr. Zeus.

723
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,414
Oh. Excuse me.
