Mr. Jiang,

33
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,970
thanks to you and CBBC

34
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,030
for your human and financial resources.

35
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,460
It has opened up

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,300
a new landscape

37
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,840
for our development.

38
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,820
It started with Zhilan Snacks.

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,860
This batch is one

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,380

traditional foods

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,140
with online and offline promotions.

45
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,660
It boosted

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,540
attention

47
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,820
and encouraged original brands

48
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,820
like Lanxi Winery

49
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,380
(Lanxi Wine)
to fully upgrade,

50
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,740
creating numerous

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,340
You flatter me.

55
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,740
I need to thank Mayor Yan
and Director Xia.

56
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,220
No, it should be

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,060
Vice President Xia.

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,220
CBBC gave us a third-party

joint loan plan,

60
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,060

62
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,300
provided a point of entry

63
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,580
for implementing

64
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,500

66

a complete development plan,

67
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,820
giving CBBC enough confidence

68
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,660
to offer nearly 80 million in loans.

69
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,380
Let's look forward

70
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,780
to injecting new vitality

71
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,780
into Lanxi Ancient Town.

72
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,500

73

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

Huijie Loan closely addresses the SME's

75

with online access.

77

(Huijie Loan)
With sectional approval,

78
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,820
it's more flexible and faster.

79
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,220
After this product is launched,

80
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,620
Tang Yang will get promoted, right?

81
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,580
Tang Yang

82
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,900
never considers this

83
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,340
before doing something.

84
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,340
In the program
at the Rongcheng branch,

85
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,260
Huijie Loan's convenience
and flexibility

86
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,660
have gained wide recognition.

87
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,940
I fell asleep.

88
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,420
Here are your boxes.

89
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,980
- Thanks, sir.
- Thanks.

90
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,580
- Good.
- You can head back now.

91
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,540
Okay, bye-bye.

92
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,020
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

93
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,740
Your timing

94
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,180
is just right.

95
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,740
You got off the train,

96
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,140
headed straight to the airport,

97
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,220
and picked me up so we'd

98
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,180
go back together.

99
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,860
Why go through all that trouble?

100
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,980
We could just meet

101
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,820
at one place.

102
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,180
That would be a big loss.

103
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,740
I'd see my girlfriend an hour later.

104
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,220
Why not have Mr. Liu

105
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,500
take you home first?

106
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,780
I need to go upstairs.

107
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,980
Why do you come upstairs?

108
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,660
To drop off a boyfriend

109
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,500
for our Tang.

110
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,380
Wait. I'll grab something.

111
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,220
What's this?

112
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,100
A gift for you.

113
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,540
Why do you need to give me a gift?

114
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,540
You don't...

115
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,860
You know why I had

116
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,220
to rush back today, don't you?

117
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,340
Seems I forgot.

118
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,540
Today is our

119
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
200-day anniversary.

120
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,820
You remember.

121
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,140
I left it here before I went

122
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,340
to Lanxi Ancient Town.

123
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,140
Of course, I knew

124
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,300
you'd rush back today.

125
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,620
Let's open my gift first.

126
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,020
Why are you giving me perfume?

127
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,140
Because I saw Yanan

128
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,940
recommending some

129
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,500
special scented perfumes

130
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,220
in her makeup videos.

131
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,300
There's one that smells

132
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,420
like gingerbread.

133
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,820
I thought

134
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,460
it'd be perfect

135
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,500
for you to wear

136
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,780
at the company

137
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,780
since it gives off

138
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,940
an "I smell delicious" vibe.

139
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,620
I don't want others to think

140
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,460
I'm delicious.

141
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,300
Annoying.

142
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,860
Let me see yours.

143
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,140
These two are a pair.

144
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
A pair of bowls?

145
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,100
Yes, hand-painted.

146
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,860
Why are you giving me bowls?

147
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,060
Earlier you said

148
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,860
you swore

149
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,980
that as long as you have a bowl of rice,

150
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,020
I'd have a bowl to wash.

151
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,740
Isn't this fulfilling our promise?

152
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,580
It's quite special.

153
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,140
Are these zodiac signs?

154
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,980
Yes.

155
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Jiang Shiyan.

156
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,500
Son.

157
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,980
Jiang Shiyan.

158
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,740
Son?

159
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,540
I'm coming in.

160
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,610
Jiang...

161
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,100
What on earth did you buy?

162
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,340
These are for Tang.

163
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,500
She's going to prepare

164
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,340
the dowry.

165
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,180
I'm taking my time.

166
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,260
I was going to pay,

167
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,140
but she wouldn't let me
and argued about it.

168
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,140
What are you saying?

169
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,660
How can you buy these?

170
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,580
These should be prepared by the bride.

171
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,020
Let me tell you.

172
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,940
In the future,

173
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,810
I want to replace

174
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,660
everything in their new house

175
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,980
with the best,

176
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,060
soft, and fluffy

177
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,540
cotton products.

178
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,740
We don't need any of the old stuff.

179
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,580
All new ones.

180
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,980
Do you have clothes to be washed?

181
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,420
I'll throw them in the machine.

182
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,780
No. No need to worry about it.

183
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,660
I'll do it myself.

184
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,380
Some clothes need to be dry-cleaned.

185
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,620
Okay.

186
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,260
I'll wash some jujubes.

187
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,140
Wash yourself now?

188
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,300
Yes.

189
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,060
Mayor Yan brought me jujubes

190
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,900
from the town,

191
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,500
saying they're sweet.

192
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,860
I'll wash some for you.

193
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,420
Jiang, if you make
another pun like that,

194
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,580
I'll really fine you.

195
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,740
Mom, what's wrong?

196
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,100
Jiang Shiyan,

197
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,740
are you back?

198
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,940
I'm back.

199
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,940
Then hurry home.

200
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,700
I have urgent news for you.

201
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,260
What's going on?

202
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,340
Anything wrong?

203
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,140
It's nothing.

204
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,700
I just have urgent news for you.

205
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,580
Tang is on a business trip.

206
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,300
(Yi Fangping)
Why are you out?

207
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,700
Hurry back home.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,310
What's going on, Aunt Yi?

209
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,700
Tang?

210
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,100
You're with Jiang Shiyan?

211
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,140
Yes, I'm back.

212
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,660
Jiang Shiyan picked me up.

213
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,020
Now we're together.

214
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,380
Is there something urgent?

215
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,620
Should I let him go back?

216
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,660
No, no, no.

217
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,220
No, no, it's nothing.

218
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,180
It's nothing.

219
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,020
Nothing urgent.

220
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,860
Tang, listen.

221
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Tell Jiang Shiyan

222
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
not to wander around

223
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,300
and to stay with you.

224
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,900
(Yi Fangping)
He can come back anytime.

225
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,860
It's okay if it's late.

226
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,700
Tang, that's it.

227
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,660
I'll hang up now.

228
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,820
Well.

229
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,340
Why do I feel something's off?

230
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,380
Why don't you go back?

231
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,660
- What's wrong?
- You eat.

232
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,500
I'm not eating.

233
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,140
They're for you.

234
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,820
Mom.

235
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,460
Why are you sleeping here?

236
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Don't catch a cold.

237
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,620
I'm exhausted today.

238
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,180
I sat here for a bit

239
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,660
and thought about things

240
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,060
until I fell asleep.

241
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,020
What's on your mind?

242
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,020
Today,

243
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,540
I went shopping with Ms. Zhou.

244
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,460
My legs are about to break.

245
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,380
Do you know

246
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,740
what we went to buy?

247
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,020
What did you buy?

248
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,420
She bought a whole bunch

249
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,380
of bedding items.

250
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,220
Sheets, covers,

251
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,340
and silk comforters.

252
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,740
A ton of stuff.

253
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,700
I said I would pay,

254
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,100
but she refused.

255
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,580
She even said

256
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,260
the things she bought

257
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,620
were for moving

258
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,460
into the new house later.

259
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,180
She talked about furniture,

260
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,220
curtains, the kitchen, and so on.

261
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,060
The bride's side

262
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,020
should cover all that.

263
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,820
Oh what?

264
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,300
I...

265
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,260
What's wrong with it?

266
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
I can't say "Oh" now?

267
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,940
They're preparing her dowry,

268
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,980
saying it's going to be moved
to a new house.

269
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,140
Mr. Jiang Shiyan, may I ask

270
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,540
where's your new house?

271
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,140
Will you live here

272
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,260
after getting married?

273
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,660
Mom, Tang and I have been

274
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,300
too busy these past six months

275
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,460
to take care of that.

276
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,140
So, tell me.

277
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,780
When are you not busy?

278
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,780
- I...
- This is a new house.

279
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,020
Not groceries

280
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,300
or flowers that I usually buy.

281
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,420
Buying a house

282
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,580
should take some time.

283
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,500
If you find a pre-sale property,

284
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,540
you may have to wait a year

285
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,940
for it to be delivered.

286
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,940
You haven't made any arrangements.

287
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,340
What will her parents think of me?

288
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,700
Will they think

289
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,620
you lack sincerity

290
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,980
or that you don't want

291
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,020
to get married at all?

292
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,180
Mom, you know

293
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,980
Uncle Tang and Ms. Zhou.

294
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,020
Would they think that way?

295
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,260
The two families are so close.

296
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,180
They are fine with it.

297
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,020
Can't you think about it?

298
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,420
You're mistaking
their politeness for goodwill.

299
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,140
Take this card.

300
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,660
I prepared some money for you.

301
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,380
Starting tomorrow,

302
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,660
take Tang

303
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,060
to look

304
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,900
at one property

305
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,100
after another

306
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,540
and make sure it's one she likes.

307
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,820
Mom, how can I take your money?

308
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,660
Keep it for yourself.

309
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,740
I have money.

310
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,900
I know you have money,

311
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,260
but this is for your wedding.

312
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,420
I'm the mother-in-law.

313
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,860
Don't I need

314
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,420
to contribute?

315
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,460
People will think

316
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,620
I, Yi Fangping,

317
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,820
am uncouth.

318
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,660
You're silly.

319
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,780
You know?

320
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,540
I used to run a seafood business.

321
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,980
I saved quite a bit of money.

322
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,100
You didn't ask me

323
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,380
for money to buy this house.

324
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,060
Though I haven't been
in business for years,

325
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,420
I still have rent coming in

326
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,260
from my shops

327
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,500
and stalls.

328
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,020
I have money, alright?

329
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,860
This money is for Tang,

330
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,700
and you must tell her

331
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,940
never to think

332
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,020
that because I gave you money

333
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,060
for your house,

334
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
I'll be living

335
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,540
with you.

336
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,380
Wrong.

337
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,180
You're a young couple.

338
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,460
I won't interfere.

339
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,020
I'm fine living here,

340
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,860
close to Ms. Zhou's place.

341
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,860
We can dance and play cards.

342
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
And the garden.

343
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,220
It's all my territory.

344
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,380
I absolutely will not move,

345
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,220
so don't ask me to.

346
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,340
Mom,

347
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,940
you're overthinking it.

348
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,820
You know Tang very well.

349
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,820
How could she worry

350
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,060
about what you're saying?

351
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,340
The reason why I didn't buy a house

352
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,980
is to leave a spot open

353
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
for Tang to pick

354
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,020
the one she likes.

355
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,980
But in the past six months,

356
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,940
I've been busy
with funding and contracts,

357
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,980
and Tang has also

358
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,820
been very busy.

359
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,780
We were swamped.

360
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,340
I don't care.

361
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,820
Work can never

362
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,140
delay your personal matters.

363
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,220
It's the other way around.

364
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,820
Anyway, listen.

365
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,860
I'm notifying you

366
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,420
that within a week,

367
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,140
I must see tangible results
of your house purchase.

368
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,540
Otherwise,

369
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,660
I'll take Tang

370
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,740
and go buy a house.

371
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,580
Take it.

372
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,500
I thought you couldn't make it

373
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,260
to say goodbye to Rover.

374
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,900
I almost couldn't,

375
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,460
but I canceled a job.

00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,500

452
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,420
Do you know the video

453
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,460
I posted yesterday?

454
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,500
I know.

455
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,860
They said I plagiarized.

456
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,140
Who did I copy?

457
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,460
Alright, you didn't plagiarize.

458
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,420
Why are you getting upset?

459
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,020
Didn't you say

460
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,660
they get mad, not you?

461
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,220
Besides, if you

462
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,460
get angry about this,

463
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,500

467
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,340
No, you didn't.

468
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,340

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,700
Well.

470
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,860

471
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,620
for cooking at night?

472
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,020
You want to eat them?

473
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,260
No, I don't.

474
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,500

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,180

481

482
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,220

484
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,940

If someone attacks me,

486
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,980
he fights back for me.

487
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,180
His name is...

488
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,000
XQBB.

489
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,500
He's probably just

490
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,820
a very devoted fan

491
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
of yours.

492
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,060
Qi's dad.

493
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,260
XQBB?

494
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,860
Honey.

495
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,020
Okay, okay, okay.

496
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,460

497
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,660

498
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,540
Don't be angry.

499
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,940

500
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,820

501
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,180

502
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,700

504
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,770

505
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,640

506
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,860

507
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,260
- Okay?
- Okay. Kiss me.

508
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,020
Alright, let me take a call.

509
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,660
I'll take a call. Wait a moment.

510
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,500
Wait a moment.

511
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,220
Hello, Jiang Shiyan?

512
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,220
Go ahead.

513
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,140
No problem.

514
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,140
I'll contact you later.

515
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,580
What's wrong?

516
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,180
I have good news.

517
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,820
What is it?

518
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,940
Our 100,000 yuan

519
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,940
is settled.

520
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,780
What 100,000 yuan?

521
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,900
From No. 1 Bay.

522
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,380
You didn't let me sell the house.

523
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,380
You got upset over it.

524
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,220
Got a refund?

525
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,460
No.

526
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
Tang Yang and Jiang Shiyan

527
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,300
are house hunting.

528
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,380
Jiang called me to ask

529
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,220
about the listing.

530
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,340
So, you...

531
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,900
So, I'll recommend that place

532
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,220
to him.

533
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,740
It's a win-win.

534
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,460
He gets a house,

535
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,980
and we get our money back.

536
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,340
Plus, its price

537
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
is skyrocketing.

538
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,300
Well, that house

539
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,740
is really good.

540
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,300
So, it means

541
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,460
they've gone house hunting.

542
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,060
They're getting married?

543
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,620
No.

544
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,420
Of course.

545
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,820
Who looks for houses if not?

546
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,340
That's great.

547
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,300
I'm going to help Yang

548
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,180
pick a wedding dress

549
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,580
and choose the wedding venue.

550
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,420
I'm definitely going to be the best man.

551
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,940
What's wrong?

552
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,980
I think I ate too much.

553
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,340
It's fine.

554
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,700
Qi can sit in their car as a tradition.

555
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,060
Dear.

556
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,340
Are you...

557
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,620
You are!

558
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,220
Please come in.

559
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,780
Let me introduce this property to you.

560
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,540
The total area of this house

561
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,740
is 385 square meters,

562
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,420
with a usable area of 400 square meters.

563
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,060
What catches the eye is this

564
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,700
panoramic floor-to-ceiling window.

565
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,020
The view is incredibly open,

566
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,620
overlooking the entire riverside.

567
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,980
The best part is

568
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,860
the night view.

569
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,060
It's stunning.

570
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,580
This area here

571
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,780
is the kitchen.

572
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,780
All the appliances

573
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,980
are fully equipped.

574
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,180
What I like the most is

575
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,620
the island counter.

576
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,940
With fewer people,

577
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,100
it can serve

578
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,020
as a dining table.

579
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,900
With more people,

580
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,420
you can use that area behind you.

581
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,900
It can accommodate as many people.

582
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,220
Every morning,

583
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,700
enjoying a cup of coffee here

584
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,740
is simply delightful.

585
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,500
The wine cabinet. You two can

586
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,860
have red wine every night.

587
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,300
How wonderful.

588
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,220
The best part is the bedroom.

589
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,260
The bedrooms

590
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,740
are on either side of the house.

591
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,860
Each room

592
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,140
has its own bathroom.

593
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,380
The master bedroom

594
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,300
even has a walk-in

595
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,540
wardrobe.

596
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,660
This area here

597
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,500
is the study.

598
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,820
Why look at me?

599
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,060
I know this house
like the back of my hand.

600
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,660
Okay? Stop the introduction.

601
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,500
Let me handle it.

602
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,700
Have you caught a cold?

603
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,620
I'm just upset.

604
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,460
What cold?

605
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,380
I'm not allowed
to buy such a great house.

606
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,100
Yang,

607
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,340
I'm telling you.

608
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,420
Your wedding dress

609
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,420
must be a long one.

610
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,500
There's one that's 12 meters long.

611
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,580
It's stunning.

612
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,540
Twelve meters? How will I walk?

613
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,420
Just walk forward confidently.

614
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,700
What if I fall?

615
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,020
Besides, when you walk,

616
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,460
there will be flower kids behind you.

617
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,380
I've chosen the flower kid for you.

618
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,700
Our Qi.

619
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,500
We didn't think about this at all.

620
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,340
How come you all planned ahead?

621
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,220
You have to think about it.

622
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,420
With a 12-meter dress...

623
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,100
The master bedroom.

624
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,860
Look how great it is.

625
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,020
This area here

626
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,100
is the walk-in

627
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,260
wardrobe.

628
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,100
Let me tell you;
this house is just good.

629
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,300
If we can't sell the house

630
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,020
at Rongcheng Duhui,

631
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,380
we won't have a quota.

632
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,620
We don't have a quota,

633
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,380
but I've paid a deposit of 100,000

634
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,260
for this house.

635
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
Just listen to me.

636
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,500
Buy this house.

637
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,100
The 100,000 deposit I paid

638
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,620
won't be forfeited.

639
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,740
No wonder you're recommending this one.

640
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,620
So, this is

641
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,460
your plan.

642
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,140
You're too petty.

643
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,460
Tang.

644
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,460
Tang.

645
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,700
What's wrong?

646
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,940
How do you like this house?

647
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,580
I think it's quite nice.

648
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,740
Should we go elsewhere?

649
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,220
No need.

650
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,500
Let me tell you.
I've compared the surroundings.

651
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,700
This house is the best.

652
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,660
Since they've done their homework,

653
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,660
I think we don't need

654
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,500
to look at each one.

655
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,580
Okay.

656
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,500
Let's just

657
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,740
buy it.

658
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,540
But your 100,000 deposit

659
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,020
will count

660
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,900
as our wedding gift.

661
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,460
When did you become so shameless?

662
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,820
Are we so close?

663
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,860
100,000 for a wedding gift?

664
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,300
When you married Yanan,

665
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,540
I gave you a gift.

666
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,980
He gave you a gift.

667
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,380
I gave Yanan a gift.

668
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,260
He gave Yanan a gift.

669
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,340
Adding it up,

670
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,060
we gave four gifts.

671
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,940
When we get married, do you have

672
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,020
to return four gifts?

673
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,380
Dividing the 100,000 by four,

674
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,220
after these years,

675
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,140
it's not much.

676
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,540
Yang,

677
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,580
you've really shown me

678
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,580
what good math skills

679
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,620
look like today.

680
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,060
That's terrifying.

681
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,260
- Come here.- What's wrong?

682
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,610
- Hurry.- What's wrong?

683
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,620
Sheng Nina.

684
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,220
- Sheng Nina.
- What happened?

685
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,700
What's going on?

686
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,460
(Breaking News)
Sheng Nina and Cheng Hui had breakfast.

687
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,660
It's trending online.

688
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,420
A female star

689
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,100
and Cheng Hui?

690
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
(The previous rumors might be wrong...)

691
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,660
This is your family's guest list.

692
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,740
You need to count

693
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,820
the people in the village.

694
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,780
You have to add this in here.

695
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,900
This is how many tables we have.

696
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,740
I know, I know.

697
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,660
This is what you have.

698
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,570
- I know.
- Hello.

699
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,100
Mom, Aunt Yi.

700
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,100
With this and that,

701
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,580
- it makes...
- You're back.

702
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,940
How did it go with that house?

703
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,900
We're about to buy it.

704
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,660
This time, you did it really fast.

705
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,500
Very good.

706
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,860
What are you two calculating?

707
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,220
We're calculating

708
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,140
how many guests we need

709
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,060
to invite to your wedding.

710
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,420
Count it now?

711
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,180
We haven't decided yet.

712
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,380
Once you decide,

713
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,820
we can send a mass

714
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,180
WeChat message.

715
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,140
That's more convenient.

716
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,420
Let me tell you.

717
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,180
It's quite convenient

718
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,260
in his grandpa's village.

719
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,060
It's a three-day open banquet.

720
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,380
Everyone in the village comes to feast.

721
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,180
I think we could do something like that.

722
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,020
Make it lively

723
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,060
for three days.

724
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,140
- Wait.
- Lively.

725
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
Excuse me.

726
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,300
Do we have to be present
for all three days?

727
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,620
- Yes.
- Of course.

728
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,740
And every hour,

729
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,740
you'll need to toast everyone.

730
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,900
It'll be lively.

731
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,740
You have to attend.

732
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,740
I'm thinking...

733
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,140
Why they're more anxious than we are?

734
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,660
Teachers and colleagues.

735
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,140
That's at least eight tables.

736
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,900
- Eight tables.
- And my

737
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,300
first batch of students

738
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,100
from the Class of 1995.

739
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,300
During their last visit,

740
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,260
they said

741
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,620
when Tang got married,

742
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,860
I had to invite them.

743
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,460
They won't all come.

744
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,620
It's at least three tables.

745
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,580
So, based on this,

746
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,820
it's at least a thousand.

747
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,020
Looks like they're seizing

748
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,340
this big event.

749
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,180
- Good.
- Right.

750
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,020
Two thousand.

751
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,140
We should do it big.

752
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,100
It feels less like our wedding

753
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,340
and more like theirs.

754
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,180
I think it's their wedding.

755
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,460
What's going on?

756
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,780
Why did you call us here?

757
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,340
You know these two.

758
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
They love secrets.

759
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,940
Don't worry; they'll be here soon.

760
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,780
They'll be here soon.

761
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,380
Please have a seat for now.

762
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,860
Sit for a moment.

763
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,300
I'll tell you in a bit.

764
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,700
Yanan, hurry.

765
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,540
Say hi.

766
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,380
Who are they?

767
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,380
Well...

768
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,220
Wait a moment.

769
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,140
Dad, this place is

770
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,740
Feng Weiran's property.

771
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,860
It's a beautiful courtyard.

772
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,620
They're here.

773
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,540
Grandpa.

774
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,460
Grandpa, you're here.

775
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,660
Hello. Hello.

776
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,100
You two are here.

777
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,860
Why haven't those two come to greet us?

778
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,340
- Exactly.
- Even Grandpa is here.

779
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,980
Don't you know them?

780
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,180
They love to keep it a secret.

781
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,340
We'll find out soon enough.

782
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,580
What's this all about?

783
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
Why is it so grand?

784
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,700
It's a secret.

785
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,740
You'll find out soon.

786
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,860
Kids love being mysterious.

787
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
Let's go, Dad.

788
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,980
Let's go, let's go.

789
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,020
Walk slowly.

790
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,100
There are too many people.

791
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
Right.

792
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,120
- OK.
- Everyone's here?

793
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,180
- Where?
- They all came.

794
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,100
This way, this way.

795
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,980
You're here too.

796
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,500
You all came.

797
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,300
Slow down, slow down.

798
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,700
Slow down, slow down.

799
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,500
Slow down, slow down.

800
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,340
Alright.

801
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,500
Good.

802
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,300
Oh, my, come here.

803
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,340
What's going on?

804
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,580
They called over Grandpa,

805
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,780
Uncle, and everyone.

806
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,660
What is this about?

807
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,500
Just wait.

808
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,420
Soon everyone will know.

809
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,140
Look, there's a big screen.

810
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,700
Quick, look.

811
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,420
Hello, everyone.

812
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,700
I bet you're all very curious

813
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,900
why I gathered you here today

814
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,580
why we aren't present,

815
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,980
and why we're dressed

816
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,940
like this in the video.

817
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,580
That's right.

818
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,660
Today,

819
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,460
Tang and I are getting married.

820
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,500
This is our big day.

821
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,940
Why are they getting married there?

822
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,300
- Do you know?
- I don't know.

823
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,980
They didn't tell me either.

824
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,660
Do you guys know?

825
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,820
You're the mom.

826
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,780
How would we know?

827
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,820
Getting married there?

828
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,900
We've been thinking about whether

829
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,260
we should have a wedding

830
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,140
and in what form.

831
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,420
Later, we realized

832
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,740
what matters is that we're together.

833
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,180
The form doesn't matter.

834
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,820
Right. That's great.

835
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,500
When we were 18, we came here

836
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,100
during our graduation trip.

837
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,900
It was summer back then.

838
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,860
Everything was so green.

839
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,220
At that time, we promised

840
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,180
to come back in winter

841
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,300
to see the snowy scenery.

842
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,100
So today, we're here,

843
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,460
fulfilling the promise we made at 18.

844
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,180
Tang Yang,

845
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,820
we used to joke that if one day

846
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,140
we reached the end of our lives,

847
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,500
we'd be the ones giving

848
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,740
farewell speeches to each other.

849
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
But then one day,

850
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,900
I realized

851
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,980
I wanted to be the one

852
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,220
who gets to say wedding vows with you.

853
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,500
This world is so big.

854
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,420
So many people spend their lives

855
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,260
without finding

856
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,420
someone who can make them feel happy.

857
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,940
How fortunate I am

858
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,380
to have met you

859
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,460
in my youth,

860
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,380
to grow with you,

861
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,580
to share every little moment,

862
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,900
and to support each other.

863
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,180
Tang Yang,

864
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
I ask you

865
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,940
to be my wife.

866
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,020
Please let me cherish

867
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,420
love you,

868
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,100
and live with you.

869
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,060
Jiang Shiyan,

870
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,980
I always thought

871
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,020
that in this world,

872
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,180
besides parental love,

873
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,700
no one's love

874
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,820
was unconditional,

875
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,860
until I met you.

876
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,940
You showed me that in this world,

877
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,980
there's someone

878
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,140
who puts me first in everything,

879
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,460
always prioritizing me.

880
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,860
Thanks, Jiang Shiyan.

881
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,540
I'm willing to be your wife.

882
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,580
No matter what happens in the future,

883
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,500
I will walk hand in hand

884
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,300
with you,

885
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,260

How trendy are they?

909
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,140
Who would think

910
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,780
to get married over there?

911
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,180
They didn't even let us witness.

912
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,900
Yeah.

913
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,220
This is a live wedding broadcast.

914
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,500
It's the trendiest thing now.

915
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,320
Grandpa is trendy.

916
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,530
Dad is trendy.

917
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,180
What do you think of my idea?

918
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,460
If it weren't like this,

919
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,060
how could we scare them

920
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,060
into getting married

921
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,500
so quickly?

922
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,460
It took them 13 years to start dating.

923
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,380
If we hadn't scared them,

924
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,860
what if it happened again?

925
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,540
- Who can wait that long?
- Exactly.

926
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,340
I just remembered.

927
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,660
Did they get their certificate?

928
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,660
Right.

929
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,180
They did.

930
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,620
Last week,

931
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,820
I saw our Tang sneak out

932
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,900
with the household

933
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,740
register.

934
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,980
I remembered.

935
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,340
I remembered. That day,

936
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,460
Jiang Shiyan

937
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,860
wore a white shirt

938
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,580
and tied a bouquet of roses

939
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,420
from my garden with a ribbon.

940
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,980
Now I know they went

941
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,300
to get the certificate.

942
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,140
Yes.

943
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,420
Everything fits.

944
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,220
They probably think

945
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,740
they're watching

946
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,180
a live broadcast of us right now.

947
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,300
Who would have thought

948
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,540
we recorded the video

949
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,820
a day in advance?

950
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,940
Now, Cheng Hui is

951
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,500
helping us play it in real time.

952
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,580
They should be enjoying it.

953
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Well.

954
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
It's pretty cold on the mountain.

955
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,940
- Right.
- This morning,

956
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,860
I didn't even dare

957
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,580
to leave the tent for the sunrise.

958
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,220
I remember when we last came here,

959
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,140
it was summer.

960
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,340
We waited on the mountaintop

961
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,580
to see the sunrise,

962
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,020
but before we could see it,

963
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,580
everyone started dancing.

964
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,980
We can still dance now.

965
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,540
How can we dance?

966
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,220
I can't bear to leave my sleeping bag.

967
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,380
We can dance in our sleeping bags.

What's wrong?

985
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
Isn't that her mom?

986
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,540
Why is she crying?

987
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,260
You don't know?

988
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,180
She's dating Liu Minghao from her class.

989
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,340
Their head teacher found out.

990
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,180
So, the parents were called to school.

991
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,140
Seems like

992
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,820
they might even get a punishment.

993
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,300
But someone's even more high-profile

994
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,140
than them.

995
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,540
Who?

996
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,780
I know.

997
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,900
You mean that...

998
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,940
Just that...

999
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,460
- That...
- Who? Just tell us.

1000
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,220
It's Tang Yang from Class One

1001
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,740
and the school hunk.

1002
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,420
School hunk?

1003
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,100
- Jiang Shiyan?
- Right.

1004
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,060
Let me tell you.

1005
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,060
I see them together every day,

1006
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,900
coming

1007
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,300
and going to school.

1008
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,660
I heard

1009
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,740
Tang Yang often goes
to Jiang Shiyan's house.

1010
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,060
She's so bold.

1011
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,740
Hurry. Get down, get down.

1012
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,620
I even heard the dean

1013
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,020
ask Mr. Chen of Class One

1014
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,580
about Tang Yang

1015
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,420
and Jiang Shiyan.

1016
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,580
Ask about them?

1017
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,700
Of course, it's...

1018
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,140
- Bet?
- Bet on what?

1019
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,980
What do you think?

1020
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,740
It's early love.

1021
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,500
Early love.

1022
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,980
Let me ask you; what do you think it is?

1023
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,460
I don't know.

1024
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,820
