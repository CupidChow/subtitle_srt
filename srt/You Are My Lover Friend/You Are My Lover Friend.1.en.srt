Come on, are you two serious?

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,680
You just took a sip.

44
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,550
Exactly.

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,240
Let me see if you drank it.

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,330
- I did.
- I did drink it.

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
Seriously?

00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Now that we've graduated,

49
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,760
shouldn't we all down our drinks?

50
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,800
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,200

52
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,610

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Jiang Yanan.

57
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,680
Why are you drinking soda?

58
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,610
Well, you see.

59
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,800
Yanan doesn't drink alcohol, so...

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,960
- Then drink.
- I'll drink.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,400
- Drink!
- I'll drink for her!

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,170
What does that mean??

63
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,050
What's going on?

64
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,450

66
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,890
- What's wrong?
- Don't push.

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,790

68
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,730

You won't get into college
next year like this.

72
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,240
You can't say that to her.

73
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,080

76
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,520
- You can't say that.
- And you two.

78
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,240

00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,010
I heard people say

80
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,450
that no matter how close

81
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,410
you are in high school,

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,330
once you're in uni,

83
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,730

00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,840
he'll still be passed out

188
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,800
when I get off work.

189
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,200
I'll drop you off first

190
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,130
and then handle him.

191
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,130
Sure.

192
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,770
By the way, this is just like

193
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,200
when you used to queue

194
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,650
while memorizing vocabulary, right?

195
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,560
Not really. There's a slight difference.

196
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,650
Before, it was talent plus effort,

197
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,960
but now it's mostly
relying on natural beauty

198
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,560
and just a bit of efficiency.

199
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,080
I should've bought some

200
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,130
Xiaolongbao downstairs.

201
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,530
I'm actually a bit hungry now.

202
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,130
Check the backseat.

203
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,800
And a cup of unsweetened soy milk.

204
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,170
Oh, my god.

205
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,530
This is what they call

206
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,200
"filial piety above all".

207
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,840
Aren't you a bit too conscientious?

208
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,650
You've consumed all my conscience.

209
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,130
Don't distract me. I'm driving.

210
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,200
What are all those bags

211
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,130
in the back?

212
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,400
Clothes for change.

213
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,730
I plan to leave

214
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,680
my work uniform

215
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,560
at the office,

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,440
so I can wear

217
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,680
my own clothes to and from work.

218
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,440
(Huishang)
Morning.

219
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,520
- Morning.
- Morning.

220
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,360
Morning.

221
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,200
- Morning.
- Morning.

222
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,580
(Credit Audit Office)

223
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,720
- Morning.
- Morning.

224
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,720
- Morning.
- Morning.

225
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,010
Director Gan. Secretary Xia.

226
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,320
A delicious breakfast, huh?

227
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,010
Eat in the lounge.

228
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,080
Don't let the smell get in.

229
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,490
Morning, Director.

230
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,530
Is there a new milk tea shop

231
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,400
opened next door?

232
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,720
Right, it's in that mall on the left.

233
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,840
So much hair for young people.

234
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,130
It's really enviable.

235
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,440
Throw it away.

236
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,400
Remind everyone

237
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,560
trash affects attendance.

238
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,600
Also, tie your hair up here.

239
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,290
Okay, okay, just stop here.

240
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,680
Here?

241
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,840
You still have to walk.

242
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,290
It's fine. Stopping here is good.

243
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,960
Do you need a ride tomorrow?

244
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,490
No need.
My car will arrive this afternoon.

245
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,340
I can manage.

246
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,800
I wish Deputy Director Tang

247
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,050
a smooth first day on the job.

248
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,550
Deputy Director?

249
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
I'd even answer to Director Tang.

250
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,840
Sounds like sweet ribs.

251
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,490
Looking for trouble?

252
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,080
I wish Director Tang

253
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,410
a smooth first day on the job.

254
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,440
Alright, got it.

255
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,720
Alright. Everything is perfect.

256
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,680
Hurry up and get going,
or you'll be late.

257
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,840
Grace

258
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,050
is a beauty's life motto.

259
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,040
Alright.

260
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,520
I'm off.

261
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,400
Bye-bye.

262
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,490
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

263
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,720
Time for live streaming.

264
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,920
Hello. Got it.

265
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,080
Mr. Jiang, where are you?

266
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,290
Can you make it on time?

267
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,170
Have Yue Ya and Sheng Nina's team

268
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,010
go through it.

269
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,280
I'll be on time.

270
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,280
Okay.

271
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,680
Graduated from Zhongzheng Uni
of Finance and Economics,

272
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,920
Tang Yang got a PhD in Finance.

273
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,440
Right after graduation, she built

274
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,650
a risk-adjusted capital return model
for risk control,

275
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,200
earning her the Outstanding Newcomer
in the industry.

276
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,130
She's published many papers
in both domestic

277
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,650
and international academic circles.

278
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,370
Through the Elite Trainee Program,

279
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,720
(Tang Yang)
she was recruited.

280
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,130
She's now the Deputy Director

281
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,080
of Rongcheng Branch's

282
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,080
Credit Audit Division

283
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,600
at Huishang Bank Co., Ltd.

284
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,440
Is this Director Tang?

285
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Hello, and you are...?

286
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,290
I'm Fan Linlang. I'm here for you.

287
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,890
This way, please.

288
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,490
- Let me help you.
- No need.

289
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,370
I can carry it.

290
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,440
Thank you.

291
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,440
Look at her.

292
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,320
She has a PhD,

293
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,320
was specially hired,

294
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,840
built a risk control model,

295
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,560
and came up with agile concepts.

296
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,320
Her achievements are endless.

297
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,890
Not even thirty,

298
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,440
and she's already a director.

299
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,320
(Huishang Bank)
The youngest ever.

300
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,560
She's one of a kind.

301
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,890
And look at us...

302
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,920
There's always someone better out there.

303
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,370
That's normal.

304
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,960
If it's about comparison,
what will life be like?

305
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,130
Ms. Qin, it's almost year-end.

306
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,890
No need to be contrary all the time.

307
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,800
I'm saying this

308
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,890
so everyone can learn

309
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,320
from her as a role model.

310
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,090
Come in.

311
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,920
Hello, everyone.

312
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,840
Hello, Director Gan. I'm not late, am I?

313
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,200
You're right on time.

314
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,600
Just three minutes until nine.

315
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,250
Next time, I'll make sure

316
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,130
to arrive earlier.

317
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,650
What's going on here?

318
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,250
I was just heading downstairs

319
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,170
and ran into Ms. Tang in the elevator,

320
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,600
so we came up together.

321
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,130
Yes, we bumped into each other.

322
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,170
This place is so big.

323
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,200
I would've gotten lost.

324
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,560
I've met Ms. Tang once before

325
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,680
at President Zhou's office.

326
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,650
To be exact, we've actually met twice.

327
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,890
How so?

328
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,130
When I was a sophomore,

329
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,440
doing an exchange at your school,

330
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,050
you were giving a speech

331
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,080
on behalf of the doctors.

332
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,800
I remember you saying

333
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,170
your name stands for ambition

334
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,600
and great potential.

335
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,650
It impressed me.

336
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,890
So, rounding up,

337
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,170
you're half my junior.

338
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,730
Exactly.

339
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,920
Let me introduce you.

340
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,560
This is our other Deputy Director,

341
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,890
Qin Yue.

342
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,160
I'm Qin Yue. I've heard a lot about you.

343
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,600
Tang Yang. Nice to meet you.

344
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:05,500
(Yi Xiu Gourmet)

345
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,740
(Jiang Shiyan, CEO)

346
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,700
(Yi Xiu Gourmet)

347
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,280
Mr. Jiang.

348
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,170
- Jiang.
- Mr. Jiang.

349
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,200
Spicy cashews for you?

350
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,040
Mr. Jiang.

351
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,800
They're pretty good.

352
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,680
Mr. Jiang.

353
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,170
The live stream started well.

354
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,890
It's Sheng's first-time live streaming,

355
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,680
but she interacted with the viewers.

356
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,560
So, viewers poured in.

357
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,130
Yue Ya coordinated the product

358
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:45,970
perfectly.

359
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,370
Our third product broke

360
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,290
the full-session record

361
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,130
- soon.
- Sir.

362
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,740
Xinhe Oats were up fourth.

363
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,200
- Mr. Jiang.
- Miss Sheng tasted it

364
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
and said it was inferior.

365
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,130
She wanted it out.

366
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,250
Yue Ya refused.

367
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,720
Both of their fan bases are massive,

368
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,080
so it hit the trending topics.

369
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,320
The live stream is crashing.

370
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,200
Neither side is backing down.

371
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,650
Mr. Feng is on his way.

372
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,610
A question for you.

373
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,970
Sure. Go ahead.

374
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,320
Sichuan Resto doesn't

375
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,400
take reservations, right?

376
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,840
Yes. Only numbers on-site.

377
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,290
Well, can you find a way to reserve

378
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,640
their biggest private room?

379
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,480
Enough for 16 people,

380
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,320
under Ms Tang's name.

381
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,690
Got it, I'll call the owner.

382
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,320
Hello, everyone. I'm Tang Yang.

383
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,770
Tang, as in Tang Dynasty,

384
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,120
and Yang, as in rippling water.

385
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,360
Coincidentally,

386
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,290
I grew up

387
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,360
in Rongcheng,

388
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,530
and during my internship,

389
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,840
I also spent half a year

390
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,690
at Rongcheng Branch.

391
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,080
So, coming back this time

392
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,690
feels incredibly familiar.

393
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,880
Besides work,

394
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,050
my biggest hobby is food.

395
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,770
I hope in the future,

396
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,450
we can all not only collaborate at work

397
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,800
but also share experiences

398
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
over great food,

399
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,080
building a strong rapport

400
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,290
and making progress.

401
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,160
Great.

402
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,380
(Joint Live Stream)

403
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,800
Alright, I'll figure something out.

404
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,050
Let's not stay upset, okay?

405
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,000
Drink some water.

406
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,490
Xingyue, have some water.

407
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,770
Can we talk for a moment?

408
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,890
Sure.

409
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,600
Xingyue, you know it's impossible

410
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,490
to ensure

411
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,840
a 100% product quality rate.

412
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,400
A 97% or 98% rate

413
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,320
is already very high.

414
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,730
Maybe the three bags just

415
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,770
happened to be faulty.

416
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,600
This happens occasionally.

417
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,160
How well you normally sell

418
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,160
doesn't concern us,

419
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,360
but today, many people

420
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,690
tune in because of Nina.

421
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,120
We're responsible for them.

422
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,210
We didn't see Xinhe Oats

423
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,730
on the product list.

424
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,530
How did it suddenly appear?

425
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,370
Xingyue,

426
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,880
we're not shirking responsibility,

427
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,530
but we still have other products.

428
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,400
So, can we put the oats issue aside

429
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,600
for now?

430
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,600
If we don't address the oats issue,

431
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,010
we can't continue like this.

432
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,250
In all the time I've worked with Yue Ya,

433
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,970
I've never seen a live stream be halted.

434
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,600
Throwing a diva fit.

435
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,690
Xinhe Oats has been featured
in many sessions.

436
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,210
- Others are fine.
- Talk to Yue Ya.

437
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,560
Only Sheng Nina ate it

438
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,920
and found an issue.

439
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,250
It's normal to add a surprise product.

440
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,160
Is Sheng Nina the center
of the universe?

441
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,640
What are you doing?

442
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,930
Mr. Jiang, we're from Yue Ya's team.

443
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,160
So, her team can

444
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,000
cause trouble here?

445
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,160
Mr. Jiang.

446
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,770
You're finally here.

447
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,730
Get back to your work.

448
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
My goodness.

449
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,450
Mr. Jiang, let me tell you.

450
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,290
The brands

451
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,250
of the upcoming products

452
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,490
are pressing us to continue.

453
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,320
But Sheng Nina is still hung up on a few

454
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,250
insignificant items.

455
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,250
It's the second place
on trending topics.

456
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,730
I'm about to lose my mind.

457
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,840
This product list was signed off

458
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,880
by you, me, and Sheng Nina.

459
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,690
But Xinhe Oats

460
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,130
wasn't on it.

461
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,050
Xinhe Red Dates, Xinhe Goji,
and Xinhe Oats.

462
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,640
They're all from the same brand.

463
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,320
It's natural for the team
to overlook a few things.

464
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,530
You've made many mistakes.

465
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,970
Not the first day we met.

466
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,640
Tell me what you want to say.

467
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,480
Mr. Jiang,

468
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,290
I've always been grateful
for your support

469
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,440
and for signing me,

470
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,160
building my team, securing deals,

471
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,880
and bringing me to where I am today.

472
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,560
Yes, without you

473
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,440
and Yi Xiu,

474
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,800
I wouldn't have made this far.

475
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,440
But I'm sure

476
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,160
I haven't earned you guys any less.

477
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,800
I've given you everything I have,

478
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,050
but what about you?

479
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,490
You control the categories

480
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,880
and the brands.

481
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,050
Look around.
Among live streamers at my level,

482
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,450
who doesn't have their own

483
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,290
selection team?

484
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,050
We can let you choose

485
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,970
your products,

486
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,840
but your products

487
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,250
must go through our quality control.

488
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,770
Food safety is important.

489
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,050
But you know.

490
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,690
Food safety standards

491
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,930
are inherently vague.

492
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,290
Pull the product, apologize,

493
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,130
and resume it.

494
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,960
I can't pull it.

495
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,120
I've signed a base quantity contract

496
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,250
with Xinhe' manufacturer.

497
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,920
Let's talk later.

498
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,010
I won't pull it.

499
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,080
Think about the bigger picture.

500
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,730
What's bigger, and what's smaller?

501
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,730
It's Sheng Nina's first live stream.

502
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,360
Everything will be

503
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,290
analyzed repeatedly.

504
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,880
If anything goes wrong...

505
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,250
Sheng Nina, Sheng Nina.

506
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,250
This is my live stream.

507
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,130
Let's get it straight.

508
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,160
It's not hers.

509
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,210
I call you Mr. Jiang

510
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,290
out of respect.

511
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,530
My team separated a long time ago.

512
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,120
With only my profit-sharing contract,

513
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,970
what can you do

514
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,010
if I'm not pulling out?

515
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,120
My contract with Yi Xiu

516
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,690
expires in six months.

517
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,450
During this time, do you know

518
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,560
how many companies have

519
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,480
given me good offers?

520
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,530
I stayed only out of the friendship

521
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,080
we've built over the years of hardship.

522
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,490
I thought we'd accommodate each other,

523
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,400
not make things difficult.

524
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,770
It's the eighth major notice

525
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,730
you have received

526
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,320
this month.

527
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,160
Don't worry.

528
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,200
End the contract.

529
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,250
I'll have Mr. Feng

530
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,400
contact you with the details.

531
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Don't regret this.

532
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:18,890
Let's go.

(Conference Room; Huishang Bank)

534
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,080
If you have any questions,

535
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,120
feel free to ask me.

536
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,050
If I'm not around,

537
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,690
you can look for Xia Chuan or Linlang.

538
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,640
Don't hesitate.

539
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,170
Thank you, Mr. Gan.

540
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,050
Alright, carry on.

(Credit Audit Division)

542
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,290
She gave up

543
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,560
great prospects in Lancheng

544
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,400
just to transfer back here.

545
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,080
What do you think

546
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,050
Ms. Tang is thinking?

547
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,160
Ms. Tang is a local.

548
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,160
Maybe it's for her parents.

549
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,840
She's got a Ph.D.

550
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,840
She's a popular rising star

551
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,800
in the entire industry,

552
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,360
and you're telling me

553
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,250
she switched jobs
to care for her parents?

554
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,640
A bright light doesn't save on oil.

555
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,530
Director Gan,

556
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,880
here's the file you asked for.

557
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,640
Is it urgent?

558
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,090
No rush, no rush.

559
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm full now.

560
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,840
- Let's work.
- Alright.

561
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,050
Linlang,

562
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,530
do you know what's going on

563
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,450
with my office?

564
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,800
Year-end filing piles up,

565
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,210
and the personnel order from above

566
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,160
didn't finalize in time.

567
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,210
Someone started slacking,

568
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,080
and now everyone followed suit,

569
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,730
leaving things this messy.

570
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,770
Director Tang, how about I...

571
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,930
You have eyes.

572
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:08,970
Use them

573
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,890
to see the situation.

574
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,970
Ms. Tang just started today.

575
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,010
Her office

576
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,930
should've been ready

577
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,770
at least a week ago.

578
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,010
What do you expect her to do?

579
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,800
Work standing up?

580
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,720
Ms. Tang,

581
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,080
they dropped the ball.

582
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,130
Please don't mind.

583
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,440
It's fine.

584
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,120
But given the current situation,

585
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,080
you will have to squeeze in

586
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,210
and share a workstation with everyone.

587
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,290
No problem.

588
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,160
It's my first day.

589
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,730
I can get to know everyone.

590
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,490
So considerate.

591
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,840
You can start

592
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,320
with these files here.

593
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,530
As always,

594
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,640
I'm at your service.

595
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,330
Miss Sheng.

596
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,770
Xingyue.

597
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,530
I sincerely apologize

598
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,450
for what happened today.

599
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,400
Can we talk privately for a moment?

600
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,970
How are we going

601
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,050
to handle this situation?

602
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,880
We chose to collaborate with Yi Xiu

603
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,690
because you were once

604
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,450
a famous food blogger

605
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,290
in the industry.

606
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,360
- We
- Thanks.

607
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,600
followed your blogs,

608
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,360
and we also use Yi Xiu

609
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,600
to find restaurants

610
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,250
and buy various goodies.

611
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,560
We've always thought
your work was great.

612
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,080
But this time...

613
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,880
There were indeed some oversights

614
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,800
on our part.

615
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,880
Ask Mr. Feng where he is.

616
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:39,770
Alright.

617
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,330
Please wait a moment.

618
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,450
Good morning, Mr. Feng.

619
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,800
Morning, morning.

620
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,530
Let me get that.

621
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,680
Thank you.

622
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Mr. Feng.

623
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,770
What's that?

624
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,450
Got it from Disney. Isn't it cool?

625
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,320
Cool, cool, cool.

626
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,450
It's not just a glove.

627
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,450
It's also a cup holder.

628
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,530
- Really?
- Put it in.

629
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,770
Fits perfectly!

630
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,400
Took my son to Disneyland,

631
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,400
and he wanted it.

632
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,450
He refused to leave without it,

633
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,370
crying on the floor.

634
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,690
Kids at this age now...

635
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,810
Almost.

636
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,610
Take it back.

637
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,120
I don't want it. Take it.

638
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,490
It's okay. I didn't even touch it.

639
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,480
Take it back.

640
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,120
Mr. Jiang means

641
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,210
that you will finish

642
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,320
today's live stream alone.

643
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
He's having an assistant

644
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,960
to help you.

645
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,080
Since when have you been so agreeable?

646
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,490
He offered us

647
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,640
a one-year contract for Food Selector.

648
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,560
Yi Xiu now has over 30 million

649
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,560
registered users,

650
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,840
with 8 million active monthly.

651
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,490
It's growing really well.

652
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,720
Alright.

653
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,640
No matter what,

654
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,930
we have to resolve this issue.

655
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,480
Exactly.

656
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,640
Helping finish this
will boost our reputation.

657
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,560
Fine, I'll call someone
to redo your makeup

658
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,970
and go over the products.

659
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,290
As for the specific product details,

660
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,450
please remind Miss Sheng

661
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,290
more often.

662
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,600
Sure, Mr. Jiang. Don't worry.

663
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,480
Thank you.

664
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,600
Your Mr. Jiang

665
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,880
sure works efficiently.

666
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,640
What do you mean?

667
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,450
I'll explain later.

668
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,610
Let's step outside.

669
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,290
Sorry about this.

670
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,120
What are you doing?

671
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,000
Are you crazy?

672
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,560
Between the two of us,

673
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,120
which one looks crazier right now?

674
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,730
Stop sidetracking me.

675
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,690
Can you please take that thing off?

676
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:01,530
It looks creepy.

677
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,450
I can't take it off.

678
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,640
- Why not?
- It's glued.

679
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,570
Who glued it?

680
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,440
Who else?

681
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,680
Your godson, surely.

682
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,640
I've realized kids these days

683
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,930
are so mischievous.

684
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,050
When I was leaving,

685
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,600
he insisted I wear this glove.

686
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,160
I stuck my hand in,

687
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,250
and it was filled with glue...

688
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,120
Stop sidetracking me.

689
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,120
Answer my question.

690
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,530
Didn't I ask Peng Si

691
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,400
to talk to you?

692
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,210
Yes. They had a surprise product,

693
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,200
and a defective one.

694
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,050
Right.

695
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,210
But first,

696
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,560
no live streamers

697
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,640
can guarantee

698
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,600
100% product quality.

699
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,720
Second,

700
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,770
Yue Ya has a lot of autonomy.

701
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,160
Even if there's an issue

702
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,020
with the product,

703
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,530
she has a thousand ways

704
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,970
to make up for it.

705
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,130
Third,

706
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,500
Yue Ya holds half of the market

707
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,360
for food live stream.

708
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,660
Many of our investors

709
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,390
came because of her popularity.

710
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,020
If you end the contract with her now,

711
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,060
they'll all pull out.

712
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,760
You're absolutely right.

713
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,840
Yue Ya is crucial
to Yi Xiu's food live streaming.

714
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,080
Very important indeed.

715
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,900
But if Yi Xiu's

716
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,120
food live streaming

717
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,460
depends on Yue Ya,

718
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
then I think

719
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,440
it has no value at all.

720
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,440
Let the investors pull out if they want.

721
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,640
Right now,

722
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,840
we're in the same boat as Yue Ya.

723
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,060
She holds one oar,

724
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,040
and we hold the other.

725
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,540
For the boat to move

726
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,380
and turn,

727
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,780
the commands must be synchronized,

728
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,880
and we have to cooperate.

729
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,120
But now, Yue Ya clearly
has her own agenda.

730
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,020
If we hand over the oar

731
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,120
in our hands to her,

732
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,900
the boat could sink,

733
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,000
and we'd be beyond saving.

734
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,780
Does it have to be now?

735
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,740
Must it be today?

736
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,060
We've already discussed this

737
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,020
many times.

738
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,020
Right now, she's intoxicated
by the benefits

739
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,980
brought by the traffic.

740
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,560
If she can't be reined in, the costs

741
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,920
will be unbearable for us.

742
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,140
Really.

743
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,100
Let me snap my fingers

744
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,320
and make her disappear.

745
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,660
(WeChat; Just now:
One unread message from Peng Si)

746
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,580
(Reservation info)

747
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,380
(Tang Yang)

748
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,860
(WeChat; Just now:
One unread message from Jiang Shiyan)

749
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,840
(Your reservation
for Sichuan Resto has been

750
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,730
(confirmed at 12:30 PM today,
in VIP Room 888 on the sixth floor.)

751
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,690
(The staff of Sichuan Resto
eagerly awaits your visit.)

752
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,640
Mr. Jiang,

753
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
how did you know

754
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,080
I wanted to treat
my new colleagues to lunch?

755
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,700
(Tang Yang)

756
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,820
Director Gan.

757
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,140
Director Qin.

758
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,640
Since today is my first day,

759
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,740
I thought I'd invite everyone to lunch

760
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,120
so we can get to know each other.

761
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,180
I've booked Sichuan Resto.

762
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,600
Sichuan Resto?

763
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,600
Isn't it impossible
to book there?

764
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,220
I went there at 11:01 AM last week

765
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,060
and there were

766
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,200
over 50 tables ahead of me.

767
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,600
Yeah, it's hard to get a spot,

768
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,380
but the food is really good.

769
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,440
How did you book it?

770
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,020
I happen to have a friend

771
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,360
from Yi Xiu Gourmet,

772
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,740
and they work

773
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,940
with these restaurants.

774
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,880
He helped me with this.

775
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,460
Yi Xiu Gourmet?

776
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,660
I've bought stuff

777
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,700
from there before.

778
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,380
Any restaurant they recommend

779
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,040
turns into an online hotspot.

780
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,080
Well.

781
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,220
But Director Gan here

782
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,420
has a very important
client meeting today

783
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,920
that can't be rescheduled.

784
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,900
No problem.

785
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,940
Today's invitation was

786
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,980
quite last-minute anyway.

787
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,000
I'll plan ahead next time.

788
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,620
Then we'll have to trouble Ms. Tang

789
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,160
to cover the cost next time.

790
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,440
Of course, no problem.

791
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,520
What about everyone else?

792
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,920
Well, I'm not free today either.

793
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,440
My classmate is coming
to see me for lunch.

794
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,500
Sorry about that, Ms. Tang.

795
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,360
No worries.

796
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,220
Hello? Please wait a moment.

797
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,900
I'm having lunch with my boyfriend,

798
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,840
so I can't join you.

799
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,700
Ms. Tang, my food delivery came.

800
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,600
I'm going to grab it.

801
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,900
Tang Yang,

802
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,460
I really have to head home.

803
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,900
I need to put my little one down

804
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,740
for a nap.

805
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,260
The nanny is on leave,

806
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,280
and my mom can't come.

807
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,780
If I'm late getting back,

808
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,040
cover for me, okay?

809
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,800
Sure, no problem.

810
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,760
I'll make sure to ask you in advance.

811
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,340
(Huishang Bank)

812
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,460
(Contract Termination Letter)

813
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,940
Here's the termination letter.

814
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,800
Take a look.

815
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,020
The food safety report for Xinhe Oats

816
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,980
isn't out yet.

817
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,520
There might not even be a problem.

818
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,520
And even if there is,

819
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,360
it might not be my fault.

820
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,380
If you're determined

821
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,020
to terminate the contract,

822
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,860
it's fine.

823
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,180
Then we can just proceed

824
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,920
according to your
forced termination clause

825
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,160
and discuss the compensation terms.

826
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,040
If that's the case,

827
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,840
we'll need to address the issue

828
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,740
of Yue Ya falsifying sales data

829
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,120
during her promotion

830
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,860
to a higher revenue-sharing tier,

831
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,600
which might constitute
unfair competition.

832
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,740
You can just block

833
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,460
Yue Ya's live stream account on Yi Xiu.

834
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,540
We're ending the contract.

835
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,400
It doesn't matter.

836
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,620
Here's the thing.

837
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,280
Besides this contract,

838
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,540
Yue Ya and Yi Xiu

839
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,940
also have a separate, indefinite

840
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,780
labor contract.

841
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,320
These actions

842
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,280
might constitute embezzlement.

843
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,160
She's signed it.

844
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,900
Think about it.

845
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,740
Relationships

846
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,680
are really fragile.

847
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,260
We've known Yue Ya

848
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,460
for five or six years, right?

849
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,380
To be honest,

850
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,640
it's not a short amount of time.

851
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,900
But once this letter is signed,

852
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,380
it's like a gust of wind,

853
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,460
and the relationship

854
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,300
just dissipates.

855
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,600
The year's almost over.

856
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,980
With Yue Ya leaving,

857
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,680
at least half of our channel
will collapse.

858
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,600
Where there's a will, there's a way.

859
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,360
I don't know how to respond to that.

860
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,420
Forget it.

861
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,680
Forget about it. My head hurts.

862
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,700
What's for lunch?

863
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,220
If we're going out,
let's ask Yang to join.

864
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,860
She's back.
It's easier to plan meals.

865
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,840
And Huishang is nearby.

866
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,820
No need.

867
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,180
What's wrong with you two?

868
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,380
Did you argue again?

869
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,220
Last night at dinner,

870
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,080
you seemed fine.

871
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,900
Today is Yang's first day at work.

872
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,080
She's having a business lunch.

873
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,840
Yeah, Yang's first day.

874
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,060
Since when have you

875
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,160
become so considerate?

876
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,440
I've always been considerate.

877
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,980
If that's the case,

878
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,120
book me a meal quickly.

879
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,140
It's already noon.

880
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,320
I didn't have breakfast.

881
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,880
Get out of here.

882
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,500
Book it!

883
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,600
Let me help you.

884
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,340
Come on. Look at the camera.

885
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,180
Look at the camera.

886
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,220
I want one too.

887
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,700
Include the glove.

888
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,560
Come on, come on.

889
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
Can it go on Moments?

890
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,980
Sure, sure, sure.

891
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,100
Let's take a group photo.

892
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,120
Come on, come on.

893
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,160
Look at the camera.

894
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,180
Let's go. Thank you, Mr. Feng.

895
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,020
No problem.

896
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,660
- Thank you, Mr. Feng.
- No problem.

897
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,500
Okay.

898
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,860
See?

899
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,280
Men have to stand out.

900
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,580
So many colleagues

901
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,640
took pictures with me.

902
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,880
Are you envious?

903
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,120
You'll have one tomorrow.

904
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,620
I envy how you casually

905
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,900
pull out two Ultraman masks

906
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,120
during meetings.

907
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,020
I also envy how, a month ago,

908
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,160
when you needed a stamp,

909
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,080
you found
a Lord of the Rings ring in the box.

910
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,640
Stop making sarcastic comments.

911
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,820
This is the joy of being a dad.

912
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,260
(Tang Yang)
You wouldn't understand.

913
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,460
(How did you know I wanted...)

914
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,670
(How's the food?)
That's true.

915
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,620
(There's wine.)
I took

916
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,500
(For you.)
a shot

917
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,800
of you with your colleagues.

918
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,940
I'll send it to Jiang.

919
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,120
Let's see if she can relate.

920
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,160
Don't mess around, bro.

921
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,540
(Jiang Shiyan)

922
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,720
How did it get sent out?

923
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,760
Stop messing around. What...

924
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,860
(Tang Yang: How did you know...)

925
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,580
(Jiang Shiyan: What's the food like?)

926
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,260
(There's wine. For you.)

927
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,540
You scared me.

928
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,620
Don't joke like that.

929
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,600
My heart can't take it.

930
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,820
(Jiang Shiyan: How's the food?)

931
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:47,300
(Tang Yang)

932
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,720
(Jiang)
Colleagues didn't join you?

933
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,060
Bad timing.

934
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,180
They have other commitments.

935
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,030
Maybe next time.

936
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,820
I tried the food
at the Huishang cafeteria.

937
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,640
It's pretty good,
better than our school food.

938
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,620
(Tang Yang)

939
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,160
(Jiang Shiyan)
The dishes do look good.

940
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,600
It's Huishang Stir-fry
and is quite famous.

941
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,740
It's even a trending product.

942
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,650
Outsiders even try
to find ways to buy it.

943
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,490
(Tang Yang)

944
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,480
Get me some.
I'll have a runner pick it up.

945
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,820
(Jiang Shiyan)

946
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,020
Order a delivery service

947
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,300
and send over my bag

948
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,280
with my clothes.

949
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,540
I forgot it when I got off

950
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,980
(Tang Yang)
as you were talking.

951
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,820
Have a runner

952
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,800
to bring me the dishes,

953
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,920
and I'll have him bring back your stuff.

954
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,440
It's a win-win.

955
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,180
(Jiang Shiyan)

956
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,780
I have to go.

957
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,620
Where are you going?

958
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,460
To find Yang.

959
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,460
Didn't you say not to disturb Yang

960
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,800
as she's having a business lunch?

961
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,500
Why do you care?

962
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,580
I...

963
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,620
Fine.

964
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,680
You're such a practical person.

965
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,000
I want to know the business asap.

966
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,380
I thought this position

967
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,500
would feel cramped,

968
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,740
but I didn't expect you

969
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,560
to be tall and fit here perfectly.

970
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,380
It's a temporary spot

971
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,480
anyway.

972
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,200
Whether it's good doesn't matter.

973
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,860
At two o'clock,

974
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,660
there's a style conference in T1.

975
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,900
Ms. Tang, please attend.

976
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,740
Got it, no problem.

977
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,340
Go ask the admin

978
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,540
when they have time.

979
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,620
We need to sort out

980
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,580
Ms. Tang's office

981
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,600
by the end of the week.

982
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,540
No matter how new she is,

983
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,100
she's still a leader here.

984
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,940
Sure.

985
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,560
She can't keep sitting outside.

986
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,700
(Just now:
One unread message from Jiang Shiyan)

987
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,460
(Jiang)
You must be too busy

988
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,440
to reply to my message.

989
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,460
I thought you would

990
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,660
squeeze some time

991
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,940
to bring things for me.

992
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,960
(Tang Yang)
But...

993
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,100
(Jiang)
But what?

994
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,580
But I had to call for delivery.

995
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,100
(Tang Yang)
And I have to pay for it.

996
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,140
Every word is heart-wrenching.
I can't reply.

997
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,120
Please understand.

998
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,140
(Tea Room)

999
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,780
Ms. Tang.

1000
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,260
Good. Thank you.

1001
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,180
Ms. Tang.

1002
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,000
You came personally.

1003
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,660
Transfer 500 to me.

1004
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,780
Earlier, downstairs,

1005
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,300
I met a kind-hearted lady

1006
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,900
who saw me struggling with my stuff

1007
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,780
and registering,

1008
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,760
so she brought me up.

1009
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,200
Linlang, please
share this with everyone.

1010
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,440
- Sure.
- Sichuan Resto.

1011
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,660
Hold on a second.

1012
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,640
To get cash for me?

1013
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,160
I'll get some water.

1014
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,660
Who are you?

1015
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,500
I'm a runner.

1016
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,100
Who ordered this?

1017
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,960
Ms. Tang.

1018
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,240
Sichuan Resto can do takeout?

1019
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,320
Ms. Tang is very impressive.

1020
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,640
It's about reciprocity.

1021
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,900
I'll take you downstairs.

1022
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,880
Alright, let's go.

1023
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,660
(Huishang Bank)

1024
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,040
The new office location is nice.

1025
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,820
You don't need to see me off.

1026
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,660
You're too kind.

1027
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,800
Our relationship is worth the gesture.

1028
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,140
Why are you laughing?

1029
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,300
It's nothing.

1030
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,820
Is the wrenching heart

1031
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,720
healing slowly?

1032
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,920
Not too bad.

1033
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,040
Then here's another thread

1034
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,380
to stitch it up.

1035
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,060
Isn't that the one I sent

1036
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,120
in the group?

1037
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,580
Yes, you said both necklaces

1038
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,300
were nice and you liked them.

1039
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,140
You were conflicted.

1040
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,820
Then I heard Jiang Yanan say

1041
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,960
you bought the other one,

1042
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
so we decided to get

1043
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,100
this one for you

1044
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,120
as a welcome gift for your new position.

1045
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,780
But last night,

1046
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,980
after drinking,

1047
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,900
it was brought home

1048
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,040
by that unreliable couple.

1049
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,920
