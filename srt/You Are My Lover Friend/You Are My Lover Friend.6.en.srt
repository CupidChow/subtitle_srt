It's okay. Tang Yang,
I can take out the garbage.

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,800
No, I can do it...

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,600
No need.
You don't have to go downstairs.

30
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:45,850
Goodbye.

31
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,400
Jiang Shiyan.

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,040
What's wrong?

33
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,040
Why are you so scared?

34
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,650
When you called my full name,

35
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,560
it brought me back to the old days

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,400
when you criticized me

37
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,450
for getting two questions wrong.

38
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,610
It seems you've had the trauma

39
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,040
for many years.

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,560
Exactly.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,330
Nothing special.

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,120
I just want to say thanks.

43
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,250
I've been busy over the past few years.

44
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,280
Thank you for taking care of my parents.

45
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,530
Ms. Zhou didn't allow me
to call you Yang.

46
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,280
She was afraid
that I might interrupt your blind date.

47
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,530
Well,

48
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,210
aren't we supposed to be bros?

49
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,250
My mother went too far.

50
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,930
How could she relate everything
to blind dates?

51
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,840
Okay, cheer up.

52
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,570
We'll play badminton in the morning,

53
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,570
have lunch at Foot Street,

54
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,880
cycle in the afternoon,

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,960
and take a walk by the river at night.

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,690
I'll pick you up in the morning.

57
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,530
No need.

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,130
I'm close to the badminton hall.

59
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,280
I can walk.

60
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,690
See you tomorrow.

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,810
See you.

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,040
Hello, Mo, what's up?

63
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,880
Yang,

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,090
do you have time?

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I want to ask you something.

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,090
Mo, are you kidding me?

67
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,880
Are you asking me questions?

68
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,090
It's important to me.

69
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,720
Only you can do it.

70
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,170
Okay. Well, Mo,

71
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,240
I'm sending you a location,

72
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,720
and we'll meet there.

73
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,280
Okay. See you later.

74
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,440
Okay.

75
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,160
Come on, put this on.

76
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,000
No.

77
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,920
You'll be sweating.

78
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,640
No, my hairline powder

79
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,970
will get wet and flow down.

80
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,090
Then give me a kiss.

81
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,730
You're so annoying.

82
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,760
No headband. Okay.

83
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,000
Tang Yang, hurry.

84
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,170
Feng Weiran and Jiang Yanan

85
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,440
are already showing their affection.

86
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,370
It's been a long time

87
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,610
since we played badminton together.

88
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,410
If you're late, you'll pay for lunch.

89
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,960
By the way, I forgot to tell you.

90
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,490
- Well, Cheng Hui can't come.
- Change it.

91
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,170
I think he's still sleeping.

92
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,280
Considering his routine,

93
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,440
maybe he has stayed up all night.

94
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,810
It's possible.

95
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,170
Stop making a mess.

96
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,850
Why don't you call your partner?

97
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,050
She's going to be late.

98
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,610
Even if she doesn't come,

99
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,730
I can defeat

100
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,970
both of you.

101
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,210
Are you serious?

102
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,280
You're always bragging.

103
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,250
Come on, young man.

104
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,480
Come on. Let's see.

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,520
- Listen,
- I'm not scared.

106
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,560
Yanan and I are the perfect partners.

107
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,520
You're doomed.

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,610
You don't know who's going to lose.

109
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,050
Let's go. Come on!

110
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,120
Weiran, beat him!

111
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,680
- Watch this.
- Get him!

112
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,350
- Come on!
- Come on!

113
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,330
Watch out!

114
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,250
What's wrong with you?

115
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,120
- Listen,
- Weiran!

116
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,520
don't get carried away.

117
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,290
He's out!

118
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,370
- Come on.
- Come on, Shiyan.

119
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,370
Didn't you want to defeat us?

120
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,120
Get him!

121
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,810
Nice!

122
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,930
Great!

123
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,480
Come on!

124
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,450
One shot!

125
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,570
Get him!

126
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,440
Show him the skill!

127
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,280
Great!

128
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,360
(WeChat, Just now,
Tang Yang, One message)

129
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,320
Take a break. Drink some water.

130
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,410
We're just getting started.

131
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,640
Honey, help me adjust my clothes.

132
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,730
It's too itchy.

133
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,170
Can you rip it off?

134
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,520
(Tang Yang)
I have an emergency and can't come.

135
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,530
Please tell them

136
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,410
about it too.

137
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Are you working?

138
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,400
Where are you going?

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,610
I can come over.

140
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,290
(Jiang Shiyan)
It's too hot.

141
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,520
Tang Yang can't come.

142
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,370
What? Then tell her

143
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,080
we'll find a place,
and she can go there.

144
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,000
I told her.

145
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,520
Mo.

146
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,370
Thanks.

147
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,320
- You're early.
- Here.

148
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,360
Come on.

149
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,280
Have a seat.

150
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,000
This place is nice.

151
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,010
Yes.

152
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,690
My friend Feng Weiran

153
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,610
is the boss here.

154
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,760
We like to

155
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,680
come here and spend some time together.

156
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,640
There are meals and tea.

157
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,050
If you want to come next time,

158
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,970
you can call me,

159
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,850
and I'll tell them.

160
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,930
The boss is Mr. Feng.

161
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,050
Do you remember?

162
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,200
I remember him.

163
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,570
He loves his wife very much.

164
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,930
Yes. That's him.

165
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,970
The tea is good.

166
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,320
Mo, why do you

167
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,760
want to ask me?

168
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,440
Well,

169
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,250
I want to

170
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,530
buy some designer toys

171
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,370
and figures

172
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,970
for an important friend,

173
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,930
but I know nothing about it.

174
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,210
I saw your Moments.

175
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,490
You must know it well.

176
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,610
- I do.
- So, I wanted

177
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,640
to ask you about

178
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,170
the types and editions

179
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,370
in the market.

180
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,730
You've made a good choice

181
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,810
because I'm a fan

182
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,370
of toys and figures.

183
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,800
However, since you want to buy these,

184
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,000
she's not a friend from work, right?

185
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,760
Okay, I got it.

186
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,410
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

187
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,370
I'll check Yang's message.

188
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,760
(Tang Yang)
No need. I'm with Zhou Mo.

189
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,210
Why did she say?

190
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,440
Is she coming?

191
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,970
She said she was with Zhou Mo.

192
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,290
Come on. Let's continue.

193
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,130
Who?

194
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,520
Zhou Mo?

195
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,490
Oh, no rush!

196
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,490
Tell her to take her time.

197
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,930
She can play badminton at any time.

198
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,960
We need to give them some space.

199
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,800
Yes.

200
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,320
Considering the last time,

201
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,200
I think this person is a good man.

202
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,490
Besides, I've heard

203
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,080
that before leaving Huishang Bank,

204
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,880
he was a rare

205
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,780
- vice-president-to-be.
- Really?

206
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,970
Wei Changqiu made the right choice

207
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,960
to have poached him.

208
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,320
Oh my god. I'm impressed.

209
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,850
I think Zhou Mo

210
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,850
must have feelings

211
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,760
for Yang.

212
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,300
I wonder what Yang is thinking about.

213
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,490
I don't know. You should ask him.

214
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,890
Jiang Shiyan,

215
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,250
do you think

216
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,930
Zhou Mo is Yang's type?

217
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,480
Honey,

218
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,730
early this year,

219
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,090
I took Yang to read her fortune.

220
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,370
That person said Yang would
find a boyfriend this year,

221
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,610
and she's known

222
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,760
that person for a long time,

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,850
but they never knew
each other's feelings.

224
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,280
Did you hear it?

225
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,450
Yang is going to have a boyfriend.

226
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,490
Jiang Shiyan, are you crazy?

227
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,610
How could you hit him?

228
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,450
Let me take a look.

229
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,720
It's bruised.

230
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,250
It's okay. Don't worry.

231
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,330
- It's a game.
- Your head.

232
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,640
How could you have no mercy?

233
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,810
Give me a bottle of water.

234
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,120
Okay. Drink some water.

235
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,570
It was a revenge.

236
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,050
Water.

237
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,130
These are new toys,

238
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,880
such as Oracode series,

239
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,490
ink fish series,

240
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,920
and luminous series.

241
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,880
They're very popular.

242
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,250
And this, cowboy gentleman.

243
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,640
You have to be lucky to get this.

244
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,090
It's the Star Wars co-branding series.

245
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,640
I thought these

246
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,770
toys and figures

247
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,010
were small stuff

248
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,370
like blind boxes.

249
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,210
It turns out to be quite complicated.

250
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,130
Of course.

251
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,410
Those co-branding ones

252
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,010
must be collectible, right?

253
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,280
Yes, that's right.

254
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,130
You're a big fan of this.

255
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,000
Do you have a favorite one?

256
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,890
Mo, have you ever heard

257
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,000
a stupid joke?

258
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,090
What is it?

259
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,040
Auditors

260
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,520
can't tell others what they like.

261
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,890
If you say

262
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,160
you like red,

263
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,560
Cartier will appear in your office

264
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,210
tomorrow morning,

265
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,400
and you say blue,

266
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,610
there will be Tiffany & Co.

267
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,130
Therefore,

268
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,280
as auditors,

269
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,370
we don't like anything.

270
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,280
No desire,

271
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,330
no guilt.

272
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,850
It's good to be cautious.

273
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,090
It's a nice place.

274
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,970
We can take our son here next time.

275
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,090
Of course.

276
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,760
It's the weekend.

277
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,450
I didn't expect it to be so crowded.

278
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,250
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

279
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,250
Well, let's eat something.

280
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,120
Jiang Shiyan!

281
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,690
We're hungry. Let's have lunch.

282
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,330
Not in the mood.

283
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,380
It looks nice. Let's go.

284
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,490
(Tipsy & Jade)

285
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,330
Take a look.

286
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,130
Jiang Shiyan.

287
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,050
There's a weekend offer.

288
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,250
Only 19 yuan per person.

289
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,090
No.

290
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,210
Let's eat Cantonese hotpot.

291
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,280
I'd rather go back to Leisure House.

292
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,370
Weekend deals for new arrivals.

293
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,330
It's our store.
We can enjoy it as much as we can.

294
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,730
Yes, but it's the weekend...

295
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,800
This store has a weekend offer
of free drinks.

296
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,610
- That's good.
- Weekend offer.

297
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,850
Weekend deals.

298
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,210
What about workdays?

299
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,850
You need to pay extra money later.

300
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,850
Don't you think

301
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,920
the weekend is a scam?

302
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,120
Honey,

303
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,880
do you think Jiang Shiyan

304
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,920
is kind of weird.

305
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,280
Who offended him?

306
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
It makes sense.

307
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,170
We're just

308
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,010
hanging out with friends

309
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,890
on weekends.

310
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,850
Is that a problem?

311
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,880
Exactly.

312
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,800
I wish Tang Yang were here.

313
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,280
Only she can deal with him.

314
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,370
I get it.

315
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,600
He must be upset

316
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,160
about Sheng Nina.

317
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,690
It's quite complicated.

318
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,690
But he shouldn't take it out on you.

319
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,090
Does it hurt?

320
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,010
It doesn't hurt,

321
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,330
but I'm starving and dizzy.

322
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,090
Let's go. Slow down!

323
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,180
(Tang Yang)
What are you doing?

324
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,490
What did you have for lunch?

325
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:44,020
(Jiang Shiyan)

326
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,040
I'll kowtow to you.

328
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,500
(Jiang Shiyan)

329
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,760
(Fine. He must be angry.)

330
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,180
(Anchor Analysis)

331
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,380
(Tang Yang: What are you doing?)

332
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,180
(What did you have for lunch?
I'm sorry. I'll kowtow to you.)

333
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,680
(Do I have to reply)

334
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,000
(to your message?)

335
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,800
Okay. Nina, let's take a break.

336
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,640
Okay.

337
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,280
Nina, get some rest.

338
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,370
Give me my phone.

339
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,400
Thanks, everyone.

340
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,730
Has the milk tea for everyone arrived?

341
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,610
Thank you. Drink some water.

342
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,450
I'm fine.

343
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,300
(Call, Nina)

344
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,880
Hello, Ms. Sheng.

345
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,210
Mr. Jiang, sorry,

346
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,760
I was busy with shooting

347
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,610
and missed your message.

348
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,570
What's the matter?

349
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,130
Nothing special.

350
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,040
Well, where are you right now?

351
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,560
I'm in Beijing.

352
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,760
I'll come back tomorrow.

353
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,040
Well,

354
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,610
will you have time

355
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,800
for me after you come back?

356
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,250
I'd like to talk to you

357
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,090
and Xingyue.

358
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,680
Okay,

359
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,450
but maybe later in the afternoon.

360
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,760
How about this? I'll go to your company
when I arrive.

361
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,000
No problem. See you tomorrow.

362
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,120
See you tomorrow.

363
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,450
Thanks.

364
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,640
Why did you say yes?

365
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,720
I've made it clear

366
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,370
with them.

367
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,530
Our contract

368
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,920
didn't specify the time.

369
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,800
We can just keep them waiting.

370
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,450
He's asking you out

371
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,090
because he wants to persuade you

372
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,160
to be an anchor.

373
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,210
We've talked about it.

374
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,370
You can't keep doing this.

375
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,520
We're in different positions.

376
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,610
What if it gets ugly

377
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,640
when we meet?

378
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,880
What's the point?

379
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,730
I've had this feeling

380
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,880
that he's not that kind of person.

381
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,800
Work and private life

382
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,040
are different.

383
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,850
You're always smart.

384
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,250
Don't be fooled by him.

385
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,450
You can't go tomorrow.

386
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,040
I'll talk to him.

387
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,260
(Jiang Shiyan)

388
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,530
You'd better have

389
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,880
a good reason.

390
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,400
Mr. Jiang.

391
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,210
Ms. Busy.

392
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,530
How can you have time

393
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,520
for me?

394
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,880
I've made Sweet and Sour Pork
and Green Pepper Fish.

395
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,880
I'm here to apologize.

396
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,210
I didn't say you made mistakes.

397
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,450
I did. I made huge mistakes.

398
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,320
First of all, I shouldn't have

399
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,970
abandoned my teammate.

400
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,370
Second,

401
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,970
I shouldn't have bailed on you.

402
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,400
Most importantly,

403
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,800
I shouldn't have left

404
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,290
a handsome man alone

405
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,210
to fight the couple.

406
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,250
I was so heartless.

407
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,890
I'm guilty. I should be punished.

408
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,930
They bullied me together.

409
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,800
I'll definitely avenge you.

410
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,010
I'll beat them to the ground,

411
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,850
okay?

412
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,450
Men always lie.

413
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,360
But I'm a lady.

414
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,730
You're my bro.

415
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,520
But I'm still a pretty woman.

416
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,760
For real?

417
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,000
I swear.

418
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,360
If the same thing

419
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,490
happens again

420
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,730
next time when someone

421
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,080
asks you out, you'll...

422
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,970
You first. You're the boss.

423
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,120
For real?

424
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,800
They can never compare to you.

425
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,360
I'll ignore them.

426
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,040
If you lie, you'll stay single.

427
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,280
Wait a minute. I need to take this.

428
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,890
Hello, Linlang. What's wrong?

429
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,930
I got it. Okay.

430
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,250
I'm coming.

431
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:00,850
Bye.

432
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,490
Jiang Shiyan.

433
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,000
Here's the thing.

434
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,280
Fan Linlang asked me to come back

435
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,560
for something

436
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,890
really important.

437
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,320
You... You'll agree, right?

438
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,520
At least give me a sign.

439
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,600
If you stay silent,

440
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,250
I'll take it as a yes,

441
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,130
right?

442
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,320
What did you say?

443
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,690
Stay single? Withdraw that.

444
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,000
I didn't say yes. Bye.

445
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,250
Wasting food is unacceptable.

446
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,690
Ms. Tang.

447
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,540
What's wrong?

448
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,800
Xu Hang from Nanjin Branch said

449
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,320
Zhang Zhilan called,
saying she was at home.

450
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,280
We can visit her.

451
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,410
Xu Hang wanted our division's support.

452
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,800
Okay. Well,

453
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,690
let's get changed

454
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,760
and go there.

455
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,810
Okay.

456
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,950
(Call, Zhou Mo)

457
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,360
Hello, Mo. What's wrong?

458
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,360
Ms. Tang,

459
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,760
are you free tonight?

460
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,410
The alumni group chat

461
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,930
is having a party tonight.

462
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,600
We have Fang Qi from Yiding Capital,

463
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,410
Huo Fan from Caiteng Capital,

464
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,690
and two professors.

465
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,410
If you want to come,

466
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,840
I can invite you to the group chat.

467
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,600
Mo, I'm out for fieldwork.

468
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,490
It's going to be late

469
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,560
when I get there.

470
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,280
It's okay. Just go ahead.

471
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,360
You can come

472
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,520
when you're done.

473
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,600
You just came back,

474
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,170
so I wanted to introduce you to them.

475
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,320
Okay, thanks, Mo.

476
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,160
Okay.

477
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,560
(Zhou Mo invites you to group chat
CUFE Finance School Alumni in Rongcheng)

478
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,860
(Zhilan's Pot-stewed Dish,
Delicious and Fresh)

479
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,760
We're almost there.

480
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,690
Over there.

481
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,160
Zhang Zhilan.

482
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,410
Come on. Let me introduce them to you.

483
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,360
Manager Xu.

484
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,450
This is the Ms. Tang
from Credit Audit Division.

485
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,290
Nice to meet you.

486
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,250
I got oil on my hands.

487
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,170
It's okay.

488
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,170
Nice to meet you, too.

489
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,800
This is my colleague Fan Linlang.

490
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,490
- Hello.
- You know me.

491
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,530
Xu Hang, loan manager

492
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,840
from Nanjin Branch.

493
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,970
We're here to take a look.

494
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,340
By the way, can we get in

495
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,220
and take some photos

496
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,080
to assess your condition

497
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,520
for applying for a loan?

498
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,580
Of course.

499
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,450
This way, please.

500
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,410
Come on, Ms. Tang.

501
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,410
Thanks.

502
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,080
Could you please

503
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,970
tell me about

504
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,410
your specific conditions?

505
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,570
No problem.

506
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,120
(Yi Xiu Gourmet)

507
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,210
You must've waited for a long time.

508
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,050
Not at all.

509
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,290
I'm so sorry.

510
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,800
Nina can't make it today.

511
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,640
It's okay.

512
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,170
Nina,

513
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,250
why are you here?

514
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,090
Xingyue.

515
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,040
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

516
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,170
I asked Ju to tell you.

517
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,250
She didn't?

518
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,210
No.

519
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,050
Maybe she was busy with

520
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,450
buying food for me and forgot about it.

521
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,730
Nina, your food.

522
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,280
Leave it here.

523
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,170
Thanks.

524
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,560
Mr. Jiang, sorry,

525
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,120
I didn't have lunch.

526
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,690
I'm starving, so...

527
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,890
No problem at all.

528
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,760
Go ahead.

529
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,250
I'll get you a yogurt.

530
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,090
Okay.

531
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,770
It smells good. I miss it.

532
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,770
Didn't you promise

533
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,840
not to come?

534
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,890
When did I say that?

535
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,450
Don't worry.

536
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,890
I just want to know

537
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,840
how they're going to persuade me.

538
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,360
Don't eat too much.

539
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,650
You'll get fat.

540
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,520
This is so good.

541
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,600
Listen, I really can't

542
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,730
control myself right now.

543
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,210
I didn't get off work until 3:00 a.m.

544
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,810
Yogurt.

545
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,520
- Thanks.
- Xingyue, have some water.

546
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,560
Thank you.

547
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,640
Mr. Jiang,

548
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,130
do you want to try this?

549
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,520
The pot-stewed dishes are so good.

550
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,210
It's highly recommended online.

551
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,450
- Really?
- Pork knuckles,

552
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,040
duck wings, and tofu skins

553
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,970
are so good.

554
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,360
I tried it last time

555
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,410
and couldn't forget it.

556
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,840
Is it that good?

557
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,680
Come on.

558
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,170
- Then I'll try it.
- Try.

559
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,400
Do you like it?

560
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,360
Good.

561
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,120
Take a photo.

562
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,530
Go ahead.

563
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,730
What's the name of the store?

564
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,040
Zhilan's Pot-stewed Dish,

565
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,080
Zhi for ambition,

566
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,320
and Lan for orchids.

567
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,290
It's quite close

568
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,130
to your company.

569
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,120
I saw it

570
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,210
on my way here.

571
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,650
However, it seems that it only opens

572
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,730
from 5:00 p.m. to evening.

573
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,210
- It's closed in the daytime.
- Really?

574
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,650
I saw many recommendations

575
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,210
on our review platform.

576
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,970
Yes, I saw others' recommendations

577
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,600
on Yi Xiu Gourmet.

578
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,250
Ms. Sheng, thank you

579
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,250
for supporting us.

580
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,690
I only

581
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,730
have a small stall

582
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,250
to sell pot-stewed dishes.

583
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,970
I want to rent a shop.

584
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,410
A while ago,

585
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,930
except for running the stall,

586
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,250
I was also working as a janitor

587
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,450
at a small hotel.

588
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,450
I led a mall group

589
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,970
of a few people.

590
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,760
When the hotel closed down,

591
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,930
the owner owed us

592
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,410
several months' salary,

593
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,050
so I took them

594
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,280
to talk to him.

595
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,600
He said he didn't have cash,

596
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,410
but he had a shop

597
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,490
which was rented out

598
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,490
as a restaurant

599
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,080
with some devices.

600
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,080
Then the tenant left,

601
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,210
so the boss

602
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,490
gave us the devices

603
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,650
as compensation for our salary.

604
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,840
I see.

605
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,590
Then where is the shop

606
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,490
you mentioned?

607
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,080
Can you take us there?

608
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,690
No problem. It's close.

609
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,690
I'll take you there.

610
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,880
Okay.

611
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,450
299 yuan, no.

612
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,640
99 yuan, no.

613
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,480
69 yuan, no.

614
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,120
On Yue Ya's channel,

615
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,280
Xinhe Jujube,

616
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,250
one, two, three, four, five, five packs,

617
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,040
only 29.9 yuan,

618
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,250
and you'll have them all.

619
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,040
Honey, what are you waiting for?

620
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,930
(Yue Ya)
One, two, three,

621
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,170
get on the cart!

622
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,650
(Meng)
Only 100 left.

623
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,120
Come on, family,
anyone who hasn't got it,

624
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,650
get on the cart!

625
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,360
Only 50 left!

626
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,600
20!

627
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,600
Family, I'm giving you
the best deal ever.

628
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,010
(Bella)
20 packs in total.

629
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,280
Three, two, one, get on the cart!

630
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,210
These don't fit Nina.

631
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,560
I remember

632
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,770
when my friend once

633
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,000
treated me to a stake,

634
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,840
he pointed at the rosemary

635
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,800
and said

636
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,040
a line from Hamlet,

637
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,460
(My goddess is here. I've bought it.)

638
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,930
(Fresh knowledge!)
There's rosemary,

639
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,410
(It's an educational channel!)
that's for remembrance.

640
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,080
Which can be

641
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,490
interpreted as

642
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,520
"Rosy can help you remember.

643
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,930
Darling,

644
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,490
please remember."

645
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,600
From now on,

646
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,360
if you want to prepare

647
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,690
a romantic dinner

648
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,840
for your loved one,

649
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,970
remember to use rosemary

650
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,000
so that he or she

651
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,840
can remember

652
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,660
(That makes the steak fancier.)
your love in the food.

653
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,490
I think Ms. Sheng

654
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,970
enjoys this mode.

655
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,450
Based on the viewers' comments,

656
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,650
we can tell

657
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
they like it a lot.

658
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,560
What's behind gourmet?

659
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,560
There's history,

660
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,730
geography,

661
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,170
and humanity.

662
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,760
As for the expressions,

663
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,890
I believe

664
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,890
that's what Ms. Sheng sees in life

665
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,490
and understand about life.

666
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,320
Meanwhile, the viewers

667
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,130
admire her expressions

668
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,130
and cheer for her.

669
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,890
Therefore, I suggest

670
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,650
from now on,

671
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,770
we make every live event

672
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,690
a personal meeting room

673
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,080
for Ms. Sheng.

674
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,840
It's just like a salon.

675
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,250
In this salon,

676
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,080
Ms. Sheng can express

677
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,010
her insights on food

678
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,560
and the land,

679
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,170
people,

680
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,250
and stories

681
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,410
behind the scenes.

682
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,320
I remember Ms. Sheng

683
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,930
majored in geography.

684
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,080
Mr. Jiang,

685
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,840
we'll consider it.

686
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,520
Okay. Take your time.

687
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,570
Come in.

688
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,130
Mr. Xu, come in.

689
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,300
(Rongcheng, Jiangjiang Noodles)

690
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,930
We've learned a lot about

691
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,600
your conditions.

692
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,530
We need to go back

693
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,840
and sort this out.

694
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,080
By the way,

695
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,210
if you don't mind,

696
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,600
please give us

697
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,450
more information

698
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,280
about your business partners.

699
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,450
Okay.

700
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,450
Most of them

701
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,970
are military families,

702
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,840
and two of them

703
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,760
lost their husband

704
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,130
just like me.

705
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,040
I didn't see it in the papers.

706
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,210
Immediate family may be related to

707
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,690
changes of second repayers.

708
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,760
I didn't know this.

709
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,490
If you need any information,

710
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,170
I'll provide it to you.

711
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,490
My husband Min Zhi was in the army.

712
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,560
Our friends introduced us to each other.

713
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,890
We got married in 2012

714
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,600
and had Min Mu in 2013.

715
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,730
In 2015,

716
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,890
Min Zhi's squad commander sacrificed,

717
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,600
and his wife left home

718
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,890
to make money,

719
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,650
so we adopted

720
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,690
their son,

721
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,000
which is my second son Min Lin.

722
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,410
Thank you for the information.

723
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Nina.

724
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,960
Nina.

725
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,000
Mr. Cheng.

726
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
What's the matter?

727
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,600
I broke your headset

728
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,730
last time.

729
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,080
Sorry about that.

730
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,690
I've bought you a new one.

731
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,360
No need.

732
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,800
That's not my glasses.

733
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,250
It's the latest edition.

734
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,800
It has more features.

735
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,170
I only want my old headset.

736
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,770
That's a test edition.

737
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,730
How can I...?

738
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,450
How about this?

739
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,770
Can you make an appointment
with R&D colleagues?

740
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,010
I'll treat them to a meal

741
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,970
and see what I can do.

742
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,320
It's not something that can be

743
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,760
solved by having a meal.

744
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,600
Then...

745
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,130
- Here.
- Thanks.

746
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,250
Do your homework.

747
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:21,540
(Rongcheng First High School)

748
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,410
Well,

749
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,210
eating snacks I bought

750
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,970
at the front gate of our alma mater,

751
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,760
doesn't it feel like
yesterday once more?

752
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:29,970
Oh, come on.

753
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,520
I was the one who bought you food

754
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,730
every time in the old days.

755
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,890
I bought you food too.

756
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,890
When?

757
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,210
When Ms. Zhou was busy

758
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,600
with compiling the exam

759
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,000
and your father
caught up in a project,

760
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,450
I often brought you

761
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,250
soup and snacks for dinner, right?

762
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,690
By the way,

763
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,560
I was so surprised

764
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,170
to see you
at the pot-stewed dish stall.

765
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,360
What a coincidence.

766
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,530
Yes. I was wondering

767
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,600
what you were doing there.

768
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,600
Of course for work.

769
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,930
I was there for work too.

770
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,730
For work too, huh?

771
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,290
By the way,

772
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,450
have you fixed the problem

773
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,560
of Yue Ya?

774
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,650
No matter how strong the wind is,

775
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,840
I'll head forward and fight for my life.

776
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,320
Shiyan, do you know?

777
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,530
When you said that,

778
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,490
if you have a tail,

779
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,450
it'll look like this,

780
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,690
like a propeller.

781
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,760
It should be like this.

782
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,450
No. You can't fly like that.

783
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,320
It must be...

784
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,530
Wait a minute. I've got a call.

785
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,370
Okay.

786
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,060
(Call, Zhou Mo)

787
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,490
Mo.

788
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,250
Sorry, I'm caught up in something.

789
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,690
Yes, I...

790
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,280
I'm so sorry.

791
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,360
It's very important,

792
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,600
and I guess

793
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,120
it will take longer than I thought.

794
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,320
I really can't come.

795
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,560
Sorry about that.

796
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,280
Maybe we can meet some other time.

797
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,490
I'm so sorry.

798
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,080
Okay, no problem.

799
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,800
Thank you so much.

800
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,640
Okay.

801
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,120
If you're busy,

802
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,970
we... we can talk

803
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,360
next time.

804
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,690
Hey. Stop.

805
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,000
You are my top priority.

806
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,080
You're in a bad mood.

807
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,120
As your bro,

808
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,290
I should be responsible

809
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,320
and stay with you.

810
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,410
It's okay.

811
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,730
If you're busy, we...

812
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,040
Forget it.

813
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
How can I be mad, huh?

814
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,890
Just go, okay?

815
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,600
Shiyan, you know,

816
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,840
every time you speak

817
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,560
with emotional endings

818
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,170
like "huh" and "okay"

819
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,120
with a dramatic face,

820
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,930
you must be lying.

821
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,600
That's who you are.

822
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,170
Tell me.

823
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,000
Sheng Nina wanted

824
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,690
to terminate the contract,

825
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,840
so I changed the plan

826
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,800
and asker her again.

827
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,800
I thought

828
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,930
they'd be satisfied,

829
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,360
but they only said

830
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,360
they had to consider it.

831
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,890
She said she wanted to quit...

832
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,640
Even if they've

833
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,490
changed their minds,

834
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,730
they can't tell you right now.

835
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,490
That's the way
of bargaining and self-protection,

836
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,330
understand?

837
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,250
I'm worried about Feng Weiran.

838
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,450
I promised him

839
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,800
that Sheng Nina
would renew the contract.

840
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,760
He'll start nagging me, talking about

841
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,840
his investors,
Chinese New Year's Shopping Festival,

842
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,450
and so on.

843
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,730
Then you can

844
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,600
tell him that I said

845
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,490
when I get rich one day,

846
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,170
I'll be their angel investor.

847
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,130
Bro,

848
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,800
The series B funding is finished.

849
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,250
Still angel investor?

850
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,120
It's over?

851
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,250
When did it happen?

852
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,650
That's weird.

853
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,530
When Feng Weiran was working on it,

854
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,730
he asked you to improve the plan.

855
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,130
You knew it.

856
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,250
Of course I did, idiot.

857
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,250
I've contributed to your every battle

858
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,840
with the capital.

859
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,000
When will I get my share?

860
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,130
What share?

861
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,450
What's mine is also yours.

862
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,280
Oh, come on.

863
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,010
You're a miser.

864
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,440
How's that possible?

865
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,760
Do you remember

866
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,240
you refused to reply to my messages

867
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
after I bailed on you that day?

868
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,080
You were angry for a long time.

869
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,120
It's not the same thing.

870
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,530
One year consists of 52 weeks.

871
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,930
Except for business trips and holidays,

872
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,600
we only have 10 times to meet.

873
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,530
How could you bail on me?

874
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,370
Aren't you guilty?

875
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,040
Fine.

876
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,970
I owe you one,

877
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:26,810
okay?

878
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,480
I'll make it up to you.

879
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,570
Words don't count.

880
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,280
What do you want?

881
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,540
(Rongcheng First High School)

882
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,570
Now? You...

883
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,770
Jiang Shiyan, don't go too far.

884
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,970
We just finished

885
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,410
a whole day's work.

886
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,080
How can you ask me to play badminton

887
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,010
after work?

888
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,370
Don't you think it's quite

889
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,810
unreasonable?

890
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,090
We just need to go there,

891
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,250
serve, and receive, and that's all.

892
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,770
Okay.

893
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,570
If you're tired,

894
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,690
let's forget it.

895
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,530
Stop.

896
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:11,920
How about this?

897
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,890
If you can get in

898
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,290
our school's badminton hall,

899
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,240
I'll play with you

900
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,530
for as long as you want.

901
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,650
What will a dog do when it's anxious?

902
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,130
Are you sure you want to
get over the wall?

903
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:29,800
Of course.

904
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,400
Well,

905
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,010
are you too noble

906
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:33,870
to demean yourself?

907
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,010
Or are you afraid

908
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:35,890
that you can't get over it

909
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:36,890
because you're old and weak?

910
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,410
Are you kidding me?

911
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,170
I'm a young director.

912
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,770
I'm also an outstanding alumna.

913
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,970
My photo

914
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,240
is on the Glory Wall.

915
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,450
I'm an outstanding alumnus too.

916
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm also a young entrepreneur.

917
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,880
I'm not like you.

918
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,730
You always have no shame,

919
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,400
but I do.

920
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,360
Since we're here...

921
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,730
That's right.

922
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,280
Jiang Shiyan, help me out.

923
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,050
Why are you so sluggish?

924
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,080
Come on.

925
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,330
Yang, are you okay?

926
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,720
No problem. Come over.

927
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,290
Okay. I'll throw the rackets over first.

928
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,130
Okay.

929
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,880
Look at us.

930
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,090
We're still

931
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,650
as young and agile as before.

932
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,890
I knew the wall

933
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:56,930
wasn't the only thick thing.

934
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,810
What else is thick?

935
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,680
Come on, Yang.

936
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,530
What is it? Say it!

937
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:02,920
Stop!

938
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,280
I'll catch you! You're over!

939
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,940
(Gym)

940
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,800
You're still a good runner.

941
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,610
You're too slow.

942
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,880
Who can be faster than you?

943
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,570
It's locked.

944
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,090
What should we do?

945
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,010
Think of something.

946
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,570
Let's figure it out.

947
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,280
Who's there?

948
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,560
What? Run!

949
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,720
- Who's there?
- Again?

950
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,760
Stop! Don't run!

951
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,560
Yang...

952
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,280
- Stop! Don't run!
- Watch out.

953
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,640
- Don't twist your ankle.
- Stop!

954
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,210
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Stop!

955
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,570
Stop!

956
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,520
Run!

957
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,480
This way.

958
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,810
It's a dead end.

959
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,690
Lee me see.

960
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,360
Come here.

961
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,050
Is he still following us?

962
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,240
Don't look! Keep quiet!

963
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,090
He's still there.

964
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,250
Come closer.

965
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,090
It's indeed unreasonable to do this
at this hour.

966
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,530
Jiang Shiyan, don't talk about

967
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,050
being reasonable or not.

968
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,400
We seem to be

969
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,920
close friends,

970
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,690
but we're different.

971
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,680
You can choose

972
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,320
to do many things,

973
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,560
but my life

974
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,530
is full of must-dos.

975
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,400
I must do this job.

976
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,650
I must smile at everyone

977
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,760
even if I hate them

978
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,280
after they deceive me.

979
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,690
Tang Yang.

980
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,920
I have a lot of restrictions,

981
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,570
but in my tiny little space of freedom,

982
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,570
you're my best friend.

983
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,610
You are the reason.

984
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,970
There are only
a few formulas for ellipses.

985
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,080
You've finally remembered all of them.

986
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,250
You didn't make a mistake this time.

987
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,570
85 points.

988
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,210
Great.

989
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,170
Congratulations.

990
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,170
Have some noodles.

991
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,090
What's this?

992
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,330
You can memorize the formulas

993
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,770
while eating.

994
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,800
It's efficient.

995
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,040
Yang, you're really...

996
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,920
You're welcome.

997
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:43,920
Eat.

998
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,840
I'll test you later.
