Director Ying.

29
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,930
Why are you being so polite?

30
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,790
Director Ying?

31
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,630
You called me Deputy Director first.

32
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,850
Then...

33
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,520
I'll call you Tang Yang.

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,860
Look how smart you are.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,460
Hasn't Mr. Jiang arrived?

37
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,830
Is he coming?

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,890
Usually, Mr. Feng attends those events

39
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,950
on behalf of the company.

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,720
Mr. Feng seems to be busy,

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,620
so Mr. Jiang will come.

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,460
I haven't got a chance to meet him.

43
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,580
Can you please

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,460
introduce me to him today?

45
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,920
Of course. If Mr. Jiang is coming,

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,260
I'll let you guys know each other.

47
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,050

Mr. Zhou.

Mr. Zhou?

55
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,570
Why are you so polite?

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,570
You're our client,

57
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,180
so I need to respect you.

58
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,010
I need to talk to some clients

59
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:46,850
over there.

60
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,760
Mr. Zhou

61
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,660
is also our partner.

62
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,000
Ms. Tang, please take care of him.

63
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,300
No problem. Go on with your work.

64
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,200
Take your time.

65
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,340
See you later.

66
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,550
I want to introduce you

67
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,650
to some friends.

68
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,970
Okay.

69
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,510
Good.

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,780
Director Gan's staff are all impressive.

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,600
They have a good teacher,

72
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,440
- right.
- Exactly.

73
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,650
Linlang,

74
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,710
how old are you?

75
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,270
I was born in 1996.

76
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,460
I didn't expect you

77
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,580
to be so young.

78
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,690
I thought

79
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,960
you just graduated from college.

80
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,440
With the help of Director Gan,

81
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,580
you'll have a bright future, right?

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,620
Absolutely.

83
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,390
Come on, to a bright future.

84
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,900
- Come on.
- Come on.

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
Okay.

86
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,440
Cheers.

87
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,300
Cheers.

88
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,720
Linlang,

89
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,060
thank Mr. Gan.

90
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,480
Mr. Guan and CBBC

91
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,020
are long-term partners.

92
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,390
You need to keep in touch

93
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,950
to deepen our partnership.

94
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,460
Please take care of Linlang.

95
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,620
No problem,

96
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,990
as long as Linlang doesn't mind.

97
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,780
Come on, cheers.

98
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,480
- Come on.
- Cheers.

99
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,340
- Cheers.
- Finish it. Good.

100
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,780
That's inappropriate.

101
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,270
- Come on.
- Mr. Guan,

102
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,780
I can't drink anymore.

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,250
Mr. Guan really admires you.

104
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,400
You have to

105
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,240
finish it.

106
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,360
That's right.

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,280
Director Gan.

108
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,460
Sorry to interrupt you.

109
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,080
Linlang needs to help me

110
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,510
deal with some work.

111
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,570
I believe Director Gan

112
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,220
can take care of the guests.

113
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,920
Come on.

114
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,870
Director Gan, it seems

115
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,790
you still need to train your staff.

116
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,210
Here, Linlang.

117
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,180
Drink some orange juice to get sober.

118
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,340
You should go home.

119
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,420
I'll tell Mr. Gan

120
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,080
that you're not feeling well.

121
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,190
I'll call a taxi for you.

122
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,660
Thanks, Ms. Tang.

123
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,780
Linlang, listen,

124
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,290
no matter how sleepy you are,

125
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,810
you can't fall asleep on the way home,

126
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,650
okay?

127
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,080
Thanks, Ms. Tang.

128
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,920
Get in the car.

129
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,750
Tell me when you get home.

130
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,580
Goodbye, Ms. Tang.

131
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,650
Goodbye.

132
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,310
Mr. Jiang.

133
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
What a coincidence.

134
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,150
Are you waiting at the door

135
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,460
to welcome me?

136
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,240
Welcome you?

137
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,150
I didn't even know if you were coming.

138
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,520
So, have you been waiting for me?

139
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,370
I told you I was stuck

140
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,210
in a traffic jam.

141
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,240
Wait...

142
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,310
Waiting for you? I...

143
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,420
I...

144
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,800
This is so ridiculous.

145
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,880
Why would I wait for you?

146
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,750
Actually, it was

147
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,330
Ying Miao...

148
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,570
who asked about you a lot,

149
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,690
so I came out

150
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,530
to check it out.

151
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,390
Nice necklace.

152
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,900
Isn't it because I'm pretty?

153
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,750
It means I'm both sweet and cool.

154
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,750
I can be dressed in any style.

155
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,540
You know nothing.

156
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,810
You're Tang. Of course
[*Tang: Candy]

157
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,650
you're sweet.

158
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,390
You're also quite cool.
[*Cool: Homophone of his name Yan]

159
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,220
Why are you smiling?

160
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,490
You look weird.

161
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,650
You must be

162
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,130
up to no good and guilty.

163
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,190
Don't use that word, okay?

164
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,460
Then why are you smiling?

165
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,720
Mr. Jiang!

166
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,120
Mr. Jiang.

167
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,640
Right on time.

168
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,520
I recognized you from afar.

169
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,780
You're really here.

170
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,540
This is Mr. Ying.

171
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,920
This is Mr. Jiang.

172
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,520
Feng Weiran

173
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,460
talked about you a lot.

174
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,890
Thank you for giving Yixiu a chance
to cooperate with you.

175
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,100
I was in a rush last time.

176
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,340
I've wanted to talk with you

177
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,150
about our further cooperation.

178
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,390
No problem.

179
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,010
Ms. Tang.

180
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,080
President Zhou wants to see you.

181
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,860
Okay.

182
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,490
Take your time. I need to talk to them.

183
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,330
Okay. No problem.

184
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,680
Ms. Tang,

185
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,050
you told Linlang to go home.

186
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,050
It seems you have to

187
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,220
drink with us tonight.

188
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,320
Mr. Gan,
if you don't withdraw your hand,

189
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,660
my hand might slip

190
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,270
and accidentally

191
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,280
pour the wine

192
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,150
on your face.

193
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,730
Mr. Zhou is waiting for us.

194
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,570
Okay.

195
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,960
Distinguished leaders,

196
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,870
dear guests,

197
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,320
ladies and gentlemen,

198
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,470
- This way.
- good evening.

199
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,920
Welcome to...

200
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,880
Ms. Shen, I've watched

201
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,780
a lot of your lectures,

202
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,010
and I've been following

203
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,380
your legal awareness videos.

204
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,810
They're so educational.

205
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,650
Thanks.

206
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,680
Tang Yang,

207
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,900
where is Linlang?

208
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,660
A client just asked me about her.

209
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,440
We had a little situation.

210
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,630
I've told her to go home.

211
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,160
Is she drunk?

212
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
That little girl

213
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,020
has never seen anything like this.

214
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,150
She'd gotten drunk before we started.

215
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,390
Ms. Shen,

216
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,520
when I was in college,

217
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,170
my social ethics professor

218
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,730
recommended one of your lectures to me.

219
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,800
It was about

220
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,110
workplace harassment

221
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,150
and women's self-defense.

222
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,300
I learned a lot from it.

223
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,970
You mentioned

224
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,490
that many sexual assaults take place

225
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,130
after a woman drinks

226
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,260
with her bosses and clients.

227
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,250
I'm wondering

228
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,450
if you have time

229
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,270
to attend our discussion panel for women

230
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,130
and give us a lecture

231
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,150
about preventing workplace harassment.

232
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,600
No problem.

233
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,730
Indeed, many young girls
who just graduated from college

234
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,560
don't know how to refuse

235
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,490
the drinks from their male leaders

236
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,510
and prevent intentional physical contact.

237
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,890
Yes. That's great.

238
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,610
Well, I'll send you

239
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,870
the schedule after the meeting.

240
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,800
Okay.

241
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,210
Let's welcome

242
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,090
Ms. Shen and Ms. Tang

243
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,660
to draw the third prize for us.

244
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,470
There will be ten winners,

245
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,160
and each of them will get

246
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,390
a latest sweeping robot.

247
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,110
Let's welcome them.

248
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,210
Let's go.

249
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,210
You go first.

250
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,380
(Tang Yang, Branch Credit Audit Division,
CBBC Outstanding Employee of the Year)

251
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
(Shen Li,
Co-founder of Tiansheng Law Office)

252
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,880
Okay, Ms. Shen and Ms. Tang,

253
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,760
each of you will draw

254
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,870
five lucky winners for us.

255
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,490
Number 15.

256
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,330
Congratulations.

257
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,780
Number 76.

258
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,000
Congratulations.

259
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,370

260
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,270
Number 56.

261
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,520
Number 8.

262
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,520
Congratulations.

263
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,330
Okay. Congratulations to you.

264
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,800
Let's find out who will be

265
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,780
the other five winners.

266
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,510
Number 82.

267
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,180
Number 39.

268
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,900
Number 5.

269
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,420
Number 71.

270
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,870
Number 182.

271
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,400
- Did you win?
- Okay.

272
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,020
- Congratulations to you.
- No?

273
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,880
Ms. Shen, Ms. Tang,

274
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
thank you for giving us

275
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,250
a good start.

276
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,560
Please go back to your seat

277
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,870
to take a break. Thanks.

278
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,490
(Let's welcome Zhou Zixing,)

279
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,450
(president)

280
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,760
(of CBBC Rongcheng Branch,)

281
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,010
(to help us draw)

282
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,040
(the biggest prize of tonight,)

283
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,270
(the grand price.)

284
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,520
(The winner will get a voucher)

285
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,540
(for four nights
at Six-star Qingcheng Resort.)

286
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,400
(As we know,)

287
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,490
(Qingcheng Resort)

288
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,770
(is located at the backside)

289
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,600
(of the 5A scenic area
Qingsecheng Mountains.)

290
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,730
(Everyone wants to win)

291
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,700
(the grand prize.)

292
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,810
(Let's welcome...)

293
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,730
Little kitten.

294
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,660
The more outstanding

295
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,920
a woman is,

296
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,430
the more a man wants to conquer her.

297
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,350
Mr. Gan, are you drunk?

298
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,700
In Credit Audit Division,

299
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,490
no one ever took over

300
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,420
a case from me

301
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,520
or

302
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,680
surpassed me

303
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,670
to get Outstanding Employee of the Year.

304
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,850
The more outstanding

305
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,280
and disobedient you are,

306
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,060
the more curious I am.

307
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,390
Do you think I'm afraid
to be your enemy?

308
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,600
For what?

309
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,870
Infighting in CBBC?

310
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,450
Deputy Director Tang,
do you want to lose the position?

311
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,680
Do you want other banks

312
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,520
to make fun of us?

313
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,150
Or

314
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,630
sexual harassment?

315
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,560
Are you uncomfortable

316
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,230
with the title of deputy director?

317
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,890
I just passed by

318
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,320
and brushed against you by accident.

319
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,570
Do you want to use this

320
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,900
to replace me?

321
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,470
I can take the risk.

322
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,960
Do you want to take the risk

323
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,800
too?

324
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,240
Threaten me?

325
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,940
You'll be sentenced to death for murder.

326
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,900
You can try and see if I dare.

327
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,300
After all, you'll die first.

328
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,900
Besides, this is a hotel

329
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,990
with cameras everywhere.

330
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,480
Okay.

331
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,210
Mr. Jiang.

332
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,900
(Elite Society)

333
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,640
Can you learn

334
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,210
to avoid hurting yourself

335
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,230
when beating someone else?

336
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,990
How could I notice that when I hit him?

337
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,020
I'm worried about crushed glass.

338
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,850
Tang.

339
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,720
Tang Yang.

340
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,680
Aunt Yi

341
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,350
always calls me Tang,

342
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,730
but it seems you never

343
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,750
did that before.

344
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,300
I want to tell you something.

345
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,520
Go ahead.

346
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,510
I called you bro

347
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,130
because you cross-dressed a male role
in The Merchant of Venice.

348
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,020
I thought it was funny.

349
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,940
Besides, do you remember

350
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,900
we used to spend time together

351
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,350
eating and doing homework?

352
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,210
Yes.

353
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,400
Because my mother

354
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,390
were always out.

355
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,850
Even if she was at home,

356
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,730
she would make

357
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,020
some weird food.

358
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,400
Therefore, Aunt Yi

359
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,520
would always ask you

360
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,100
to bring me some deciduous food.

361
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,960
Then they said

362
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,990
we were in a relationship.

363
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,330
I didn't want the teachers
to misunderstand us

364
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,390
or to get you into trouble,

365
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,590
so I called you bro.

366
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,720
Thanks.

367
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,630
Actually,

368
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,540
that wouldn't get me into trouble.

369
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,850
Back then, teachers

370
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,060
only cared about grades.

371
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,020
I always had good grades,

372
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,940
and your grades were improved.

373
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,990
All the teachers loved that.

374
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,410
I thought about it many years later.

375
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,110
Maybe I just didn't want

376
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,510
to be your burden.

377
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:23,970
After all, you could

378
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,160
raise the average

379
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,590
of the whole school,

380
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,370
whereas I might've

381
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,620
failed to get into a college...

382
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,910
if it weren't for your help.

383
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,120
You...

384
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,970
Aunt Yi and you

385
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,390
always say that,

386
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,280
but actually,
you couldn't keep up with others

387
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,710
in the first and second years

388
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,800
because you missed some remedial classes

389
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,180
and practices

390
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,730
when you had to help your mother

391
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,900
and had no time.

392
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,750
However, in the third year,

393
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,130
we didn't need to learn new stuff.

394
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,700
Everyone started to focus on exercises,

395
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,560
and you manage to keep up with them.

396
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,010
You're not a bad learner after all.

397
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,820
But you made me believe in myself.

398
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,960
Tang Yang.

399
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,920
I...

400
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,160
I...

401
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,290
Hello, Mom.

402
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,150
Hello, Mom.

403
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,430
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

404
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,360
Slow down. I can hear you.

405
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,660
Calm down. Take your time.

406
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,800
What?

407
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,640
How's that possible?

408
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,410
Okay.

409
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm coming back right now.

410
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,900
Okay. I'm coming.

411
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,840
- Bye.
- Bye.

412
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,640
Well...

413
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,570
Let's go.

414
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,600
Come on.

415
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,770
Let's go.

416
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,400
First-aid kit.

417
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,260
Forget it!

418
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,460
(Jade Garden Property Management Center)

419
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,730
I said it was an accident.

420
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,250
Old women, you've lived for so long...

421
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,180
Old women?

422
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,770
Don't you dare hit me!

423
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,360
How could you call other old women?

424
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,200
So what?

425
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,590
How dare you blackmail me?

426
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,790
Sir, look.

427
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,180
They hit my head.

428
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,230
It really hurts.

429
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,090
You deserved it.

430
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,740
Don't you know what you've done?

431
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,930
Nasty trash.

432
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,650
I said it was an accident.

433
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,930
What accident?

434
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,800
Why did you take pictures?

435
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,360
Why did you
put your phone under her dress?

436
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,740
Do you know what this is?

437
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,790
It's indecent assault!

438
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,010
It's sexual harassment!

439
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,800
You insulted a woman, okay?

440
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,690
Indecent assault?

441
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,560
Harassment?

442
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,210
Come on, I'm a 20-year-old

443
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,360
handsome young man.

444
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,200
What about her?

445
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,890
She's just a middle-aged ugly woman.

446
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,930
Why would I harass her?

447
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,010
I'm not a psychopath!

448
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,220
Shut up!

449
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,550
Listen, don't try to blame the victim!

450
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,170
You're not only a psychopath

451
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,460
but a pervert!

452
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Sir, the old woman insulted me!

453
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,960
I can defend myself

454
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,950
- by cursing her to die, right?
- Say that again!

455
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,870
Do you want a fight?

456
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,350
I'm scared, okay?

457
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,730
Hurry.

458
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,210
- Okay. Let's go.
- Come on.

459
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,660
Beat me. Come on!

460
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,700
Mom!

461
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,250
Mom, Mom, calm down.

462
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,800
- What happened?
- What happened?

463
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,870
Aunt Zhou and I

464
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,740
wanted to send some food to Tang

465
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,180
and saw

466
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,660
this pervert

467
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,900
taking pictures

468
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,220
of this girl
with his phone under her dress.

469
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,180
We caught him,

470
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,210
but he hit us

471
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,550
and asked us to pay compensation.

472
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,540
You saw it.

473
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,650
She was the one who hit me.

474
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,490
I didn't do anything.

475
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,690
You asked for it.

476
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,900
You gave her a cup.

477
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,520
Enough. Stop arguing with him.

478
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,560
We should call the police

479
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,620
and let them deal with it.

480
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,360
- Okay.
- What's the point?

481
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,940
There's no surveillance or evidence.

482
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,210
Yes, no surveillance.

483
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,330
Hello, I need to report

484
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,260
- How do you know?
- a suspected indecent assault

485
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,260
- or sexual harassment
- I get it.

486
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,110
- at Jade Garden Property Center.
- He must've done it before.

487
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,610
- Please come.
- The security cameras on the road

488
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,960
- have stopped working for a long time.
- Okay.

489
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,650
- Thanks.
- Yes.

490
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,540
So, there's no surveillance.
What's the point of calling the police?

491
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,460
Here's the thing. Well,

492
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,520
Room 301 in No. 2 Building,

493
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,650
the one that keeps pigeons,

494
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,490
has surveillance

495
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,590
in the dovecote.

496
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,840
We can ask them to give us

497
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,010
the footage.

498
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,320
I remember there are two cameras
at the south entrance.

499
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,200
They can also capture
the images of the corner.

500
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,180
Okay. We'll contact the owner.

501
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,530
- No problem.
- Okay.

502
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,110
Over there!

503
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,260
Are you still denying it?

504
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,650
Officers, I'm sorry!

505
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,410
I was out of my mind!

506
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,260
You can tell us at the police station.

507
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,260
You must be careful on the street.

508
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,350
Those perverts...

509
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,320
Thank you so much.

510
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,180
Thank you, officers.

511
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,030
Thank you so much.

512
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,180
If it weren't for you,

513
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,970
she would've suffered a lot

514
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,680
because she can't speak or call for help

515
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,660
when facing a pervert.

516
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,080
Thank you so much.

517
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,120
It's okay. We're neighbors.
It's not a big deal.

518
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,320
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

519
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,550
- Yes.
- As long as she's fine.

520
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,590
It's okay.

521
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,980
- Thanks.
- It's okay.

522
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,200
Here.

523
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,660
I always carry pepper spray.

524
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,770
Take this.

525
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,280
If you encounter a pervert,

526
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,420
use this to defend yourself.

527
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,220
Be careful! It's...

528
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,850
very spicy.

529
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,550
It's chili water.

530
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:16,850
Take it.

531
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,450
- Put it in your bag.
- Thanks.

532
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,290
It's okay.

533
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,190
If you have to walk alone at night,

534
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,280
choose the north entrance.

535
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,030
It's the main gate. It's safer.

536
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,530
- Thank you so much.
- Okay.

537
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,400
Okay.

538
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,250
Goodbye.

539
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,090
Okay. Goodbye.

540
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,380
Goodbye.

541
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

542
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,220
- Bye.
- Bye.

543
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,090
- Let's go.
- Okay.

544
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,320
Let's go.

545
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,220
Come on. Let's go home.

546
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,980
Luckily, we're fine.

547
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,460
If that man

548
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,700
had a knife...

549
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,160
If that man

550
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,180
was a desperado...

551
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,150
If he wanted to kill us,

552
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,280
how could two old ladies like us

553
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,870
defeat him?

554
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,180
We were too reckless.

555
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,170
Look,

556
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,180
you're family.

557
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,150
You threw a punch without hesitation,

558
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,940
whereas Jiang

559
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,980
remained calm.

560
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,890
He asked for the footage
and called the police.

561
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,810
Excellent work.

562
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,220
The pervert tried to hurt you.

563
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,150
You threw a punch first.

564
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,210
Yes. I was also reckless. I...

565
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,390
I must reflect on myself.

566
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,500
From now on, we must be smart

567
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,130
when helping others.

568
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,210
We can't resort to violence.

569
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,080
Oh no. Whatever happens,

570
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,520
we must stay calm

571
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,640
and come up with a plan.

572
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,110
Attack By Stratagem

573
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,940
in The Art of War is very useful.

574
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,430
"The highest form of generalship
is to balk the enemy's plans,"

575
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,610
that's what I'm talking about.

576
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,530
It means...

577
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,570
What's wrong?

578
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,220
The groceries we bought!

579
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,700
And the frozen food!

580
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,760
Wait!

581
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,600
Slow down.

582
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,030
Be careful.

583
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,070
Mr. Jiang, it seems you're
more mature and calm.

584
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,250
Wait. Why is your hand injured?

585
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,700
Is it because you hit someone?

586
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,870
Where are we going?

587
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,730
Ms. Wei is at the clubhouse.

588
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,600
It seems you know

589
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,450
my wife whereabouts

590
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,700
better than I do.

591
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,790
So, how do you know

592
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,830
there's surveillance at the dovecote?

593
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
I developed a habit

594
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,180
when I was living in Lancheng alone.

595
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,150
I don't walk on a road

596
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,760
without street lights or cameras

597
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,980
after 10:00 p.m.

598
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,390
I thought I was the only one doing this.

599
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,590
Then I found all my female colleagues

600
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,350
would do the same thing.

601
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,280
It seems

602
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,870
every single woman who lives alone

603
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,590
will become a great scout.

604
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,590
I was right.

605
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,200
About what?

606
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,740
You often called me

607
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,730
at 10:00 p.m.

608
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,070
when you were in Lancheng.

609
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,180
You would tell me

610
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,160
to work hard to survive the competition

611
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,210
or to rest well

612
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,260
and stay healthy.

613
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,150
I was wondering

614
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,640
if you were too scared
to walk alone at night.

615
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,880
Yes.

616
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,030
You used to go to sleep
at 5:00 or 6:00 p.m.

617
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,000
and get up at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m.,

618
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,410
but I forced you to go to sleep

619
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,700
at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m.

620
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,490
Cheng Hui told me it was hard for him
to get used to jet lag,

621
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,740
but it was never a problem

622
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,770
for me.

623
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,290
Tang,

624
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,660
where are the garbage bags?

625
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,310
In the closet.

626
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,290
The closet?

627
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,590
So, back then...

628
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,490
No. It's full of

629
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,420
your packages.

630
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,500
I'm coming.

631
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,530
Come on. Help me.

632
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,250
Why can't you find it?

633
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,360
They're in the closet.

634
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,260
At the bottom.

635
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,660
Look, it...

636
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,290
It's a mess. I can't find them.

637
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,130
Check it out.

638
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,720
- Mom, sit down.
- Where are they?

639
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,690
Did you run out of them?

640
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,560
Oh, I remember now. I bought it,

641
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,660
but I haven't unpacked it.

642
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,940
I remember I got a delivery.

643
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,790
Look how careless you are.

644
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,500
Listen,

645
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,450
you need to unpack the packages
once you get them

646
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,620
and put them in order,

647
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,610
- or you'll forget soon.
- Where are my scissors?

648
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,930
Now you've forgotten the scissors.

649
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,110
I put them right here.

650
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,090
Here.

651
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,790
- Let me do it.
- Here.

652
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,520
Listen,
when you get a package next time,

653
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,390
open it right away

654
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,940
and put it in order.

655
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,560
I've been busy,

656
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,500
so I forget to do it.

657
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,650
No matter how busy you are,

658
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,420
your house must be organized.

659
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,500
Don't embarrass me
in front of Mr. Jiang.

660
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,770
What? Jiang is our family.

661
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,250
Why are you embarrassed? Look at you.

662
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,970
- We're family.
- I got it. I got it.

663
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,170
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhou.

664
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,890
Be careful. Don't break it.

665
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,730
I...

666
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,680
Careful.

667
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,500
Look at you.

668
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,350
Remember to wash your hands.

669
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
I got it.

670
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,360
It's dirty.

671
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,740
Ms. Zhou, this is too much.

672
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,870
Look, a piece of cake.

673
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,870
One bag is enough.

674
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,520
First, it can prevent leakage.

675
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,490
Second,

676
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,820
you don't have to do it again.

677
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,730
Come on.

678
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,220
You're so smart.

679
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,490
It's easy to tell who can do housework

680
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,590
and who can't.

681
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,410
Can you please not be

682
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,740
so good at everything?

683
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,450
I want to save you some trouble.

684
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,220
You're making me look stupid.

685
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,460
I didn't finish my words.

686
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,980
Go ahead.

687
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,320
Tang, help me change the channel.

688
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,630
I can't figure it out.

689
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,750
Tang, hurry.

690
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,510
- Why isn't it working?
- I'll ask my driver

691
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,570
- to send them home.
- Tang, why isn't this working?

692
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,630
Be quick.

693
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,740
I'm coming.

694
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:48,850
What's wrong?

695
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,140
The controller is so advanced.

696
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,580
- How can we change channels?
- It's high-tech.

697
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,720
Aunt Yi, which channel?

698
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,090
Mr. Gan,

699
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,650
Ms. Wei

700
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,740
is still working.

701
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,500
You have to wait for a while.

702
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,900
What does she want?

703
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Ms. Wei will come

704
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,350
after finishing her work.

705
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,260
Mr. Gan, would you like
something to eat?

706
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,870
Your uncle is Zhou Zixing.

707
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,310
You don't need her help.

708
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,180
There have been many men

709
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,790
around Wei Changqiu over the years.

710
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,810
However,

711
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,280
you're the youngest

712
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,180
and most handsome man.

713
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,980
I just can't figure out

714
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,350
what you want?

715
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,180
Mr. Gan, you're injured.

716
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,420
Can you still go to work tomorrow?

717
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,120
Tang.

718
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,730
The corns are cooked.

719
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,500
You just need to add some water

720
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,600
and put them in the microwave
for five minutes.

721
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,440
Okay.

722
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,460
I also bought some ready-to-eat carrots.

723
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,910
Just wash them before eating.

724
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,420
- Okay.
- Besides,

725
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,900
I prepared

726
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,960
some steamed breads.

727
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,880
Did you see them?

728
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,310
The shelf life is three months,

729
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,220
but once opened,
they'll be stale in three days.

730
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,730
Therefore, two breads a day,

731
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,740
and you'll finish all six of them
in three days.

732
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,730
I got it.

733
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,560
Thank you, Ms. Zhou,

734
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,690
you're the best.

735
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,660
Aunt Yi,

736
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,440
Jiang Shiyan,

737
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,220
thank you for today.

738
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,490
Stop pretending to be polite.

739
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,330
Aunt Zhou,

740
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,680
Mom,

741
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,560
I'm calling the driver

742
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,940
to send you home, okay?

743
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,040
I... I'll come back later.

744
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,630
Yes. I need to talk to Jiang Shiyan
about some stuff.

745
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,640
Yes.

746
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,630
Just suit yourself.

747
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,350
We'll watch TV.

748
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,550
We'll have nothing to do
when we get home.

749
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,110
Yes. Look at your father.

750
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,490
He plays chess

751
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,210
in the garden every night

752
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,030
and won't come back until 10:00 p.m.

753
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,360
Move.

754
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,320
Come on. I want to talk to you.

755
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,520
I'll get some snacks for you.

756
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,830
She has many good snacks.

757
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,870
Here, so many snacks.

758
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,340
Come, let's see what she's got.

759
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,090
This one.

760
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,420
I recommend this.

761
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,810
Try this.

762
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,900
The duck necks are so good.

763
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,890
Other brands

764
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,040
are only spicy.

765
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,650
These are spicy and yummy.

766
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,550
Try this.

767
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,590
Gloves.

768
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,260
No need. I've got this.

769
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,390
Try this. Do you like it?

770
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,040
- It's so good.
- Where can I buy it?

771
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,660
Tang, where did you buy it?

772
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,080
- What?
- Well,

773
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,680
where did you get the duck necks?

774
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,110
Jiang Shiyan brought it.

775
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,150
You can find it on Yixiu Found of Food.

776
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,630
Yixiu.

777
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,250
Why didn't you

778
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,090
bring some home?

779
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,190
- Well...
- It's okay. We've got plenty of them.

780
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,390
There are duck stomachs too.

781
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,360
Every time I come here,

782
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,860
I don't want to go back
after eating the snacks.

783
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,330
You can take them all later.

784
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,360
By the way,

785
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,900
our class monitor gave me a flash drive.

786
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,490
There are some videos

787
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,180
of our classmates in high school.

788
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,150
He wanted to make a short video

789
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,180
and play it at our class reunion.

790
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,120
Then I'll help you

791
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,250
to upload them to the server.

792
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,090
Okay.

793
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,830
Someone can edit it.

794
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,180
When's the reunion?

795
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,400
Why didn't I know it?

796
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,420
We haven't set a date.

797
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,880
The monitor said he needed
to count the people first.

798
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,250
We talked about it
at the reunion last time.

799
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,350
You didn't come.

800
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,030
Look at you.

801
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,050
Mr. Gan.

802
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,490
Mr. Gan.

803
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,760
I can handle it.

804
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,600
Just go back.

805
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,440
Okay.

806
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,110
Have you finished?

807
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,010
It looks like

808
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,180
he's royal to you,

809
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,740
but he might be

810
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,180
up to something else.

811
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,770
He wants money,

812
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,030
just like you back then.

813
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,290
He...

814
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,180
He's not that simple.

815
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,980
Don't overestimate yourself.

816
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,520
He might set you up

817
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,460
one day.

818
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,900
Mind your own business first.

819
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,590
You'll be destroyed by women
sooner or later.

820
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,460
You already got me a long time ago.

821
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,590
I've done so much dirty work for you.

822
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,110
If it's exposed,

823
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,630
none of us can get away.

824
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,390
We're married.

825
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,320
We can never

826
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,390
get rid of each other.

827
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,880
Each of us

828
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,460
should have some fun.

829
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,700
What do you want from me?

830
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,150
Linjiang project

831
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,420
has a funding gap.

832
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,010
Zhou Mo

833
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,080
is working on CBBC.

834
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,300
I need you to figure out
something else for me.

835
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,290
When?

836
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,070
Within three months.

837
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,620
I've uploaded them.

838
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,240
I'll send it to you when it's finished,

839
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,820
- Okay.
- and you can send it to him.

840
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,120
I should've hidden the snacks.

841
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,230
Why are they still eating?

842
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,180
When will they stop?

843
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,070
Eating snacks is not a big deal.

844
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,150
It's holding things up.

845
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,520
I'll buy her plenty of snacks

846
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,160
so that she can eat them at home.

847
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,510
I remember

848
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,040
there was a time

849
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,780
when I couldn't finish
my computer homework

850
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,310
because I was busy
preparing for competitions,

851
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,090
and you'd finish my homework every time.

852
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,110
I've been wondering

853
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,820
why the teacher never found out

854
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,340
our assignments

855
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,070
were exactly the same.

856
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,300
Who told you they were the same?

857
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,950
I wrote different answers.

858
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,660
I never knew.

859
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,150
- Tang.
- So, you...

860
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,860
I'll sleep here tonight.

861
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,510
The cultural center said

862
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,450
the reading conference
at the library on Saturday

863
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,450
was rescheduled

864
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,300
to tomorrow.

865
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,960
It's more convenient to get there
from your apartment.

866
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,250
Convenient?

867
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,690
Jiang Shiyan,

868
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,300
when are we going back?

869
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,260
It's almost 10:00 p.m.

870
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,360
I'm a little tired.

871
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,220
Mom, you can stay.

872
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,480
Then I'm leaving.

873
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,300
Okay. Let's go.

874
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,160
I'll pack some snacks for you.

875
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,470
No need. Jiang Shiyan
will buy them for me.

876
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,010
Just take some home.

877
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,720
No need. We're leaving.

878
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,560
Okay.

879
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,810
I'll leave this to you.

880
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,610
- Remember to clean...
- No problem.

881
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,340
Then I won't walk you out.

882
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,550
- Let's go.
- Be safe.

883
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,380
- I'll get my shoes.
- Tang.

884
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,040
I'm going to take a shower.

885
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,180
Okay, I'll see them off.

886
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,180
We're leaving.

887
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,560
Goodbye, Tang.

888
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,560
Okay.

889
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,260
Goodbye, aunt.

890
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,440
Be safe.

891
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,160
(Is there anything else)

892
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,610
(Tang Yang)
(that I don't know?)

893
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,660
(Let me think about it.)

894
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,780
(Jiang Shiyan)

895
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,200
(You're doing this on purpose.)

896
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,010
(Tang Yang)
(You don't need to recall them.)

897
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,920
(Jiang Shiyan)
(Nothing important.)

898
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,630
(Tell me.)

899
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,420
(Tang Yang)

900
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,200
Stop playing with your phone.
Take a shower.

901
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Okay, I'm coming.

902
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,040
Look at you.

903
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,200
You've worked all day.

904
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,040
Aren't you tired?

905
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,290
What?

906
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,510
- What's wrong?
- Why is it gone?

907
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,210
What's gone?

908
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,820
I just bought it. Why is it gone?

909
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,810
The orders.

910
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,700
Did you buy it on Yixiu?

911
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:58,810
Yes.

912
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,820
I saw Sheng Nina's streaming

913
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,130
and bought it immediately.

914
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,630
I also told Ms. Zhou about it.

915
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,510
That's right. Why haven't I received it?

916
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,200
Your platform is too slow.

917
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,150
I'll file a complaint.

918
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,430
What's wrong?

919
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,050
Stop playing. Take a shower.

920
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,470
Okay, I got it.

921
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,440
Hurry up.

922
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,200
Look what you did.

923
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,970
You only put it in the cart.

924
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,180
You never paid, okay?

925
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,710
Even if you're my mother,
they won't send you the product

926
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,060
(Instant Sweet Corns)
until you pay for it.

927
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,900
(Shopping Cart)

928
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,340
Did you do this?

929
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,860
Why would I do that?

930
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:47,180
(Tang Yang: Tell me.)

931
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,260
(WeChat, Now,
Jiang Shiyan: One Message Unread)

932
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,860
There's a coupon.

933
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,810
Jiang Shiyan. Jiang Shiyan,

934
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,010
how can I use the coupon?

935
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:05,890
Mom, stop doing it.

936
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,100
I'll buy it for you tomorrow.

937
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,290
Mr. Liu, drop me off

938
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,380
when you leave the overpass.

939
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,510
Send my mother home.

940
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:12,690
Where are you going?

941
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,660
Company.

942
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,430
Why are you
going to the company at this hour?

943
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,550
Buy duck necks for you.

944
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,860
You don't have to buy them now.

945
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,220
(It seems there are many things
I want to tell you,)

946
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,270
(but I don't know how to start.)

947
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,670
(Back then, I always felt
that you were nice to me.)

948
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,470
(I didn't know how to pay it back.)

949
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,940
(Jiang Shiyan)

950
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:47,420
(Jiang Shiyan)

951
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,950
(Actually...)

952
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,380
(Have you arrived?)

953
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,820
(Can I go to your place now?)

954
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,740
(Is it a little bit late?)

955
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,150
(Tang Yang)
(I'm going out now.)

956
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,860
(Can you go downstairs?)

957
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,950
What did you tell Aunt Yi?

958
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,510
I said I had to work.

959
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,110
Then go to the company.

960
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,330
Goodbye, then.

961
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,560
Don't go.

962
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,690
I won't.

963
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,600
Why did you

964
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,440
suddenly come back?

965
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,990
You asked me to tell you,

966
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,840
so I wanted to tell you.

967
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,850
But I hate typing,

968
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,690
so...

969
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,630
I'm here.

970
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:10,850
Then...

971
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,850
tell me.

972
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,010
I just remembered I forgot to tell you

973
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:19,990
something important.

974
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,040
Well...

975
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,950
I founded Yixiu Found of Food

976
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,290
because of you.

977
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,480
Where is Yang?

978
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,300
She's in the principal's office.

979
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,330
Is she okay?

980
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,160
Maybe they're rewarding her

981
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,520
for winning another competition.

982
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,820
I really envy the good students.

983
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,400
They can be praised every day.

984
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,400
Shiyan.

985
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,660
Is Yang crying?

986
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,210
Move.

987
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,850
Yang.

988
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,600
Shiyan.

989
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,700
Why are you crying so hard?

990
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,510
Did the principal scold you?

991
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,650
No.

992
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,680
Did someone bully you?

993
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,520
I'll beat him up.

994
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,820
What did the principal do?

995
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,110
My eyes hurt so badly.

996
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,530
When I went to the office,

997
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,340
a mosquito bit me on the leg.

998
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,120
I borrowed some cooling balm,

999
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,520
but I forgot I'd used it

1000
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,700
and rubbed my eyes,

1001
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,090
and I couldn't stop crying.

1002
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,450
I can't open my eyes.

1003
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,450
- Oh my god.
- It hurts.

1004
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,890
Come on. Let me blow on your eyes.

1005
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,730
Let me help you.

1006
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,040
No, No.

1007
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:53,240
- Are you feeling better?
- No. You blew too hard. No.

1008
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,330
Stop blowing. Take her to wash her eyes.

1009
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,600
Okay. Let's go.

1010
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,950
Come on.

1011
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,430
No, wait!

1012
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,620
- Which way?
- Over there.

1013
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,610
The restroom is over there.

1014
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,860
How can we get into the ladies restroom?

1015
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,050
Let's go to the water supply room.

1016
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,990
Wait.

1017
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,680
The wind is so strong!

1018
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,950
Block the wind. Hang in there.

1019
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,470
The... The wind!

1020
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,720
- Are you better now?
- No!

1021
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,580
Not at all!

1022
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,420
Hang in there.

1023
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,500

Please turn to page 64.

1026
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,510
With the rapid growth of productivity,

1027

social structures

1028
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,300
and the world situation...

1029
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:32,880
Jiang Shiyan.

1030
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,750
(Geography)
Is this a history textbook?

1031
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,070
Where is it?

1032
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,590
My textbook

1033
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,960
