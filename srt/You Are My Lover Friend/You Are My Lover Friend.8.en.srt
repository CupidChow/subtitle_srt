28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,630
Thank you, sir. We have arrived home.

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,800
Hurry back.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,800
Mom.

31
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,190
We are back.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,630
Son, you are back.

33
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,660
Give me the backpack.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,150
What's wrong with your face?

35
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,130
I fell.

36
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,150
You fell?

37
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,760
This is the cinnamon tea of Matouyan.

38
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,410
I have tried. Really nice.

39
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,740
I brought you a box to try.

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,580
- OK.
- This is

41
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,440
broken spore powder
of Ganoderma lucidum.

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,110
I heard that the results are good.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,860
You have to eat on time.

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,300
Health is the most important.

45
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,990
This thing is so expensive.

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,850
You should save the money

47
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,150
and spend it on yourself.

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,440
I have saved some money. Don't worry.

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,860
These things are not expensive.

50
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,290
And this is designed

51
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,710
by my friend's jewelry studio.

52
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,690
I thought it is perfect for you

53
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,020
the moment I saw it.

54
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,090
Not tacky.

55
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,970
It looks great.

56
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,950
You need to try this size to see if it fits.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,200
Is it my birthday

58
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,090
or your birthday today?

59
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,290
You gave me so many gifts.

60
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,600
I'm having a birthday.

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,340
As long as you are happy,
I am happy too.

62
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,110
I have to line up for the cake.

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,710
So I arrived late.

64
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,880
Mr. Zhou.

65
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,110
Mo, today is your birthday.

66
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,860
Stay and have a meal together.

67
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,410
Ms., I haven't finished my work yet.

68
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,570
I need to go back to the company first.

69
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,040
I'll come and have dinner with you
another day.

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,130
How come you're leaving so soon?

71
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,130
Work is not finished yet.

72
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,320
I'll come see you another day.

73
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,460
Well, you…

74
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,690
Look at him.

75
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,150
Why is he so busy?

76
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,710
Mr. Jiang

77
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:26,850
has departed.

78
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,410
This is delicious.

79
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,460
This is also good.

80
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,850
The traffic is a bit congested.

81
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,460
It may take a few more minutes.

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,600
Do not want this.

83
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,010
This is good. Dark chocolate.

84
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,250
Mr. Jiang has arrived.

85
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,460
Gambling tycoon loves it.

86
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,990
My favorite crispy snacks.

87
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,620
You are welcome to come often
if you like.

88
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,580
It's not about the number of times,

89
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,430
but about gaining something each time.

90
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,300
Yes, you are right.

91
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,730
I first learned

92
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,730
about Zhilan Snacks

93
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,880
when Sheng Nina and the others

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,100
came over to discuss business.

95
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,360
As soon as she left the crew,

96
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,750
she had the assistant line up to buy.

97
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,240
I was very curious at that time

98
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,510
how delicious it can be.

99
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,580
I tried it and it tasted really good.

100
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,480
(Everyone is equal in front of food)
It's not a matter of taste.

101
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,640
Zhilan Snacks is a new restaurant.

102
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,570
In your Yi Xiu Community,

103
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,900
this restaurant is not popular at all.

104
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,420
You can't say that like this.

105
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,220
Every restaurant comes from a new one.

106
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,020
I'm just hoping you can help

107
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,810
boost the popularity.

108
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,420
Don't flatter me too much.

109
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,440
We don't need to talk
about our personal relationship.

110
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,840
But you also know

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,510
we only try out those restaurant
with long queues.

112
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,190
I can't help you with Zhilan Snacks.

113
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,900
I will take you to the restaurant
another day.

114
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,440
Try it and then you consider it.

115
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,580
There's nothing to consider.

116
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
As a CEO,

117
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
you're busy with numerous tasks
every day.

118
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,360
Why are you so interested

119
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,510
in such a small restaurant?

120
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,170
Weren't we relying

121
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,510
on visiting small restaurants one by one

122
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,810
and accumulating notes

123
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,580
by back in the day?

124
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,870
I never forget why I started.

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,870
I have been fooled

126
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,660
by you all the time.

127
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,680
Look at the time, buddy.

128
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,830
Where are you?

129
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,580
What should the three of us do?

130
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,780
It's quite awkward, buddy.

131
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,100
Fine, I owe you this time.

132
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,390
Miss Sheng,

133
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,310
Cheng Hui is not coming.

134
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,710
He said you invited us to dinner

135
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,680
and he…

136
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,490
He arranged this meal.

137
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,460
How could he not come?

138
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,900
You are right.

139
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,880
Cheng Hui told me before

140
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Miss Sheng

141
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,320
accidentally broke the glasses

142
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,950
we lent him to try on.

143
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,810
Originally, we thought

144
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,900
it doesn't matter.

145
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,810
But suddenly he said

146
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,100
he'd like to treat us to a meal

147
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,870
and also asked us if we are willing
to come.

148
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,210
We actually

149
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,850
have long heard of Miss Sheng's
great reputation.

150
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,450
So…

151
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,830
Cheng Hui has always been like this.

152
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,420
Let me tell you a story about him.

153
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,340
We agreed

154
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
traveling from Shanghai
to Suzhou together

155
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,720
to visit an exhibition.

156
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,610
We agreed to go together at afternoon.

157
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,100
As a result, he suddenly...

158
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,170
He suddenly wanted to ride a bike.

159
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,270
At three o'clock in the morning,

160
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,640
he went for a bike ride

161
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,370
and then rode back.

162
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,190
After that, he took a ride with us.

163
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,340
He

164
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,150
is such a weird person.

165
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,360
It's OK.

166
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,000
I was also planning

167
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,510
to apologize to you in person today.

168
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,370
I heard that those glasses are very special.

169
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,390
They are not available outside.

170
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,610
I'm really sorry, guys.

171
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,570
Today,

172
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,900
I'm very glad to meet you all.

173
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,160
To everyone.

174
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,410
Miss Sheng,

175
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,610
it's OK.

176
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,840
Those glasses

177
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,660
are for trial.

178
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,770
After the new product is released,

179
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,440
I will make a reservation

180
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,310
for you and Cheng Hui.

181
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,660
That's great.

182
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,950
Actually, I

183
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,080
am quite interested

184
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,980
in those high-tech products.

185
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,190
I'll empty it.

186
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,870
Cheng Hui is too strange.

187
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,010
I invited his friends to have a meal

188
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,190
and apologized in person.

189
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,440
He said his friends couldn't eat,

190
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,830
and then he said his friends could eat.

191
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,570
I thought it was my fault

192
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,420
so I offered to treat him.

193
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,050
But in the end,

194
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,050
he didn't show up himself,

195
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,220
only sending his friends instead.

196
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,660
How can things be done like this?

197
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,930
Fortunately, Mr. Lin and the others

198
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,100
are relatively polite.

199
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,530
And I checked in advance.

200
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,930
It is a quite famous

201
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,020
technology company.

202
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,710
It can be considered a leader
in the industry.

203
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,580
Otherwise it would be too embarrassing.

204
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,390
Let's go.

205
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,570
I want to ask Jiang Shiyan

206
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,540
what's going on with Cheng Hui.

207
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,560
I think this thing

208
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,610
is too suspicious.

209
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,370
He has always refused
to accept compensation

210
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,750
and didn't show up for dinner.

211
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,770
I feel like he just wants this matter

212
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,630
to remain unresolved.

213
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,330
What benefit does it bring to him

214
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,700
if this matter cannot be resolved?

215
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,730
Let you feel like you owe him
all the time.

216
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,270
Maybe there will be a chance
to see him again.

217
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,320
Nonsense.

218
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,900
You're making this sound stranger.

219
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,510
It's strange from the beginning.

220
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,500
(Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant)

221
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,780
This is our office area.

222
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,760
They are our excellent

223
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,800
workers.

224
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,920
They have good skills,

high consciousness,

226
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,470
and are willing to work hard.

227
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,750
Our plant's development relies entirely
on them.

228
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,000
Ms. Tang,

229
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,880
we have advanced

230
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,160
production lines and equipment

231
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,400
that can produce different types of steel,

232
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,490
such as construction steel,

233
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,420
machinery steel, and automotive steel.

234
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,800
We also have a team

235
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,820
of experienced technicians

236
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,370
who can customize production

237
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,780
according to customer requirements

238
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,940
to meet the needs of different fields.

239
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,640
Please follow me.

240
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,400
Dear leaders, please come over here
and take a look.

241
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,280
This machine

242
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,250
is one of the few devices

243
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,250
we have domestically.

244
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,210
It's excellent.

245
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,130
And it can produce

246
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,610
very delicate

247
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,510
special small steel materials.

248
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,600
Ms. Tang.

249
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,150
Ms. Tang, here.

250
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,170
Let's take a look at this side.

251
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,010
Come and visit.

252
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,130
This machine is a very advanced one

253
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,470
in our country.

254
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,760
Mr. Jiang.

255
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,090
Here you are.

256
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,640
You are really lucky today.

257
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,560
Originally,

258
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,300
we were going to visit Ms.
He's Spicy Hotpot tonight,

259
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,010
but we received a call

260
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,860
before setting off,

261
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,400
saying there was a food safety issue.

262
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,370
Then I received your call

263
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,230
asking me to come over.

264
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,210
This is destined by God.

265
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,590
You can't miss this restaurant.

266
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,200
As a food blogger

267
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,420
with millions of followers,

268
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,450
it would be a huge loss

269
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,650
if you don't discover this restaurant

270
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,900
right away.

271
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,970
What I'm more curious about is

272
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,130
why you are so concerned

273
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:27,970
about Zilan Snacks.

274
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,210
This restaurant started out

275
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,180
as a small stall

276
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,820
and gradually grew into what it is today.

277
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,990
I remember the days

278
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,150
when I first started my food blog.

279
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,820
With the initial intention

280
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,230
of enjoying good food,

281
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,410
I visited each restaurant,

282
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,520
eating and writing along the way.

283
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,160
There are not many restaurants

284
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,020
that are delicious and
don't have long queues now.

285
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,700
Why not eat more now?

286
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,170
When they become popular and crowded,

287
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,400
it will be troublesome to wait in line.

288
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,540
I really hate waiting in line.

289
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,150
(Zhilan Snacks)
Medium spicy or…

290
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,780
- Medium spicy.
- OK.

291
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,520
- Coriander?
- Yes.

292
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,360
Come on.

293
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,970
This one.

294
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,810
Here.

295
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,940
OK, thank you.

296
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,610
Do you want chili?

297
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,520
A little bit?

298
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Chili makes it better.

299
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,360
OK.

300
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,760
Mr. Jiang,

301
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,230
don't you think this is a queue?

302
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,680
It won't take more than an hour.

303
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,520
Is this a queue?

304
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,090
Standing for a while before eating

305
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,330
is beneficial for physical health.

306
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,790
- Choose for yourself.
- There are vacant seats.

307
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,900
Go. Let's sit down to order.

308
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,230
What would you liket?

309
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,400
Here.

310
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,350
Here is a pair of gloves.

311
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,570
OK.

312
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,690
Mildly spicy?

313
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,010
- Try it.
- OK.

314
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,850
Here is your portion.

315
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,760
Ms., I want this one.

316
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,350
This one. OK.

317
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,150
OK.

318
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,870
Some coriander?

319
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,940
Here you go.

320
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,590
OK.

is scheduled at her crew's hotel.

325
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,120
Then what?

326
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,970
Mr. Jiang is asking

327
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,730
if you can bring your technical

328
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,350
and operations team for a visit.

329
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,330
Then what?

330
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,650
Can I book a flight for you

331
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,350
at five p.m.?

332
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,550
Please let me know who you want to bring

333
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,520
so that I can book a flight ticket.

334
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,690
OK.

335
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,390
I have already sent you the list.

336
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,360
OK.

337
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,650
Do you want to go back and pack up?

338
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,087
- After that, I'll arrange a car...
- Zhang, a cup of coffee, please.

339

Do you want to go back and pack up?

340

- After that, I'll arrange a car...
- Zhang, a cup of coffee, please.

341

To take you to the airport.

342

Pack what?

343

Replacing clothes and stuff.

344
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,700
Is there no supermarket over there?

Peng Si.

346
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,630
You don't know about this.

347
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,490
When Mr. Cheng is on a business trip,

348
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,330
apart from electronic products,
data cables,

349
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,290
and charging cables,

350
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,900
everything else will be purchased
locally.

351
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,250
Excuse me. May I ask

352
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,870
if there are any shops around here?

353
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,330
This place is a bit remote.

354
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,330
There are fewer shops.

355
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,560
Are you looking to buy something?

356
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,540
Just the underwear and underpants.

357
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,400
OK, let me check

358
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,110
if there are any shops still open at this time.

359
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,290
Mr. Cheng.

360
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,000
Miss Sheng.

361
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,090
You just arrived.

362
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,420
Is the check-in process completed?

363
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,520
It's done.

364
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,490
Thank you for your help this time.

365
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,020
I heard that you came here on purpose.

366
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,020
It's OK. There's nothing
to worry about.

367
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,250
Sir, I have checked it for you.

368
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,010
The shops around here have all closed.

369
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,220
If you want to buy it,

370
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,850
you can only wait until the shops
open tomorrow,

371
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,160
or we arrange a car

372
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,430
to take you to the county town tonight.

373
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,610
But if we go there now,

374
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,590
the shops in the county town

375
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,630
may have already closed.

376
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,270
What do you need to buy?

377
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,250
We have brought all the things we need.

378
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,510
Maybe we have what you need.

379
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,370
I don't think you have

380
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,270
what I need.

381
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,440
This sir would like to buy

382
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,780
some clean underwear and underpants.

383
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,930
Under…

384
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,590
Mainly underpants.

385
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,450
We really don't

386
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,660
have this.

387
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,660
Did you forget to bring it?

388
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,150
I didn't bring anything.

389
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,940
Didn't bring anything?

390
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,250
Were you in such a hurry?

391
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,180
No hurry.

392
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,020
I just don't have the habit
of bringing it.

393
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,330
Well…

394
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,680
Take Mr. Cheng

395
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,660
to the costume department.

396
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,350
Maybe they can help Mr. Cheng.

397
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,230
OK, Mr. Cheng, please come with me.

398
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,540
Thank you.

399
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,690
You're welcome.

400
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,450
Hello everyone, this is Daily Menu.

401
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,130
Recently, there is a restaurant

402
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,700
called Zhilan Snacks on Yi Xiu Gourmet

403
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,760
that is particularly popular.

404
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,530
This restaurant was mentioned

405
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,730
by many food notes.

406
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,890
It is said that this restaurant

407
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,880
used to be a very small storefront

408
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,050
and only opened for business

409
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,130
after five o'clock in the evening.

410
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,090
Now it has moved to this new location,

411
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,090
with a larger storefront

412
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,010
and increasing popularity.

413
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,560
Today I will try to see

414
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,650
if it is as delicious as everyone says.

415
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,490
Let's go.

416
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,860
(Zhilan Snacks)

417
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,500
(Zhilan Snacks)

418
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,590
Your dishes are all here.

419
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,290
Well,

420
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,450
I finally got

421
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,800
the most anticipated

422
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,540
spicy braised pig intestines.

423
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,180
There is no odor at all.

424
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,640
Very fresh.

425
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,210
Then when you chew,

426
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,850
the texture is exceptionally silky.

427
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,450
Overall, it is soft and chewy.

428
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,890
I see special marinade

429
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,230
below it.

430
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,480
The saltiness of the marinade

431
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,800
is just right and the spiciness
is moderate.

432
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,520
There is still a hint of sweetness
lingering.

433
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,400
This marinade is quite refreshing.

434
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,240
Unlike some marinades,

435
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,920
this one doesn't make your throat

436
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,940
tighten up after one bite.

437
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,700
So delicious.

438
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,900
This is also their signature dish,

439
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,960
braised pig's trotters.

440
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,590
Worth a try.

441
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,050
When torn open,

442
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,940
it feels especially chewy.

443
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,300
(Zhilan Snacks)

444
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,940
The spicy sauce must be placed
at the door.

445
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,420
The kitchen

446
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,660
needs to be equipped with glass.

447
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,930
Print those internet-famous slogans

448
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,700
and stick them on the wall.

449
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,980
The atmosphere is about to change.

450
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,450
Young people came here for check-in.

451
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,560
It became popular all of a sudden.

452
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,250
Zhang Zhilan told me

453
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,110
these are all Ms. Tang's ideas.

454
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,490
I was wondering which Ms. Tang

455
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,390
is so clever.

456
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,870
Close at hand.

457
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,970
I summarized the patterns

458
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,470
from the videos taken by those bloggers

459
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,160
on Yi Xiu Gourmet.

460
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,650
Putting the braised dishes at the door

461
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,650
can allow everyone
to see the production process,

462
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,220
increase attractiveness and popularity.

463
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,000
Additionally, it is convenient
for takeout packaging

464
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,030
and eating on the go,

465
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,210
making it easy for bloggers

466
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,390
to check in and take photos.

467
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,030
It's a win-win situation.

468
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,310
By the way,

469
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,600
today I watched a video

470
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,210
of that famous food blogger,

471
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,560
Daily Menu.

472
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,390
He tried out Zhilan Snacks.

473
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,970
And the number of likes on that video

474
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,070
is especially high.

475
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,800
The restaurants he had visited before

476
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,970
were all super famous

477
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,350
internet celebrity ones.

478
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,760
I really didn't expect

479
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,700
that he also paid attention
to Zhilan Snacks.

480
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,120
Yang,

481
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,800
you don't know about this.

482
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,460
That was not a coincidence at all.

483
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,550
Daily Menu said

484
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,280
he went to try out Zhilan Snacks

485
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,890
purely because of Mr. Jiang's adherence

486
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,410
to his original aspirations.

487
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,940
Come and have some scallops.

488
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,350
Adherence to original aspirations?

489
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,600
I saw Zhang Zhilan

490
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,550
with her child that day.

491
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,420
Is she a single mother?

492
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,870
She grew up in an orphanage.

493
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,830
She married a soldier.

494
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,250
After her husband sacrificed,

495
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,500
she became a martyr's family member.

496
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,360
Many of the employees in her restaurant

497
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,350
are military wives.

498
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,490
There.

499
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,700
Why are you looking at me?

500
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,490
How could you wipe with a tissue?

501
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,660
You need to wipe it with a wet tissue.

502
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,870
Otherwise, the taste cannot be erased.

503
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,520
Stop wiping.

504
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,010
You wiped so much oil on me.

505
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:13,850
Hurry up!

506
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,040
The more you wipe, the dirtier it gets.

507
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
I'm going to wash up.

508
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,700
- Take it.
- No need.

509
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,260
You seem to lack common sense in life.

510
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,260
You are just messing around.

511
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,310
These are all taught by my wife.

512
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,800
How is the situation of this site visit?

513
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,260
Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant

514
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,870
is an old industrial enterprise.

515
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,600
If there are no issues

516
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,750
with the site visit and materials,

517
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,150
we can consider approving it.

518
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,040
The VIP Client Department

519
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,590
has been bothering us constantly.

520
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,090
Of course.

521
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,400
Since I have delegated the case

522
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,500
to you,

523
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,120
I want to see

524
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,500
how you will handle it specifically.

525
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,310
Mr. Gan, it's like this.

526
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,490
Including telephone interviews,

527
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,210
we conducted three site visits.

528
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,740
Every time, we found there are
some significant issues.

529
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,930
They described

530
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,080
that it is in the top ten in the industry,

531
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,320
but after the recent update,

532
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,250
its ranking has dropped

533
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,390
to beyond 100.

534
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,490
And there are signs

535
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,320
that the factory equipment
has not been used much.

536
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,560
There is also a problem

537
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,600
with telephone interviews.

538
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,460
Talk about it later at the meeting.

539
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,530
OK.

540
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,070
There is another question.

541
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,180
Your words

542
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,630
are too polite.

543
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,170
For risk control

544
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,210
and work at the grassroots level,

545
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,750
the scope and boundaries
should be considered.

546
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,150
The Credit Audit Division
is just the opposite.

547
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,930
Yes or no?

548
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,320
To be or not to be?

549
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,360
If there is really a problem,

550
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,730
even it is Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant,

551
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,310
there will have no room for maneuver.

552
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,220
I understand. Thank you, Mr. Gan.

553
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,170
If someone had told me so much

554
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,210
when I first joined the division,

555
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,410
I would have avoided

556
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,030
a lot of detours.

557
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,450
I envy you

558
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,110
for having encountered a good leader.

559
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,400
Mr. Gan,

560
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,690
just say what you have to say.

561
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,070
What are all these actions for?

562
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,460
You are the leader.

563
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,660
It's inappropriate.

564
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,420
Don't you knock on the door?

565
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,840
I have told you many times.

566
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,740
I don't know.

567
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,180
Mr. Gan, I'll go first.

568
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,760
(Converge Business Bank of China)
Lanchun Iron and Steel Plant

569
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,350
has been cooperating with us
for over ten years.

570
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,980
During this period,

571
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,870
the total amount of the
loan exceeded 500 million.

572
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,210
Any questions

573
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,110
never happened.

574
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,010
The amount of this loan

575
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,260
is less than 30 million.

576
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,460
The mortgage valuation
exceeds 40 million.

577
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
In theory,

578
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,450
it should be approved directly.

579
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,590
Our department

580
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,210
needs your division

581
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,410
to review it

582
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,830
because there is

583
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,730
a slight risk issue

584
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,570
with the current system.

585
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,040
Hope you can approve it
as soon as possible

586
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,170
from the perspective

587
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,260
of retaining customers.

588
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,490
It is like this.

589
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,600
Li Mingwei owns

590
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,120
a total of four cars.

591
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,840
The Mercedes-Benz 2015 C200,

592
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Porsche Macan 2016 model,

593
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,160
Bentley Bentayga Sport Utility Vehicle

594
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,830
and Range Rover Evoque.

595
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,600
But Porsche and Bentley

596
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,970
are purchased second-hand.

597
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,010
He concealed this

598
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,970
in the mortgage documents,

599
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,320
increasing our approval risk.

600
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,980
The mortgage is based on the value.

601
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,150
It's not a question of first-hand
or second-hand.

602
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,500
If all your questions are like this,

603
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,790
there's no need to talk.

604
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,840
We have checked the consumption records

605
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,460
of Li Mingwei.

606
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,410
In 2019,

607
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,320
his clothing consumption

608
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,490
reached 400,000.

609
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,280
In 2020, it is 300,000.

610
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,800
But in the year 2022,

611
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,070
it is plummeted to less than 20,000.

612
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,360
He is under too much pressure.

613
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,630
It's normal to save money.

614
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,770
This recording

615
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,180
is from our telephone interview.

616
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,550
(Phone recording)

617
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:42,850
Hello?

618
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,570
Is this Mr. Li Mingwei?

619
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,630
I am from the Credit Audit
Division of Converge Business Bank.

620
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,410
Is this Mr. Li Mingwei?

621
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,440
I am from the Credit Audit Division
of Converge Business Bank.

622
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,170
I'd like to make a simple
telephone interview

623
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,040
about the pledge issue
of Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant.

624
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,110
OK, what questions do you have?

625
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,120
May I ask if you are
the legal representative

626
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,890
- from Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant?
- Dear passengers,

627
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,150
the approaching station is…

628
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,320
There is only one bus route

629
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,670
at the Lanchuan Bus Stop

630
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,930
near the Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant.

631
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,450
Bus 829.

632
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,600
However, Lanchuan East Road

633
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
is a road in the industrial park area,

634
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,970
unobstructed and smooth.

635
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,170
There is absolutely no possibility

636
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,320
that he would take

637
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,560
public transportation

638
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,460
due to traffic congestion.

639
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,170
Green travel

640
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,080
can also be a reason for you

641
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,030
to refuse.

642
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,490
Gan Yiming,

643
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,400
can you approve it?

644
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,290
Don't always use your subordinates

645
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,220
as a shield.

646
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,250
You have your wife's

647
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,070
Jiujiang Group as the backing.

648
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,070
If worst comes to worst,
you can go back to her.

649
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,370
But don't disrupt our job.

650
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,170
We have always followed the rules
in everything we do.

651
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,940
It's true that there are some issues
with the material.

652
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,340
Mr. Zhao, please don't bring up
other things.

653
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,120
Mr. Zhao,

654
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,840
can you let me elaborate on this?

655
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,690
Or are you deliberately trying
to confuse the issue

656
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,600
by pretending not to know

657
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,900
about the problems with Li Mingwei

658
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,600
and Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant?

659
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,730
When Li Mingwei was awarded
the title of Charity Role Model

660
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,460
and Entrepreneur of the Year,

661
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,570
Ms. Tang,

662
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,010
you were probably still worrying

663
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,850
about the final exams.

664
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,040
I think

665
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,080
let's stop here for the meeting.

666
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,500
Mr. Zhao, please wait a moment.

667
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,360
Here is a record of Li Mingwei's

668
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,180
supplementary card expenses.

669
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,410
In 2019,

670
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,250
Li Mingwei recharged 4.18 million

671
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,490
on the live streaming platform

672
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,590
and 8.87 million on the gaming platform.

673
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,790
In 2020,

674
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,330
his consumption on live streaming
platforms

675
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,450
reached 3.83 million,

676
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,690
and on gaming platforms
reached 6.72 million.

677
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,360
The related posts by Bro. Li

678
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,690
in Post Bar

679
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,930
have reached 397.

680
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,800
Based on this information,

681
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,440
it can be concluded

682
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,140
that there is a risk of Li Mingwei
embezzling funds

683
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,770
from the plant

684
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,040
and he does not have the basic ability

685
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,310
to repay debts.

686
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,520
What about the total value
of the real estate and vehicles?

687
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,220
This was also my initial concern.

688
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,630
Why did Li Mingwei take the bus?

689
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,210
Because he lost his cars.

690
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,490
However, in a normal car pledge,

691
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,150
the debtor has the right
to use the vehicle.

692
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,840
He had no credit damage

693
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,650
but was deprived of the right
to use his private car.

694
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,210
There is only one scenario.

695
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,450
Li Mingwei has relied

696
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,390
on his legal person status
at Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant

697
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,410
to borrow money from individuals
multiple times,

698
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,260
mortgage his vehicles,

699
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,770
and has already caused

700
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,790
debt disputes.

701
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,760
Based on the above situation,

702
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,410
Mr. Zhao,

703
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,770
do you think there is still a possibility

704
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,350
for Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant
to be approved?

705
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,160
Of course.

706
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,940
If you like direct sales,

707
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,150
please go to the top floor.

708
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,640
You can go now.

709
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,940
Remember to send me the documents later.

710
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,980
OK. I know. Let's go.

711
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,730
Everyone knows

712
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,010
that Zhao Zhengming competed with me

713
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,910
for the position of Director
of the Credit Audit Division.

714
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,740
I won it when he didn't.

715
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,460
He went to the VIP Client Department

716
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,520
and became the second in command.

717
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,420
The VIP Client Department has few work
but high profits,

718
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,590
which can't satisfy his needs.

719
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,730
He would seize the opportunity

720
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,110
to peel me off if he could.

721
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,520
I understand, Mr. Gan.

722
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,250
In the future, when dealing
with their cases,

723
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,490
I will pay special attention.

724
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,180
- OK.
- I'm going to work.

725
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,730
Mr. Gan,

726
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,560
Mr. Tang

727
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,350
stood on your side today.

728
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,980
She has no choice.

729
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,740
Daily Menu?

730
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,730
Yeah, I made an appointment with him.

731
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,700
Isn't it tomorrow?

732
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,550
Jiang Shiyan!

733
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,570
I'll be there in a moment.

734
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,410
What is this? It's so big.

735
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,390
You came just in time.

736
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,490
Let me bring it in for you.

737
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,390
You dismantle it yourself.

738
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,630
So big! What is this?

739
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,450
I have urgent matters to attend to,
so I'm leaving.

740
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,450
Come on. You just leave like this?

741
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,500
You didn't even say what this is.

742
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,450
It's so big…

743
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,420
Handle with care.

744
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,900
You are really annoying!

745
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,870
Drive slowly and safely.

746
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,940
This is amazing.

747
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,900
There is no sign of repair at all.

748
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,360
Mr. Jiang,

749
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,210
(Tang Yang)
In consideration

750
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,690
of your efforts to make up
for your mistakes,

751
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,940
you are pardoned and forgiven.

752
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,540
(Jiang Shiyan)

753
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,900
(Zhou Mo)

754
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,770
Yang,

755
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,080
do you need the invoice
for the toy bear?

756
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,830
If needed, I can send it to your email

757
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,220
as a proof.

758
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,980
I need it.

759
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,180
Thank you, Mo.

760
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,060
(Tang Yang)

761
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
(Good Buddy)

762
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,540
(Model 0307)

763
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,780
(Model 0307)

764
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,550
0307?

765
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,870
0309.

766
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,700
It is indeed 0309.

767
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,940
0307?

768
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,220
Who are you?

769
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,140
(XILI Manicure and Eyelashes)

770
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,930
Yes, over there.

771
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,390
That's it.

772
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,970
Why did you come here to do your nails?

773
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,030
Here you are. Have a seat.

774
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,290
This store originally had a branch

775
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,250
in my neighborhood.

776
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,410
In the end, it was closed.

777
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,250
I have recharged.

778
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,730
I have to use it.

779
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,890
How does it look?

780
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,730
Swipe my card.

781
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,080
Forget tit.

782
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,290
I came over to chat with you

783
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,170
during my lunch break.

784
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,800
I will go back to work in a while.

785
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,830
Chat with me?

786
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,530
Go ahead.

787
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,320
It's not my business.

788
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,410
It's just a friend of mine.

789
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,310
Wait a moment.

790
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,690
What kind of friend?

791
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,790
Who are you closer to?

792
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,660
Our relationship is quite ordinary.

793
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,040
I can only say

794
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,490
we are colleagues
with some intersections.

795
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,330
Then go ahead.

796
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,880
My colleague has encountered

797
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,730
some difficulties recently.

798
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,010
She

799
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,650
had a very close friend,

800
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,360
and one day this friend

801
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,390
accidentally broke something

802
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,690
that was given to her by another friend

803
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,690
who she is not as close with.

804
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,760
That thing is a bit expensive,

805
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,970
hard to buy,

806
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,880
and my colleague really likes it.

807
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,600
Then her friend

808
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,170
pretended to take this thing
to be repaired,

809
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,160
and he ended up exchanging it

810
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,290
for an identical one.

811
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,450
But actually, this identical one

812
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,730
was already bought in advance

813
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,800
and prepared by that friend

814
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,250
to give to my colleague.

815
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,890
So my colleague asked me

816
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,170
what

817
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,120
this close friend meant.

818
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,280
You know I'm completely clueless
about this.

819
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,890
I have no way to give advice to others.

820
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,870
Wait a moment.

821
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,070
What colleague?

822
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,980
I heard Feng Weiran say

823
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,760
that your married director

824
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,980
is not a good person.

825
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,940
It has nothing to do with him.

826
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,530
My colleague

827
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,560
is a girl.

828
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,600
Those two friends of her

829
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,870
are two boys.

830
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,730
That's it.

831
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,070
I see.

832
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,870
Is there a possibility

833
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,450
that

834
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,080
your colleague's friend

835
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,420
has a crush on your colleague?

836
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,640
And they may

837
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,120
have known each other for a long time.

838
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,640
Yes, they have known each other
for a long time.

839
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,290
Right? But

840
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,530
there is no opportunity

841
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,170
to break the status quo

842
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,590
between the two of them.

843
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,040
What does it mean?

844
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,930
There is also a possibility

845
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,010
that they have gone

846
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,360
through a lot together,

847
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,320
so they cherish each other very much.

848
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,600
Because they cherish,
they fear of losing.

849
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,800
Because they fear of losing,

850
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,740
so what?

851
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,280
So what?

852
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,740
Be afraid to move forward.

853
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,590
Move forward?

854
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,360
They indeed have known each other
for many years

855
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,900
and have gone through a lot together.

856
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,310
They also cherish…

857
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,560
My colleague

858
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,760
has told me about these.

859
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,110
- Right?
- You have a keen eye for judging people.

860
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,120
See?

861
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,260
I told you earlier.

862
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,120
If the college entrance examination
replaced math

863
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,950
with emotional analysis,

864
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,240
my emotional analysis would be as good

865
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,560
as your math score.

866
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,460
You are amazing.

867
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,160
I will send you a little test

868
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,740
about whether friendship can change
into love.

869
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,680
You send it to your colleague.

870
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,950
If it doesn't work, you can create a group.

871
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,030
I will talk to her separately.

872
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,830
Create a group?

873
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,250
Didn't you just

874
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,500
paint this color?

875
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,590
You don't understand.

876
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,880
Look.

877
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,590
The beauty that appears effortless

878
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,600
is actually the result

879
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,630
of countless trials.

880
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,830
Apply another layer.

881
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,530
Can you paint one more layer for me?

882
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,900
I have already recharged so much.

883
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,010
Thank you.

884
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,220
Friendship test.

885
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,080
The first one.

886
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,800
Naturally flirt with him

887
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,690
and observe that he is shocked

888
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,630
or gently smiles.

889
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,110
Naturally flirt with him.

890
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,660
Observe his reactions.

891
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,970
Casually,

892
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,070
naturally

893
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,460
flirt with him.

894
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,390
Flirt with him.

895
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,260
Shiyan.

896
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,420
Shiyan.

897
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,870
Disgusting!

898
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,310
Smile.

899
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,940
Shiyan.

900
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,420
Shiyan.

901
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,180
It's disgusting anyway.

902
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,600
Naturally.

903
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,180
Mainly, it should be natural.

904
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,570
No.

905
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,630
Casually,

906
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,220
naturally.

907
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,440
Yang.

908
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,040
Shiyan,

909
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
you are coming so late.

910
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,660
You made me wait for a long time.

911
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,980
Tang Yang, what did I do wrong?

912
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,500
No.

913
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,640
You called and I answered.

914
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,250
You called me out, and here I am.

915
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,120
You…

916
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,520
What did I do wrong? I'll change.

917
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,700
Can you say it out loud?

918
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,910
Don't punish me like this.

919
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,910
(No change)

920
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,640
Let's go.

921
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,610
Go shopping.

922
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,370
You give me goosebumps all over.

923
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,210
Oh my god.

924
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,600
The second one of the test.

925
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,970
Propose to buy couple items

926
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,510
and observe his reaction.

927
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,610
Wait a moment.

928
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,650
- Look at this.
- What's wrong?

929
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,550
- Look at this.
- Fine.

930
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,400
Welcome

931
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,300
Welcome.

932
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,980
These two

933
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,290
are the best-selling couple bracelets

934
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,660
in our store.

935
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,040
Boys wear this one.

936
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,150
Girls wear this one.

937
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,370
What do you think

938
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,600
if we both wear one together?

939
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,070
Wait a moment, bro.

940
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,930
You used to have no interest

941
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,890
in this thing at all.

942
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,480
You would just walk by
without even looking at it.

943
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,520
She's is so beautiful.

944
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,660
You actually call her bro.

945
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,380
Why can't I call her bro.? She's so tall.

946
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,010
She has a stronger sense
of responsibility

947
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,070
than the average boy.

948
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,430
OK. Stop.

949
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,850
(Great. No change)

950
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,820
Take another look.

951
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,030
That outfit looks good, too.

952
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,180
This pendant is so cute!

953
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,990
Is there a candy in the middle of it?

954
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,510
I want to buy one.

955
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,080
We are here to buy clothes.

956
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,450
Let's go and buy clothes.

957
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,290
Fine.

958
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,070
That looks good.

959
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,290
Excuse me.

960
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,700
Is this cat holding a candy?

961
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,890
Yes, this is our limited edition

962
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,810
designed by our designer.

963
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,810
It's called Sugar Cat.

964
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,030
It can be hung on a bag.

965
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,510
Sugar Cat.

966
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,900
(Fitting room)

967
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,890
The third one.

968
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,810
Wear a dress

969
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,120
in a different style than usual

970
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,630
and see his reaction.

971
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,540
(He really has no rivals in Chengdu)

972
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,730
Is it good-looking?

973
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,290
It's not bad, but…

974
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,330
Well…

975
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,290
No.

976
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,780
- Maybe I just feel
- Is this good-looking?

977
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,740
it's not good.

978
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,490
I feel a bit strange.

979
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,330
I'm not used to it.

980
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,740
Maybe I need to get used to it.

981
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,820
Strange? Where?

982
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,720
Not strange.

983
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,990
You look great in this dress.

984
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,210
My fault.

985
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,080
It's very good-looking.

986
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,050
You said it's strange.

987
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,820
How could I wear it?

988
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:19,990
No change.

989
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,250
You finish trying clothes?

990
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,330
No more trying?

991
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,490
No more trying.

992
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,950
Not in the mood to try anymore.

993
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,250
Give me your bag.

994
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,260
What is this?

995
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,640
I think

996
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,780
this suits you well.

997
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,430
It is called Sugar Cat.

998
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,030
Sugar Cat.

999
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,360
Well…

1000
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,560
(Has it changed)

1001
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,030
(or not?)

1002
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,080
What's wrong?

1003
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,770
Is it cute?

1004
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:53,850
Yeah.

1005
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,860
I like it. It goes well with me.

1006
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,260
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1007
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,770
Finally, adapt to changes.

1008
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,050
Make some

1009
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,300
harmless small requests.

1010
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,660
We have wandered around for a long time.
You didn't buy anything.

1011
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,950
What do you want to shop for?

1012
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,630
Wait for me. Let me touch up my makeup.

1013
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,400
