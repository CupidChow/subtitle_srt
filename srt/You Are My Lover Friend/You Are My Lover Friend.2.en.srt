00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,700
We have to bear the consequences.

191
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,520
Nothing more to say.

192
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,720
Bye.

193
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,050
Yang.

194
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,660
What's wrong? How are you?

195
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,720
No.

196
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,360
I have a problem.

197
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,360
Sit down.

198
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,470
What is it?

199
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,660
You can tell me.

200
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,590
I'm so mad.

201
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,060
This place

202
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,770
has a new spicy fish pot

203
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,640
that's amazing.

204
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,520
But weren't you always a fan

205
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,630
of the pork rib chicken pot?

206
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,420
If I choose one,

207
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,510
I can't decide.

208
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,180
But I can't finish both.

209
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,470
It's so frustrating.

210
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,750
Is this what you call a big problem?

211
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,490
Yes. Food is crucial.

212
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,400
Isn't this a huge deal?

213
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,420
Here, take a look.

214
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,750
Alright, I'll help you solve it.

215
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,060
Today, we'll have the pork rib chicken,

216
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,560
and next time

217
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,020
we'll come for the spicy fish.

218
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,050
Okay.

219
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,820
I saw the news about you and Yue Ya.

220
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,660
I had anticipated this

221
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,060
but didn't expect it
to happen so quickly.

222
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,780
Will it have serious consequences?

223
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,750
Yes, but they're not critical.

224
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,570
Are you sure?

225
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,480
Absolutely.

226
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,570
That's good.

227
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,940
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

228
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,150
Your pork rib chicken.

229
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,210
Thank you.

230
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,820
What about you? Why are you upset?

231
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,820
No Sichuan Resto.

232
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,490
Missed you for afternoon tea.

233
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,540
You didn't get the office.

234
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,020
Is the director scaring you?

235
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,560
He wants me to know

236
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,300
who's in charge of the division.

237
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,650
But they'll clear

238
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,900
the office for me.

239
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,230
Maybe right now,

240
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,660
it's ready for me.

241
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,420
Call me if you need me.

242
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,240
Are you charging me?

243
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,080
Without money, our friendship

244
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,150
is a pile of loose sand.

245
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,120
Alright.

246
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,470
Then let's skip the process

247
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,900
and cut ties right now.

248
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,930
Don't.

249
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,850
With some water and ingredients,

250
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,770
it can become concrete.

251
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,020
If you smear it on the wall,

252
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,300
it can hold for a day or two.

253
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,400
A day or two?

254
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,660
Not three or four days?

255
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,300
Of course, it'll last.

256
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,290
Come on.

257
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,220
(Xiaobei Soup)

258
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,270
- What to do?
- I'll walk

259
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,870
with you to your community.

260
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,170
Feng Weiran will come

261
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,390
to pick me up there.

262
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,230
He's near Leisure House.

263
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,630
By the way,

264
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,490
during the day, he's your partner

265
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,660
and executive president,

266
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,560
but at night,

267
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,490
he transforms into the owner
of the new trendy

268
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,660
Leisure House.

269
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,590
He transitions seamlessly.

270
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,680
You didn't see it.

271
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,900
This executive president

272
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,490
came to the company
wearing a Thanos glove this morning.

273
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,410
- Really?
- Yes.

274
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,520
Everyone was laughing.

275
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,560
Many female colleagues went

276
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,400
to take pictures.

277
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,820
Any photos? Send them to me.

278
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,360
None.

279
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,210
There must be some.

280
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,210
Stop joking. Show me.

281
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,050
Let me take a look.

282
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,990
You're so close with Jiang Yanan,

283
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,870
and Feng Weiran is afraid of her.

284
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,700
If Jiang Yanan gets mad,

285
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,650
won't she make him sleep on the floor?

286
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,590
You're wrong.

287
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,040
If she does that,

288
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,130
she'll need to prepare

289
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,470
a quilt and pillow for him.

290
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,890
Yanan will definitely

291
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,520
kick him to the son's room,

292
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,920
and then Mr. Feng will end up

293
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,890
accompanying his son

294
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,020
to the bathroom at 2 AM.

295
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,700
I still remember

296
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,230
when the little one was just born.

297
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,210
When I saw him in the hospital,

298
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,150
he was so small.

299
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,590
In a flash, he grew up.

300
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,970
He's 6 years old now.

301
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,350
Time really flies.

302
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,760
Yeah.

303
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,820
We've known each other...

304
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,820
For thirteen years.

305
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,760
Mr. Jiang, your chauffeur

306
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,160
arrived quite on time.

307
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
Can you two hurry up?

308
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,590
Feng, put the umbrella in the trunk.

309
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,350
Yes, boss.

310
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,590
Wearing a suit, very stylish.

311
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,610
That's a must.

312
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,660
Then I'm heading up.

313
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,180
Plans for the weekend?

314
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,290
Blind date.

315
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,450
Why are you laughing?

316
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,820
I'm telling you.

317
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,920
Your mom not urging

318
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,940
is your luck.

319
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,450
If I don't meet any weirdos,

320
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,660
it'll be my blessing.

321
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,520
My mom also urges me.

322
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,400
My mom always tells me

323
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,800
that even dogs are paired up

324
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,300
and seeing me all day tires her out.

325
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,770
I said I was tired

326
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,650
and wanted to move.

327
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,800
She said I don't love her anymore

328
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
and insisted

329
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,060
on cutting ties with me.

330
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,210
What should I do?

331
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,850
I think you two should just

332
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,870
get together for that.

333
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,530
My wife has recently been reading

334
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,010
those novels about contract marriage

335
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,210
for their moms.

336
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,780
They break up once the contract ends.

337
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,150
- Don't joke.
- Don't joke.

338
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,400
No.

339
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
I'm not looking down

340
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,450
on Mr. Jiang.

341
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,470
I mean

342
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
I'm just a regular worker

343
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
and an old single woman

344
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,560
with no grand aspirations, right?

345
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,420
Someone like our Mr. Jiang

346
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,450
is a diamond-level catch.

347
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,440
I think he should be left

348
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,870
for someone with better teeth.

349
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,000
Who has good teeth?

350
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,880
Our Tang.

351
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,700
At one point, she had short hair.

352
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,090
When we walked together,

353
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,370
other girls used to think

354
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,850
we went to the men's loo together.

355
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,990
What do you mean?

356
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,610
In such a public place,

357
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,820
you're disrespecting women.

358
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,040
Don't mislead people.

359
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,210
I'm not disrespecting women.

360
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,410
What I just referred to

361
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,780
was our Yang.

362
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,800
Doesn't Yang deserve respect?

363
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,490
- Yang.
- Why shouldn't I

364
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,350
be respected?

365
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,970
Alright, enough, stop messing around.

366
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,820
Look at the time.

367
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,590
- Hurry up and go rest.
- You're too old for this.

368
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,160
Who's messing around?

369
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,540
Driver, hurry up and start driving.

370
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,660
Give me a good rating.

371
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,660
I'm heading up.

372
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,880
Yang.

373
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,870
Good luck with your date.

374
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,920
Do you believe I'll beat you up?

375
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,410
- Alright.
- You know what?

376
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,320
I'm closing the window.

377
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,180
Be careful. Careful.

378
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,230
You two, I'm telling you.

379
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,640
Goodbye.

380
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,540
Unbelievable, really.

381
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,450
If you ask me,

382
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,300
you should

383
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,630
just date Yang.

384
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,110
No way.

385
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,170
We're too familiar.

386
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,160
That's exactly why.

387
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,420
You know each other very well.

388
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,660
Really, no way. We're way too close.

389
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,010
Wasn't Yang's first love

390
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,250
someone she knew well?

391
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,160
You used to hang out.

392
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
That boy named Song something.

393
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,040
Song Jing.

394
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,180
Right, Song Jing.

395
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,300
That's not the same.

396
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,150
Their friendship was superficial.

397
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,820
Our friendship is the kind

398
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,490
where if one of us dies,

399
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,600
the other has to stand
in the front row,

400
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,610
bow, then organize the meal afterward,

401
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,010
and urge people not to waste food

402
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,060
and pack it up.

403
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,480
How can I make a move

404
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,420
at my bro?

405
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,610
I was just joking,

406
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,920
casually saying it.

407
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,020
Why did you say that?

408
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,330
Why get so worked up?

409
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,250
I swear.

410
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,970
If I have ulterior motives towards her,

411
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,630
let us both get hit by a car.

412
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,780
I'm driving here. What are you saying?

413
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,250
What are you doing?

414
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,150
Can you even drive?

415
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,050
Wow.

416
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,350
Is this some kind of curse?

417
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,540
Now, you saw the consequence.

418
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,260
Jiang Shiyan.

419
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,690
You're back.

420
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,530
Yeah, I'm back.

421
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,150
Where are the flowers from?

422
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,740
From the trash.

423
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,940
Be careful not to cut off the buds.

424
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,040
The kid upstairs

425
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,970
keeps

426
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,810
stomping around,

427
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,940
running back and forth

428
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,030
nonstop.

429
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,900
Old buildings have poor soundproofing.

430
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,790
I told you to move, but you refused.

431
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,660
It's easy for you to say.

432
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,460
Sure, I can move,

433
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,030
but how do I move

434
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,390
my flowers

435
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,180
and my beloved trees?

436
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,110
You went to dinner with Tang again?

437
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,730
Didn't I tell you?

438
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,760
If she wants to eat,

439
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,890
bring her home.

440
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,790
I'll cook.

441
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,050
Eating out and eating at home

442
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,830
are completely different.

443
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,660
How did you know it was Tang?

444
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,560
All you do besides work

445
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,800
is hanging out with Feng Weiran

446
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,840
and those people.

447
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,420
Now that Tang is finally back,

448
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,560
of course, you'll follow

449
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,790
your big brother around.

450
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,980
Honestly,

451
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
if you can bring

452
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,460
a girlfriend home for me,

453
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,790
I could lose my teeth out of joy.

454
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,740
"I could lose my teeth out of joy."

455
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,220
I've been saying I'd come

456
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,700
but never found the time.

457
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,900
The Client Department told me

458
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,500
your pre-loan work coordination

459
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,030
has been seamless.

460
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,010
Within the restrictions

461
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,660
of survey-loan separation,

462
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,170
I hope everyone can

463
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,120
gather first-hand info

464
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,340
as much as possible.

465
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,140
(Zhou Zixing, Branch President)
First,

466
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,070
it reduces communication costs

467
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,460
and improves the efficiency.

468
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,730
Second,

469
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,900
it helps us understand
small and micro-business needs

470
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,590
and implement inclusive policies.

471
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,070
I'll pass that on.

472
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
(Tang Yang, Deputy Director)
I trust you.

473
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,280
In the first two quarters,

474
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,730
loan volumes showed

475
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,700
significant growth,

476
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,170
thanks to your wise leadership

477
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,700
and everyone's teamwork.

478
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,870
It's what we should do.

479
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,460
Tang Yang, how are you here?

480
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,310
I'm still getting familiar with things.

481
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,450
The bank values the development

482
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,870
of educated management trainees.

483
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,520
If you have any ideas,

484
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,660
you can always talk to Director Gan.

485
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,110
If he's not around,

486
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,420
feel free to come to me.

487
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,040
Huishang is your fertile ground,

488
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,700
a stage for you
to showcase your talents.

489
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,980
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

490
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,070
True gold is tested by fire.

491
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,630
When Tang Yang was coming,

492
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,320
other two divisions

493
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,180
were eager to get her.

494
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,440
I said no.

495
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,790
She goes to Credit Audit.

496
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,390
Only Director Gan

497
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,740
can see the essence without the halo.

498
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,220
But Tang Yang has just started
with the credit audit.

499
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,500
If she makes a mistake,

500
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,030
you should criticize her.

501
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,390
Yes, yes, yes.

502
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,600
President Zhou,

503
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,930
I suggest we take a group photo.

504
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,770
Sure.

Come on, ladies first.

506
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,330
No, no, no.

507
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,760
It's a matter of principle.

508
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,600

511
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,700
Okay, then we'll stop here.

512
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,590
Welcome to guide us more in our work.

513
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,600
Please.

514
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,830
- Take care.
- Alright.

515
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,570
Take care.

516
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,890
How's the office?

517
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,460
I don't know if you like it.

518
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,010
I like it very much.

519
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,600
You can focus on the big picture

520
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,740
and handle the details.

521

Our division being recognized
by President Zhou

522

is definitely thanks
to your wise leadership.

you're the expert.

Isn't there an archive room?

527
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,030
I thought there wasn't one.

528
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,790
- This?
- Director Gan, I'm back to my work.

568
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,030
and Yi Xiu for giving me
this opportunity.

569
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,410
Over the years,

570
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,690
I've been trying to explore

571
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,390
more possibilities in life.

572
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,110
Becoming an actress midway is,

573
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,800
and so is becoming

574
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,260
a Food Selector of Yi Xiu.

575
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,690
So in the future,

576
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,760
I will use my passion and sincerity

577
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,150
in character creation

578
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,390
to repay everyone.

579
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,890
Let's select great food together

580
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,110
to create a bright future.

581
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,580
(Signing Document)

582
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,460
Hope we'll work well.

583
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,640
Hope we'll work well.

584
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,200
Are you okay?

585
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,790
I'm fine. Thank you.

586
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,010
Look at Mr. Jiang's cufflink.

587
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,880
It's just like

588
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,730
Nina's necklace.

589
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,980
You're right. They really are.

590
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,170
Is this official

591
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,830
or quietly showing off?

592
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,980
A gentle CEO

593
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,700
and a popular star make a perfect match.

594
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,120
(Girl on a Tree)
So thrilling.

595
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,440
(It's been 5 years since Nina's debut.)
Am I the only one on Mr. Jiang's looks?

596
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,590
(Yi Xiu started 5 years ago.)
So cute and dandy.

597
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,520
(What a coincidence?)

598
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,830
(Cat of Kilimanjaro)
Please...

599
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,010
Please...

600
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,050
Give me. Come on.

601
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,890
How immature.

602
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,030
Please become an artist.

603
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,180
(AKA Lies)
Mr. Jiang's cufflink

604
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,930
and Sheng Nina's necklace

605
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,350
are definitely a match.

606
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,970
(Jing)
He's helping her.

607
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,220
His eyes shine with countless stars.

608
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,690
This is so sweet!

609
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,030
No need to say more, okay?

610
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,120
I can admit

611
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,070
to be "cute and dandy".

612
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,660
But I'm not dating her.

613
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,280
There were a lot of people there.

614
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,080
How could I have no cufflink
at that time?

615
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,310
But I couldn't find it.

616
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,450
As for Feng Weiran,

617
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,980
he was wearing a button-down shirt.

618
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,080
Sheng Nina's earring

619
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,220
was just perfect.

620
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,440
Later,

621
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,550
when she was walking,

622
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,450
she almost fell because of a tablecloth.

623
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,290
So I had to help her.

624
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,260
And it turned into this.

625
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,940
It's fine if you're dating her.

626
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,360
Single at the right age.

627
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,320
You both look good.

628
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,260
You're a good match.

629
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,870
Anyway, Aunt Yi is expecting this.

630
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,740
As Ms. Zhou says,

631
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,740
blind dates

632
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,560
aren't about forcing you

633
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,900
to get married and have children

634
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,420
but about encouraging you to date,

635
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,660
stimulating your dopamine production,

636
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,730
and letting you discover
the world's beauty.

637
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,940
Then the two of you

638
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,360
can warm each other

639
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,350
and progress together.

640
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,550
Ms. Zhou's words are really nice.

641
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,460
But are you sure

642
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,180
you want me to date?

643
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,260
Oh, right.

644
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,880
We were supposed to share

645
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,550
the pressure from Ms. Zhou and Ms. Yi.

646
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,150
If you quickly find someone,

647
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,550
then all the pressure will be on me.

648
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,420
I can't accept that.

649
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,690
I almost thought you couldn't keep up.

650
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,420
You don't know. Before I came back,

651
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,260
I received three calls a day.

652
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,500
After I returned,

653
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,180
I have ten notifications a week.

654
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,840
I told my mom I was tired.

655
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,680
And she said,

656
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,010
"It's okay. I love you."

657
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,010
"I support all your decisions."

658
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,930
"But you know."

659
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,830
"Walking alone is tough."

660
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,560
"The character for person
has two strokes."

661
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,740
"It means mutual support."

662
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,660
She's left me speechless.

663
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,660
Ms. Zhou doesn't need to worry.

664
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,350
No matter when,

665
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,810
I'll always be here.

666
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,170
What good is having you?

667
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,070
To watch a play?

668
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,180
Who said that? I can

669
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,250
cheer you up.

670
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,260
What a great buddy I am.

671
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,790
You're really a fantastic buddy.

672
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,050
You're great.

673
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,660
But I can't be that selfish.

674
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,250
I can't let my issues

675
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,590
delay your bright future.

676
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,650
If one day you find someone,

677
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,490
no matter how fast ,

678
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,420
just let me know.

679
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,420
Not sure.

680
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,890
If I'm in a good mood, I'll try.

681
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,150
If I'm not...

682
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,640
Why not say some nice things?

683
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,480
Let me hear them.

684
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,560
Does this sound good?

685
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,400
How about this one?

686
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,490
I was wrong.

687
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,410
- Sorry.
- Is it good?

688
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,640
- It's good, right?
- So good.

689
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,480
Stop, stop, stop!

690
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,360
Yang, it hurts!

691
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,600
You're pulling me!

692
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,320
Oh, my goodness.

693
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,260
Your performance is so intense!

694
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,730
I didn't even pull that hard.

695
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,570
Is that so?

696
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,310
Of course. I learned it from you.

697
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,690
Am I your acting teacher?

698
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,320
Do you respect your acting teacher?

699
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,160
Did you pay me?

700
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,550
I didn't pay. I'd give you this.

701
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:45,810
Try it.

702
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,030
I'll try it.

703
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,440
It's not bad, right?

704
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,700
This hot pot flavor is just right.

705
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,050
Try this beef.

706
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,280
This is the current best-seller

707
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,120
in our mall.

708
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,350
It's selling well.

709
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,690
This flavor reminds me

710
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,070
of the old town's Alley Hotpot.

711
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,070
What a pity.

712
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,830
I heard it's gone.

713
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,160
Who said it's gone?

714
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,310
It moved to the alley across the street.

715
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,630
It's still there?

716
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,290
Yes, if you want to eat it,

717
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,920
just tell me when we're in the old town.

718
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,390
Let's go then.

719
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,110
You have no idea.

720
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,760
Every time the autumn wind rises,

721
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,210
my longing for alley hot pot

722
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,590
reaches its peak.

723
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,600
When I was alone

724
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,630
in Lancheng,

725
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,030
I thought about it

726
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,320
and dreamed about it.

727
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,260
You could say it's
a lingering obsession.

728
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,660
A girl always

729
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,590
keeps talking about eating.

730
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,260
A girl?

731
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,450
What a clever name.

732
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,290
There are two words!

733
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,260
Don't just eat.

734
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,560
After you finish,

735
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,840
fill out this tasting card.

736
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,790
I can do that right now.

737
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,710
(Flavor, saltiness, 40)
You should try this mushroom.

738
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,870
Do you know what it's called?

739
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,120
What is it called?

740
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,590
It's called "Blue Mushroom".

741
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,840
(Yi Xiu Gourmet)

742
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,940
I'm gonna give a bad review.

743
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,180
What a cold joke.

744
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,110
I saw a popular blogger say

745
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,420
my astrological chart
is compatible with Jiang's.

746
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,770
Every time you have a rumor,

747
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,350
he says you'll get married soon.

748
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,810
What did you say?

749
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,930
It's been so many years.

750
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,880
You wouldn't start

751
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,870
believing it now, right?

752
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,050
No way.

753
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,590
I just happened to scroll past it.

754
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,450
This time, your earring incident

755
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,310
has gained attention,

756
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,870
but it might not be good.

757
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,940
You haven't been acting
for eight months.

758
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,830
Fans are really emotional,

759
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,120
saying you're not focusing on your work,

760
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,180
only wanting to date.

761
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,460
That's not true.

762
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,880
I'm currently looking

763
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,720
at a few programs.

764
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,490
Did you read the script

765
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,330
I gave you that day?

766
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:55,850
I did.

767
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:56,810
How is it?

768
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,310
Not great.

769
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,530
Mainly, its storyline

770
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,370
is very unrealistic.

771
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,830
I can't believe it myself.

772
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,940
How am I supposed
to convince the audience?

773
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,170
Besides, this character isn't likable.

774
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,080
They won't like it.

775
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,350
The prerequisite for that
is having an audience.

776
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,740
I got it.

777
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,120
Then

778
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,980
think it over yourself.

779
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,920
I'm leaving.

780
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,920
Okay.

781
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,900
Stay safe on the road.

782
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,740
The prerequisite for that
is having an audience.

783
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:28,140
(Rover)

784
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,860
(Good morning, Rover;
Good morning, hardworking people)

785
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,060
(Moonlight Blade; Game)

786
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,120
For this game's

787
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,840
anniversary event,

788
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,650
they invited Sheng Nina.

789
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,520
She's so beautiful.

790
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,010
Her resources have been great lately.

791
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,840
After becoming our Selector,

792
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,070
she's been trending.

793
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,970
Mr. Cheng, have you seen

794
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,390
her raw photos in her super topic?

795
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,590
Absolutely stunning.

796
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,630
Finished all the tasks from last week?

797
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,320
When I came here
for materials last time,

798
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,600
I heard that you were coming.

799
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,660
Seeing is believing.

800
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,940
Capable and pretty.

801
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,830
Thank you, Manager Xu.

802
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,010
Thank you, Ms. Tang.

803
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,940
I'm not sure why you called me today.

804
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,110
Here's the thing.

805
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,930
Since I'm new here,

806
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,040
I don't know many things.

807
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,220
I'll be straightforward.

808
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,450
There are issues with the contract loan

809
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,150
and the site visit for Moonlight Media.

810
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,220
(Xu Hang, Manager of the Credit Division
at Rongcheng Branch, Huishang Bank)

811
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,250
Ms. Tang, you're new.

812
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,420
You might not know about it.

813
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,320
Nanjin is an old district.

814
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,420
The situation is complex.

815
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,870
Moonlight Media was

816
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,650
brought in by Nanjin

817
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,830
through cultural approval.

818
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,350
Whether it's for investment or approval,

819
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,650
the collateral for Moonlight Media

820
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,040
is listed under Oriental Waterside.

821
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,600
I checked.

822
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,010
The average price online there

823
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,030
is just over 9,000.

824
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,070
But this document states 20,000.

825
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,210
And the Site Visit Department surveyed

826
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,210
its main business.

827
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,150
Out of nine pictures,

828
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,980
five are from the internet.

829
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,250
And the transaction records

830
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,360
for the corporate account

831
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,200
have issues too.

832
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,890
I've annotated everything.

833
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,730
Please take a look.

834
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,970
Ms. Tang, you probably haven't

835
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,150
conducted a site visit, right?

836
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,390
The same block can have

837
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,520
two different prices depending

838
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,500
on its facilities.

839
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,120
Within the same community,

840
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,360
small units with households

841
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,450
and large duplexes can have

842
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,150
vastly different prices.

843
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,550
Have you been to Oriental Waterside?

844
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,240
This was handled by the credit officer.

845
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,380
They forgot to note it down.

846
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,150
I checked.

847
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,770
Oriental Waterside isn't

848
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,030
a school district property.

849
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,370
There's no nearby subway,

850
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,470
nor food delivery.

851
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,450
The map and review frequency

852
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,600
don't exceed 20 times a year.

853
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,180
The occupancy rate is less than 5%.

854
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,600
I don't think it fits

855
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,450
what you described

856
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,030
as vastly different situations.

857
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,240
Without proper assessment,

858
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,490
this two million business loan

859
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,910
is questionable.

860
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,990
Ms. Tang, you don't know.

861
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,180
In the first six months,

862
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,340
your division joined our operations.

863
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,470
The branch stopped the field allowance.

864
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:58,970
So, the outlet managers

865
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,810
and credit officers

866
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,070
might not be very meticulous.

867
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,780
When it came to me after all that...

868
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,290
Well.

869
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,560
This is embarrassing for me.

870
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,400
How about this?

871
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,150
I'll take it back

872
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,820
and rectify everything.

873
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Manager Xu, I don't know

874
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,430
who you were coordinating with before,

875
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,930
but now that Director Gan

876
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,850
has handed these documents to me,

877
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,930
I hope we can enhance our understanding

878
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:25,990
and work together.

879
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,240
If we're strict now,

880
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,110
we can reduce issues later.

881
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,340
Now every case is tracked for life.

882
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,490
Every step we make

883
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,770
is traceable.

884
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,680
This is taking responsibility
for ourselves.

885
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,630
- Right?
- Yes, yes.

886
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,080
I just saw Xu Hang leave.

887
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,300
His face was pale.

888
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,660
This Deputy Director Tang

889
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,040
is quite impressive.

890
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:51,990
Of course.

891
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,770
She used the style showcase

892
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,970
to force us to work overtime,

893
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,660
clearing out the office for her.

894
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,380
She's not someone to underestimate.

895
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,820
You're talking about Tang, right?

896
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,010
She's a management trainee.

897
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,080
After a year and a half,

898
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,740
she'll be up with her polished resume.

899
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,660
She can be a director in a year?

900
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,520
She'd achieve some results,

901
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,430
and move to be the director
of another division.

902
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,180
She could also be the director here.

903
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,600
Pay attention to Mr. Gan.

904
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,150
His attitude towards Tang
is very subtle.

905
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,650
Hello, Shiyan.

906
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,690
Yang.

907
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,260
What time do you get off work?

908
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,930
My mom's pomegranates are ripe.

909
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,860
I have some for you.

910
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,700
I should finish at six,

911
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,330
but I need a site visit

912
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,030
in the old town this afternoon.

913
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,450
How about

914
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,600
we meet up

915
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,560
at Alley Hotpot tonight?

916
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,400
No problem.

917
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:40,990
I'm free anytime.

918
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,340
Who was it that said about me

919
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,720
that I never miss out on having fun,

920
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,910
living freely without constraints?

921
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,160
I've even read Moments

922
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,110
three days ago.

923
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,910
Hang up, hang up. Stop talking.

924
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,950
I'm just joking.

925
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,770
I've been busy all morning

926
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,810
and haven't eaten anything.

927
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,770
I have another meeting.

928
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,070
Just waiting for this dinner.

929
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,400
Okay.

930
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,910
I'll call you after I finish.

931
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,810
By the way, if you get off work early

932
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,820
and want to stroll around,

933
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,950
we have a very handsome

934
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,970
front guy at Yi Xiu.

935
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,430
How about I have him accompany you?

936
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,910
The front guy at Yi Xiu?

937
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,150
Who? It wouldn't be you, would it?

938
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,300
Am I that shameless?

939
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,680
Absolutely.

940
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,510
Young and talented, strikingly handsome.

941
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,780
Is that true?

942
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,970
Is he really that handsome?

943
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,070
When have I lied to you?

944
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,110
Jiang Shiyan, really.

945
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,680
After knowing you for so long,

946
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,380
you finally did something reliable.

947
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,560
Alright.

948
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,630
See you later.

949
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,690
See you tonight.

950
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,730
Hey, Peng Si.

951
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,450
The guy from Media Uni.

952
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,590
What's the cute guy's name?

953
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,070
Here's a task for him.

954
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,140
(Wang Xingyue)
Talk to you later.

955
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,250
Xingyue.

956
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,590
Mr. Jiang, I'm really sorry.

957
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,770
We have a sudden

958
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,780
schedule change,

959
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,050
so can we reschedule

960
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,950
the afternoon meeting?

961
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,990
That's great.

962
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,470
No, I mean, sure, no problem.

963
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,490
Alright, let's do it that way.

964
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,910
Alright, we'll set it up later.

965
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,820
Young and talented.

966
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,030
It's a coincidence.

967
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,290
So how do you explain

968
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,990
"strikingly handsome"?

969
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,560
Don't you think that describes me

970
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,550
perfectly?

971
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,300
Perhaps it's a rhetorical technique.

972
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,880
Plain description?

973
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,080
Irony.

974
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,630
Wear less light-colored clothing.

975
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:46,770
Why?

976
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,070
Light colors show off my elegance.

977
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,340
Light colors easily get stained.

978
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,470
You did it?

979
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,950
I just smeared it.

980
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,740
I didn't even notice.

981
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,300
It really does get dirty easily.

982
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,560
Did your director

983
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,810
say anything after giving you

984
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,660
your office?

985
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,340
He didn't say anything.

986
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,050
Why do I feel like

987
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,470
his name is so familiar?

988
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,370
Isn't his wife the chairman

989
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,260
of Jiujiang Property?

990
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,360
Wei Changqiu?

991
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,690
That's right.

992
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,860
How are your colleagues?

993
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,780
Pretty good.

994
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,200
But our director especially likes

995
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,810
to pat people's hands when he talks.

996
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:28,650
Is that for real?

997
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,700
Absolutely, I've seen it several times.

998
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,700
You need to be careful.

999
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,680
Yang, though you're excellent,

1000
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,530
you just started

1001
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,430
your career.

1002
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,530
The higher up you go,

1003
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,990
the more likely you'll run

1004
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,860
into those savvy office veterans.

1005
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,700
Our atmosphere is good enough,

1006
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,600
but still, between colleagues,

1007
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,910
there are always intrigues.

1008
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,380
Not to mention Huishang.

1009
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,070
But you're smart.

1010
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,470
You know what I mean.

1011
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,610
I know.

1012
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,510
By the way,

1013
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,970
is this the bookstore

1014
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,740
we used to frequent?

1015
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
(Rongcheng First Bookstore)
Yes.

1016
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,890
How come I remember

1017
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,520
there were several cultural streets?

1018
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,380
Where did they go?

1019
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,720
It's been urbanizing in recent years.

1020
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,560
They tore it down.

1021
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,690
Tore it down?

1022
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:14,950
Want a look inside?

1023
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,700
- Sure.
- Let's go.

1024
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,110
It really is different from before.

1025
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,150
I remember there used to be
so many people.

1026
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,560
When the popular authors

1027
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,820
released their books,

1028
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,220
if it opened at eight o'clock,

1029
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,470
the entrance would be packed by 7:30.

1030
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,380
People have abandoned physical books.

1031
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,420
(Reading Activity Area)

1032
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,330
Yang,

1033
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,180
do you remember this corner?

1034
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,770
You used to love nestling here reading,

1035
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,860
spending all day
without even stopping for meals.

1036
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,120
There was one time

1037
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,600
we even argued

1038
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,510
about whether to eat.

1039
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,290
I remember.

1040
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,290
Then you just left me

1041
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,180
and walked away.

1042
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,720
How could I leave you?

1043
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,910
You did.

1044
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,260
You must be wrong.

1045
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,430
I'm definitely not wrong.

1046
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,000
Shiyan.

1047
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,520
Shiyan.

1048
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,680
Just say a word to her

1049
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,740
and apologize.

1050
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,550
Yang.

1051
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,330
You're good buddies.

1052
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,660
There's no overnight grudge.

1053
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,330
Besides,

1054
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,510
eating is very important.

1055
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,380
(A Deadly Secret)

1056
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,340
I'm really in a difficult position
with you two.

1057
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,400
You...

1058
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,070
What are you going to do, Shiyan?

1059
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,430
I'll pull him back.

1060
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,850
Shiyan.

1061
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,110
Shiyan, where are you going?

1062
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,340
Little Tang Yang.

1063
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,590
Little Tang Yang.

1064
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,200
Your brother Jiang Baba is

1065
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,300
waiting for you here.

1066
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
He can't find you

1067
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,810
and is very worried,

1068
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,110
so please come quickly.

1069
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,780
Little Tang Yang.

1070
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,110
Little Tang Yang.

1071
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,680
Your brother Jiang Baba is

1072
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,950
waiting for you here.

1073
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,120
He can't find you

1074
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,070
and is very worried,

1075
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,660
so please come quickly.

1076
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,590
Miss, can you broadcast it again?

1077
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,260
I'm afraid this little one

1078
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,200
can't hear well.

1079
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,720
I've broadcast it twice for you.

1080
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,630
Besides, she won't get lost
in the bookstore.

1081
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,740
Why is your name so strange?

1082
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,950
Does it stand for "bossy"?

1083
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,400
Yes.

1084
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,640
It's a boy's name.

1085
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,590
How powerful is that?

1086
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,080
Miss, I really am

1087
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,660
her brother.

1088
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,380
Brother, Yang...

1089
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,360
Bro...

1090
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,070
What's your name?

1091
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,930
You don't have to know that.

1092
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:29,770
I...

1093
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,550
Just tell me those two characters.

1094
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,210
