(Yi Xiu Gourmet)

28
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,270
Hello, I'm looking for Mr. Jiang.

29
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,710
Mr. Jiang is having a meeting there.

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,650
Having a meeting?

31
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,490
Yes.

32
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,410
This year, we're planning

33
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,520
to extend the concept and scope

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,810
of The Good Food

35
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,940
on last year's basis.

36
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,160
In this way,

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,800
we can greatly motivate

38
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,930
our community users.

39
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,290
We also plan to work with

40
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,130
some trendy restaurants

41
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,410
and issue special coupons

42
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,790
to keep our users active.

43
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,330
Yang?

44
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,440
Here, I've brought milk tea for you.

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,890
- It's too much.
- All kinds of flavors.

46
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,180
Share it with others. Be Careful.

47
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,990
Thanks, Ms. Tang.

48
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,860
Now you're calling me Ms. Tang.

49
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,050
If I brought you

50
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,920
high-quality steaks,

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,990
what would you say?

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,620
Blessed be, my lord.

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,280
Are you busy?

54
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,210
Not at all.

55
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,430
Are you free today?

56
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,690
The weather is quite nice,

57
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,230
so I came by
and bought some milk tea for you.

58
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,720
It's almost over.

59
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,880
Do you want to listen?

60
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,480
We're talking about

61
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,570
the annual food rankings

62
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,020
to see if there's something exciting.

63
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,480
When it's over, we can have a barbecue

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,490
on the patio with Feng Weiran.

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,480
Isn't it inappropriate for me to listen?

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,390
Of course not. We're brainstorming.

67
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,800
If you can come up with

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,670
a good idea,

69
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,850
I'll give you a big prize.

70
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,850
- Big prize.
- Come on.

71
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,690
Let's go.

72
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,860
Get up and make room.

73
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,760
Go to the middle. Yang, sit here.

74
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,390
Yang, have a seat.

75
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,640
- Do you like the milk tea?
- Thanks.

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,270
Princess, thanks for your milk tea.

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,320
So disgusting.

78
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,370
Thanks.

79
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,270
Go ahead.

80
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,810
We held

81
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,160
a cafeteria competition last year,

82
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,010
and it went well.

83
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,410
Several college cafeterias

84
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,020
presented popular dishes.

85
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,480
We can borrow that idea

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,410
whiling promoting it

87
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,370
to government departments,

88
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,040
state-owned enterprises
and internet companies.

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,890
More people

90
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,950
can join us this time.

91
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,530
Ms. Jiang has made a proposal

92
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,050
of improving community features

93
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,670
of Yi Xiu Gourmet.

94
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,670
Everyone, share your opinions.

95
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,900
How about Street Food Sharing?

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,330
How about

97
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,270
Home Cooking Championship?

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,250
But nowadays, most young people

99
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,830
don't have time for cooking.

100
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,020
I have an idea.

101
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,010
Do you remember

102
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,410
when we were
at Zhilan's Pot-stewed Dish,

103
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,180
Zhilan added some secret sauce

104
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,690
to the leftovers

105
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,640
and

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,050
made a plate

107
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,290
of delicious fried rice?

108
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,850
When the short video

109
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,090
came to this part,

110
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,410
I saw many comments saying

111
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,720
the method was easy,

112
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,430
but the food looked so good.

113
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,690
I also saw many people

114
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,730
using this method

115
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,090
to deal with leftover food

116
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,440
on Yi Xiu Gourmet.

117
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,760
More importantly,

118
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,090
many young people

119
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,960
will pack the leftovers

120
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,180
after eating in a restaurant,

121
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,360
but the food will turn cold

122
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,580
and lose the flavor.

123
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,850
If we can process

124
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,850
the food like this,

125
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,690
we can make them

126
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,900
a brand new dish.

127
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,100
I get it.

128
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
Actually, many labors

129
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,020
complain about the quality

130
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,870
of take-out food.

131
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,010
However, it's hard for them

132
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,930
to learn cooking

133
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,100
in a short time.

134
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,290
Therefore, I'm thinking

135
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,270
we can launch

136
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,980
a leftover food contest for them.

137
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,370
For example, everyone can

138
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,730
make a delicious meal

139
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,690
by heating leftovers for a few minutes.

140
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,070
On the one hand,

141
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,090
we can encourage people

142
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,970
to pack leftovers

143
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,930
when eating in a restaurant.

144
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,050
On the other hand,

145
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,050
they will also enjoy

146
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,510
the fun of cooking,

147
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,660
and it's easy to learn.

148
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,420
If that's the case,

149
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,080
processing food

150
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,280
usually requires

151
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,010
prepared seasonings, sauces,

152
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:04,960
and even food.

153
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,970
We can ask them

154
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,930
to attach our product links

155
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,510
to their posts,

156
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,970
so that they can not only

157
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,440
acquire knowledge and share their lives

158
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,340
in the competition

159
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,850
but also bring profits

160
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,280
to our online market.

161
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,780
I think it's a complete business chain.

162
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,950
However, as for the name...

163
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,870
Name...

164
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,610
Leftovers Challenge.

165
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,450
Leftovers.

166
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,900
It's a good idea.

167
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,370
- Not bad, right?
- Leftovers.

168
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,730
- Very good.
- Creative.

169
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,970
- Really?
- Great. Leftovers Challenge.

170
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,980
Thank you so much.

171
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,080
Your meeting

172
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,020
is so simple.

173
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,120
Yang,

174
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,200
you've brought us

175
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,710
not only milk tea but a brilliant idea.

176
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,880
I must treat you to dinner today.

177
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,580
I've told you to have a barbecue.

178
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,170
Well,

179
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,760
I'll ask Yanan to pick up our son

180
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,780
from school,

181
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,840
and we can enjoy it together.

182
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,680
Okay.

183
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,440
Guys, let's work on

184
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,630
the details of the plan.

185
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,050
- Okay.
- Okay.

186
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,950
Let's get it started.

187
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,410
I got dragged into

188
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,510
the meeting.

189
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,970
I'm going to the restroom.
You guys talk.

190
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,810
Okay.

191
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,950
The video Twilight is going viral.

192
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,440
Big data has also recognized
the keyword Zhang Zhilan

193
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,050
and recommended

194
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,950
Ms. Tang's analysis
of Zhang Zhilan's case.

195
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,930
It's the first promotional video

196
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,810
of our bank
with over 100 thousand likes.

197
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,440
Many comments

198
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,380
are complimenting CBBC.

199
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,760
(The winds rise from duckweeds,)
The headquarters also used it to promote

200
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,140
(and the waves come from gentle water.)
our policies for small businesses.

201
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,170
I didn't expect it

202
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,510
to become the most trending topic,

203
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,080
and we've gained a great number of fans.

204
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,580
Anyway, it's an unprecedented success.

205
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,950
Did Tang Yang write the title?

206
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,790
Yes.

207
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,310
The winds rise from duckweeds,

208
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,070
and the waves come from gentle water.

209
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,530
Mr. Feng.

210
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,570
It seems Ms. Tang

211
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,980
treats Yi Xiu like her home.

212
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,310
Jiang Shiyan is our boss, right?

213
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,830
Yang is Jiang Shiyan's big brother.

214
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,540
We all know that.

215
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,170
When our boss's bro

216
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,320
come to our company,

217
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,530
it's natural for her

218
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,630
to treat it like her home.

219
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,880
We thought she was

220
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,510
our boss's girlfriend

221
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,020
and was going to be Mrs. Jiang.

222
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,290
What Mrs. Jiang?

223
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,370
Yang and I are bros.

224
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,960
We'd risk our lives for each other.

225
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,240
Have you been pure friends

226
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,400
all these years?

227
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,830
Have you ever
had feelings for each other?

228
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,710
What feeling?

229
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,010
Young girl,

230
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,710
why are you always
thinking about these things?

231
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,200
Yang and Mr. Jiang,

232
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,630
as you know,

233
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,050
are good buddies.

234
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,570
They're bros.

235
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,150
Yes, once bro, always bro.

236
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,490
Okay. Now we know Ms. Tang and you

237
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,400
are just friends.

238
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,490
You don't need to repeat that.

239
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,310
- Okay. It's enough.
- We got it.

240
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,020
The boss's bro.

241
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,280
Stop it. Stop it.

242
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,420
It's time to eat. Let's go.

243
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,120
Ms. Tang.

244
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,710
They went back to the office.

245
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,130
The barbecue is ready.

246
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,340
I'll take you to the patio.

247
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,570
Okay.

248
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,780
Oh, deliver a message for me.

249
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,220
I have an urgent meeting.

250
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,540
I'll skip the barbecue.

251
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,120
Okay.

252
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,240
Thanks.

253
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,340
Yang.

254
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,250
Aren't we going to have a barbecue?

255
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,090
Why are you leaving?

256
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,640
They just called me back

257
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,100
to work overtime.

258
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,150
Sorry, I can't join you.

259
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,390
Wait a minute.

260
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,450
What?

261
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,700
We just got some snacks.

262
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,350
You can eat them later.

263
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,470
I'm not your client...

264
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,370
I... I'm your bro.

265
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,390
You don't have to be so polite.

266
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,870
Thanks.

267
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,820
Yang, you...

268
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,850
I'm fine.

269
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,800
I know the way out.

270
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Just go back.

271
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,640
Bye.

272
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,800
What are you doing?

273
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,660
We've been looking for you.

274
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,760
The barbecue is ready.

275
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,600
Let's go.

276
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,270
You guys enjoy it. I'm not hungry.

277
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,250
You said you wanted to have a barbecue.

278
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,630
It's ready. We're waiting for you.

279
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,010
You go first.

280
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,900
Be quick.

281
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,640
(What Mrs. Jiang?)

282
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,680
(Yang and I are bros.)

283
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,230
(We'd risk our lives for each other.)

284
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,420
(Once bro, always bro.)

285
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,410
(Okay.)

286
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,560
(Now we know Ms. Tang and you)

287
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,490
(are just friends.)

288
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,750
(You don't need to repeat that.)

289
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,410
What Mrs. Jiang?

290
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,700
She's my bro.

291
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,970
What's the rush to clarify that?

292
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,660
I'm more afraid of being misunderstood.

293
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,270
Once bro,

294
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,150
(Eyebrow Cake)
always bro.

295
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,420
That's right.

296
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,300
We're both innocent.

297
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,420
(Call, Jiang Shiyan)

298
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,980
(Call, Jiang Shiyan)

299
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,850
Sorry, the number you dialed

300
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,270
is not answered...

301
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,390
It's late. Why didn't she answer?

302
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,420
Is she still working?

303
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,420
You're back.

304
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,760
Are you hungry?

305
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,160
Do you want some noodles?

306
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,000
No.

307
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,300
Oh, I'm hungry. I want some food.

308
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,020
Make yourself some noodles.

309
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,750
Then why did you ask?

310
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,170
Good morning, Ms. Tang.

311
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,510
Did you check the intranet mailbox?

312
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,470
The list of new key cases
has been published,

313
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,800
and I've almost finished

314
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,870
my cases.

315
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,010
I'm wondering if I can

316
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,390
follow some new cooperative cases

317
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
to learn about

318
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,820
the patterns and strategies.

319
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,290
No problem.

320
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,900
Is there a case you're interested in?

321
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,990
I'm fine with all of them.

322
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,390
It's up to you.

323
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,270
If I have to choose one,

324
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,090
I'm quite interested in

325
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,230
the cooperative aesthetic medicine loan.

326
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,560
Aesthetic medicine

327
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,870
has been popular in recent years.

328
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,960
Its size and rate of return

329
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,150
are promising.

330
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
However, it also has

331
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,660
many potential risks.

332
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,940
For example, most lenders are young

333
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,150
and hard to afford the loan.

334
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,900
Besides, the aesthetic medicine loan

335
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,270
has lowered its threshold.

336
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,250
Some people might repay the loan

337
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,150
with another loan.

338
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,230
These are the potential risks
of this project.

339
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,590
In other words,

340
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,560
it seems to be

341
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,870
a tempting and interesting project,

342
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,330
but I think it's going to be
highly controversial in the meeting.

343
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,170
Ms. Tang,

344
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,850
the target group for market expansion

345
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,390
must be women.

346
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,250
I think aesthetic medicine loans

347
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,300
have huge market potential.

348
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,250
It's also aimed at

349
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,350
a high-growth group.

350
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,540
I want to give it a try.

351
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,750
Even if there's only a one-in-a-million
chance of success,

352
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,390
I still want to try.

353
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,180
If it's approved,
everyone will be happy.

354
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,520
If not,

355
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,180
I can also gain some experience.

356
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,590
Ms. Tang, please give me a chance.

357
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,920
Okay. No problem.

358
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,300
Let's see which one it is.

359
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,900
I think it's this one.

360
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,180
No problem.

361
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,920
Well, read it carefully.

362
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,630
If you have any questions, just ask me.

363
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,690
Thanks, Ms. Tang.

364
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,340
(Pantry)

365
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,210
Mr. Gan,

366
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,180
aesthetic medicine loan
is not a small project.

367
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,250
Ms. Tang, are you going to

368
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,660
hand it over to Linlang alone?

369
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,450
She wants to improve herself.

370
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,750
I have to hand it over to her.

371
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,760
That's right.

372
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,770
For Linlang, it's

373
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,800
a profitable project,

374
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,130
but for you,

375
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,090
maybe it's

376
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,300
nothing special.

377
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,490
Deputy Director Tang,
you've got a call.

378
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,650
It's your friend, Yi Xiu Gourmet's CEO

379
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,270
Jiang Shiyan who showed up

380
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,110
in the video last time.

381
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,360
Okay.

382
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,060
Can you put the cup back for me?

383
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,630
- Okay.
- Thanks.

384
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,930
Hurry.

385
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,490
What's wrong?

386
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,900
Mr. Jiang is calling Ms. Tang.

387
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,400
Ms. Tang, should congratulate you

388
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,390
in advance?

389
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,090
You've got Mr. Jiang,

390
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,700
a young and single millionaire.

391
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,040
How can the small Credit Audit Division

392
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,180
compare to that?

393
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,230
You left your scarf

394
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,630
at Yi Xiu yesterday.

395
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,420
I wanted

396
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,730
to send it to you last night,

397
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,210
but you didn't answer my calls

398
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,390
or reply to my texts.

399
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,350
I was wondering where I left it.

400
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,560
I worked late last night

401
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,760
and fell asleep once I got home.

402
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,600
I was exhausted.

403
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,180
I just had a meeting this morning.

404
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,090
(Converge Business Bank of China)
Of course I know.

405
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,930
You must be busy.

406
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,060
When do you get off work today?

407
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,850
Do you want to

408
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,270
eat the hotpot we talked about

409
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,360
last time?

410
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,730
Not tonight.

411
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,880
It's the end of the year.

412
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,630
We have many summaries, reviews,

413
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,010
and meetings.

414
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,700
I also need to work overtime tonight.

415
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,370
- You're so busy.
- Yes.

416
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,300
- Then...
- Ms. Tang.

417
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,450
Well,

418
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,850
go to work.

419
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,720
I'll visit you some...

420
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,560
By the way,

421
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,730
if it's not an emergency,

422
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,990
please don't come here.

423
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,210
I don't want others to think

424
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,780
that you're my boyfriend.

425
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,150
The hijacking video

426
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,880
has gone viral

427
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,470
on the internet.

428
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,180
My colleagues
also gossiped about it today.

429
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,020
You know I hate

430
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,180
being in the spotlight.

431
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,230
So, maybe we should
avoid seeing each other here.

432
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,510
Okay. Fine.

433
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,330
Well,

434
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,300
go to work. I'm leaving.

435
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,590
Okay. Well, I have to work.

436
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,120
Okay.

437
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,010
(If it's not an emergency,)

438
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,270
(please don't come here.)

439
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,490
(I don't want others to think)

440
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,060
(that you're my boyfriend.)

441
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,060
What's wrong with that?

442
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,610
If it's not an emergency,

443
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,660
please don't come here.

444
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,920
I don't want others to think

445
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,420
that you're my boyfriend.

446
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,230
No. It's not that casual.

447
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,090
How about this?

448
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,250
If it's not an emergency,

449
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,090
please don't come here.

450
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,090
I don't want others to think

451
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,230
that you're my boyfriend.

452
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,240
It's too serious.

453
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,420
It's something between

454
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,990
playing hard to get

455
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,170
and being adorable.

456
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,510
- Do you understand?
- I get it.

457
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,370
If it's not an emergency,

458
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,420
please don't come here.

459
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,490
I don't want others to think

460
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,350
that you're my boyfriend.

461
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,010
That's the tone

462
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,220
I'm talking about.

463
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,700
I get it.

464
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,160
Come on.

465
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,390
Listen to my analysis.

466
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,900
You have a friend.

467
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,390
His friend talked to him

468
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,930
in the tone like Cheng Hui just did.

469
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,350
She told your friend

470
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,870
not to come

471
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,070
to avoid misunderstandings.

472
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,500
- Is that right?
- Yes.

473
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,970
She said that

474
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,940
because she regarded him

475
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,390
as a close friend, right?

476
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,740
What close friend?

477
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,930
Listen,

478
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,180
this is very simple.

479
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,790
There are only three possibilities.

480
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
First, Jiang Shiyan's friend

481
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
must be a man,

482
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,650
and his friend must be a woman.

483
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,040
Considering

484
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,390
the entire situation,

485
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,650
the woman must be

486
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,530
building up

487
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,460
her career.

488
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,790
She doesn't like this man,

489
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:55,850
understand?

490
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,490
She thinks if he visits her,

491
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,730
people will gossip about her.

492
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,450
It's much more difficult for a woman

493
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,120
to succeed than a man does.

494
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,220
That's the first possibility.

495
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,590
Second,

496
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,040
this woman

497
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,360
doesn't like this guy,

498
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,080
but she likes

499
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,050
someone else

500
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,970
at her company.

501
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,760
She's worried that this guy

502
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,350
will make her crush jealous.

503
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,550
Then what's the third one?

504
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,870
She definitely doesn't like this guy.

505
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,110
Listen, in the workplace,

506
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,970
people will feel extremely uncomfortable

507
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,250
when working with

508
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,310
someone they don't like.

509
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,320
It's logically

510
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,160
correct.

511
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,090
Of course.

512
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,280
I passed the logic class in college
with a perfect score.

513
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,310
Is that right, Yan...?

514
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,200
He left?

515
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,050
Is that right,

516
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,160
Cheng Hui?

517
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,730
Ms. Tang,

518
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,400
Deputy Director Qin said

519
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,600
she sent two forms to your mailbox.

520
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,210
Please fill them up and reply to her.

521
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,050
Okay, I got it.

522
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,970
Here's the draft analysis

523
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,970
of aesthetic medicine loan.

524
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,220
Please check it out.

525
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,930
If there's any problem, please tell me,

526
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,770
and I'll correct it.

527
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,110
Well, put it on my desk.

528
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,070
Besides, Linlang,

529
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,070
I hope you can take it easy

530
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,150
with this case.

531
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,080
- I got it.
- Okay.

532
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,150
Thanks, Ms. Tang.

533
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,170
(If it's not an emergency,)

534
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,550
(please don't come here.)

535
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,650
(I don't want others to think)

536
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,220
(that you're my boyfriend.)

537
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,520
(First of all,)

538
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,650
(the woman must be)

539
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,530
(building up)

540
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,550
(her career.)

541
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,790
(She doesn't like this man.)

542
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,450
(That's the first possibility.)

543
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,420
(Second,)

544
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,490
(this woman)

545
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,970
(doesn't like this guy.)

546
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,080
(Third,)

547
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,790
(she definitely doesn't like this guy.)

548
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,900
(Yang)

549
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,820
(Yang)

550
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,320
Good morning, Ms. Zhou.

551
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,160
Good morning.

552
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,420
I've realized

553
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,930
the second female lead

554
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,390
in an idol drama

555
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,550
is usually

556
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,410
an excellent

557
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,030
and hard-working woman.

558
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,630
However, the male lead

559
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,450
always prefers

560
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,600
a loser female lead.

561
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,930
Maybe the female lead

562
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,900
has something special.

563
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,500
She's definitely special,

564
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,940
extremely useless.

565
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,900
To be honest,

566
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,080
one needs to find a perfect match.

567
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,070
Exactly.

568
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,280
How was Tang's blind date

569
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,220
last week?

570
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,500
Listen,

571
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,080
Tang had a blind date

572
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,450
with a neurosurgery medical doctor.

573
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,180
He's tall and polite

574
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,900
and has a rich family

575
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,980
and a good education.

576
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,120
Neurosurgery?

577
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,460
That's great!

578
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,940
Tang can't miss him.

579
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,070
I think he might be the one.

580
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,120
Yang went on a blind date?

581
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,110
Why didn't she tell me?

582
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,560
It's her blind date.

583
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,180
Why does she have to tell you?

584
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,030
She would...

585
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,830
tell me every time.

586
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,220
Maybe Jiang

587
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,870
cares about Tang a lot, right?

588
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,060
(Call, Jiang Yanan)

589
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:10,900
Hello, Yanan. What's up?

590
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,120
Yang.

591
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,930
Feng Weiran's uncle

592
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,450
sent us some Cantonese cuisine.

593
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,660
Come to our house for lunch tomorrow.

594
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,770
Who will be there?

595
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,390
Who else can it be? Feng Weiran,

596
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,730
Jiang Shiyan, and Cheng Hui.

597
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,660
Same as usual.

598
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,560
I have a meeting tomorrow.

599
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,830
Sorry, I can't come.

600
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,290
Yang,

601
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,040
it's Saturday tomorrow. You're off.

602
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,120
If you work overtime on weekends,

603
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,650
you can file for labor arbitration.

604
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,490
How about this?

605
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,930
You can hire me to be your lawyer

606
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,790
so that I can make some extra money.

607
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,760
Mr. Feng,

608
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,310
it's not working overtime.

609
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,980
We just

610
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:51,890
want to hang out at our company

611
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,520
during the weekend,

612
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,560
and we accidentally

613
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,180
go to the meeting room

614
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,220
and talk about work.

615
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,800
To be honest, I really need this job

616
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,420
to pay my mortgage.

617
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,080
Fine. Work is important.

618
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,360
Come next time. Bye.

619
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,790
- Bye.
- Bye.

620
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,020
(Assessment of Financial Situation)

621
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,180
(Loan Approval Results)

622
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,740
(Tang Yang, Deputy Director)

623
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,380
(Yi Xiu Gourmet)

624
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,160
Jiang Shiyan,

625
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,660
are we still playing badminton
this weekend?

626
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,070
Cheng Hui will come.

627
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,120
Besides,

628
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,220
Yang said she wouldn't work overtime.

629
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,520
It's rare for all of us to play together.

630
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,260
We'll have so much fun.

631
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,790
After the game, we'll have a great meal.

632
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,350
Yang already missed

633
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,690
the Cantonese cuisine last week.

634
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,530
Mr. Feng.

635
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,920
Mr. Jiang,

636
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,730
I've booked your ticket to Lancheng

637
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,900
and arranged the schedule.

638
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,070
The client who stopped working with us

639
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,970
because of Meng and Bella

640
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:22,840
came back.

641
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,740
I need to go there.

642
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,590
We should apologize.

643
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,040
But I thought you'd leave next Monday.

644
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,880
When will you get back?

645
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,320
Monday

646
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,700
or Sunday. I'm not sure.

647
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,320
I can't come on Sunday.

648
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,160
I have something to do.

649
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,900
Then who will monitor
Sheng Nina's streaming?

650
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,350
Peng Si and Cheng Hui.

651
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,360
Okay.

652
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,170
Mr. Cheng, Mr. Jiang and Mr. Feng
are both busy.

653
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,930
Please keep an eye on

654
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,070
Ms. Sheng's streaming on Sunday,

655
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,040
including receptions
before and after the streaming.

656
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,700
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

657
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,810
Rest early.

658
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,660
Oh my god.

659
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,700
Honey.

660
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,360
Have you noticed

661
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,500
a weird thing lately?

662
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,360
Wherever there's Tang Yang,

663
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,420
Jiang Shiyan wouldn't be there,

664
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,030
and Tang Yang wouldn't meet
Jiang Shiyan either.

665
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,590
Yes, and it's been a while.

666
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,420
Are they having beef?

667
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,560
They're not in a relationship.

668
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,790
They're brothers.

669
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,500
It can't be something serious.

670
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,740
What's the date today?

671
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,960
5th.

672
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,380
(Yi Xiu Gourmet)

673
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,380
(Tonight at 18:00, enjoy Ms. Sheng's
recommendations at Sheng's Feast)

674
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,490
Check the data.

675
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,410
Is it incorrect?

676
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,870
Oh, no, let me check this out.

677
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,150
Excuse me.

678
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,980
The lights are ready.

679
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,050
Okay.

680
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,730
Tang Yang.

681
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,050
Mo.

682
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,660
Are you going to buy a house?

683
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,600
Come in and take a look.

684
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,770
Let's go.

685
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,810
Okay.

686
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,050
Banks also

687
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,460
pay attention to new media now.

688
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,040
Twilight has made Zhang Zhilan's case

689
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,080
and CBBC Small and Micro Loan

690
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,220
famous.

691
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,710
You'll definitely become

692
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,140
the CBBC Outstanding Employee
of the Year.

693
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,350
CBBC has many talents.

694
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,150
It depends on luck.

695
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,520
This is a multifunctional smart kitchen

696
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,760
with an oven, a dishwasher,

697
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,600
and a sterilizer.

698
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,690
Our kitchenware

699
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,260
are all famous international brands.

700
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,260
You're always so modest.

701
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,400
By the way,

702
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,170
I saw you and Mr. Jiang

703
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,320
in the video of Yi Xiu's hijacking

704
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,360
on the internet.

705
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,410
I've seen a lot of

706
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,250
interesting comments.

707
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,890
They say only a young
and successful man like Mr. Jiang

708
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,110
deserve to be Ms. Tang's boyfriend.

709
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,890
We've been friends for years.

710
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,310
Mo, you know that.

711
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,320
They're all floor-to-ceiling windows,

712
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,180
which can let more light come in
and provides a good view.

713
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,010
Yes.

714
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,030
It's been many years.

715
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,660
You could've been together
a long time ago.

716
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,930
Check this giant lobby.

717
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,560
It's rare among

718
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,550
Rongcheng's apartments.

719
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,840
Water brings fortune.

720
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,700
You can sit here during your free time...

721
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,220
Go to work. I need to talk to her.

722
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,250
Okay.

723
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,740
It has a nice view

724
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,410
and good transportation.

725
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,460
It's also close to CBBC.

726
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,830
This road goes straight to the airport.

727
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,600
There are supermarkets,

728
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,180
hospitals, and schools

729
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,350
in the neighborhood.

730
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,920
Indeed.

731
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,790
It's a convenient place.

732
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,840
Mo, why are you taking me here

733
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,700
to see the apartment?

734
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,400
Do you like it?

735
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,390
You can buy it.

736
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,460
Mo, I'm so flattered.

737
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,800
I put the down payment

738
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,490
of my small apartment

739
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,450
with my own savings

740
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,760
and the money I borrowed

741
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,870
from my parents and friends.

742
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,260
I'm still paying the loan.

743
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,320
I can't afford such a fancy apartment.

744
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,310
I can't even dream about it.

745
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,150
Jiujiang Property
is one of the developers.

746
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,740
We've got a lot of
special-price apartments.

747
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,930
I've got this number

748
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,840
of apartments.

749
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,260
- 30?
- Yes.

750
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,590
It's 10 thousand yuan cheaper
than the opening price.

751
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,900
I did some calculations.

752
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,520
If you sell

753
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,360
your apartment,

754
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,980
it can cover most of the payment.

755
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,700
Besides, this location

756
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,310
has great growth potential.

757
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,680
How do you like it?

758
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,260
But...

759
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,490
I...

760
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,970
You're not taking advantage of me.

761
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,250
I need you to do me a favor.

762
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,900
The 30 apartments are not free gifts.

763
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,170
I need 30 people
to accept the special offer.

764
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,800
If I can't sell these apartments,

765
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,700
my colleagues in Jiujiang Group
will look down on me.

766
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,460
Therefore, I'm using
this opportunity to do you a favor.

767
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,050
Ms. Tang, if you have
some good opportunities,

768
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,110
please don't forget me.

769
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,920
Mo,

770
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,260
you can make it clear.

771
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,600
Okay.

772
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,280
Jiu Jiang will lend a 2-billion-yuan
property development loan

773
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,700
from CBBC.

774
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,600
Credit Audit Division

775
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,630
will be the first reviewer,

776
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,310
and I'll definitely need your help.

777
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,490
Of course, we won't

778
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,740
make any trouble.

779
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,830
However, we're worried that we might

780
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,350
miss some details.

781
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,070
Yang, can you do me this favor?

782
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,790
This apartment

783
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,870
is just a small gift.

784
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,500
I know Jiujiang Group.

785
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,900
They're always

786
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,350
careful with work.

787
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,960
Tang Yang.

788
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,260
Tang Yang, Tang Yang!

789
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,280
Mo, you've asked the wrong person.

790
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,460
Sometimes, we have no choice.

791
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,900
The powerful people

792
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,610
can not only
make us successful overnight

793
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,910
but also

794
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,490
put restrictions on us
for the rest of our lives.

795
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,390
I have many options.

796
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,080
If they give me a hard time,
I can change my place.

797
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,600
Yes, you're right.

798
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,070
But Tang Yang, what's the point?

799
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,630
It's the same everywhere.

800
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,150
As I said,

801
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,490
use this opportunity to do me a favor,

802
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,830
and everyone will be happy.

803
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,420
I know

804
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,890
there's something special

805
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,220
between us.

806
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,320
We're always on the same boat,

807
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,180
- so we...
- Mo, do you think

808
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,450
there's still anything special

809
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,420
between us now?

810
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,790
Besides, I have

811
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,350
seasickness.

812
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,660
I'd rather stay on shore.

813
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,680
Okay.

814
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,310
I've talked too much today.

815
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,260
Please consider it carefully\
when you go back.

816
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,260
(Jiang Shiyan)

817
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,400
Sorry,

818
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,970
the subscriber you dialed

819
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:09,840
is powered off.

820
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,680
Sorry...

821
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,180
Drink the water and put on some makeup.

822
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,590
Mr. Cheng, is there anything wrong
with the process?

823
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,330
No.

824
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,630
Ask him what he means.

825
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,360
What's wrong with Mr. Cheng?

826
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,630
He's been staring at us.

827
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,250
I'll talk to him.

828
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,110
Okay. Thanks.

829
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,690
Mr. Cheng, is there

830
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,070
a problem?

831
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,180
No.

832
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,630
Then why are you staring at her?

833
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,410
Didn't you say

834
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,370
Jiang Shiyan asked me

835
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,510
to keep an eye on the streaming?

836
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,480
I get it.

837
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,040
Where are going after work?

838
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,490
I saw a new store at the door.

839
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,330
Let's go there.

840
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,910
Okay, after work.

841
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,910
Nina, why aren't you eating?

842
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,080
I can't eat.

843
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,010
If you're still hungry,

844
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,430
you can eat mine.

845
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,180
Mr. Cheng, the email has been sent.

846
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,980
(Streaming Service Contract)

847
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,430
I'll get some rest upstairs.

848
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,440
Keep eating.

849
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,550
I... I'm finished.

850
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,200
Would you like twice-cooked pork?

851
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,150
No one touched it.

852
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,560
Nina,

853
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,770
I told you last time,
but you didn't believe me.

854
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,810
Look,

855
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,890
since you came here,

856
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,380
he's been sitting still

857
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,470
and staring at you

858
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,720
during the makeup process and the meal.

859
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,600
He even

860
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,070
ate our leftovers.

861
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,590
Look at him.

862
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,730
I think

863
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,180
He must be your big fan.

864
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,820
Just ignore him.

865
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,430
We're partners, after all.

866
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,560
Have you landed?

867
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,740
(Feng Weiran)
Yes, I just left the airport.

868
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
I'll arrive at the company

869
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,160
in about half an hour.

870
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,000
Okay.

871
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,590
How's the streaming?

872
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,030
Dorry worry. Everything's fine.

873
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,180
Peng Si keeps me informed.

874
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,040
When I finish this,

875
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,260
- I'll also be there.
- Mr. Feng.

876
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,470
Please sign this.

877
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,150
You just played badminton, right?

878
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,670
Aren't you supposed to
have a meal together?

879
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,260
What meal?

880
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,410
Yang went to see
an apartment with Zhou Mo.

881
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,250
She doesn't have time.

882
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,330
What?

883
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,240
Seeing an apartment with Zhou Mo?

884
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,080
Yes.

885
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,820
Where are they?

886
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,290
Why are they seeing an apartment?

887
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,510
How should I know?

888
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,640
They must

889
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,260
want to buy an apartment.

890
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,400
What's wrong?

891
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,910
Nothing. Bye.

892
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,520
(They must)

893
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,260
(want to buy an apartment.)

894
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,650
Hi Nobby,

895
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,180
call Yang.

896
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,780
(Call, Jiang Shiyan)

897
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,770
Yang.

898
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,070
Feng Weiran told me you went to

899
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,210
see an apartment?

900
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,770
Who were you with?

901
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,590
Are you buying another apartment?

902
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,630
No. I was with Zhou Mo.

903
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,890
He said
Jiujiang was one of the developers

904
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,430
of a building,

905
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,370
and he got a special price
for a few apartments,

906
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,340
which is much cheaper.

907
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,000
Is that so?

908
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,180
Which building?

909
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,220
(Yang)
It's called Riverbank Maple Town.

910
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,550
It sells well, right?

911
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,070
The first phase was very popular.

912
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,700
The second phase is about to open.

913
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,700
How can there be a special offer?

914
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,810
It has nothing to do with me.

915
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,740
I'm not buying an apartment.

916
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,950
Have you finished?

917
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,960
Yes.

918
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,910
I'm driving home now.

919
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,160
I was distracted

920
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,370
and chose the wrong road.

921
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,370
Now I am

922
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,820
on Airport Expressway auxiliary road.

923
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,110
Airport Expressway auxiliary road?

924
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,950
What a coincidence. I'm also here.

925
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,180
We must be close.

926
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,110
Why were you at the airport?

927
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,430
Yang, what's happened?

928
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,340
(Jiang Shiyan)
Yang.

929
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,770
Tang Yang!

930
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,080
Bro, the car is fine.

931
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,930
The car is fine.

932
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:55,860
What's wrong with you?

933
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,640
Sorry for this. Miss, please leave.
It's okay.

934
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,010
Bro, give me the key. I'll drive.

935
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,070
I'm not drunk!

936
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,330
Well, bro. It's okay. Come on.

937
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,890
- I'm really fine.
- Okay. You're fine.

938
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,630
Bro, drink some coffee to get sober.

939
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,740
Coffee.

940
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,110
Miss, please leave.

941
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,250
Hurry. You can go.

942
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,130
He's fine. Just leave.

943
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,020
He's fine. Just leave.

944
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,150
- Hello.
- He's not drunk.

945
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,660
Drink some coffee.

946
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,650
Miss!

947
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,040
Miss, don't call!

948
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,610
- I need to report something.
- Miss!

949
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,640
Who are you calling?

950
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
- I'm on the Airport...
- You don't need to call anyone.

951
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,380
- Airport Expressway.
- She's calling the police!

952
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,440
- Open the door!
- Miss!

953
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,280
Get out!

954
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,010
I've told you no one can stop my bro

955
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,080
when he's mad.

956
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,600
- Leave here!
- I suggest you calm down.

957
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,720
Get out! Get out!

958
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,930
- Get out!
- Miss,

959
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,150
I told you to leave. See?

960
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:37,910
You don't want to open the door?

961
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,040
Let's wait and see.

962
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,040
Let's wait and see!

963
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,920
Let's wait and see!

964
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,560
- The police are coming!
- Open the door!

965
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,820
- Can you calm down?
- Get out and talk!

966
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,340
You don't want to open it? Fine.

967
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,170
Get out!

968
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,160
Out, out!

969
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,470
- Get out!
- Get out!

970
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,430
Get out now!

971
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,910
Hit me? Get out!

972
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,810
Get out!

973
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,920
Back off!

974
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,330
What are you doing?

975
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,730
Don't move!

976
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,150
Yang, are you okay?

977
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,000
Are you okay?

978
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,170
Come on.

979
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,220
Get out. Let me see.

980
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,960
Are you alright?

981
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,080
I'm fine. I'm fine.

982
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,970
Did you get hurt?

983
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,150
No, I didn't.

984
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,860
I'm just freaked out.

985
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,260
It's alright. I'm here.

986
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,740
Girl,

987
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,300
is school over?

988
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,260
Rongcheng First High School.

989
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,860
Well, can we

990
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,850
make friends?

991
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,080
What's your name?

992
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,590
Do you want to eat something with us?

993
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,450
Say something.

994
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,630
Are you shy?

995
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,600
Just you three, right?

996
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,810
Judging from your uniforms,

997
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,030
you're from 11th High School, right?

998
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,600
Did you bully someone here

999
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,780
yesterday?

1000
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,600
You're always here

1001
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,260
waiting for our students.

1002
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,290
You'd bully every student

1003
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,380
who's alone, right?

1004
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,780
What do you mean?

1005
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,440
We just like to

1006
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,200
- make friends with girls.
- Make friends with girls.

1007
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,040
Yes.

1008
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,880
Listen,

1009
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,550
I'm not alone today.

1010
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,430
Skinny monkey!

1011
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,340
He's alone. How dare he play the hero?

1012
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,250
Miss,

1013
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,430
- I'm sorry.
- We're just kidding.

1014
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,240
It's a misunderstanding.
We're just kidding.

1015
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,080
Just kidding.

1016
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,560
Don't hit my face!

1017
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,340
We don't fight. We reason.

1018
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,560
Take us to your school

1019
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,990
to visit your teacher!

1020
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,520
- Thanks, ma'am.
- Thanks, ma'am.

1021
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,330
It's okay. If you need anything else,

1022
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,910
- just tell me.
- Okay.

1023
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,380
Let's finish this first.

1024
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,210
Yang,

1025
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,330
how did you know

1026
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,370
they'd be waiting for girls

1027
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,210
on this street?

1028
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,520
Think about it.

1029
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,030
They wanted to block girls,

1030
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
so they wouldn't dare

1031
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,150
to go somewhere crowded.

1032
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,220
This street is very quiet.

1033
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,770
The relocation has begun.

1034
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,740
Many people have moved out.

1035
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,770
Besides, it is

1036
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,160
on the shortcut

1037
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,550
from our school to the subway station.

1038
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,220
Weren't you afraid of being the bait?

1039
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,550
Why would I?

1040
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,630
Everyone was behind me, right?

1041
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,110
Look at you.

1042
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,010
As long as our bros are here,

1043
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,890
Yang fears nothing, right?

1044
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,200
Yes!

1045
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,990
In other words, Yang is here,

1046
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,950
so someone's going to

1047
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,280
pay for the barbecue tonight!

1048
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,860
- Stop talking!
- Thanks, Yang!

1049
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,490
Thanks, Yang!

1050
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,330
Cheers!

1051
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,360
Come on.

1052
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,340
I didn't say it!

1053
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,850
Thanks, Yang.

1054
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:21,690
