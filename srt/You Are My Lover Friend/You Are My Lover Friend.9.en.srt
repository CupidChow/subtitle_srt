a sugar-free Napolitain,

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,480
a sugar-free raspberry cake…

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,570
- That's enough.
- And

31
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,940
a small sugar-free Tiramisu.

Sugar-free. Eat as you like.

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,160
By the way, what happened

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,130
to your colleague afterwards?

36
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,970
Which thing?

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,520
That colleague

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,350
who want to test friendship.

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,000
She tested it.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,840
What's the result?

41
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,970
After multiple layers

42
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,680
of data verification,

43
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,040
it has been proven that
their feelings have not changed.

44
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,020
It's still friendship.

45
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,850
You can choose not to believe
in emotions.

46
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,850
But you must believe

47
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,810
in statistics, right?

48
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,230
Data never lies.

49
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,880
Statistics is statistics.

50
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,130
In a relationship,

51
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,440
each case is unique.

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,580
You don't understand anything.

53
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,480
Sugar Cat.

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,440
Do you know this?

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,580
This is recently very popular.

56
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,710
There is

57
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,200
a puppy which is also very popular.

58
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,740
It's called Syrup Dog.

59
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,570
Syrup…

60
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,620
They are a couple.

61
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,730
Sugar Cat and Syrup Dog

62
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,610
is called Syrup Duo.

63
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,440
Syrup Duo…

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,430
So cute.

65
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,900
A little bit…

66
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,370
Honey, look.

67
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,050
I want this Sugar Cat, too.

68
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,110
It is cute, isn't it?

69
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,460
Syrup…

70
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,830
What did the headquarters say
at the meeting?

71
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,450
We are competing with Pengxing

72
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,550
for reaching ten-billion scale
for small and micro enterprises.

73
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,310
The headquarters proposed the case
of Zhang Zhilan

74
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,390
as a prime example.

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,850
Detailed material,

76
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,340
data and explanation are needed.

77
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,830
I have informed Mr. Gan.

78
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,340
Tell Ms. Yang directly.

79
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,370
Got it.

80
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,270
I'm going to work now.

81
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,020
(The return of the top ones)

82
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,020
Here. Take a look.

83
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,880
Let me see.

84
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,210
It's OK.

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,670
- I'm going.
- Keep it up.

86
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,920
The fifth and the sixth one…

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,850
The fifth and sixth

88
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,760
are two big brands.

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
We will adjust them

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,900
based on the number of viewers
in the live streaming room.

91
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,970
If there are many viewers,

92
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,040
we will introduce them first.

93
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,410
OK.

94
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,110
Feng

95
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,510
will give you hints.

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,880
Let me have a look.

97
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,550
This is…

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,320
Mr. Cheng,

99
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,450
the devices are all put away.

100
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,810
Xingyue said she will arrange a car

101
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,760
to take you

102
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,830
to the airport tomorrow morning.

103
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,870
OK. I know.

104
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,920
OK.

105
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,700
(Cloudy with light rain today)

106
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Mr. Cheng.

107
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,320
Are you going out so late?

108
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,580
- For a run.
- A run now?

109
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,960
Is it not illegal?

110
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,800
Not…

111
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,020
Why haven't they gone back yet?

112
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,510
It seems to be the flight
tomorrow morning.

113
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,840
This person is really strange.

114
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,680
Exactly.

115
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,440
Besides dogs, only men
with ulterior motives

116
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,750
run at night in this place.

117
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,490
He might be pretending to go
for a night run.

118
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,880
He was intentionally waiting for you here.

119
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,170
Start walking navigation.

120
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,460
Please head south along the current road.

121
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,140
(A longing for the green hills)

122
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,570
Nina,

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,800
your purse.

124
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,160
Morning.

125
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,070
You just got back.

126
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,370
It's so early…

127
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,210
Watching the sunrise.

128
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,660
There must be a problem.

129
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,150
To watch the sunrise, he has to go
to the top of the mountain.

130
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,440
It will take more than an hour

131
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,690
from here to the top of the mountain.

132
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,520
The round trip takes at least three hours.

133
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,770
Doesn't that mean he got up

134
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,050
to climb the mountain at four o'clock?

135
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,980
Run at midnight,

136
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,760
watch the sunrise at four o'clock.

137
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,980
Does he not sleep?

138
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,600
Nina,

139
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,280
I'm telling you, he did it on purpose.

140
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,900
He is waiting here just for you.

141
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,530
Has he been waiting at this door

142
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,780
all night?

143
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,520
Too scary.

144
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,750
He is really not quite normal.

145
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,960
Stop that.

146
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,800
Let's go quickly.

Hello? Tang Yang.

156

Jiang Shiyan,

157
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,440
I need to submit the materials
of the Zhang Zhilan case

158
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,280
to the headquarters.

159
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,530
I just watched

160
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,490
the video filmed by Daily Menu.

161
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,580
It's great.

162
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,660
Can I use it?

163
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,870
Will there be any copyright issues?

164
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,190
Isn't that video all about food?

165
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,510
Can it be useful?

166
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,130
I just watched

167
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,020
the videos taken by my colleagues.

168
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,710
It's hard to put it into words.

170

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,020
to highlight its business content.

172
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm just here taking some photos
right now.

173
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,630
If you have time, come and take a look
at the materials.

174
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,000

In another folder.

192
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,520
This one.

193
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,520
That's right.

194
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,420
There is another folder.

195
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,150
- Look at this.
- Come on.

196
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,930
Zhilan.

197
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,170
Zhilan.

198
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,880
You two actually know each other.

199
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,720
I…

200
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,130
I do not know him.

201
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,250
We just arrived here

202
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,660
- and came across.
- Yeah.

203
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,610
Is it true?

204
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,010
Looks like not unfamiliar.

205
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,860
- Is that so?
- It's true.

206
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,140
Fate cannot be stopped when it comes.

207
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,800
Right?

208
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,390
Yeah.

209
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,700
- Enjoy your meal.
- OK.

for bringing bad luck to my parents

and my grandmother.

229
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,520
When I started primary school

230
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,300
at six,

231
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,910
I was the only one left
in the household registration.

232
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,590
When I was thirsty, I drank tap water.

233

When I was hungry,

234
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,750
I ate what others have left.

235
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,540
When I was 15 years old,

236
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,800
I was diagnosed with nephritis.

237
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,920
At that time, medical conditions

238
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,010
were not very good yet.

239
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,870
I thought

240
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,730
I can't survive on my own.

241
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,800
But everyone tried their best

242
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,150
to treat me.

243
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,090
One night,

244
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,090
a teacher from the orphanage

245
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,150
took us to the riverbank
to see fireflies.

246
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,060
He gave me a glass bottle

247
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,010
with the fireflies in it.

248
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,540
I still remember what he said,

249
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,290
"Look.

250
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,350
Just a little bit of light

251
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,350
can make people smile

252
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,640
and feel happy

253
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,060
even in the darkest times."

254
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,020
From that moment on,

255
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,660
I felt like

256
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,300
I was no longer alone.

257
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,880

258
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,540
every time I faced the toughest moments,

259
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,280
I always told myself

260
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,660
that I am not alone.

261
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,590
All employees here are military wives.

262
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,470
Life is not easy.

263
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,590
But just as the teacher said,

264
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,180
even if everyone

265
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,900
emits a little bit of light,

266
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,870
it can be very beautiful.

is in trouble,

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,990
doesn't seem so difficult anymore.

274

279
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,210
OK.

280
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,520
This.

281

Let's go out to eat.

286

It's OK, Zhilan. Don't bother.

287
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,420

291
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,780
Sure, no problem.

So abundant.

300
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,510
- Thank you.
- Try it.

301
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,180
Then I'll…

302
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,450
(Zhilan Snacks)
I just wanted to eat together.

303
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,780
Yummy! Just eat.

304
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,180
This is so delicious.

305
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,880
This is definitely the most delicious
fried rice

306
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,210
I have ever eaten.

307
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,130
This is much better than the one

308
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,970
we used to eat after evening
self-study classes

309
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,350
near the school gate.

310
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,970
Is it really that good?

311
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,230
It's really delicious.

312
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,210
Zhilan,

313
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,490
can I stand next to you

314
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,370
and record it

315
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,560
next time you do it?

316
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,730
I can do it myself once I get back.

317
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,820
I'm telling you guys.

318
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,680
Put these on top of the leftover rice.

319
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,880
I'll give you some sauce.

320
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,690
Pour it and heat it in the microwave
for a few minutes.

321
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,330
You can eat then.

322
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,400
I'm busy with work usually.

323
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,850
Put the leftovers from the previous day

324
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,610
in a big bowl.

325
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,760
After Min Lin came back,

326
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,650
they can eat when it's heated.

327
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,940
Safe and convenient.

328
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,270
No need to turn on the stove.

329
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,920
No need to turn on the stove?

330
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,040
Heat it with a microwave.

331
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,920
You have to teach me.

332
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,760
Sometimes after work,

333
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,210
I'm tired of eating takeouts.

334
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,520
This one is perfect for me.

335
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,450
Yang, your kitchen hasn't been used
for a hundred years.

336
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,750
Where did the leftovers come from?

337
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,210
Sometimes we had lunch gatherings

338
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,090
with colleagues

339
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,040
and I packed up the leftovers

340
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,090
to take home.

341
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,370
I just put it in the refrigerator.

342
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,670
After a few days, I forgot about it.

343
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,280
When I opened it again,
it was already spoiled.

344
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,800
I had to throw it away. What a waste.

345
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,470
If I could do this,

346
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,800
it will be more convenient in the future.

347
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,040
I don't have to order takeout anymore.

348

You don't have to rely on me
to bring you food every day.

350
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,690
Well,

351
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,290
that's different.

352
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,200
You are a delivery guy.

353
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,850

354
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,660

You're back.

358
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,470
Are you hungry? Do you want
to eat noodles?

359

became the typical case

00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,490
You stood on the right side early on.

377
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,210
You just took a site visit with her.
And then your name

378
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,450
appears twice in the first paragraph.

379
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,250
The leaders of our bank

380
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,060
can all see it.

381
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,210
Ms. Tang.

382
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,130
Ms. Tang, you're here.

383
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,650
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

384
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,990
We have to thank you.

385
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Don't mention it.

386
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,730
I always emphasize fairness and justice

387
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,180
in my work.

388
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,210
Next time,

389
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,700
take me with you, please.

390
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,330
And me.

391
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,200
- Take me with you.
- And me.

392
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,060
OK.

393
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,820
(Pantry)

394
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,880
Mr. Gan is coming.

395
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,940
- Mr. Gan.
- Mr. Gan.

396
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,760
Morning, MS. Tang, Ms. Qin.

397
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,850
- Morning
- Morning, Mr. Gan.

398
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,900
Have you all seen the notification
from the headquarters?

399
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,760
Yes.

400
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,020
Learn more from Ms. Tang.

401
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,940
Get ready for the meeting.

402
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,150
OK.

403
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,960
When did you

404
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,280
make your video?

405
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,630
Too professional.

406
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,780
A friend helped me with it.

407
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,940
A friend?

408
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,870
Yeah, my friend.

409
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,570
Well,

410
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,760
be careful.

411
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,690
Your friend will worry about you.

412
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,550
Don't joke around.

413
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,010
It’s not a joke.

414
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,170
You look nervous.

415
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,360
Don't blame me.

416
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,200
It's all your fault.

417
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,550
Let's hurry up. The meeting is starting.

418
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,660
(Glimmer)

419
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,940
Others blame me

420
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,830
for bringing bad luck to my parents

421
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,870
(Zhilan Snacks)
and my grandmother.

422
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,110
When I started primary school

423
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,030
at six,

424
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,030
I was the only one left
in the household registration.

425
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,250
Mr. Jiang.

426
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,830
Mr. Jiang, something bad happened.

427
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,170
Today is the day for the public to taste.

428
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,280
The team randomly selected ten users
from the community.

429
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,730
We didn't expect a man to bring a knife.

430
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,170
When we started giving introductions,

431
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,590
the man took out the knife.

432
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,690
Mr. Feng is also on the scene.

433
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,800
I have already called the police.

434
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,840
Don't come over here.

435
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,680
Step back.

436
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,110
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

437
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,890
- Don't come over.
- Step back.

438
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,630
Step back, step back, step back.

439
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
Do you have a responsible person?

440
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,070
I only talk to the person in charge.

441
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,950
Listen to me.

442
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,140
- I am in charge of this company…
- He!

443
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,500
He is the boss of Yi Xiu.

444
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,010
I have seen him in the news.

445
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,220
I only talk to him.

446
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,050
The police are coming. Go and meet them.

447
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,890
I'm fine.

448
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,700
Do you know me?

449
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,970
What can I help you with?

450
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,420
Return the money, return my money.

451
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,010
300,000.

452
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,110
That is all the savings of my parents.

453
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,090
Please speak slowly.

454
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,930
Since we don't know each other,

455
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,420
why do we owe you

456
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,050
300,000?

457
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,500
You cheated my money.

458
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,450
Yi Xiu Finance

459
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,310
deceived me into buying a 300,000-yuan
financial product,

460
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,490
claiming that I can withdraw
and deposit at any time.

461
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,600
When I want

462
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,730
to withdraw the money,

463
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,940
that website simply cannot be accessed.

464
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,420
That's all the savings of our family.

465
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,870
My parents have worked hard
all their lives

466
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,700
to save up for the down payment

467
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,520
for the house for me and my girlfriend.

468
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,150
300,000 in total.

469
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,170
That's my lifeblood.

470
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,320
Now the money is gone.

471
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,070
You took my money away.

472
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,440
Listen to me.

473
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,170
We do not have any content

474
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,180
related to financial management
under Yi Xiu.

475
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,740
Have you called the police?

476
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,740
Yes, that's right.

477
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,030
Have you called the police?

478
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,220
Online fraud.

479
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,420
- Yes.
- It's online fraud.

480
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Maybe I won't get

481
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,940
a single penny back.

482
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,440
It's gone.

483
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,600
Nothing left, nothing left.

484
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,220
Stay calm.

485
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,290
After Ms. Tang posed

486
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,890
the fraud risk of Li Mingwei last time,

487
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,550
I followed up and implemented it.

488
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,360
It was found

489
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,600
that on March 24 last year,

490
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,890
Li Mingwei received a transfer

491
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,900
of 500,000 yuan

492
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,250
from the deputy director
of Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant,

493
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,250
marked as a loan.

494
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,410
On January 13 this year,

495
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,490
he received another transfer

496
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,410
of 100,000 yuan

497
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,700
from Wang Siqi, the workshop director
of Lanchuan Iron and Steel Plant,

498
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,500
marked as a loan.

499
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,160
Mr. Gan,

500
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,400
I have something urgent to attend to.

501
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,700
I have to go out.

502
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,780
(Jiang Shiyan)

503
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,170
Sorry, the number you dialed

504
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,650
is temporarily unavailable.

505
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,260
Please try again later.

506
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,200
(Yue Ya Live Room)

507
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,180
Capture it quickly.

508
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,690
- How is it going?
- It's OK.

509
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,530
Yue Ya,

510
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,080
the live streaming will start
in three minutes.

511
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,920
OK.

512
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,590
Yue Ya, Yi Xiu has big news.

513
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,830
Now the money is gone.

514
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,630
You tool all of them away.

515
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,310
Jiang Shiyan.

516
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,820
(Public Security)

517
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,790
Take me to the scene.

518
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,310
- Mr. Feng.
- Peng Si.

519
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,210
This is Mr. Ma, and this is Mr. Feng.

520
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,450
Hello, follow me this way.

521
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,400
It's not easy to be found here.

522
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,240
OK.

523
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,200
Please.

524
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,590
Listen to me. There will always be
a solution.

525
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,770
The police track internet crimes

526
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,320
very quickly nowadays.

527
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,070
I don't listen to your nonsense.

528
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,960
Well…

529
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,600
Let me introduce you to each other.

530
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,320
This is our expert in charge
of negotiations,

531
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,160
Mr. Fang.

532
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,150
- Nice to mee you.
- Nice to mee you.

533
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,690
What should we do in this situation now?

534
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,010
Just before you arrived,

535
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,930
he kept asking

536
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,150
who is the head of Yi Xiu.

537
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,940
Our president, Jiang Shiyan, went up.

538
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,260
Now he only talks to him.

539
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,700
I can't replace him.

540
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:45,970
There are too many

541
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,030
onlookers here.

542
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,280
I am afraid

543
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,900
that someone will do something
to provoke him,

544
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,730
causing harm to the people around him

545
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,590
and the bystanders.

546
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,550
Is there any specific way?

547
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,200
Let's do this.

548
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,560
I'll pretend to be your colleague

549
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,070
and find a way to talk to Mr. Jiang.

550
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,250
I suggest

551
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,250
leading him to a place

552
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,260
with fewer people.

553
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,010
OK.

554
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,460
- Take this.
- OK.

555
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,400
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

556
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,460
(Office area)

557
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,570
Everything is gone.

558
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,940
Nothing left.

559
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,360
Nothing left.

560
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,080
Sir, calm down.

561
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,840
How could I calm down?

562
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,170
They are all scammers.

563
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,740
Yi Xiu is a fraud.

564
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,120
- Mr. Jiang.
- Please believe in Yi Xiu.

565
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,080
- I am in charge of negotiations.
- I can't believe them.

566
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,320
Can you come up with a way

567
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,740
to lead him to a place
with fewer people?

568
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,450
Who are you?

569
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,560
What are you doing?

570
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,980
They are my business partners.

571
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,660
Yi Xiu's partners.

572
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,450
We have just confirmed

573
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,490
that Yi Xiu does not have

574
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,750
any financial management products.

575
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,560
How about this?

576
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
I don't want to hear your nonsense.
I don't listen.

577
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,420
- Can we do it this way?
- I want my money.

578
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,150
Can we do it this way?

579
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,500
This is our technical director

580
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,490
at Yi Xiu,

581
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,720
who is responsible for technology.

582
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,770
He just told me that since they
can provide

583
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,980
the entire network and system,

584
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,310
there must be clues to follow.

585
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,070
- Right?
- Yes.

586
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,490
As long as there is enough information,

587
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,420
I can track it.

588
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,590
We are an internet company.

589
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,010
Our company has a lot

590
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,420
of talented technical personnel.

591
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,590
If you provide us
with the website address,

592
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,290
we may be able

593
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,260
to track them down

594
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,500
and help you recover your money.

595
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,150
Is it still possible?

596
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,010
There is still time.

597
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,880
Stay calm, stay calm.

598
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,120
- Don't get excited.
- Stay calm.

599
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,420
- How about this?
- Stay calm, stay calm.

600
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,700
You let her go.

601
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,920
Let me be your hostage.

602
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,800
Let's go to the office over there.

603
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,180
I will help you search on the computer.

604
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,120
No.

605
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,750
I want to take her to the office

606
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,150
with you.

607
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,590
Only he can go.

608
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,530
OK.

609
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,350
You go to the office with me.

610
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,070
You go ahead.

611
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,290
Our office is on the fifth floor.

612
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,180
Take the elevator with me.

613
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,980
Make way.

614
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,440
Don't move.

615
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,690
Don't move, don't move.

616
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,010
Don't blame me for being rude.

617
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:58,850
Follow me.

618
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,070
What is on the fifth floor?

619
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,460
It is the parking lot
for company executives

620
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,170
within our company.

621
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,040
There shouldn't be many people.

622
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,760
Arrange at the elevator entrance
on the fifth floor.

623
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,220
Evacuate all personnel on the fifth floor.

624
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,940
Is there any other way to get
to the fifth floor?

625
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,520
There are also freight elevators.

626
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,360
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

627
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,770
Go.

628
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,310
Be honest.

629
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,250
Jiang Shiyan.

630
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,080
What did bring you here?

631
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,120
Are you OK?

632
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
I'm fine.

633
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,110
Did he hurt you?

634
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,450
Why are you so neverse?

635
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,290
It's OK.

636
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,210
It's nothing.

637
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,050
When did you come over?

638
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,150
I just arrived.

639
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,280
Yang.

640
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,660
Mr. Jiang, are you OK?

641
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,920
I'm fine.

642
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,160
Thank you.

643
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,790
You're welcome, sir.

644
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,880
I will need your cooperation

645
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,040
to make a record later.

646
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,880
Sure.

647
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,550
Thank you again.

648
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,070
Let me take a look.

649
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,770
- Are you K?
- It's nothing.

650
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,830
Oh my god. I'm so scared.

651
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,030
I still haven't recovered.

652
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,250
Contact Cheng Hui as soon as possible

653
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,410
and see if he gets off the plane.

654
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,020
I estimate that public opinions
on the internet

655
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,940
have already fermented.

656
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,440
I see.

I'm fine.

662
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,070
Then why are you crying?

663
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,740
Let's wipe it for you.

664
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,420
So sweet!

665
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,900
It's OK. I'm still alive.

What are you doing?

669
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,880
Stop taking photos.

670
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,390
I thought you were…

671
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,030

You bought so many again.

676
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,640
You're back.

677
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,700
Be careful, kids.

678
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,250
Come in.

679
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,360
Your flowers

680
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,550
can decorate the garden beautifully.

681
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,840
I'll find two pots to plant it

682
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,520
in a moment.

683
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,690
They will be completely different.

684
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,800
Do you know

685
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,050
there is a kind of

686
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,520
self-watering flower pots?
They're quite useful.

687
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,730
Let me search online for you.

688
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,140
The self-watering pots need
to be planted

689
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,630
with self-watering plants.

690
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,740
You will eventually find a use for it.

691
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,110
You take a seat first.

692
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,150
(Mr. Jiang confronted the criminal
in the hostage situation)

693
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,930
It's Shiyan.

694
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,900
It's Shiyan. Take a look.

695
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:39,850
Hurry up!

696
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,290
What's wrong?

697
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,090
What's going on?

698
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,560
Is it Shiyan's phone?

699
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,400
Yes, yes, yes.

700
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,010
Son.

701
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,870
Mom. Ms. Zhou.

702
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,520
Don't worry, I'm fine.

703
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,700
See. Tang is here, too.

704
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,360
Mom, Aunt Yi, don't worry.

705
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,520
We are all fine.

706
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,730
What happened?

707
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,460
That video was scary just now.

708
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,660
It's nothing.

709
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,560
There is a scam group

710
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,530
conducting fraud

711
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,840
under the guise of Yi Xiu Finance.

712
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,870
That person put all the money

713
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,760
his parents gave him

714
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,360
for the down payment on the house

715
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,050
and the money for his mother's
medical treatment

716
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,310
into it.

717
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,210
When he realized something is wrong,
he called the police.

718
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,870
The police told him that he had been
deceived.

719
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,800
He may be a bit absent-minded.

720
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,770
He ran over and caused a scene.

721
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,600
He thought Yi Xiu Gourmet

722
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,450
is in cahoots with Yi Xiu Finance.

723
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,360
His purpose is

724
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,740
to get his money back.

725
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,360
When the incident just happened,

726
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,770
Feng Weiran had already asked someone

727
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,120
to display the fraudulent website

728
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,050
and scam warning

729
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,210
on the homepage of Yi Xiu

730
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,350
and various live streaming rooms.

731
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,970
Someone was preparing to make a payment.

732
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,150
He immediately called the police
after seeing the live streaming.

733
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,630
It is said that the police
have identified

734
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,040
all useful information.

735
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,250
Maybe this person's money

736
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,350
can be recovered.

737
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,080
It's good if it can be recovered.

738
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,030
It's good.

739
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,500
You're not hurt, are you?

740
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,830
I'm fine.

741
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,110
Look at me.

742
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,570
I'm doing well.

743
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,290
The public opinion on the Internet

744
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,170
is very chaotic now.

745
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,970
Many people are inciting
and stirring up trouble,

746
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,930
and many water army

747
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,420
taking advantage of the chaos
to smear us.

748

00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,340
(Jiang Shiyan Cheng Hui
Jiang Yanan)

934
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,240
Do you have any activities

935
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,590
today?

936
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,100
(Tang Yang)

937
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,780
(Jiang Yanan)

938
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,980
(Feng Weiran)

939
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,860
(Event overview)

940
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,660
(Yi Xiu Gourmet)

941
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,360
Hello.

942
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,030
I want to see Mr. Jiang.

943
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,640
Mr. Jiang is having a meeting
over there.

944
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,160
- Meeting?
- Yeah, meeting.

945
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,080
Our plan this year

946
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,000
is to expand the concept and scope
of the food competition

947
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,820
based on last year's event.

948
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:19,930
In this way

949
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,490
the activity level of community users

950
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,030
will increase significantly.

951
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,820
(Seven years ago)

952
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,200
Yang, come here.

953
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,850
Jiang Shiyan, let me go.

954
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,700
I…

955
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,180
Bring her a bowl of eight-treasure rice.

956
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,200
Listen to me.

957
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,370
- Sit down.
- I only took

958
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,560
a vacation of several days this time.

959
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,760
I have gained five jin now.

960
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,640
I really can't eat anymore.

961
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,030
Last time you asked me
to try the durian.

962
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,160
I almost vomited.

963
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,860
- Let go.
- I…

964
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:56,810
Eat.

965
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,850
Yang, listen to me.

966
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,690
Listen to me.

967
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,940
We are recommending food
for Chinese New Year.

968
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,510
They have prepared such a large amount
of food.

969
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,470
They have been photographed,

970
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,340
the packaging has been opened,
and it has been heated up.

971
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,550
It's a waste if we don't finish eating it.

972
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,130
Feng Weiran,

973
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,080
have some more.

974
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,930
I really don't want to help you

975
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,970
try eating anything anymore.

976
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,560
I will leave in a couple of days.

977
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,260
Would you like to have a big meal
with me?

978
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,160
- Have a big meal.
- Stop.

979
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,740
Don't say anything

980
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,720
related to eating.

981
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,780
I can't listen. I feel sick when I listen.

982
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,950
What big meal? I can still eat more.

983
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,640
Eight-treasures rice feast.

984
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,860
Yang, come and have a taste of this.

985
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,950
Blood glutinous rice. It's really delicious.

986
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,490
Feng Weiran, can you please
stop burping?

987
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,370
It's disgusting. Don't affect
Yang's appetite.

988
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,510
I can't control it.

989
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,260
Have a taste of this.

990
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,050
This red bean paste is slightly sweet.

991
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,740
It's not greasy at all.

992
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,110
Pine nuts have a clean
and fragrant taste.

993
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,330
Open your mouth.

994
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,220
That's right.

995
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,080
Then take another bite.

996
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,120
Come on, have a little more.

997
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,340
- You can.
- You guys…

998
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,660
Try this flavor again.

999
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,180
The ultimate destination of food reviews
is the community.

1000
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,630
I want to provide a platform

1001
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,860
for users to communicate
and share with each other,

1002
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,430
a product

1003
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,850
that brings together

1004
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,110
foodies

1005
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,210
and gourmet.

1006
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,250
What's more,

1007
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:23,910
in China,

1008
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,930
people consider food
as their primary need.

1009
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,330
There is nothing

1010
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,120
- more important than eating.
- That's right.

1011
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,160
So it's absolutely no problem

1012
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,700
for our target users to reach over a billion.

1013
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,470
Right, Cheng Hui?

1014
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,410
Why are you still eating?

1015
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,640
How much have you eaten?

1016
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,740
Aren't you full?

1017
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Can you control him?

1018
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,730
He ate the portions of five people

1019
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:43,660
by himself.

1020
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,690
I am tall.

1021
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,430
Don't you think Cheng Hui's belly

1022
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,720
is naturally suitable

1023
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,820
for Yi Xiu Gourmet?

1024
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,280
By the way, I haven't asked you yet

1025
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,860
why you took the name
of Yi Xiu Gourmet.

1026
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,110
How to understand it?

1027
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,220
At first,

1028
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,740
the meaning is loving delicious food.

1029
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,300
No matter how you read it,

1030
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,990
it fits our product positioning.

1031
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,630
Then I asked each of them

1032
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,590
to give one word.

1033
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,700
Let me explain this.

1034
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,910
I thought

1035
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,050
since we are in the food industry,

1036
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,030
we must strive to be the best
in the industry, right?

1037
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,690
I just said Yi.
[*Yi means the number one in Chinese]

1038
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,720
Who would have thought

1039
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,780
that this guy said Xiu after I said Yi.

1040
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,860
Why did you say Xiu?

1041
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,660
Speaking of Yi,

1042
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,470
Xiu is the only word in my mind.

1043
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,950
Xiu is good. Its meaning is
to have a good rest.

1044
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,050
Take a break

1045
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,490
and then eat more delicious food.

1046
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,380
No problem at all.

1047
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,660
Can I still have the big meal
you just mentioned?

1048
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,440
Come on.

1049
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,470
- Do you still want to eat?
