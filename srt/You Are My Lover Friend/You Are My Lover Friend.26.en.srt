Peng Si.

29
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,030
Take it.

30
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,720
- Hello.
- Mr. Jiang, something's wrong.

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,240
There's negative news about Ms. Sheng,

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,160
and it's gone viral.

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,580
Mr. Feng wants to discuss it.

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,760
Okay. Let me see what happened.

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,600
I'll call you back.

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,000
It seems her private account

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,480
was found talking weird stuff

38
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,050
with another account,

39
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,940
and there are indecent photos.

40
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,980
(I knew she was not innocent.)

41
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,710
Well, go to your company.

42
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,060
Don't worry. I can go myself.

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,080
Sorry.

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,690
Don't be.

45
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,990
I'm leaving.

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,620
Then I'll stop here.

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,600
Don't worry.

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,320
Goodbye.

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,320
What happened?

50
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,710
You're finally back.

51
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,250
It's gone viral on Hot Topics.
Do you know that?

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,380
Go to my office.

53
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,800
(Mr. Jiang,)

54
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,680
(all the photos)

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,520
(are fake.)

56
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,970
(Someone hacked Nina's account.)

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,010
(We're drafting a statement.)

58
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,360
(We'll hold the hacker)

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,890
(and those who spread the rumors
accountable.)

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,530
Her agent Wang Xingyue

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,100
sent me this on my way here.

62
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,550
The screenshots of the chat

63
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,010
have been exposed for two hours.

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,560
Do you know how fast

65
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,870
rumors can escalate in social media?

66
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,760
As far as I know,

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,520
all the brands she cooperates with

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,590
have deleted her information

69
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,200
from their websites,

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,110
so I suggest that we delete the photo

71
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,520
of her being the Food Selector

72
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
of Yixiu Found of Food

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,460
from our homepage as soon as possible.

74
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,260
Cheng Hui, have you analyzed
the technical problem?

75
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,020
I need time to find the hacker,

76
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,630
but I've asked someone

77
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,930
to identify and analyze the pictures.

78
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,050
They're all composite images.

79
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,030
They're fake.

80
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,870
There's another problem.

81
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,270
In her channel, Sheng Nina

82
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,150
(Fake Photo Analysis)
always has wisdom and good taste,

83
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,590
but the negative news

84
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,600
are completely opposite

85
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,900
to her public persona.

86
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,390
Even if we can

87
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,440
solve this crisis,

88
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,290
we still need to consider

89
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,700
if we should renew her contract.

90
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,220
As long as we can prove
she didn't do this,

91
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,120
her public image won't collapse.

92
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Anyway,

93
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,370
at this critical point,

94
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,370
the safest thing we can do
is to remove her from our homepage.

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,900
Since Cheng Hui has conformed
the falseness of the rumors,

96
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,320
Sheng Nina is very likely

97
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,820
to be the victim in this.

98
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,120
Her food live-broadcast

99
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
has helped us a lot

100
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,260
by bringing in many users for us

101
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,490
as a celebrity.

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,320
But we've established

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,790
our celebrity social media matrix.

104
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,930
She's not indispensable.

105
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,340
In terms of business interests,

106
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,480
she can only bring us

107
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,900
negative comments.

108
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,000
Regardless of business value,

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,830
I think we've built
a partnership with her

110
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,100
after all our cooperation.

111
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,050
Since Cheng Hui thinks

112
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,260
the photos are fake,

113
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,230
I think

114
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,370
we should keep her image.

115
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,520
What are you doing?

116
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,930
Didn't you decide to keep her image?

117
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,270
I have to prepare for a PR crisis.

118
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,490
Who else can be responsible for that?

119
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,830
Thanks, big lawyer.

120
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,370
Stop laughing, Jiang Shiyan.

121
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
My career as a lawyer

122
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,040
has long gone

123
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,730
since you got me

124
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,160
into this.

125
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,190
What are you doing?

126
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,310
I'll

127
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,580
visit a friend.

128
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,490
Visit a friend?

129
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,070
Okay.

130
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,660
We've sent the statement,

131
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,350
but based on the public's comments,

132
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,410
it didn't work well.

133
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,610
They said

134
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,760
they knew we'd claim

135
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,780
the account was hacked.

136
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,170
A PR company suggested

137
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
that you go live

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,370
and respond to this.

139
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,900
How should I respond?

140
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,510
Besides, even if I clarify it,

141
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,780
will they believe me?

142
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,160
It'll only lead to

143
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,530
more hot topics about me.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,490
Mr. Cheng from Yixiu.

145
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,320
Why is he calling me

146
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,160
now?

147
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,660
Maybe

148
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,580
they want to terminate our contract.

149
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,820
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

150
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,040
(Xingyue,)

151
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,410
(are you with Ms. Sheng?)

152
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,050
(She didn't answer my video calls.)

153
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,370
(I'm downstairs,)

154
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,000
(but the guard wouldn't let me in)

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,100
(without her permission.)

156
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,870
Mr. Cheng.

157
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,050
Get in. I'll open the door.

158
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,540
(For Fine Food)

159
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,610
(In this press conference,)

160
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,270
(we'll focus on Yixiu Found of Food's)

161
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,700
(latest business.)

162
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
(I'm going to introduce)

163
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,050
(the core features
of the business platform)

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,660
(and give you a brand-new blueprint
of Yixiu's Food Map.)

165
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,660
Tell me the details

166
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,190
of the Yixiu's brand-new

167
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,370
Food Map Project.

168
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,460
It's the integration
of online and offline businesses.

169
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,370
They'll find

170
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
representative and historic

171
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,370
food specialties of an area

172
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,700
and open food collection stores there.

173
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,790
Eventually, they'll promote the brand
to other industries

174
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,730
via marketing strategies

175
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,260
of Yixiu Found of Food.

176
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,160
Do you mean

177
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,260
Jiujiang

178
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,410
should invest in this project?

179
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,870
Yes.

180
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,880
Jiujiang has large resorts

181
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,560
and shopping malls

182
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,580
in many areas.

183
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,560
I think

184
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,100
we can cooperate with them

185
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,410
with Jiujiang Property's

186
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,340
real estate assets.

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,080
We'll provide funding

188
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,230
and build offline stores,

189
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,200
and they'll select food products

190
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,100
and promote and publicize them.

191
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,340
Yixiu is very popular right now.

192
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,440
Are you sure

193
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,490
they'll cooperate with us?

194
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,890
They're in the Series C Round
of financing.

195
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,010
Considering their growth rate,

196
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,820
the financing

197
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,910
will be used

198
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,340
to expand their current business.

199
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,460
As for the offline brands,

200
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,540
they cannot make it

201
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,970
with their own funds.

202
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,700
If we cooperate with them,

203
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,850
we'll not only provide funds

204
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,080
but also solve the problem
of location selection.

205
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,060
It's a win-win situation.

206
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,010
After the Series C Round,

207
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,940
Yixiu will focus on going to market.

208
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,480
If we want to participate in it,

209
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,940
this is the best opportunity.

210
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,670
After that,

211
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,940
we'll cost ten times the price.

212
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,970
Yixiu's CEO Jiang Shiyan

213
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,720
and CBBC's branch leader Tang Yang

214
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,580
are very close.

215
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,770
If I talk to Yang Tang first,

216
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,520
we'll have a good chance of winning.

217
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,890
You've got a good plan.

218
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,940
The business model

219
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,610
and the path are both clear,

220
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,370
and it'll be very influential.

221
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,460
I think it'll work.

222
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,300
Just stick with the plan.

223
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,890
Okay, Ms. Wei.

224
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,430
Thanks.

225
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
The base is chicken soup.

226
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,510
I asked him to make dumplings and soup

227
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,350
separately.

228
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,520
Thanks.

229
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,060
Try it.

230
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,100
Mr. Cheng, leave it to me.

231
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,680
It's okay. I can wash the dishes.

232
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,040
No, no. Let me do it.

233
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,010
Let me do it.

234
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,430
Thanks.

235
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
No problem.

236
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,550
Is it good?

237
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,550
Very good.

238
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,650
I'll take you to the store.

239
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,640
It's even better.

240
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,420
However,

241
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,250
you owe me

242
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,590
four meals now.

243
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,400
Yes.

244
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,420
I owe you more and more meals,

245
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,180
but I'm starting to take it for granted.

246
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,800
Then I'm leaving.

247
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,610
I'll see you off.

248
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,750
I remember there was a time

249
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,060
when I went to Daxing'anling Prefecture

250
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,610
and lived in a mountain village,

251
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,610
but there was a blizzard,

252
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,770
and I was stuck there for a week.

253
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,250
There was no network

254
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,770
or cell phone signal.

255
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,700
During that week,

256
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,130
I didn't even know what was going on
outside the mountains.

257
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,420
After I left,

258
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,180
I realized

259
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,720
that all the messages

260
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,460
I missed in the week

261
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,700
didn't matter at all.

262
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,180
I had nothing to do with them.

263
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,470
Bye.

264
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,230
Why did he

265
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,070
come here?

266
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,830
Well...

267
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,730
Eat dumplings.

268
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,940
What about the hacker?

269
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,120
Anyway,

270
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,960
we've done everything we could.

271
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,060
We've sent a statement.

272
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,400
Whether they believe it or not

273
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,580
is not up to us.

274
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,460
So, what should we do now?

275
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,460
Now

276
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,670
I'm tired.

277
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,970
I'm going to sleep.

278
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,430
Thanks.

279
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,240
Who's this?

280
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,340
Why are you here?

281
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,420
I finished my work.

282
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,770
I knew you weren't sleeping,

283
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,300
so I came to see you.

284
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,130
Did you have dinner?

285
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,550
Yes,

286
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,100
but I only had a sandwich.

287
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,060
Only a sandwich?

288
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,540
It's not enough.

289
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,800
Are you hungry?

290
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,650
I can cook for you.

291
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,370
Cook for me?

292
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,770
Can you do that?

293
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,460
Don't look down on me.

294
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,960
It's not a big deal.

295
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,440
I can make

296
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
simple food.

297
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,580
Like instant noodles?

298
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,750
Of course I can do that.

299
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,280
I can even make more complicated food.

300
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,440
I can make dumplings

301
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,370
or something like that.

302
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,710
I'd like some small rice dumplings
with sweet fermented rice.

303
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,180
There are some

304
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,990
black sesame glutinous rice dumplings
in the fridge.

305
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,490
And the sweet fermented rice
hasn't expired.

306
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,970
I didn't know they were in the fridge.

307
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,220
Why do I feel

308
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,710
that you know my fridge

309
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,540
better than I do?

310
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,160
I just cleaned it in the morning

311
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,460
and threw away the expired ones.

312
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,280
What's this?

313
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,870
I went out in a hurry.

314
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,990
Maybe it got stained somehow.

315
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,830
Coffee?

316
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,730
Take it off. I'll wash it for you.

317
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,180
You don't have to.

318
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,730
It's okay. Not a big deal.

319
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,250
I'm going to do the laundry anyway.

320
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,340
With your clothes?

321
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,420
Why are you staring at
the washing machine?

322
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,350
I like to watch

323
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,610
our clothes

324
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,610

I think

we just spent too much time
doing laundry,

334
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,300
and it's overcooked.

335
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,160
We can only have

336
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,740
the sesame soup.

337
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,550

Mr. Feng, this is

350
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,680
the consulting team of Liqin Consultant

351
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
hired by Ding Shen Capital.

352
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,750
- Hello.
- I'm Lisa.

353
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

354
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,800
I'm Feng Weiran.

355
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,030
This is the project leader,

356
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,930
Mr. Alex Song.

357
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,020
Song Jing?

358
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,880
The first two are samples.

359
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
We need to think carefully

360
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,870
about both the design plan
and the location.

361
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,720
Got it.

362
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,280
Go on with your work.

363
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

364
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,850
- Mr. Feng.
- Mr. Feng.

365
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,310
Why are you here?

366
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,580
Take a look.

367
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,500
The investment team is here.

368
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,890
Didn't you ask me to come at lunch?

369
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,680
Do you know

370
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,520
who the leader is?

371
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,590
Who?

372
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,630
Song...

373
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,870
Jing.

374
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,830
What are you looking at?

375
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,200
I'm not surprised.

376
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,200
They're here again,
those guys in dark suits

377
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,920
who eat the same takeout food
for every meal

378
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,210
and never leave our meeting room.

379
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,310
The cafeteria prepared lunch today.

380
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,370
Remember to come.

381
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,550
(Meeting Room)
I'm too busy.

382
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,440
As a co-founder,

383
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,360
you need to say hi to them.

384
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,210
I'm busy.

385
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,510
They made sweet and sour ribs

386
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,450
and Sichuan pepper chicken.

387
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,070
When?

388
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,150
12:00 p.m.

389
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,870
Okay.

390
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,390
Song Jing.

391
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,600
It's been a long time.

392
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,960
Jiang Shiyan,

393
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,030
it's really been a long time.

394
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,870
Alex,

395
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,550
are you guys

396
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,280
classmates?

397
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,790
I transferred to
Rongcheng First High School

398
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,200
in my senior year.

399
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,270
I had to come back to my hometown

400
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,870
(Project Director of Liqin Consultant)
for the college entrance examination,

401
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,570
(Song Jing)
so we three

402
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,600
were classmates for a semester.

403
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,370
Well, Mr. Jiang,

404
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,720
do you have any gossip

405
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,370
about Mr. Song's youth?

406
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,550
It's the senior year.

407
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,480
We spent all day

408
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,510
taking exams.

409
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,600
Time flew by so fast

410
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,780
as we took countless exams.

411
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,720
I remember we haven't seen each other

412
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,150
since we graduated
from high school, right?

413
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,000
That's not true.

414
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,600
In college, I went to your university

415
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,440
to visit...

416
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,020
visit a friend

417
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,200
and met you at the door

418
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,120
of the supermarket,

419
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,020
right?

420
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,020
Yes, I remember.

421
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,440
Liqin Consultant,

422
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,280
welcome and thank you.

423
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,160
We don't have much to offer,

424
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,210
but we have plenty of snacks.

425
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,760
Let me introduce them.

426
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,550
This is Xue Lei, our accountant.

427
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,210
- Hello.
- Zhang Le, the administrator.

428
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,060
- Hello.
- If you need anything, just ask them.

429
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,270
Get some fruit and coffee.

430
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

431
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,910
Well,

432
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,880
our cafeteria has made

433
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,160
some nice food for lunch.

434
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,260
I'll ask Zhang Le to send it to you.

435
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,880
- Okay. Thanks, Mr. Feng.
- Thanks, Mr. Feng.

436
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,720
My pleasure.

437
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,100
Go on with your work. We're leaving.

438
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,070
Okay.

439
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,260
- See you later.
- Okay.

440
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,620
(Meeting Room)

441
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,600
Do you think

442
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,400
(Tang Yang, Jiang Shiyan)
Song Jing knew

443
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,510
it was us

444
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,540
when he took over the case?

445
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,120
Why didn't he

446
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,340
tell us in advance?

447
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,390
Did he

448
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,940
(The consultant team came.)
want to surprise us?

449
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,100
It's more like a shock.

450
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,820
(Do you know who the leader is?)
That's right.

451
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,680
Listen,

452
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,240
Yang and he didn't end up well.

453
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,110
I'm pretty sure

454
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,410
it was his fault,

455
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,680
and he knows

456
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,610
we're close friends,

457
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,880
so I'm sure he has complicated feelings

458
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,780
towards us too.

459
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,310
Well,

460
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,680
do you think

461
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,170
we should tell Yang about him?

462
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,520
Forget it.

463
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,820
I don't think we should tell her.

464
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,600
Otherwise,

465
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,060
it'll remind her of the bad things.

466
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,480
Besides, they're

467
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,580
from two different worlds.

468
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,680
Liqin Consultant is based in Beijing.

469
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,200
He came here

470
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,100
only for a business trip.

471
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,550
When this is over,

472
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,540
he'll go back.

473
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,820
If we tell Yang,

474
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,500
it'll only bring trouble.

475
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,300
(The consultant team came.
Do you know who the leader is?)

476
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,040
This way.

477
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,540
Mr. Song, they've arrived.

478
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,260
What a feast.

479
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,310
I was going to have a salad.

480
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,410
Now I have to eat more.

481
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,450
It looks yummy.

482
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,650
Come on. Have a seat.

483
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,870
Have a seat.

484
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,170
Here, take a seat.

485
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,210
Let me introduce him.

486
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,680
This is Cheng Hui,

487
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,640
one of our co-founders

488
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,740
and the CTO.

489
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,040
Hello.

490
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,470
Well, let's eat.

491
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,360
It's just some

492
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,230
casual food.

493
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,360
- Suit yourself.
- Okay.

494
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,200
Eat more.

495
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,540
- Try this.
- Okay.

496
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,470
(Tang Yang)
(I'm in your office.)

497
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,650
Where are you guys?

498
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,740
You guys eat. I'm going downstairs.

499
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,230
Mr. Jiang, I'll come with you.

500
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,300
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Don't worry,

501
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,170
Forget it. Let's eat.

502
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,100
Eat more. Don't waste food.

503
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,930
Why are you here?

504
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,540
Why am I here?

505
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,200
It's weird. Usually, you'd be

506
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,510
happy and surprised

507
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,780
to see me.

508
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,840
Why do you look

509
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,890
very nervous?

510
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,370
Did you make a mistake?

511
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,200
No.

512
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,840
The consulting team came,

513
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,410
but the leader is...

514
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,580
is Song Jing.

515
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,300
So what?

516
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,250
Are you afraid that he might
give you a hard time?

517
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,400
I don't think

518
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,500
you offended him before.

519
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,340
It's not like that. I'm not afraid. I...

520
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,740
Why are you here?

521
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,350
Cheng Hui told me

522
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,270
you were going to have

523
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,930
sweet and sour ribs
and Sichuan pepper chicken.

524
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,930
I still had some time,

525
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,580
so I came for a free lunch.

526
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,910
Is there a problem?

527
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,980
Of course not.

528
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,640
Let's go. There are many people today.

529
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,610
The cafeteria made lunch.

530
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,960
Let's go.

531
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,500
I think we were taking extra classes
during the summer.

532
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,410
Tang Yang, why are you here?

533
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,030
For the sweet and sore ribs

534
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,980
and the chicken.

535
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,960
Tang?

536
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,130
It... It's been a long time.

537
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,580
Yes. Song Jing, it's been a long time.

538
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,550
Take... Take a seat.

539
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,390
I'll get you a chair.

540
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,880
It's okay. No need.

541
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,100
I can sit here.

542
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,020
I'll sit here.

543
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,960
Then I'll move.

544
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,360
Are you working

545
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,340
in a bank?

546
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,120
Yes, in CBBC,

547
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,960
This is our uniform.

548
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,740
I need to go back to work later.

549
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,110
Yes.

550
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,990
Yang is the director

551
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,440
of CBBC Rongcheng Branch's

552
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,980
Credit Audit Division.

553
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,750
Deputy director.

554
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,820
Yes, deputy director.

555
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,980
The food looks really nice.

556
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,980
Let's eat.

557
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,200
Come on.

558
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,070
Eat more.

559
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,240
Don't worry about me.

560
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,440
Just eat.

561
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,410
Is coffee ready?

562
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,390
Yes.

563
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,120
- Let me take it.
- Be careful.

564
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,960
Okay.

565
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,450
Lanqing told me

566
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,300
she had a meal with you.

567
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,550
Yes, she came

568
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,390
with her mayor friend.

569
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,440
She also introduced

570
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,280
the brewery.

571
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,340
We need to work with different areas

572
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,850
for the Food Map project,

573
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,150
- so I invited them here
- Thanks.

574
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,170
to talk about it.

575
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,480
Thanks.

576
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,920
Well, do you like

577
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,760
the cafeteria's food?

578
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
It's good.

579
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,600
I think I can write in my report

580
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,360
that the most valuable thing about Yixiu

581
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,850
is their chef.

582
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,020
Mr. Song,
you're telling a bad joke again.

583
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,280
Tang.

584
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,910
Wipe it.

585
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,310
What?

586
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,280
Your mouth.

587
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,720
Mouth?

588
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,580
Oh, no need.

589
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,540
My boyfriend will help me.

590
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,930
Right?

591
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,740
Look at you.

592
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,850
He called your nickname from childhood,

593
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,850
and you think you're really a child.

594
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,710
Only the seniors would call me that.

595
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,820
I was surprised.

596
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,960
Cover it.

597
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,540
I'll put the tissue here.

598
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,600
What are you looking at?

599
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,440
Eat your food.

600
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,020
More rice for him.

601
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,100
It's so good.

602
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,840
Shiyan, you were so brave

603
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,880
and smart.

604
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,030
If I hadn't been married,

605
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,840
I would've said I was Yang's boyfriend.

606
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,170
He'd be pissed off.

607
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,880
Have you ever thought that maybe

608
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,160
Yang and I are really...

609
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,070
Best buddies forever.

610
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,990
You're such a good friend.

611
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,040
I've found that you two are closer

612
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,720
than we are.

613
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,480
Hello.

614
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,170
Did you check the email?

615
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,830
Check it and reply to me.

616
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,880
I just don't understand.

617
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,720
- What's wrong
- Okay.

618
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,960
with Song Jing?

619
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,580
(Tang Yang)
(Did we officially announce it)

620
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,030
(to the public?)

621
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,870
Tang!

622
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,930
That's so disgusting.

623
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,850
Yang was so clever,

624
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,360
or he would've found out

625
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,990
she's still single

626
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,400
- and thought
- (I think we just failed.)

627
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,680
she still can't get over him.

628
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,520
Shameless.

629
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,960
The sweet and sour ribs

630
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,800
are so good.

631
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,310
- What do you think?
- Really good.

632
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,650
Wish we could have it every day.

633
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,150
Alex.

634
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,110
This is the aging analysis

635
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,170
of the accounts receivable.

636
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,390
Alex?

637
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,650
Just send me a copy.

638
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,860
(Yu Minjia, Song Jing)

639
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
(I'm back in Rongcheng)

640
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,850
(for a project.)

641
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,650
(Do you have time for a meal?)

642
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,270
(Feng Weiran told me)

643
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,170
(what happened.)

644
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,130
(You're so clever.)

645
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,690
(Well, has Song Jing)

646
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,610
(ever reflected on his mistakes?)

647
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,120
Now he's trying

648
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,550
to be close to you.

649
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,580
What is wrong with him?

650
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,960
He's always like that,

651
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,360
feeling good about himself.

652
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,260
Whatever.

653
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,030
I wish I could be there.

654
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,600
If I were there,

655
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,510
I could've seen it

656
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,690
with my own eyes.

657
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,100
(But I have to say)

658
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,350
(Jiang Shiyan is a good friend)

659
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,690
(in the critical point.)

660
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,840
What did

661
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,450
Feng Weiran tell you?

662
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,980
Well, Feng Weiran

663
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,070
told me

664
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,070
Song Jing

665
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,410
still cared about you,

666
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,920
(and you immediately)

667
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,370
(pretended to be
Jiang Shiyan's girlfriend.)

668
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,960
(Jiang Shiyan was also smart.)

669
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,740
(He responded as your fake boyfriend)

670
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,160
and embarrassed Song Jing

671
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,260
in front of everyone.

672
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,170
Is that right?

673
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,060
It's...

674
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,240
not wrong.

675
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,110
That's right.

676
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,270
Not wrong?

677
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,920
It's the truth.

678
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,070
I think you did a good job.

679
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,300
(Mommy, come here.)

680
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,550
(Okay. I'm coming.)

681
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,440
(Okay. I need to go.)

682
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,280
(My son is going to sleep.)

683
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,590
(Okay?)

684
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,020
Okay. Bye.

685
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:06,260
(MU Plaza)

686
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,520
Ms. Sheng!

687
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,350
Ms. Sheng, I'm your fan.

688
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,190
Thanks.

689
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,240
Hello, Ms. Sheng,

690
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,400
I'm your fan!

691
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,880
You're gorgeous!

692
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,820
So pretty!

693
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,600
(Jiang Shiyan, Feng Weiran, Tang Yang)
(CBBC's coffee)

694
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,690
(is worse than ever.)

695
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,780
(I want to file a complaint
to the administrative department.)

696
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,230
(Moments, Sheng Nina)

697
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,820
(Fish or shrimp?)

698
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,450
(It's a question.)

699
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,310
Yes. Then

700
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,780
give me more details about this part.

701
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,720
Yes, and make sure

702
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,840
that our fresh foods

703
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,360
have long shelf lives.

704
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,510
No expired products.

705
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,580
- Okay.
- That's it.

706
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,550
Peng Si,

707
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,840
do we have any Thai lime sauce

708
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,130
we promoted last time?

709
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,100
Yes. Mr. Cheng, do you want it?

710
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,280
Get some for me.

711
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,980
- Okay.
- Is there any other deciduous food?

712
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,270
Dried fish. The crispy dried fish

713
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,610
is always one of the best sellers.

714
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,740
Okay. I'll take a few packs.

715
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,640
- Peng Si.
- Mr. Jiang.

716
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,700
Do we have more pour-over coffee

717
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,370
that we all liked last time?

718
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,520
I think so.

719
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,440
Mr. Jiang, do you want it?

720
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,260
I'll take a few boxes.

721
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,440
Pack them

722
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,550
and send them

723
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,550
to Ms. Tang in CBBC.

724
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,390
Okay.

725
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,960
Why are you smiling?

726
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,800
Nothing.

727
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:46,500
(Moments, Sheng Nina
Fish or shrimp? It's a question.)

728
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,380
(50 Minutes Ago, Cheng Hui)

729
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,410
I brought a bottle of sauce.

730
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,980
It suits both fish and shrimp well.

731
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,450
Mr. Zhou, do you mean

732
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,200
Jiujiang wants to invest in

733
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,780
Yixiu's Food Map project?

734
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,760
Yes.

735
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,990
Jiu Jiang

736
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,260
has business properties
all over the country.

737
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,170
Yixiu needs to open

738
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,680
offline food stores

739
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,890
for the Food Map,

740
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,360
which matches the resources

741
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,260
of Jiujiang.

742
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,360
We think

743
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,480
we can provide

744
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,820
stores and funds,

745
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,030
and Yixiu

746
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,470
will focus on branding,

747
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,640
product selection,

748
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,740
overall plans for publicity
and implementation.

749
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,840
We can integrate

750
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,890
offline and online resources.

751
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,740
Mr. Feng, are you interested?

752
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,410
I want to ask something.

753
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,470
Which cities

754
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,160
are Jiujiang's business properties

755
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,930
located in?

756
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,960
I can send you

757
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,130
the details,

758
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,680
including the locations, progress,

759
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,930
and the overall layout.

760
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,070
That'd be great.

761
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,600
We check it

762
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
and have a meeting.

763
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,020
- Okay.
- I'll tell you the results later.

764
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,310
Okay.

765
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,690
We don't have to decide on

766
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,980
the form of the investment now.

767
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,340
However, we're considering

768
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,260
setting up a joint venture with Yixiu.

769
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,550
We've got some plans

770
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,450
for this,

771
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,260
I'll make a memo

772
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,360
and send it to you,

773
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,200
okay?

774
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,740
No problem,

775
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,800
but

776
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,930
if it's a joint venture,

777
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,640
our board has to have a meeting

778
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,930
and talk about it.

779
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,440
I understand.

780
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,610
Your investors
in the previous rounds of financing

781
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,820
are also our long-term partners,

782
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,210
so I believe they'll

783
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,690
trust Jiujiang.

784
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,960
I've heard you're working on

785
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,020
the Series C Round.

786
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,200
If we can come up with

787
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,920
a cooperative package

788
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,100
at this point,

789
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,850
I believe it will benefit

790
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,980

they're quite interested in

our proposal,

832
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,550
but the board will vote for

833
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,900
the establishment of the joint venture.

834
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,020
Voted by the board?

It's a good thing.

836
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,210
In that case, Yixiu's investors

00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,210

cooperate with them.

will find out very soon.

00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,020
It will be more trustworthy

841
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,480
to let them talk about it

842
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,460
than doing it ourselves.

843
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,860
Ms. Wei,

844
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,650
this time, our goal...

845
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,290
At least 1.5 billion yuan.

846
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,030
Got it.

847
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,030
Come on.

848
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,350
- Cheers.
- Come on.

849
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,510
Cheers.

850
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,730
Sorry.

851
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,460
It feels so good.

852
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,800
So delicious.

853
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,280
It's good, right?

854
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,390
You know,

855
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,770
actually, I'm not sure

856
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,170
whether I should quit being an actress.

857
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,280
I thought it'd be fun,

858
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,290
but now

859
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,070
it seems to be much more complicated

860
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,500
than I expected.

861
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,860
I used to think

862
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,480
that by being an actress,

863
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,940
I can play different roles

864
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,940
and have different lives.

865
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,900
It must be interesting.

866
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,190
You know, most people

867
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,110
can only have

868
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,250
one life.

869
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,130
But actresses are different.

870
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,940
They can

871
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,650
experience different things.

872
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,900
However, sometimes, being an actress

873
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,690
can be very troublesome.

874
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,320
It seems like

875
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,420
everyone can judge you.

876
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,760
What clothes are you wearing?

877
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,650
Does it look good?

878
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,400
What haircut did you get?

879
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,500
Does it suit you?

880
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,720
Sometimes, I don't know

881
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,900
whether I should listen to them.

882
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,020
Come on. Have a shrimp.

883
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,640
Thanks.

884
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,690
Try the dipping sauce.

885
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,310
- Is it good?
- It's good.

886
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,290
If you change the sauce

887
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,900
to soy sauce and vinegar
in Cantonese style

888
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,130
or boil the shrimp

889
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,430
with beer,

890
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,130
it'll also be delicious.

891
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,900
It's up to you.

892
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,610
Sometimes,

893
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,030
you don't have to be

894
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,290
trapped by those labels.

895
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,580
You can eat whatever you like.

896
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,070
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

897
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,290
Try the food here.

898
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,670
Song Jing,

899
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,130
have you settled in Beijing?

900
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,120
Yes.

901
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,760
Liqin Consultant only has offices

902
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,210
in Beijing and Shanghai.

903
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,950
I remember your husband was in
the School of Economics and Management.

904
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,330
We were in the same grade.

905
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,900
Are you Guan Jingtang

906
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,840
and Ge Hui's

907
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,860
classmate?

908
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,690
And Tang Yang.

909
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,730
She was also their classmate.

910
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,830
Song Jing,

911
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,550
I remember...

912
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,540
Forget it. It's been many years.

913
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,190
I met Tang Yang

914
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,350
at Yixiu Found of Food the other day.

915
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,030
She's working

916
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:16,870
in...

917
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,830
a bank, right?

918
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,590
The deputy director
of CBBC Credit Audit Division.

919
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,630
She's amazing.

920
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,900
She's the youngest deputy director.

921
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,650
She's really impressive.

922
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,760
Is she

923
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,580
married now?

924
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,730
I don't think so. It seems she's been
single for many years.

925
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,800
I've heard her mom is very worried.

926
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,730
She sets up blind dates for her
every month.

927
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,980
Yes. When we had a reunion,

928
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,210
she was complaining

929
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,110
that her mother arranged
several blind dates for her

930
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,190
every day.

931
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,100
She was exhausted.

932
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,800
She's a successful woman.

933
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,190
I don't think she'll like

934
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,030
normal guys.

935
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,000
Isn't she

936
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,670
very close to Jiang Shiyan,

937
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,060
the CEO of Yixiu Found of Food?

938
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,510
A video of them

939
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,460
was once exposed.

940
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,860
Well, they're bros.

941
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,960
Jiang Shiyan

942
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,190
has a girlfriend.

943
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,500
It's that actress

944
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,470
Sheng Nina.

945
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,190
Really?

946
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,770
Of course.

947
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,030
Check out Yixiu's homepage.

948
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,460
Sheng Nina was in trouble,

949
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
but she was still on the homepage

950
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,240
of Yixiu.

951
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,860
What does it mean?

952
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,150
She's Mrs. Jiang.

953
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,170
Of course they didn't remove her.

954
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
- Mr. Chen.
- Thanks, Mr. Chen.

955
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,760
Tang Yang.

956
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,310
Tang Yang,

957
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,240
this is Song Jing.

958
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,770
He just transferred to our class.

959
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,160
Song Jing.

960
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,280
this is our deputy monitor

961
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,120
Tang Yang.

962
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,240
Hello.

963
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,200
Hello.

964
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,080
Tang Yang,

965
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,510
take him to the classroom,

966
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,650
introduce him to everyone.

967
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,500
and arrange a seat for him.

968
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,400
I have a meeting
for the teaching and research group.

969
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,260
- Okay?
- Okay.

970
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,270
Okay, go back to the classroom.

971
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,430
Goodbye, Mr. Chen.

972
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,760
This way.

973
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,000
Is it heavy? I can help you.

974
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,020
It's okay. Don't worry.

975
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,510
Have you gotten your uniform?

976
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,000
You can get it
at the Academic Affairs Office

977
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,420
on the third floor of that building.

978
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,810
I'll only be here for a semester

979
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,430
to attend
the College Entrance Examination.

980
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
Most lessons

981
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,170
will be reviews

982
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,210
and mock exams.

983
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,460
I don't need a uniform.
