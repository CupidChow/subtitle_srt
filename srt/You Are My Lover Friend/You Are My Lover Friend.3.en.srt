Has the topic been removed?

33
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,770
It's done.

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,760

does about traffic?

36
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,350
Why does Mr. Jiang dislike popularity?

37
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,270
Once it's tied to the company,

38
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,100
high traffic would only

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,830
bring controversy.

a double-edged sword.

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,530
The most taboo is self-harm.

47
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,320
This sounds like Mr. Jiang's opinion.

to go out for a stroll

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,460

all over the country.

89
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,080
Secondly,

90
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,280
if I'm at home,

91
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,370

No.

130
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,070
- Why?
- Block me.

131

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,020
- What should we do?
- Let's go.

133
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,730
We can't stay here.

134
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,080
Hurry up and eat. Then let's go.

136

143
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,580
Good for you.

144
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,730
I came here to grab a bite.

145
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,080

They can't set up shop here.

157
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,150
I understand. We'll leave right away.

158
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,400
Let's go eat inside.

159
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,840

168

- Yes, I have to go.
- Look at this.

169
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,560
- Bye.
- Bad timing.

170

- Come on.

182
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,100
You're so annoying.

183
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,070
I'll hit you, really.

184
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,930
Don't be embarrassed.

185
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,980
He'll be embarrassed.

186
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,390
I'm embarrassed.

187
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,530

188
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,870

That's our secret passage from before.

190
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
If we were running late,
we would take that alley.

191
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,070
Of course, I remember.

192
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,850
How many times have we been able

193
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,880
to reach class on time

194
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,680
thanks to this secret passage

195
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,220
before the teacher checked?

196
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
Those fools in the next class

197
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,070
even asked me,

198
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,770
"How strange."

199
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,610
"How come you guys"

200
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,640
"can always make it,"

201
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,730
"but we always"

202
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,980
"get deducted points?"

203
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,250
I explained the reason

204
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,540
to them clearly.

205
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,780
What did you say?

206
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,310
I said, "You know who Yang is?"

207
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,570
"You know her background?"

208
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,440
"We can get away."

209
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,400
What is my background?

210
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,390
You tell me.

211
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,360
You are...

212
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,730
Come, leader, let's eat.

213
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,730
Jiang Shiyan.

214
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,680
Really.

215
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,980
I discovered it.

216
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,610
Sometimes you're not even human.

217
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,480
Jiang Shiyan,

218
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,520
you're always so annoying.

219
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,050
You really live up to your name.

220
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,490
Outstandingly annoying.

221
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,900
Of course. We're buddies.

222
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,700
Birds of a feather flock together.

223
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,970
Upset? Where are you going?

224
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,540
I'm going to check the secret passage.

225
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,180
(Be careful)

226
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,900
These alleys haven't changed at all.

227
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,050
This painting is still here.

228
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,800
(Harvest)
Exactly the same. Didn't change.

229
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,780
(Flowers)
That chili.

230
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,060
I remember right here,

231
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,020
in our second or third year...

232
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,210
The second year.

233
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,660
I bought fried chicken with someone.

234
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,530
When we were about to eat

235
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,770
in this alley,

236
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,300
we encountered a dog.

237
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,730
He ran away in a panic,

238
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,180
and the dog chased after him.

239
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,230
And he ran even faster.

240
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,610
I said, "Don't run!"

241
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,250
"Take the fried chicken!"

242
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,850
"I'll throw a stone at it!"

243
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,450
Just as I gave him the chicken,

244
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,290
what did he do?

245
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,470
He threw it away!

246
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,750
You know what?

247
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,470
You're 1.8 meters tall

248
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,230
with a courage of 1.8 mm.

249
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,820
You also ran away.

250
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,010
I ran because you ran, alright?

251
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,470
I wouldn't have run if you hadn't.

252
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,490
Let the past

253
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,820
be the past.

254
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,170
That dog is probably

255
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,510
in the afterlife now.

256
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,880
But

257
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,990
if I had the chance

258
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,270
to reunite with it...

259
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,400
What would you do?

260
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,510
I wouldn't just run away.

261
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,420
I'd confront it

262
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,300
face to face.

263
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,480
This...

264
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,150
What are you doing?

265
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,180
You said it.

266
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,150
You met it again.

267
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,900
Didn't you just say...

268
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,940
Yang, it's okay.

269
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,630
I'm here to protect you.

270
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,350
Normally, I would be...

271
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,110
I wouldn't be scared.

272
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,560
But Yang, look at it.

273
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,900
Its ears are up.

274
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,300
It's a mad dog!

275
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,610
Not necessarily.

276
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,470
I think its emotions are quite stable.

277
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,650
Yang, you can't joke

278
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,520
with your life.

279
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,450
Really?

280
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,290
Yes.

281
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,420
So what to do? Should we run?

282
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,590
I'll protect you.

283
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,780
You run first.

284
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,660
I'll cover you.

285
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,450
Yang, you're running so fast!

286
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,420
Wait a minute!

287
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,590
Yang! Yang!

288
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,520
You're running so fast.

289
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,010
Didn't you tell me to run?

290
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,210
But I'm not ready yet!

291
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,970
How can I wait for you to get ready?

292
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,810
Wait a minute.

293
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,160
Why is it here?

294
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,090
No, no, no.

295
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,420
It has tactics!

296
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,570
Don't panic.

297
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,370
I have repellent spray.

298
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,970
- I'll spray it!
- Quick! Give it to me!

299
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,020
Wait a minute!

300
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,970
What is this?

301
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,920
Wait, wait!

302
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,590
Take this. I can't find it.

303
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,820
Yang, it's coming!

304
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,850
No, wait!

305
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,700
- Almost!
- No time!

306
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,850
You...

307
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,870
Can you aim at it?

308
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,390
It shouldn't be mad.

309
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,940
The mad ones should be us.

310
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,770
Yang, I think you can

311
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,820
let go of my leg now.

312
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,850
It's gone numb.

313
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,180
Sorry, I...

314
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,780
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

315
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,020
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

316
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,120
Wait a minute.

317
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,760
Tell me.

318
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,890
Is it normal for two girls

319
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,160
to hold hands?

320
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes.

321
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,520
Is it okay for a guy and a girl too?

322
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,360
Yes.

323
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,680
But when we hold hands,

324
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,700
doesn't it seem a bit...

325
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,060
Like...

326
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,510
Like two buddies?

327
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,630
Right?

328
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,970
It is a bit strange.

329
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,810
Right.

330
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,150
So why not let go?

331
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,990
You hooked me!

332
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,290
You grabbed me!

333
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,680
Why don't you let go of my hand?

334
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,970
Why don't you release it?

335
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,110
Just pull your hand out!

336
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,900
I... I...

337
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,170
I...

338
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,230
Can you handle this?

339
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,820
Okay, I'll count to three.

340
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,540
- Okay.
- Three...

341
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,700
Two... One!

342
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,060
You shrank faster
than a sensitive plant.

343
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,630
Are we really buddies?

344
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,410
You know. In the city,

345
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,060
with public services so good,

346
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,150
how could there be a mad dog?

347
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,090
You misjudged,

348
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,880
resulting in my poor lipstick

349
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,720
getting wasted.

350
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,230
And your touch-up cushion.

351
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,970
No, you...

352
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,210
You...

353
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,180
Why do you keep staring at me?

354
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,990
You stepped on my foot.

355
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,150
Transfer me 5,000.

356
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,470
What do you mean?

357
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,350
We're even now.

358
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,990
With your logic in tech,

359
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,170
Huishang can still get

360
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,370
a top evaluation.

361
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,250
Which deity did that?

362
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,280
Let me go pray too.

363
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,820
It relies on my strength.

364
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,700
Good thing it's not about height.

365
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,000
But you're right.

366
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,510
Strength is important.

367
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,150
Otherwise, my company

368
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,470
wouldn't be doing so well.

369
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,610
In broad daylight,

370
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,350
you're so shameless.

371
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,900
In broad daylight,
the truth is revealed.

372
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,010
Listen to me. With your lofty words,

373
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,990
you'll trip while walking.

374
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,280
Do you think I'm you?

375
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,450
Habitually twisting my ankle?

376
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,540
How could that be?

377
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,720
You okay?

378
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,290
Really twisted it?

379
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,470
Don't move. I'll walk.

380
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,630
It hurts! You help me!

381
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,510
What are you doing?

382
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,210
Isn't this a bit

383
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,630
weird for buddies?

384
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,660
No, you...

385
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,610
You dog. Are you even human?

386
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,660
Do you have any humanity?

387
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,280
Listen to your own words.

388
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,130
Is it contradictory?

389
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,150
No, you...

390
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,900
Where are you going?

391
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,630
Jiang Shiyan!

392
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,020
I'm coming!

393
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,390
What does that mean?

394
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,820
A stick for you to lean on.

395
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,870
- What do you mean?
- Lollipop.

396
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,820
Lollipop?

397
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,930
Okay.

398
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,900
Don't get smug.

399
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,660
Just wait and see.

400
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,470
I can do it myself.

401
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,920
I'm fine.

402
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,110
Yang, slow down a bit.

403
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,330
Should I carry you?

404
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,230
No need.

405
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,940
Aren't I a lollipop?

406
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,530
- I was wrong.
- Lollipop.

407
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,210
- I'll carry you.
- It's fine, I...

408
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,110
Put it down.

409
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,510
Wall! Wall!

410
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,520
Enough, enough.

411
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,180
- It's for pain relief.
- It's enough.

412
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,020
That's it. It's flowing.

413
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,400
This is too much.

414
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,630
You're a grown-up.

415
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,590
Still so careless.

416
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,130
You're also a grown-up.

417
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,820
Still scared of a dog.

418
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,330
When it doesn't hurt anymore,

419
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,230
spray that white one.

420
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,330
So, today are we going

421
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,520
to Alley Hotpot, or...?

422
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,820
I'm okay with it. You decide.

423
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,510
I need to take a call.

424
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,700
Help me open it.

425
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,660
Gan Yiming.

426
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,060
Hello, Director Gan.

427
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,510
Good, good.

428
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,940
Well, I'll book a place, okay?

429
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,130
6:40 PM, no problem.

430
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,470
I'll send you the reservation.

431
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,350
Work outing?

432
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,970
Shouldn't it be notified in advance?

433
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,150
Why is it sudden?

434
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,980
We can't go to Alley Hotpot.

435
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,830
Looks like we can't.

436
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,870
No choice.

437
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,460
It's my direct supervisor.

438
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,210
Higher-ups can be daunting.

439
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,320
In the office,

440
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,770
we see each other all the time.

441
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,610
I have no choice.

442
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,570
Alright.

443
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,920
Well.

444
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,390
Aren't you afraid Gan Yiming

445
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,630
get you drunk in revenge?

446
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,320
So,

447
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,070
I wisely booked

448
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,930
this gathering

449
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,350
at Leisure House.

450
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,690
At least it's my turf.

451
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,530
Right?

452
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,630
Starting navigation.

453
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,040
This time the destination

454
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,180
is Leisure House.

455
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,650
A luxury car driver is at your service.

456
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,970
Please fasten your seat belt.

457
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,790
Is the temperature comfortable?

458
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,250
Comfortable.

459
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,830
Cutie, you're quite good-looking.

460
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,890
Is it okay to add me on WeChat?

461
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,560
Sorry, that service isn't available.

462
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,900
I'll give you a bad review now.

463
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,070
Just hope for the best.

464
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,980
(Leisure House)

465
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,840
Miss Tang, hello.

466
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,980
Miss Tang, this way, please.

467
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,260
Ms. Tang, here!

468
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,320
Ms. Tang. Ms. Tang.

469
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,900
- Here.
- Sorry for being late.

470
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,920
Ms. Tang.

471
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,110
- Ms. Tang.
- Ms. Tang.

472
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:43,840
Ziyang.

473
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,690
You sit over there.

474
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,890
I'll sit with Linlang.

475
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,730
Okay.

476
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,870
Ms. Tang, do you dislike me?

477
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,320
You misunderstood.

478
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,160
I was...

479
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,500
Some wind hit me this morning.

480
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,550
Now, I'm a little unwell.

481
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,310
I don't want you to get the cold.

482
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,770
Ms. Tang, take care of your health.

483
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,700
Don't let it worsen.

484
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,730
- Yes.
- Yes.

485
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,690
Of course, I won't

486
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,890
let this cold get worse.

487
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,730
Otherwise,

488
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,970
my new office

489
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,170
would have to become

490
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,310
an archive room again.

491
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,080
If anyone touches Ms. Tang's office,

492
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,350
I'll be the first to disagree.

493
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,080
Thank you, Mr. Gan,

494
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,500
for my office.

495
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,010
Since she's avoiding me,

496
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,660
I'll come to her.

497
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,870
Today,

498
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,320
it's Ms. Tang's

499
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,280
first gathering

500
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,260
in our division.

501
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,450
I propose

502
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,010
that we all raise our glasses.

503
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,530
- Let's toast together.
- Sure.

504
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,830
To celebrate Ms. Tang

505
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
joining our credit audit family.

506
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,410
- Okay?
- Sure, sure.

507
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,320
Welcome, welcome.

508
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,700
Tea isn't appropriate, right?

509
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,880
I...

510
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,970
I just took cold medicine,

511
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,350
so I won't drink alcohol.

512
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,010
It's tea instead of wine,

513
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,600
but my feelings for everyone

514
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,730
remain unchanged.

515
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,630
I'll start.

516
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,560
Tea or wine, it's all from the heart.

517
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,210
I'm also drinking tea, right?

518
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,590
Yes, let's toast to Ms. Tang.

519
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,210
- Come on.
- Welcome, Ms. Tang.

520
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,590
Thank you, thank you.

521
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,390
How are your colleagues?

522
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,170
Pretty good.

523
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,040
But our director especially likes

524
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,450
to pat people's hands when he talks.

525
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,350
Is that for real?

526
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,550
Absolutely, I've seen it several times.

527
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,870
Good, good.

528
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,460
Enough. Take it easy.

529
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,010
Ms. Tang, I'll toast you.

530
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,500
Sorry, I won't drink today.

531
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,220
Waiter.

532
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
Please change my plate.

533
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,220
Sure, coming right up.

534
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,360
Look, so handsome.

535
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,250
You caught a cold.

536
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,890
Better not to eat greasy food.

537
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,220
Eat more vegetables.

538
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,410
This is good. It's very nutritious.

539
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,560
No, Mr. Gan. It's not greasy.

540
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,070
Just eat for yourself. Ignore me.

541
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,080
It's drained of oil.

542
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,840
Alright, you enjoy your meal.

543
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,680
Alright.

544
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,550
Thanks.

545
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,690
You should eat a little too.

546
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,530
Okay.

547
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,630
Come on, I'll toast you.

548
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,170
Ms. Tang, I'll toast you.

549
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,010
Sure.

550
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,810
Thank you.

551
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,030
So handsome.

552
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,200
Ms. Tang.

553
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,080
I'm stuck in the division.

554
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,700
If things go well, I'll climb higher.

555
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,420
If not, I won't.

556
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,010
Director Gan, you're so young.

557
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,450
Where's that coming from?

558
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,150
- Just the truth.
- Here's meat for you.

559
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,110
- I'm not in management.
- Thanks.

560
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,460
For them, qualifications

561
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,220
are better with degrees.

562
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,500
You're in management.

563
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,070
With more qualifications,

564
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,740
you'd be a top candidate.

565
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,940
Of course.

566
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,110
Effort is just one aspect;

567
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,250
the other

568
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,650
is exchanging

569
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,840
your scarce resources

570
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,110
for advantages.

571
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,870
For example,

572
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,320
in circles where...

573
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,450
Do you need your meat cut?

574
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,940
- Yes.
- No, no need.

575
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,690
This lady said yes.

576
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,980
Please help me.

577
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,770
In circles where people

578
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,830
rely on looks for a living,

579
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,080
skills and education

580
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,740
are the scarce resources.

581
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,260
Ms. Tang, Ms. Tang.

582
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,410
Go ahead.

583
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,150
In circles where people rely

584
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,030
on skills and degrees,

585
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,730
beauty and figures

586
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,630
are scarce resources.

587
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,490
Mr. Gan, you're flattering me.

588
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,730
I'm just an ordinary woman,

589
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,590
with nothing to do with beauty.

590
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,600
Is it done cutting?

591
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,360
Is this okay?

592
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,840
Almost.

593
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,740
- Good.
- Go, go, go.

594
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,170
I'll call you later.

595
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,010
Okay.

596
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,180
Where were we?

597
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,150
You're being humble.

598
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,690
With your looks,

599
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,940
forget about the branch,

600
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,700
even if you go to the headquarters,

601
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,650
you'll be in the top ten.

602
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,930
Mr. Gan, if we compare looks at the HQ,

603
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,260
that could be serious.

604
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,120
President Zhou
would definitely criticize us

605
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,870
for neglecting our duties.

606
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,460
As for looks,

607
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,690
everyone is different.

608
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,830
Everyone has their taste.

609
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,030
Coincidentally,

610
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,210
Ms. Tang happens

611
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,740
to fit my taste.

612
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,330
Hello.

613
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,150
Let me take your trash.

614
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,870
What are you doing?

615
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,790
No, what do you mean?

616
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,560
Sorry, I thought it was trash.

617
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,890
I just picked it up.

618
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,970
Sorry, sorry.

619
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,700
- Change the plate again.
- Okay.

620
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,110
You didn't eat much today.

621
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,760
Yeah, I caught a cold.

622
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
I'm not feeling well.

623
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,600
I can't eat.

624
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,810
Coincidentally,

625
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,740
the osmanthus wine here is good.

626
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,180
It's light and smooth.

627
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,840
- No.
- Osmanthus wine.

628
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,160
- No need.
- A jug of wine.

629
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,830
I took medicine. I can't drink.

630
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,420
Have a glass of osmanthus wine,

631
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,320
sweat it out,

632
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,590
and you'll feel better.

633
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,120
How about this?

634
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,890
I really can't drink today.

635
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,360
Next time

636
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,280
I host a dinner,

637
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,890
I'll make it up with wine, okay?

638
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,320
Fine wine and a beauty.

639
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,890
One drink to cure longing.

640
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,730
Is that okay?

641
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,650
One glass. I'll be responsible for that.

642
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,490
No, no, no.

643
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,460
I can't drink.

644
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,080
It's mainly because

645
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,210
my respect for Mr. Gan

646
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,050
is more than this.

647
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,690
Next time, the drinks on me.

648
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,010
I'll start with three glasses.

649
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,040
Is that alright?

650
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,880
Director Gan,

651
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,250
everyone saw Tang Yang

652
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,420
take medicine.

653
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,460
Right, right.

654
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,360
I haven't pressured

655
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,070
Ms. Tang at all.

656
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,660
It's been so long.

657
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,760
A glass of fruit wine

658
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,110
would be okay, right?

659
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,890
Ms. Tang is so evasive.

660
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,180
It seems you're disrespecting me.

661
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,450
Mr. Gan, how could you say that?

662
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,180
I would never disrespect you.

663
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,210
It's really because
I took medicine today.

664
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,120
I can't drink.

665
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,090
It might go wrong.

666
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,410
Ms. Tang, no matter what,

667
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,900
you must drink this today,

668
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,170
or else

669
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,790
it'll be hard for us to wrap up.

670
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,830
Here's the complimentary sweet soup.

671
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,800
What are you doing?

672
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,690
I'm really sorry.

673
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,970
- Are you mad?
- How much is it?

674
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,810
I'll compensate you.

675
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,120
Is it about compensation?

676
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,250
I can't stand you anymore.

677
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,110
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

678
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,840
- Call your manager over.
- Okay.

679
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,640
I'll go get the manager now. Sorry.

680
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,870
Wipe it first. Come on.

681
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,110
Customers are gods.

682
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,900
Have I ever told you that?

683
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,760
Yes.

684
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,740
I did.

685
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,600
I did.

686
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,490
Customers' thoughts

687
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,900
are our beliefs.

688
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,260
Right?

689
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,440
Exactly.

690
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,630
You spilled the sweet soup
on the customer.

691
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,700
What's wrong with apologizing?

692
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,830
Shouldn't you?

693
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,980
Do you still want to work here?

694
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,350
I do.

695
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,030
I've already apologized.

696
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,790
Is that an apology?

697
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,310
Was your attitude sincere?

698
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,390
Sorry.

699
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,550
I'll tell you this.

700
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,220
Don't say more.

701
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,970
Go pack your things

702
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:51,810
and get lost.

703
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,930
Before I go,

704
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,360
can you settle today's wages

705
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,390
for me?

706
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,900
Dream on.

707
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,310
Not a single penny.

708
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,310
I'm really sorry.

709
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,010
To express our apology,

710
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:10,890
we're waiving

711
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,260
today's meal.

712
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,550
And to show our sincerity,

713
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,890
I also prepared

714
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,740
clothes for you,

715
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,630
including pants.

716
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,400
The price and quality

717
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,490
(Leisure House)
should be

718
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,740
similar to what you're wearing.

719
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,600
- This one?
- Yes.

720
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,110
- This one?
- It's the same.

721
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,010
Would you mind

722
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,890
leaving me your home address?

723
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,890
Once we clean

724
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,890
your clothes,

725
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,590
we'll deliver it to you.

726
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,250
If you need anything more,

727
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,090
just let us know.

728
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,210
We'll do our best

729
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,630
to satisfy you.

730
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,220
As for him...

731
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:44,840
I'll disappear.

732
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,700
He'll disappear.

733
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,930
The service here is still

734
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,110
quite thoughtful.

735
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,530
The least we can do.

736
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,210
After all, we made you

737
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,180
feel upset today.

738
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,390
We're truly sorry.

739
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,730
I'm sorry.

740
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:59,870
Sorry, Director Gan.

741
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
It's my fault.

742
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,630
Nothing to do with you.

743
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,390
Take care of yourself.

744
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,390
I'm sorry.

745
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,220
Ms. Tang is so kind,

746
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,350
wiping the waiter's hands.

747
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,120
It's because I realized

748
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,590
that the waiter was you.

749
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,260
How could you tell?

750
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,350
Listen to your nonsense.

751
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,560
Even with that panda mask,

752
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,520
I could still see

753
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,010
Mr. Jiang's

754
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,690
bright eyes.

755
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,760
Your prominent nose

756
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,690
is almost poking out

757
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,730
from the mask.

758
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,030
How could I not recognize you?

759
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,530
I think you should

760
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,890
consider becoming a waiter.

761
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,800
You'd be the front guy

762
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,350
of Leisure House.

763
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,800
Thank you so much.

764
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,640
You're welcome.

765
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,120
Feng Weiran mentioned late-night snacks.

766
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,980
Why aren't you going?

767
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,830
I really want to go,

768
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,010
but I just

769
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,450
told my colleagues

770
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,450
that I'm not feeling well

771
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,590
and going home.

772
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,630
If they see me squatting

773
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
by the road eating kebabs,

774
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,650
I could just change planets.

775
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,500
Resign at once.

776
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,490
Yeah.

777
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,840
You should have stayed there

778
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,260
and gone with them.

779
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,410
Why did you drive me?

780
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,390
I could take a taxi.

781
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,220
It's hard to get a taxi now.

782
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,980
Besides,

783
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,260
your foot hurts, right?

784
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,450
I can still picture you

785
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,900
grilling meat just now.

786
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,030
It almost choked me!

787
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,450
Are you that worried

788
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,730
about me getting bullied?

789
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,660
Is that so?

790
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,440
It's just a little.

791
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,160
I've arrived.

792
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,680
Jiang Shiyan,

793
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
do you have

794
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,460
any other intentions today?

795
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,310
What other intentions?

796
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,590
For example,

797
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,250
have you discussed

798
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,420
with my mom?

799
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,770
Are you here to confirm

800
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,350
if I'm really at a work dinner

801
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,170
or if I'm dating some wild man

802
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,040
who's dancing

803
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,930
on my mom's

804
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,030
landmine?

805
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,210
As a favor,

806
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,970
she'd be your shield

807
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,420
in front of Aunt Yi.

808
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,490
- Get lost.
- Alright.

809
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,070
Bye-bye.

810
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,420
Come on.

811
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,940
Slowly. Tell me if it's not enough.

812
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,700
What are you doing, just dazing here?

813
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,220
You didn't notice Cheng Hui.

814
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,830
Cheng Hui, you really are
a midnight knight.

815
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,660
I can only meet you at this hour.

816
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,550
Why not come sit here?

817
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,310
I'm eating barbecue.

818
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,660
I can't put it over there.

819
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,840
I haven't gone home these days.

820
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,110
I've been living at the office.

821
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,460
If you can't see me,
it means you don't miss me.

822
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,920
Oh, my.

823
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,110
Can you stop saying those things?

824
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,290
Seriously.

825
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
What's with you today?

826
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,630
Why are you putting on this act?

827
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,840
With that mask on,

828
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,890
I can see your face

829
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,660
is about to cramp from smiling.

830
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,740
Let me tell you.

831
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,560
Just now,

832
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,320
it was to play along with your act.

833
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,600
You hear me? Don't get back at me

834
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,070
by making my life hard at work.

835
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,420
Am I that kind of person?

836
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,790
Aren't you?

837
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,460
Here, a big pig trotter for you.

838
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,410
Thanks for your
wonderful performance today.

839
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,590
Thank you.

840
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,830
Something's off.

841
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,630
Something's on your mind.

842
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,810
What's on my mind?

843
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,110
Do I need to explain it?

844
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,320
Usually,

845
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,650
you value your dandy looks.

846
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,550
But today,

847
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,280
you bustled around

848
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,520
and pretended to be a waiter.

849
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,890
If it were usual,

850
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,360
you'd have been

851
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,280
showing off to the bros

852
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,740
and embellishing the story by now.

853
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,150
Now you're silent,

854
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,660
dazing for a long time.

855
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,870
I don't even know I have worries.

856
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,870
You have a crush on Yang.

857
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,030
Cheng Hui.

858
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,080
You can eat anything

859
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,320
but don't talk nonsense.

860
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,730
We are iron-clad friends.

861
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,350
Don't pin that on me.

862
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,350
Let me put it this way, Cheng Hui.

863
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,700
Even if we're together,

864
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,500
there's no way he'd be with Yang.

865
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,280
- Exactly.
- The chances of him

866
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,980
and Yang getting together

867
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,390
are almost zero.

868
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,980
It's not completely zero.

869
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,150
It's still likely.

870
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,920
First,

871
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,250
you knew Yang was back,

872
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,150
and you were ecstatic,

873
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,110
buying an out-of-stock necklace for her,

874
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,120
bustling around

875
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,220
to prepare surprises.

876
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,200
Second,

877
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,450
when Yang had an issue

878
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,500
at the work dinner,

879
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,590
you pretended to be a waiter.

880
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,790
And now,

881
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,790
I've only mentioned it,

882
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,390
and you got worked up.

883
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,870
I've known you for 7 years.

884
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,490
Even if we bicker normally,

885
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,740
you're always my buddy.

886
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,790
I've known Yang for 13 years.

887
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,220
Twice as long.

888
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,420
From middle school to my business,

889
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,530
without Yang,

890
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,390
there wouldn't be

891
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,350
me and Yi Xiu today.

892
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,970
Rounding it off, you guys

893
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,180
and I owe her too much.

894
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,250
Besides,

895
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,680
I know how things went

896
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,590
with her and Song Jing.

897
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,010
Even without Song Jing,

898
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,370
if one of us

899
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,210
starts dating,

900
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,530
our first reaction is to bless,

901
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,510
not to be jealous.
What kind of crush is that?

902
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,550
That's the truth.

903
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,260
Alright, let's not
talk about that anymore.

904
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,450
It could've happened long ago,
but it didn't.

905
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,990
Putting familiarity aside,

906
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,810
it's natural for a guy

907
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,740
to protect a girl.

908
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,040
When we're in trouble,

909
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,510
Yang is the one shielding me.

910
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,030
She's the one protecting me, right?

911
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,150
She'll be my buddy forever.

912
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,010
I don't want to hear

913
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,430
this nonsense from you again.

914
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,960
Fine.

915
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:48,810
Let's eat.

916
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,660
Why did you laugh?

917
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
Don't say that again.

918
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,470
Come on, drink up.

919
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,030
The games have gotten into him.

920
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,600
Aunt, so much again this time?

921
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,760
You gave me a lot last time.

922
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,700
We haven't finished it.

923
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,470
We're family. Why be polite?

924
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,290
You don't know.

925
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,640
Our qi loves the free-range eggs

926
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,040
and potatoes you brought last time.

927
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,370
He usually doesn't eat well.

928
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,410
Alright, next time,

929
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,080
I'll bring more potatoes.

930
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,240
Fine, I won't be polite then.

931
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,110
No need for that.

932
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,950
Homegrown veggies are safe to eat.

933
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,200
The vegetables outside

934
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,640
have pesticides. Not good for kids.

935
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,890
- True.
- Aunt, what brings you here?

936
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,370
- Go inside to sit.
- No need.

937
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,590
They're waiting. I'm leaving.

938
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,820
Wait, Aunt.

939
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,490
Let me tell you some gossip

940
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,110
from dinner last night.

941
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,220
What gossip?

942
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,530
Didn't I go eat with Cheng Hui

943
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,660
and Jiang Shiyan yesterday?

944
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,070
It's that simple?

945
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,210
Really?

946
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,110
Would I lie to you?

947
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,740
Jiang Shiyan got really agitated.

948
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,470
Cheng Hui and Jiang Shiyan were going

949
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,160
back and forth, arguing passionately.

950
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,560
Quite a debate.

951
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,860
Cheng said he has a crush on Tang.

952
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,080
Jiang Shiyan insisted

953
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,260
they were buddies.

954
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,880
So, it turns out,

955
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,070
there's a possibility

956
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,470
for me and Ms. Zhou to become in-laws?

957
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,660
Let's not think about that.

958
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,260
There's no hope for that.

959
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,640
If only it could be like that.

960
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,480
Alright.

961
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,080
They're urging me. I have to go.

962
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,920
Okay, okay.

963
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,930
I won't see you off.

964
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,380
- No need.
- Stay safe.

965
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,360
Oh, my.

966
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,810
So many vegetables.

967
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,380
So healthy and nourishing.

968
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,120
Why don't you learn from Aunt?

969
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,010
You rarely eat greens.

970
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:33,950
It's too hard.

971
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,150
I did eat.

972
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,680
When I asked you to take a bite,

973
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,780
you only took one bite.

974
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,680
If my wife says to only take one bite,

975
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,860
how dare I take a second?

976
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:41,850
You should say this.

977
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,710
- What?
- You say,

978
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,410
"Honey, take three, four, five,
six, seven, or eight bites."

979
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,890
Today Aunt brought lotus root.

980
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,600
We'll have lotus root for dinner.

981
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,070
Eating lotus root isn't bad.

982
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,860
(Beautiful Lotus Dance)

983
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,160
One, two, three.

984
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,510
Cha-cha, one.

985
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,730
You know.

986
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,110
I just went to deliver veggies
to Feng Weiran.

987
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,240
Feng Weiran told me

988
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,030
that strange Cheng Hui

989
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,930
actually suspects that your Tang

990
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,340
and our Jiang Shiyan

991
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,340
have something going on.

992
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,120
How could that be?

993
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,010
Hilarious.

994
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,410
If they had something,

995
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,740
it would've happened long ago.

996
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,430
Those young people are just

997
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,470
talking nonsense after drinking.

998
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,260
Their relationship

999
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,520
is like

1000
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,590
brothers sworn in blood.

1001
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,810
Wow, impressive.

1002
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,120
You know idioms now.

1003
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,490
"Sworn brothers in blood."

1004
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,740
Thanks to you.

1005
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,240
But at that time,

1006
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,300
I did say,

1007
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,040
if something were to happen,

1008
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,160
Ms. Zhou and I

1009
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,810
would become in-laws.

1010
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,110
That would be great.

1011
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,740
I really have thought

1012
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,410
about those two.

1013
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,260
But I also think

1014
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,780
it's unlikely.

1015
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,850
The young people in love

1016
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,720
are tied

1017
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,430
by the red thread of fate.

1018
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,150
What are they tied to?

1019
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,630
It's Guan Yu's steel.

1020
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,490
Their friendship is

1021
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,860
so strong it's almost absurd.

1022
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,590
Yeah, your Jiang

1023
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,340
likes gentle and virtuous ones,

1024
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,240
and our Tang likes

1025
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,910
gentle and virtuous ones too.

1026
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,510
Neither of them fits that description.

1027
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,260
You've put it well.

1028
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,850
The parent-child relationship

1029
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,520
can't be greater than the kids' bond.

1030
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,030
This is the sentence.

1031
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,820
In love and marriage,

1032
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
the parent-child relationship

1033
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,660
shouldn't be greater

1034
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,450
than the intimacy between the kids.

1035
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,450
That's the one.

1036
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,780
Smart and cultured.

1037
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,680
Let me tell you.

1038
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,950
I found a round-faced

1039
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,720
Cancer pilot

1040
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,860
for your Tang

1041
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,120
at the matchmaking corner.

1042
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,810
He's definitely her type.

1043
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,160
Give me his contact info.

1044
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,290
Our Tang needs

1045
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,590
to expand her social circle.

1046
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,560
I want to improve her chances

1047
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,860
of matching.

1048
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,770
If Tang is the first to get a partner,

1049
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,010
half of the credit goes to me.

1050
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,450
Of course.

1051
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,740
If I find someone suitable,

1052
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,780
I'll also let your Jiang know.

1053
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,630
Have some water.

1054
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,470
It's so hot.

1055
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,150
Do you have a partner?

1056
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,290
If not,

1057
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,470
can we partner up?

1058
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,560
Excuse me.

1059
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,910
Is this your first time here?

1060
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,340
This is Ms. Zhou.

1061
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,680
We're regular partners.

1062
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,950
We don't dance with others.

1063
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,260
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine.

1064
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,770
Your love life

1065
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,890
is still blooming, huh?

1066
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,160
What love life?

1067
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,110
Bad ones.

1068
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,970
You know.

1069
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,430
Your Jiang has

1070
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,220
inherited your good looks.

1071
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,430
Staying single isn't easy.

1072
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,150
He calls it "single from birth".

1073
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,260
Let's go practice some more.

1074
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,660
(WeChat; Just now:
2 messages from Tang Yang)

1075
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,410
(Tang)
Is this pomegranate ripe first?

1076
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,430
Why is it so sweet?

1077
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,220
I thought the later ones were sweeter.

1078
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,180
Business trip for two days.

1079
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,510
You have a crush on Yang.

1080
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,180
I have a crush on Yang?

1081
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,290
Impossible.

1082
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,590
So fragrant and tender.

1083
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,160
If this fried chicken

1084
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,200
claims to be second,

1085
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,290
no fried chicken would dare

1086
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,340
call itself first.

1087
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,030
Just a bit greasy.

1088
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,680
Three pounds a time, and unhealthy.

1089
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,290
Give it to me. Don't eat it.

1090
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,130
Greasy, right?

1091
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,850
For your health,

1092
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,970
I'll take on those calories.

1093
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,780
No need. I can gain two pounds.

1094
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,860
Don't eat it. Seriously, don't.

1095
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,070
It really is delicious.

1096
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,510
What does it mean?

1097
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,630
Does it want to eat?

1098
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:28,810
It barked.

1099
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,180
In this situation,

1100
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,550
it would chase you if you ran.

1101
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,780
You're 1.8 meters tall.
No need to be afraid.

1102
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,430
But it has four legs.

1103
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,660
You're smarter.

1104
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,110
But it's fast.

1105
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,080
Shiyan.

1106
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,340
Why did you run?

1107
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,680
Take the fried chicken.

1108
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,150
I'll throw bones to it.
