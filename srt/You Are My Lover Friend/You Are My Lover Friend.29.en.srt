Jiang is back.

29
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,070
We can eat together.

30
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,350
Today?

31
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,580
(Sheng Nina)

32
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,860
(Cheng Hui)
Yes.

33
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,580
Let me check if that steakhouse

34
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,000
has available tables today.

35
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,580
(Leisure House: Closed today)

36
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,420
Just arrived?

37
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,570
You two are here.

38
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,100
What's up?

39
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,980
Why do I still feel weird

40
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,870
seeing you two holding hands?

41
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,330
You'll have to get used to it.

42
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,400
It'll be a lifetime.

43
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,860
Honey,

44
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,280
we're finally witnessing their love.

45
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,580
We've been witnessing

46
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,770
your love for over ten years.

47
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,980
How can you say that about us?

48
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,820
Exactly.

49
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,790
Did you see that?

50
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,690
They used to attack each other.

51
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,580
Now they're teaming up.

52
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,470
Alright, alright.

53
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,180
Why is Sheng Nina treating us

54
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,210
at Leisure House?

55
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,300
How would I know?

56
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,790
Cheng Hui notified me.

57
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,120
He said

58
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,690
Sheng Nina wanted to thank us

59
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,750
for supporting her.

60
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,180
Aren't you the owner here?

61
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,540
- Yes.
- We're eating here.

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,070
Why did you have to know from Cheng?

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,670
It was even closed.

64
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,520
Yes.

65
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,420
Closed?

66
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,630
Yes, the sign says it.

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,260
What's this guy doing?

68
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,220
Let's go ask him.

69
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,100
Why is it closed?

70
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,100
They don't know.

71
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,300
Boss.

72
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,940
What's going on with the chef?

73
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,740
Mr. Cheng said you were having steak.

74
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,620
He invited a professional Western chef

75
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,460
to make it.

76
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,060
So the restaurant is closed?

77
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,580
- How about other customers?
- There aren't any.

78
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,500
Mr. Cheng said
an important guest was coming,

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,220
so Leisure House wouldn't open.

80
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,260
Cheng Hui said it?

81
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,900
Is he here? Has he arrived?

82
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,300
Yes, he's been here for a while.

83
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,740
Come on.

84
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,700
Cheng Hui.

85
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,900
Come out.

86
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,060
What do you mean?

87
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,620
Why did you close my restaurant?

88
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,220
Ms. Sheng is a big star.

89
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,940
The place should be cleared out for her.

90
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,860
How can she eat

91
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,740
with people around?

92
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,980
Isn't she treating us?

93
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,140
Why did she book our place?

94
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,660
Couldn't she book anywhere else?

95
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,940
I thought about booking a steakhouse,

96
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,140
but it was full today,

97
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,820
so I invited a professional Western chef

98
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,100
to cook here.

99
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,500
I...

100
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,100
Come on, sit down.

101
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,900
You're making yourself at home, huh?

102
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,740
No.

103
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,500
Did she find the chef?

104
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,860
I asked Peng Si to find her.

105
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,660
Cheng Hui, when did you become

106
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,500
so considerate?

107
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,620
If you can't book the steakhouse,

108
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,500
let's eat another day.

109
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,820
- It has to be today?
- Yes.

110
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,180
She's going to Beijing tomorrow.

111
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,540
How do you know so much

112
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,380
about her schedule?

113
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,300
She told me.

114
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,860
Ms. Sheng has arrived.

115
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,180
Ms. Sheng.

116
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,540
Long time no see.

117
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,220
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

118
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,300
No, no, no.

119
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,260
Please sit down.

120
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,660
- Sit.
- So beautiful.

121
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,500
Don't stand there.

122
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,460
I came today

123
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,140
to thank everyone in person.

124
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,340
Last time,

125
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,540
thanks to Yixiu's support,

126
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,620
we could

127
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,100
resolve it so soon.

128
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,780
Ms. Sheng, you're too polite.

129
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,460
We're partners.

130
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,500
We have mutual trust and understanding.

131
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,900
What matters is Cheng Hui insisted

132
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,300
that the photo must be fake

133
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,460
and that you've been hacked.

134
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,620
Thanks, Mr. Cheng.

135
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,340
How's the steak?

136
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,340
Is it ready?

137
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,740
Ms. Sheng, don't mind him.

138
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,020
Cheng Hui is

139
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,700
a true foodie.

140
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,540
Or he wouldn't have

141
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,980
been fooled by Jiang Shiyan,

142
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,060
giving up a top position

143
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,740
at a global internet company

144
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,260
to start Yixiu with us.

145
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,620
Really? That's impressive.

146
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,220
Where did you work?

147
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,100
Have you eaten?

148
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,260
Well.

149
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,580
What do you...

150
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,500
What steak do you want?

151
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,300
Then I'll have the tomahawk with you.

152
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,460
- Great.
- Tomahawk.

153
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,300
What about you guys?

154
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,410
- The ribeye.
- Okay.

155
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,820
Ribeye.

156
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,660
And Ms. Sheng?

157
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,180
Anything's fine.

158
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,460
Okay.

159
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,700
Be careful. Be careful.

160
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
Jiang Shiyan,

161
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,260
do you believe it?

162
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,020
He'll have filet mignon.

163
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,630
We'll get one tomahawk,

164
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,420
one filet mignon, and one ribeye.

165
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,020
Because he's called

166
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,340
Filet Steak.

167
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,180
A pun.

168
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,660
Why is he called Filet Steak?

169
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,980
Because his English online name

170
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,180
is just Filet.

171
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,900
His online name is Filet?

172
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,740
No, no, no.

173
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,300
It's not an English online name.

174
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,460
It's his name in their tech circle,

175
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,780
Aphélie.

176
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,220
I never understood

177
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,500
why he had such a name.

178
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,580
What does it mean?

179
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,580
It actually is

180
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,980
aphelion in French.

181
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,780
With a weird online name.

182
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,540
Something like "A Feili".

183
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,380
After KB received his information,

184
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,340
he verified it

185
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,380
and confirmed it was true,

186
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,420
feeling that we were

187
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,420
indeed wronged,

188
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,500
so he made that video
to help us prove it.

189
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,740
Let me peel this.

190
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,900
Ms. Sheng, try this salad.

191
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,460
Okay, thanks.

192
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,860
I looked at the lawyer's draft

193
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,860
for the cooperation with Jiujiang.

194
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,460
I feel like they've given up a lot,

195
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,300
like some right they

196
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,660
- could have.
- After getting married,

197
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,700
- Why does it feel a bit
- every day is kissing.

198
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,790
too compromised?

199
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,860
Kissing everywhere.

200
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,700
Big pervert.

201
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,820
Aphélie.

202
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,860
You're the one who's been helping me

203
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,780
find evidence.

204
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,700
It was you

205
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,740
who asked your friend KB

206
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,340
to help explain the truth.

207
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,060
Right?

208
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,020
You've always helped me.

209
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,340
Why didn't you tell me?

210
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,260
Yes.

211
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,100
It was me.

212
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,620
As for why I didn't tell you,

213
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,740
I can tell you,

214
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,180
but

215
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,860
are you ready to hear it?

216
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,540
Thanks for your steak.

217
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,900
You found the place

218
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,300
and the chef

219
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,700
and even bought the steak.

220
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,540
Why thank me?

221
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,780
You gave me a reason
to eat steak together.

222
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,580
The day I went to your house,

223
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,700
I saw you watching
the live stream of Rover.

224
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,660
You know this?

225
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,140
I've been watching it for many years.

226
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,460
Me too.

227
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,700
I once suffered

228
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,820
from insomnia.

229
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,540
Suddenly,
I came across this live stream.

230
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,100
I found it quite relieving,

231
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,220
watching it flicker,

232
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,060
so lonely

233
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,900
yet so determined,

234
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,380
heading to the solar system's edge.

235
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,780
At that moment, I felt like

236
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,140
many things in this world

237
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,020
were not

238
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,740
that significant.

239
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,380
Every time I watch them,

240
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,860
I can fall asleep peacefully.

241
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,060
On the 17th of next month,

242
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,580
Rover will

243
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,420
send its last message to Earth.

244
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,660
Then its communication system

245
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
will be shut down.

246
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,900
So,

247
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,020
do you want

248
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,860
to say goodbye together?

249
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,100
On the 17th of next month?

250
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,620
I can't control my schedule.

251
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,380
I need to check

252
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,220
to know.

253
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,500
Okay.

254
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,900
Let me know then.

255
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,740
I need to head back.

256
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,420
Sorry, everyone.

257
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
I have to leave.

258
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,260
I have work tomorrow.

259
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,140
Have fun.

260
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,700
Okay, okay.

261
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,540
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

262
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,540
Bye-bye.

263
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,420
What're you watching?

264
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,300
Nothing, just the stars.

265
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,900
So many stars in the universe.

266
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,300
Some stars' orbits

267
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,300
may never intersect.

268
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,060
But between stars,

269
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,980
there's always
a unique gravitational pull.

270
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,820
At some point,

271
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
maybe

272
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,220
the pull of one star

273
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,820
can forever change

274
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,020
the orbit of another.

275
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,780
Here.

276
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,860
Congratulations.

277
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,060
You and Tang Yang are

278
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,420
each other's guardian stars.

279
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:20,060
(Tang Yang, Deputy Director)

280
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,860
Hello?

281
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,900
This is Tang Yang
from the Credit Audit Division.

282
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,460
May I ask
if President Zhou is available?

283
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,620
I'd like to schedule a time

284
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,100
to report something.

285
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,940
Let me check his schedule.

286
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,780
I'll let you know.

287
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,820
Okay, thanks.

288
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,780
Qin.

289
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,780
What brings you here?

290
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,820
Please have a seat.

291
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,180
I came to handle some matters

292
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,420
and remembered you asked me

293
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,260
about Xu Shanshan.

294
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,980
I've looked into it.

295
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,500
She joined CBBC

296
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,380
in early 2019.

297
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,060
In early 2020,

298
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,580
she was transferred to Mengshan Branch.

299
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,380
I heard

300
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,700
her parents live around there,

301
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,900
so she transferred to take care of them.

302
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,220
She resigned early in 2021,

303
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,940
and it was very sudden.

304
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,860
She emailed that it was
for health reasons

305
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,380
and didn't pick up her labor manual.

306
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,380
We called her contact number.

307
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,260
At first, no one answered.

308
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,180
Later the phone was turned off.

309
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,940
No wonder your classmate
couldn't find her.

310
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,380
She joined in 2019.

311
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,900
I must have been in my doctoral program.

312
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,260
When I joined,

313
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,420
she was already gone.

314
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,140
No wonder I hadn't

315
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,100
heard much about her.

316
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,540
So,

317
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,940
she just disappeared?

318
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,900
Did no one look for her?

319
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,180
Had too many people here

320
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,220
to care.

321
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,300
Moreover, she got in

322
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,420
with a heads-up.

323
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,900
As for her transfer,

324
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,740
it wasn't even her request.

325
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,460
The president's office

326
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,540
just told us.

327
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,300
I see.

328
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,980
I'll have my classmate

329
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,540
look for her through other channels.

330
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,980
Thanks, Qin.

331
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,340
I'll treat you to dinner.

332
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,100
Haven't you done that?

333
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,500
I have to go now.

334
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,340
Okay, take care.

335
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,380
- Let me...
- Don't.

336
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,460
Bye-bye.

337
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,660
Hello?

338
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,580
Hello?

339
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,620
President Zhou is unavailable today.

340
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,220
The earliest would be 11 am tomorrow.

341
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,300
Is that okay for you?

342
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,540
Well.

343
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,020
Forget about it.

344
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,460
Don't arrange this. Thanks.

345
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,420
No problem.

346
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,060
Mr. Zhou, we've reviewed

347
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,900
the entire proposal.

348
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,900
I've discussed it with Mr. Jiang.

349
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,380
Today we called you here

350
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,980
to express our gratitude

351
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,580
to the Jiujiang Group

352
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,180
for their favor and kindness.

353
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,140
However,

354
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,260
we may not be able

355
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,300
to collaborate this time.

356
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,220
(Yuangong Sichuan Restaurant)

357
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,620
Here.

358
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,660
Sorry, sorry.

359
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,620
I had a meeting; I'm late.

360
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,940
No worries, you're not late.

361
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,500
Thanks.

362
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,300
What made you think

363
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,220
of coming here?

364
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,820
My colleague recommended it.

365
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,460
It's a small restaurant,

366
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,940
but the food is really good.

367
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,900
Is that so?

368
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,340
What's up today?

369
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,500
You seem so happy.

370
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,460
I have good news.

371
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,340
I got my salary.

372
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,940
Got your salary?

373
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,100
This is my first paycheck,

374
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,140
so I want to treat you.

375
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,060
If you didn't get paid,

376
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,260
you can't treat me to a meal?

377
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,420
Weren't you the one treating me before?

378
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,860
Not really; you've treated me too.

379
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,700
It was just some water and oden.

380
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,980
It doesn't count.

381
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,100
I have a salary now.

382
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,580
I'll treat you more often.

383
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,940
Then I need to discuss this
with your boss

384
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,340
and have him increase your salary.

385
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,700
My appetite is huge.

386
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,220
Ms. Wei.

387
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,900
Okay.

388
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,060
I'll head back now.

389
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,740
Yixiu rejected us?

390
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,260
Yes.

391
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,220
It sounds like there is

392
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,380
no room for negotiation.

393
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,580
Yixiu is indeed attractive.

394
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,020
With their project,

395
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,340
do you know what number

396
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,380
we can get our hands on?

397
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,580
3.5 billion.

398
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,780
When Feng Weiran came to the meeting,

399
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,660
everyone heard

400
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,420
that he agreed

401
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,660
to draft the contract.

402
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,740
When he met with me yesterday,

403
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,100
I sensed something was off,

404
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,180
so I didn't bring anyone.

405
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,060
The location was set at Yixiu.

406
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,860
It means

407
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,780
if we can't work with Yixiu this time,

408
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,660
they won't spread the word around.

409
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,580
If we act quickly,

410
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,380
we can still get that 3.5 billion.

411
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Investors will ask for the contract.

412
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,940
As for the contract,

413
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,700
we can just draft one ourselves.

414
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,020
I didn't misjudge you.

415
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,860
You're a sound fixer.

416
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,100
You flatter me.

417
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,500
There's still a lot

418
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,060
I need to learn from you.

419
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,020
Tang Yang may have

420
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,220
found out about Xu Shanshan.

421
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,420
The batch of loan files she's handling

422
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,860
is the same batch

423
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,500
Xu Shanshan dealt with back then.

424
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,860
She's also contacted HR

425
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,220
to check where

426
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,340
Xu Shanshan went.

427
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
Didn't you say

428
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,260
you had handled Tang Yang?

429
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,460
Tang Yang

430
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,220
got a new boyfriend.

431
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,980
Money can't fix it now.

432
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,140
If money can't work,

433
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,540
let's use other methods

434
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,420
to make her quiet.

435
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,540
There's no need to kill her.

436
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,660
Kill her? Why so extreme?

437
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,420
She's a girl.

438
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,460
Intimidation will do.

439
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,740
But didn't Xu Shanshan die?

440
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,380
That was her choice.

441
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,900
Nothing to do with us.

442
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,500
Zhou Mo.

443
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,540
Bring her out.

444
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,780
Understood.

445
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,180
I'll take care of it.

446
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,340
You trust him that much?

447
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,860
Yes.

448
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,540
I trust him completely.

449
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,060
He handled the previous

450
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,980
aviation loan.

451
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
I didn't show my face.

452
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,340
The current collaboration with Yixiu

453
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,900
was also his suggestion

454
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,500
to forge the contract.

455
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,180
This guy

456
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,580
is ambitious and bold.

457
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
He's already in deep.

458
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,460
He can't get out easily.

459
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,620
As for what happens next,

460
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,900
who knows?

461
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,420
If something goes wrong,

462
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,420
I'll still be clean.

463
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,380
Tang Yang.

464
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,900
What brings you here?

465
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,420
Let's talk.

466
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,980
We have nothing to talk about.

467
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,060
Do you want to talk about Xu Shanshan?

468
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,780
You know Xu Shanshan?

469
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,860
I do.

470
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,900
Then do you know where she is now?

471
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,340
Asking about her now

472
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,700
is meaningless.

473
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,140
Why is that?

474
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,580
Did you discover that batch

475
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,580
of strange loan files?

476
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,060
Just like she did.

477
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,980
Zhou Mo,

478
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,380
what do you know

479
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,780
about this matter?

480
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,700
What did you see in those files?

481
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,860
You know I can't tell you that.

482
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,780
I once

483
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,220
read a spy novel.

484
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,340
There was a plot

485
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,580
that impressed me.

486
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,980
The intelligence agency

487
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,380
has made no progress

488
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,220
in finding the spy.

489
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,580
Their leader said one thing:

490
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,660
Follow the money.

491
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,300
Whoever ends up with the money

492
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,660
is the hidden bad guy.

493
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,780
You can't trace where the loan

494
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,180
ended up, can you?

495
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,820
The companies that took out the loans

496
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,180
turned out to be
nonexistent shell companies,

497
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,100
with no operational entities.

498
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,460
All the forms

499
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,620
were forged.

500
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,900
Investigate these three people:

501
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,300
Yuan Chi,

502
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,100
Sun Zhenxi,

503
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,340
and Liao Shuang.

504
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,100
What do you really know?

505
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,140
Those loans basically

506
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,620
passed through these three.

507
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,580
All three of them have already

508
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,580
resigned from CBBC.

509
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,140
I can't tell you everything right now.

510
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,060
Wait for my call.

511
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,020
I'll tell you where to find me.

512
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,940
I'll tell you the whole truth.

513
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,820
Shiyan.

514
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
What are you doing?

515
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
Ding Shen's team is here

516
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,900
for the final agreement.

517
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,140
We've booked a meeting room
and rooms at the hotel

518
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,740
to battle it out with them for days.

519
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,980
Are you okay? Not feeling well?

520
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,900
I'm fine. Get back to work.

521
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,860
I'm having dinner.

522
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,620
- Bye-bye.
- Alright, get back early.

523
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,180
(Report on abnormal lending issues
at Tangdi Textile and other companies)

524
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,340
(Whistleblower: Tang Yang)

525
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,180
Who is it?

526
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,660
It's me, Tang.

527
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,700
Open the door.

528
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Tang, are you alright?

529
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,780
How did you know I really need you now?

530
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,940
Because you call me Shiyan.

531
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,820
Every time you

532
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,940
stretch out my name,

533
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,420
it means you're unhappy.

534
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,460
Tell me what's wrong.

535
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,060
Didn't we agree

536
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,980
to never bottle things up?

537
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,260
It's not because of you.

538
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,100
Have you decided?

539
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,860
I...

540
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,100
I'm still a bit worried.

541
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,460
Don't worry.

542
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,900
Since this is

543
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,780
the right thing to do,

544
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,900
don't worry.

545
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,140
Even if your future career

546
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,140
might

547
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,300
face troubles or impacts,

548
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,860
it doesn't mean

549
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,180
you shouldn't do it.

550
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,420
Right?

551
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,460
I think so too.

552
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,700
Then send it.

553
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,740
(Send)

554
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,580
(Waiting)

555
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,780
(Email sent)

556
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,740
You shouldn't go to work these days.

557
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,380
I'll stay home with you.

558
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,420
I can't leave you alone at home.

559
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,220
Aren't you

560
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,860
supposed to be having meetings?

561
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Their drafts will

562
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,300
take several days to finalize,

563
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,700
with days and nights

564
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,100
to nitpick every word.

565
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,940
When they're finished,

566
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,780
I'll go back.

567
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,340
I also don't want

568
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,700
to see Feng pecking like a rooster

569
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,020
in the meeting room every day.

570
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,060
Feng Weiran pecks?

571
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,580
He pecks at whoever opposes him.

572
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,860
How about this?

573
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,980
I'll accompany you to the hotel,

574
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,940
so it won't affect your work.

575
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,580
Anyway, I've taken leave.

576
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,660
I can stay everywhere.

577
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,860
Great.

578
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,100
The hotel is safer.

579
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,900
Then

580
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,100
let's head out now.

581
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,340
I'll pack some things.

582
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,940
I know.

583
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,260
I'm telling you now; it isn't

584
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,740
- Jiang Shiyan.
- the final version.

585
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,140
Think it over.

586
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,620
What to think?

587
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,780
I...

588
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,260
I bought you pizza.

589
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,140
Did you go out by yourself?

590
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,900
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

591
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,060
It's not safe for you.

592
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,220
I just ordered takeout.

593
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,340
Just went downstairs.

594
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,500
I didn't go out the main door.

595
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,020
Don't worry.

596
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,860
It's not dangerous.

597
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,340
No, this person is...

598
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,180
Captain Sun.

599
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,420
Hello, Captain Sun.

600
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,260
Go ahead.

601
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,420
(Public Security)

602
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,100
Got it.

603
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,180
Mr. Feng, come out.

604
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,860
Organize them; I'll tell them.

605
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,260
Hey, Feng Weiran.

606
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,100
What's going on?

607
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,580
Jiujiang is now using

608
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,020
our joint venture as a pretext

609
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,100
to forge contracts

610
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,780
and illegally raise funds outside.

611
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,620
Investors are already

612
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,940
calling Ding Shen.

613
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,140
Have the lawyers draft a statement

614
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,300
and report it to the police.

615
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,460
Understood.

616
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,580
Feng Weiran needs you?

617
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,420
What's up?

618
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,100
Go ahead with your work; don't mind me.

619
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,580
It's fine; he can handle it.

620
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,700
I'll stay with you.

621
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,500
Captain Sun, where to go?

622
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,260
To CBBC. Some situations

623
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,300
need to be verified

624
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,220
with the internal team.

625
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,460
Okay.

626
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,940
(Emergency)

627
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,020
(Reception, Credit Review Division)

628
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,860
(Statement)

629
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,700
How did it go?

630
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,460
I've shared everything I know

631
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,700
with the investigation team.

632
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,420
Let Ms. Tang rest
at home for a few days.

633
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,940
It's fine; the bank will tell you

634
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,820
the follow-up.

635
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,340
Thanks, Ms. Lin.

636
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,740
Let's go.

637
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,900
Let's go.

638
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,940
Director Tang, Mr. Jiang.

639
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,300
- Captain Sun.
- We found Wei Changqiu.

640
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,220
She was drugged by Zhou Mo

641
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,140
and locked

642
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,380
in a cold warehouse.

643
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,300
When we found her,

644
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,660
she'd passed out from hypothermia.

645
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,540
She's in the hospital.

646
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,700
Gan Yiming was stopped

647
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,540
at the customs exit.

648
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,540
We've monitored Jiujiang for a while,

649
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,340
but we're still collecting evidence.

650
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,700
This time, CBBC forwarded your email,

651
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,940
so we acted immediately.

652
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,300
But Zhou Mo beat us

653
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,540
to find Wei Changqiu.

654
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,860
He locked her in the cold warehouse?

655
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,100
Was he planning to kill her?

656
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,340
Yes, he rented the warehouse for a year,

657
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,740
paying all the rent
and electricity fees upfront.

658
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,900
The door outside

659
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,020
was welded shut.

660
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,740
If we hadn't used technical means

661
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,780
to pinpoint the area,

662
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,380
he might have left Wei

663
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,260
frozen there.

664
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,620
What about Zhou Mo?

665
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,660
By the time we arrived, he had left.

666
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,780
We're currently on a manhunt for him.

667
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,780
I'll head back.

668
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,820
If you have any news,

669
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,700
tell me at once.

670
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,540
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Captain Sun.

671
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,180
Oh, my.

672
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,300
Zhou Mo...

673
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,820
It's Zhou Mo.

674
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,500
(Come to Lotus Cemetery.)
A location.

675
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:07,100
(Xu Shanshan)

676
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,020
(Xu Shanshan)

677
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,020
Captain Sun.

678
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,140
Can I talk to him?

679
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,020
Sure.

680
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,900
(Xu Shanshan)

681
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,180
You're really lucky.

682
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,940
No matter when,

683
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,780
someone always puts you first,

684
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,420
standing firmly by your side.

685
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,780
Is Xu Shanshan your girlfriend?

686
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,740
I don't know

687
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,820
if she'd still acknowledge

688
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,020
that I'm her boyfriend.

689
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,180
Over a year ago,

690
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,180
she discovered

691
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,060
the anomalies in the loan files.

692
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,620
She knew the president was my uncle,

693
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,460
so she

694
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
was hesitant

695
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,500
about whether to tell me.

696
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,060
Just then,

697
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,540
my uncle transferred her

698
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,100
to a remote branch
to stop us from dating.

699
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,780
At that time,

700
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,740
I was busy

701
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,220
with an overseas acquisition case

702
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,860
that I thought mattered.

703
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,860
When she was

704
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,020
the most helpless in pain,

705
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,180
I focused on my work

706
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,980
and ignored her.

707
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,540
By the time I returned to Rongcheng,

708
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,420
I found she had disappeared.

709
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,500
I had a big fight with my uncle

710
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,220
and searched everywhere.

711
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,740
I finally found her hometown address,

712
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,420
but when I rushed over,

713
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,580
she had committed suicide.

714
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,020
Her suicide shouldn't just be because

715
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,860
of her transfer.

716
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,500
I've always wanted

717
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
to know what happened.

718
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,580
I found

719
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,060
an old phone she left behind.

720
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,900
There was

721
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,300
a WeChat message she never sent.

722
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,340
It was written to me.

723
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,060
In it, she said

724
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,060
she discovered
the anomalies in the loans,

725
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,300
but she was alone in Rongcheng,

726
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,700
not knowing what to do.

727
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,820
But she still didn't say

728
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,780
what had happened to her.

729
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,980
Following that message,

730
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,820
I tracked down

731
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,620
three individuals involved:

732
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,820
Yuan Chi, Sun Zhenxi, and Liao Shuang.

733
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,860
But by then, they were no longer
working at CBBC.

734
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,060
They had moved to companies
under Jiujiang.

735
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,100
That's why you went to Jiujiang.

736
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,660
Once I entered Jiujiang, I realized

737
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,180
Jiujiang Investment

738
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,460
was merely a scam

739
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,300
for Wei Changqiu to raise funds.

740
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,940
But I still didn't know

741
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,220
what she did to Shanshan.

742
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,140
Until I put you

743
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,140
in her sights.

744
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,700
She planned to do to you

745
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,780
what she had done

746
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,700
to Shanshan.

747
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,380
When you found evidence

748
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,500
against Wei Changqiu,

749
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,860
you should've called the police.

750
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,460
Wei Changqiu learned from Gan Yiming

751
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,540
that Shanshan had begun

752
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,900
to suspect the loans,

753
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,900
so she had someone

754
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,660
take her away

755
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,380
and assault her.

756
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,020
(Xu Shanshan)

757
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,180
They took photos

758
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,340
and videos

759
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,460
to silence her.

760
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,060
Since then, I've been thinking,

761
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,180
during her last moments,

762
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,100
how helpless and desperate

763
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,940
Shanshan

764
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,300
must have felt.

765
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,420
At that time,

766
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,380
if I had reported it,

767
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,300
this financial crime would've had

768
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,420
a lengthy trial period.

769
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,740
Wei Changqiu has plenty of money.

770
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,460
She could hire the best lawyers

771
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,740
to slowly build her defense.

772
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,100
I can't wait.

773
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,260
I can't risk it.

774
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,140
I want her to experience

775
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,940
the feeling of waiting to die

776
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,740
in despair and helplessness.

777
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,780
I want her

778
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,180
to pay back with her life.

779
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,620
But you

780
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,580
committed crimes too.

781
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,940
That's what I deserve.

782
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,660
Shanshan is my girlfriend.

783
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,820
I didn't take care of her.

784
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,140
I can't continue living well

785
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,500
on my own anymore.

786
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,020
(Xu Shanshan's Tomb, File Bag)

787
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
(Xu Shanshan's Tomb, File Bag)

788
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,900
(Xu Shanshan's Tomb)

789
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,140
You share the same birthday as Shanshan,

790
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,620
but she wasn't as lucky as you.

791
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,140
From her family background

792
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,580
to the people she encountered,

793
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,340
she had it worse.

794
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,680
(Gan Yiming from CBBC, Wei Changqiu)

795
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,720
(from Jiujiang Group,)

796
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,070
(and former CBBC employees)

797
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,900
(have been criminally detained.)

798
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,260
Shiyan, don't worry.

799
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,380
As long as I have a bowl of rice,

800
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,900
you'll always have a bowl to wash.

801
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,500
Thank you so much.

802
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,300
Come on, let's drink to that.

803
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,100
We'll always be good buddies.

804
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,980
No backing out.

805
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,980
Yang, what's wrong?

806
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,020
Are you okay?

807
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,020
Give me some time.

808
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,420
I need a break.

809
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,340
How?

810
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,860
