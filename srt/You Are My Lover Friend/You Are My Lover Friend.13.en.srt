27
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,360
We've reviewed the proposals

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,300
from Jiujiang and CBBC.

29
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,350
Do you have any additional comments?

30
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,210
Nangang's aviation loan

31
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,570
is a new project

32
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,100
for us.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,720
We can bypass the credit check,

34
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,560
audit it internally,

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,090
and offer a loan

36
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,010
3 to 5 times more

37
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,350
than CBBC's under the same

38
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,150
application conditions.

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,530
Jiujiang does have some autonomy

40
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,230
in loan amounts and approvals.

41
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,200
But the minimum period

42
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,020
for the aviation loan is five years.

43
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,050
A low bad debt rate and stability

44
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,950
are more important.

45
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,810
In these two aspects,

46
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,430
CBBC has unmatched advantages.

47
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,670
Thank you, Mr. Zhou, Ms. Tang.

48
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,430
We'll discuss it and tell you

49
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,480
the results.

50
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,160
Let's end

51
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,250
the meeting here.

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,320
Alright.

53
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,580
- Ms. Tang and I
- Okay.

54
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,180
seem to be fated.

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,020
I don't believe in fate.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,900
Do you only believe in reason,

57
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:55,970
not emotion?

58
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,830
Emotion depends on the person.

59
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,740
With some people,

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,340
it's unnecessary.

61
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,440
Let's stay in touch.

62
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,180
- Stay in touch.
- Thank you.

63
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,900
- Stay in touch.
- Sure.

64
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,900
Alright, it's on.

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,110
- All set.
- Jiang is really something.

66
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,130
Tang changed it himself.

67
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,200
Didn't turn off the valve,

68
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,740
and water sprayed all over the kitchen.

69
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:26,970
I had to clean it up

70
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,020
for ages.

71
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,160
Actually,

72
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,450
changing the water filter

73
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,290
is very simple.

74
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,150
But it needs to be done every 6 months.

75
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,810
No worries. I've already set

76
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,650
a reminder.

77
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,600
Thank you, Uncle.

78
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,920
Next time it needs it,

79
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,830
I'll come over again.

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,880
It's no trouble.

81
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,480
Come on.

82
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,550
- Sit.
- Have some fruit.

83
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,340
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

84
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,180
Ms. Zhou.

85
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,280
Dad.

86
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,690
Am I lost?

87
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,830
This is my home, right?

88
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,440
We have a guest over.

89
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,400
Come on. Sit, sit.

90
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,690
Why are you here?

91
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,720
Why can't I come?

92
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,560
What's going on?

93
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,640
Why did you tell us?

94
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,900
We've already finished dinner.

95
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,340
I had a meeting nearby.

96
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,200
I thought since it was close to home,

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,300
I'd come over for a bite.

98
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,730
Since you three

99
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,760
have finished eating,

100
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,600
I guess I can leave.

101
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,510
Alright, alright.

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,480
Okay, okay.

103
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,600
Have some fruit.

104
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,460
There's soup. I'll heat it up for you.

105
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,950
- Come on.
- Let me help.

106
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,160
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

107
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,010
Alright, alright.

108
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,010
Sit, sit, sit.

109
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,660
Why is he here?

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,660
He came to fix our water filter.

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,900
Thank you, Master Jiang.

112
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,150
Here, have some fruit.

113
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,270
Pay me fifty.

114
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,480
Come on.

115
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,340
Have some more corn.

116
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,420
Work has drained my soul.

117
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,760
One sip of this hot soup,

118
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,980
and I feel revived.

119
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,980
Don't just drink the soup.

120
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,580
You need to eat some dishes too.

121
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,020
Take your time. Don't choke.

122
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,090
Come on.

123
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,100
Sit down.

124
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:56,970
Ms. Zhou,

125
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,130
how are we spending

126
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,190
the New Year this year?

127
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,250
How?

128
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,810
The same as always.

129
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,310
We'll do it with her aunt's family.

130
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,510
I've heard

131
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,170
that New Year vacation trips

132
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,220
are quite trendy lately.

133
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,660
It's

134
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,900
a few families together

135
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,070
going to a tropical

136
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,570
beach island.

137
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,410
The weather

138
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,610
will be cozy.

139
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,050
Right. I have a colleague named Qin Yue.

140
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,170
She took a few families

141
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,810
to Sanya for a holiday.

142
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,880
Yes, we could go together,
just the two families.

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,050
We could hire a tour guide.

144
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,890
Right?

145
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,080
Can I spend

146
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,050
the whole holiday

147
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,960
sleeping in the hotel?

148
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,800
Of course.

149
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,340
We're okay with that,

150
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,570
but her aunt can't fly.

151
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,710
She's never taken a plane.

152
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,730
It's the New Year, we can't just

153
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,870
leave her behind, can we?

154
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,420
If she doesn't want to fly,

155
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,830
what about a cruise?

156
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,250
Cruises seem pretty nice, too.

157
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,170
On the cruise,

158
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,010
no need to move.

159
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,900
Just enjoy good food, beautiful views,

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,850
and evening shows.

161
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,970
I heard the shows are great.

162
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,880
Well, I've seen it in movies many times.

163
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,760
It's really nice.

164
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,850
So can we have barbeque

165
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,690
on the deck

166
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,970
while enjoying the sea breeze?

167
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:00,810
Of course.

168
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,440
Jiang, don't mention it.

169
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,810
You forgot that year?

170
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,520
Your mom and I tried something new

171
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,050
and joined a cruise tour.

172
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,890
In the end,

173
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,400
both of us got vertigo.

174
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,960
We felt dizzy all the time,

175
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,420
lying in the cabin, vomiting,

176
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,690
and couldn't go out.

177
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,780
No, we can't do it.

178
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,010
Right.

179
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,020
Then I'll think about it.

180
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,840
Why did you suddenly decide

181
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,830
to come over today?

182
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,870
I came to fix the water filter.

183
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,310
Seriously?

184
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,270
Yixiu is going

185
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,580
to promote the co-branded sauce

186
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,390
with Zhilan Snacks.

187
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,390
The first batch of taste tests is out,

188
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,650
so I thought I'd bring

189
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,830
two boxes for Ms. Zhou to try

190
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,420
to get some feedback.

191
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,520
Who would've thought

192
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,390
Zhilan Snacks would grow like this?

193
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,640
I went there the other day.

194
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,880
It was packed with customers.

195
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,190
No time to clean the tables.

196
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,950
It's all thanks to you

197
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,870
for granting her the loan

198
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,630
that helped her get started.

199
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,200
It's also because

200
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
of your short promotional video.

201
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,050
It made Zhilan Snacks

202
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,420
an instant internet hit.

203
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,150
So, in a way,

204
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,830
Zhilan Snacks is a project

205
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,510
we both contributed to.

206
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,420
You're really thick-skinned.

207
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,200
Zhilan didn't even say anything.

208
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,830
Why is it our project now?

209
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,010
Let me tell you.

210
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
We formed a joint venture

211
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,540
with Zhang Zhilan.

212
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,730
We're going to expand Zhilan Snacks.

213
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,020
I've ordered the production line.

214
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,480
Now,

215
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,070
it's really ours, right?

216
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,840
It's still Yixiu's.

217
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,220
What does it have to do with me?

218
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,680
By the way,

219
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,920
from what you just said,

220
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,440
you want to travel for the New Year?

221
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,830
Not going to your grandfather's?

222
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,710
Why are you smiling?

223
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,010
It's nothing. Go on upstairs.

224
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:51,850
It's cold outside.

225
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,100
I ate too much just now.

226
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Now my stomach feels
a little uncomfortable.

227
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,150
I want to take a walk to digest.

228
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,960
I thought you came to see me off.

229
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,800
As it turns out,

230
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,660
you dragged me down for your walk.

231
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,870
No difference.

232
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,680
True.

233
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,580
In view of Zhang Zhilan's case,

234
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,270
which balances

235
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,420
compliance requirements,

236
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,050
humanitarian care,

237
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,150
and positive public opinion,

238
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,900
we hereby award Tang Yang
from the Credit Audit Division

239
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,630
a commendation from the head office.

240
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,090
Congratulations.

241
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,130
I just lost

242
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,350
an aviation loan case.

243
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,920
I'm unworthy

244
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,990
of this commendation.

245
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,020
Each case is separate.

246
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,630
I reviewed that case.

247
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,450
We couldn't give them what Jiujiang

248
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,300
was offering.

249
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,020
Even if we secured it,

250
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,420
it might not have been good.

251
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,330
Come on.

252
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,220
(Happy New Year)

253
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,250
Thank you, Mr. Zhou,

254
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,820
for your guidance and encouragement.

255
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,110
Continue to work hard.

256
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,270
Well done, Tang Yang.

257
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,420
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

258
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,560
She lost the case

259
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,680
but still got a commendation?

260
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,730
Director Tang must have

261
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,570
strong connections.

262
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,440
That's right.

263
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,800
Anyone else would've been

264
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,780
harshly criticized.

265
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,010
Ms. Qin gave her

266
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,970
a cooked duck,

267
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,250
but she still managed to lose it.

268
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,660
Her reputation is too exaggerated.

269
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
From what you're saying,

270
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,040
her doctorate and being

271
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,800
CBBC's youngest deputy director

272
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,150
aren't all that impressive.

273
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,490
I'm just saying

274
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,510
someone is backing her.

275
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,880
I feel like Mr. Zhou
is quite protective of her.

276
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,730
What do you think?

277
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,110
Could it be...

278
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,820
Do you remember?

279
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,850
During the last dinner at Leisure House,

280
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,410
Director Gan said Director Tang's beauty

281
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,250
is a resource.

282
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,170
Now, that comment

283
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,150
seems to mean something.

284
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,470
What does it mean?

285
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,920
Why don't you help me analyze it?

286
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,990
I'll learn from you.

287
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,230
Director Tang, I'll get back to work.

288
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,330
The hottest item

289
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,520
(Yixiu Found of Food)
is our

290
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,250
group package with Qingshui Bay Hotel

291
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,800
from the Marketing Department.

292
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,730
All 200 sets

293
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,420
were sold out within an hour.

294
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,610
Other hotels saw this

295
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,610
and even contacted us

296
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,990
for similar products.

297
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,130
Is this the group package

298
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,210
from last time?

299
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,890
Yes, it's for New Year's.

300
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,850
It includes two tables

301
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,350
for a high-end dinner for 20 people,

302
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,130
ten hotel rooms for one night,

303
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,510
and breakfast the next morning.

304
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,520
The hotel facilities include
a mahjong room,

305
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,920
sauna, game room,

306
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,300
swimming pool, and gym.

307
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,490
There's an option for one or two nights,

308
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,880
with access to hot springs.

309
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,280
We were just trying it out,

310
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,970
helping the hotel with a complete plan.

311
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,780
We didn't expect it to be so popular.

312
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,490
A big family can
have their New Year's Eve dinner,

313
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,210
stay at the hotel overnight,

314
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,370
watch the Spring Festival Gala,
play some mahjong,

315
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,990
and even soak in the hot springs.

316
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,800
The elderly and kids
won't get too tired.

317
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,610
It's much more convenient than going

318
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,610
to a restaurant

319
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,940
and sending the elders back home.

320
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,750
200 packages were sold out?

321
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,490
Yes. The hotel has

322
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,850
fewer than 500 rooms.

323
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,680
They're fully booked
for both New Year's Eve

324
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,540
and the first day.

325
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,700
They were thrilled.

326
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,020
Get me a package.

327
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,820
Mr. Jiang, you want to go?

328
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,020
I'll upgrade it to a suite.

329
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,370
I'll take my family.

330
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,210
Sure.

331
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,180
Aviation loans are

332
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,990
usually made with banks.

333
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,110
Securing it this time

334
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,660
is really a big achievement.

335
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,170
Nangang chose between Jiujiang

336
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,330
and CBBC.

337
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,700
The person in charge at CBBC

338
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,470
is my junior, Tang Yang.

339
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,540
Tang Yang?

340
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,780
The deputy director?

341
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:29,970
Yes.

342
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,020
She's quite sensible.

343
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,760
Mom.

344
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,160
Lately, it's really popular to celebrate

345
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,000
New Year at a hotel.

346
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,750
Two big tables for dinner

347
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,390
and several family suites.

348
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,330
Mahjong and hot springs are available.

349
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,270
You can relax
without having to clean up.

350
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,900
Come on.

351
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,060
It's the New Year, okay?

352
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,130
Every hotel

353
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,420
is super expensive.

354
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,470
I won't let myself be ripped off.

355
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,570
Look at this.

356
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,630
Qingshui Bay

357
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,270
has this group coupon.

358
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,920
(Qingshui Bay)
We helped them sell.

359
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,020
The hotel gifted me one.

360
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,820
It'd be a waste if we didn't go.

361
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,810
Son.

362
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,470
You're a boss now.

363
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,750
You can't always think
just about yourself.

364
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,060
Don't you have employees?

365
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,880
Wouldn't this be a great benefit

366
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,270
for your staff?

367
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,060
Fine, fine. I'll use this coupon

368
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,160
as a prize for the annual

369
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
company raffle, okay?

370
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,090
Exactly.

371
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,540
(Fortune)

372
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,020
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

373
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,660
(Family Joy)
Good.

374
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,540
Going out?

375
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,820
To buy some goods.

376
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,330
Jiang Shiyan.

377
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,210
Why has this coupon

378
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,780
been sent home again?

379
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,590
Oh, this coupon.

380
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,250
I raffled it off

381
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,150
at the annual meeting.

382
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,050
A colleague from out of town got it.

383
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,060
He has to go home.

384
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,650
So, he sold it at a low price

385
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,630
in the company chat,

386
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,180
and I snatched it back.

387
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,900
What kind of thing is this?

388
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,680
You gave it away

389
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,420
and then spent money to buy it back?

390
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,870
How about I give it away again?

391
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,120
No need.

392
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,110
Since it's back,

393
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,230
let's just use it ourselves.

394
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,920
You've already paid for it.

395
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,900
Don't let it go to waste.

396
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,120
Alright then.

397
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,800
But you need to tell

398
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,510
your grandpa and uncle

399
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,160
that no dinner

400
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
at home this year.

401
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,060
No need to cook.

402
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,060
We'll try celebrating the New Year's

403
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,150
at the hotel.

404
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,400
Playing mahjong, soaking in hot springs,

405
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,270
and having dinner.

406
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,420
But there's one problem.

407
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,540
It says here that the package includes

408
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,560
two tables for dinner

409
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,940
and ten rooms.

410
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,770
For you, me, and your grandpa,

411
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,610
that's three rooms.

412
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,180
Three rooms for your uncle's family.

413
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,750
That only takes up six rooms.

414
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,330
What do we do with the other four?

415
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,180
They'll be wasted.

416
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,290
Really?

417
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,400
Let me see.

418
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,940
Mom, have an orange.

419
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,230
You're right.

420
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,330
How about this?

421
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,020
Do you have any close friends

422
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,520
that we're close with?

423
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,640
Who wouldn't feel awkward

424
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,390
joining us
for the New Year's Eve dinner?

425
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,050
The problem is the number

426
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,940
of rooms.

427
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,660
It's just four rooms.

428
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,630
Four rooms.

429
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,920
Feng Weiran

430
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,540
and Jiang Yanan are the most suitable.

431
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,090
No, no, no.

432
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,820
They aren't suitable.

433
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,420
Why not?

434
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,800
Aren't you

435
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,180
and Jiang Yanan cousins?

436
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,800
We're family,

437
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,060
very familiar with each other.

438
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,600
Plus, you started

439
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,610
a company together,

440
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,780
so having dinner together

441
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,020
is perfect.

442
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,060
Mom, look.

443
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,490
Jiang Yanan's family alone

444
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,660
has over ten people.

445
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,720
Feng Weiran has his parents,

446
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,900
his uncle and aunt.

447
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,270
Not enough rooms.

448
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,630
Then buy another set.

449
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,420
The hotel is fully booked.
No more rooms.

450
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,590
What should we do then?

451
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,990
Why don't you consider

452
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,630
your usual dance partner, Ms. Zhou?

453
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,590
Her family structure is simple.

454
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,270
I thought about it.

455
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,630
But four rooms would be too many.

456
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,470
Doesn't she have an aunt?

457
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,610
Yes, yes, yes.

458
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,450
Right.

459
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,510
Let me ask her.

460
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,630
See you next class.

461
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,040
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

462
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,880
Ms. Zhou.

463
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,350
Have you thought about my idea?

464
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,830
- Jiang.
- Ms. Zhou.

465
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,920
Goodbye, see you next class.

466
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,760
Goodbye, goodbye.

467
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,410
Jiang is being considerate of you.

468
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,390
See you tomorrow.

469
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,050
It'd feel awkward

470
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,350
if we went.

471
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,880
Jiang Shiyan booked
a New Year's package.

472
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,090
Two tables for dinner,

473
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,390
ten rooms.

474
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,110
My dad and I,

475
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,350
my brothers,

476
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,530
and all the kids together

477
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,470
only take up six rooms.

478
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,150
Who can use the remaining four?

479
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,680
Those are for you and your big sister.

480
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,520
Well...

481
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,880
Tell me.

482
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,250
If Tang had booked

483
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,590
such a package and had

484
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,590
four extra rooms,
who would you think of?

485
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,450
Of course, it'd be me.

486
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,230
That's true.

487
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,760
We're family.

488
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,270
So, it's settled.

489
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,480
Alright.

490
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:40,930
Thank you.

491
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,700
(Yixiu; Auspicious;
Happy New Year; Lucky)

492
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,550
Jiang Shiyan.

493
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,040
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

494
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,730
If nothing else, I need to leave.

495
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,150
Gotta visit Yanan's parents.

496
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,120
Alright.

497
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,210
Everything's arranged.

498
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,700
Cheng Hui said he'd be here
during the holiday.

499
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,940
What are you busy with over here?

500
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,390
Working on a proposal.

501
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,870
Can't you finish it after the New Year?

502
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,550
It won't make it in time.

503
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,920
What's going on?

504
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,500
Are we making a big change?

505
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,730
Why don't I know?

506
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,900
Don't worry about this.

507
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,840
Since when is there something

508
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,030
I shouldn't worry about?

509
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,890
Alright, carry on.

510
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,730
I'm leaving.

511
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,250
Remember to prepare a gift
for your godson.

512
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,090
Got it.

513
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,280
No more Lego though.

514
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,180
Our home is full of it.

515
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:57,420
(Tang Yang & Jiang Shiyan
Qingshui Bay Protocol and Details)

516
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,180
(6. Necessary travel gear and medicine.
7. Souvenirs.)

517
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,340
(Tang Yang; Deputy Director)

518
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,790
Hey, Jiang Shiyan.

519
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,660
How will your aunt get there?

520
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,250
I was thinking
I'd drop my parents off first

521
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,890
and come back to pick them up.

522
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,040
They didn't like it

523
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,460
and insisted on taking a taxi.

524
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,560
That is too far.

525
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,660
Don't let them take a taxi.

526
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,560
You can't make two trips either.

527
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,730
Our company's business car
happens to be available.

528
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,560
The driver can
drop it off at your place.

529
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,930
You can drive it tomorrow.

530
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,770
It has seven seats.

531
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,790
Perfect for your both families.

532
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,320
Great.

533
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
I also prepared some

534
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,290
multi-functional pots

535
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,730
and kettles from the company event.

536
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,840
If you get hungry at night,

537
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,080
you can make some sweet soup

538
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,980
or toast.

539
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,160
Sounds good.

540
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,830
Is your aunt's child 16 years old?

541
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,200
Yes.

542
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,450
That's her younger daughter, my cousin.

543
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,930
I have another cousin,

544
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,800
but he's abroad

545
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,900
and won't be coming back.

546
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,830
Is the old lady your uncle's mom?

547
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,360
A cashmere scarf for your cousin,

548
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,560
fishing rods for Uncle Tang

549
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,490
and your uncle,

550
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,600
and massagers for the moms

551
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,730
and the elderly lady.

552
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,690
I'll send you

553
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,760
the gift list later.

554
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,150
Check if I missed anything.

555
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,070
Are you being

556
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,260
too formal?

557
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,260
It took you the whole morning.

558
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,080
We're not strangers.

559
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,110
It's not necessary.

560
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,560
It's family. It's the New Year.

561
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,590
We can't lose our manners.

562
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,980
Yours is almost out.

563
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,150
Getting ready for a war?

564
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,700
So simple and plain.

565
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,830
Mom, what will you wear for New Year's?

566
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,120
Me?

567
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,870
I'll just wear this,

568
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,660
with a down jacket over it.

569
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,310
How about I help you
pick out a few outfits?

570
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,900
No need.

571
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,890
I see Ms. Zhou every day,

572
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,280
and Tang is family.

573
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,740
There's no need to make a big fuss.

574
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,010
Are you suggesting

575
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,630
I should wear a cheongsam?

576
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,350
But Tang's aunt's family
will be there too.

577
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,940
You could maybe

578
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,410
enhance your beauty

579
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,260
to show some respect.

580
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,150
Do I need to enhance my beauty?

581
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,740
Even though I'm older,

582
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,110
I still have some charm left.

583
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,700
Let's go.

584
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,220
What? To pick clothes?

585
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,840
Do you think this outfit

586
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,310
will work for New Year's?

587
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,420
The pink one looks pretty.

588
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,790
- Look, look.
- This color.

589
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,870
Is it too youthful for me?

590
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,110
- No, I think...
- It's too youthful. Forget it.

591
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,220
Ms. Zhou, how about the black one?

592
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,660
The black one...

593
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,690
Black is safe.

594
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,650
- It's festive.
- Well.

595
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,870
Black isn't really appropriate.

596
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,390
Forget it, I'll change.

597
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,070
How about this purple one?

598
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,180
Is it a bit too subdued?

599
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,170
(Pain Relief Cream)

600
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,890
The texture feels

601
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,840
a little cheap.

602
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,700
What do you think?

603
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,500
Tang, it's just the New Year.

604
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,180
And it's with Jiang's family.

605
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,940
Why are you so nervous?

606
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,730
Am I nervous?

607
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,570
Am I?

608
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,530
Aren't you?

609
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,110
No.

610
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,210
I'm not nervous
about going to his place.

611
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,730
How about this outfit? Will it work?

612
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,450
This one is better. This is better.

613
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,840
- Look at it.
- Wait.

614
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,680
Help me out.

615
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,250
My hand hurts. It's killing me.

616
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,390
Put the patch on for me.

617
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,050
You've overworked

618
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,600
your hand

619
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,890
preparing for New Year's.

620
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,120
- Help me.
- How about this?

621
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,010
I'll change.

622
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,360
I'll change. Take a look for me.

623
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,500
No need to change.

624
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,650
You're beautiful.
Anything you wear looks good.

625
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,390
Help me with the patch.

626
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,410
Tomorrow,

627
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,460
it'll be great not having
to do any dishes.

628
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,970
(Tang Yang)

629
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,840
Can I take that

630
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,830
as a compliment?

631
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,840
(Jiang Shiyan)

632
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,680
Of course.

633
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,400
Even though Ms. Zhou complains

634
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,410
that we're always

635
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,070
making trouble,

636
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,930
I think deep down

637
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,220
(Tang Yang)
she enjoys it.

638
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,880
And you?

639
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,600
(Shiyan)
Do you enjoy it?

640
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,150
You've said everything.

641
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,820
(Tang Yang)

642
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,360
We borrowed a big car

643
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,320
just for you all.

644
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,630
This trip is all thanks to you.

645
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,490
It's New Year's after all. Right?

646
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,390
My sister is always so thoughtful.

647
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
(Jiang Shiyan)

648
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,280
Hey, Jiang Shiyan, what's up?

649
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,220
Hey, Yang.

650
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,280
We just picked up my aunt

651
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,500
and are going to head out.

652
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,350
My grandpa fell today.

653
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,210
What happened? Is it serious?

654
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,150
When did it happen?

655
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,940
Just this morning.

656
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,600
We just finished X-rays

657
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,440
at the hospital.

658
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,120
The doctor said it's okay,

659
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,070
but he'll be monitored.

660
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,180
We wanted him to stay in the hospital,

661
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,790
but he insisted on going home.

662
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,530
It's New Year's.

663
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,730
Who wants to stay in hospital?

664
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,570
Exactly.

665
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,940
Where are you now?

666
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,770
I just

667
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,150
got home.

668
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,940
We might not be able to make it

669
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,310
to the hotel today.

670
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,490
But I've arranged everything

671
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,590
for dinner.

672
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,210
Could you please apologize

673
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,650
to Ms. Zhou and your aunt for me?

674
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,730
We agreed on this earlier,

675
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,570
but there's no way

676
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,150
we can make it back.

677
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,730
We're family. No need to apologize.

678
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,120
- Right.
- As long as he's okay.

679
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,550
Yeah, his health is the priority.

680
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,650
Take care of your grandpa

681
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,900
and Aunt Yi.

682
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,790
Thanks, Aunt. Thanks, Ms. Zhou.

683
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,450
Enjoy your time and have fun.

684
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,360
I'll send the QR code

685
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,390
for the voucher to Tang.

686
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,730
Alright, rest assured.

687
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,700
Don't worry about us.

688
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,490
Happy New Year. You're back.

689
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,030
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

690
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,900
Little one, Happy New Year.

691
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,390
Happy New Year.

692
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,940
What kind of medicine is so expensive?

693
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,170
300 yuan a bottle?

694
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,550
Might as well be robbery.

695
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,420
I told you not to buy it,
but you insisted.

696
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,530
I'm not using it.

697
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,350
I said I wouldn't use it.

698
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,590
Today,

699
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,790
you'll use it

700
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,390
whether you want to or not.

701
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,890
The doctor told you to stay
in the hospital, but you refused.

702
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,080
He told you to stay in bed,

703
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,150
and you refused either.

704
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,460
Is your foot swollen?

705
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,420
Is it as swollen
as a little steamed bun?

706
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,180
How can you write the couplets?

707
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,930
Are you 80

708
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,790
or 8 years old?

709
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,120
(Soaring Dragon)

710
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,220
Integrity.

711
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,110
Do you understand integrity?

712
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,940
I promised them.

713
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,070
I have to keep my word.

714
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,800
I write the New Year's couplets
for the village

715
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,900
every year.

716
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,400
I don't care.

717
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,260
I don't care about your couplets.

718
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,220
Why don't you try persuading them?

719
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,880
I can't.

720
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,180
Uncle, you're older.

721
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,200
You go.

722
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,690
I wouldn't dare.

723
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,980
I'm afraid of your mom.

724
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,590
Is this the place?

725
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,690
Yeah, this is it. I remember

726
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,890
coming here every summer.

727
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,730
This is the one.

728
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,940
Jiang Shiyan.

729
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,160
Jiang Shiyan.

730
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,090
Yang.

731
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,810
Tang.

732
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,870
- You're here.
- Uncle.

733
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,920
Ms. Zhou, hello.

734
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,390
Happy New Year.

735
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,800
Weren't you going to the hotel?

736
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,640
Why did you come?

737
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,730
Well, Ms. Zhou said we planned

738
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,760
to spend New Year's together,

739
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,930
but with just half of us,

740
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,250
it wouldn't feel right.

741
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,690
So, we packed up the dinner

742
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,600
and came here

743
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,700
to spend it with you.

744
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:13,980
Welcome, welcome.

745
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,700
Come in, come in.

746
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,280
Uncle.

747
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,410
Happy New Year.

748
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,690
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

749
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,600
Take these things.

750
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,770
This year feels special.

751
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,930
Happy New Year.

752
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,660
We'll need to heat up the dinner later.

753
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,120
Yes, yes, the dinner.

754
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,070
Just need to heat it up.

755
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,390
That's a figurine for your cousin,

756
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,120
and we brought wine for Uncle

757
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,630
and skincare products for Aunt.

758
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,080
You didn't have to bring

759
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,520
so much stuff.

760
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,490
It's the New Year.

761
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,660
Gifts are a must.

762
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,250
It's only right.

763
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,980
Aunt Yi, how's Grandpa doing?

764
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,320
I tried to help him with medicine,

765
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,160
but he was upset.

766
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,900
"I want to rest. You go away."

767
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,490
You two go check on him.

768
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,560
- Go check.
- I'll go.

769
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,260
I brought some tea for Grandpa.

770
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,530
I'm going to see Grandpa.

771
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,450
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

772
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,290
Go ahead.

773
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,550
- Send my regards.
- Sure.

774
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,530
Got it, got it.

775
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,750
They almost had an argument.

776
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,600
I didn't dare go in.

777
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,910
- Make it fun.
- Wait.

778
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,120
After dinner, stay here, okay?

779
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,690
- There are empty rooms.
- Your hair.

780
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,490
My brother has rooms next door.

781
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,330
It's close by.

782
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,270
Sounds good.

783
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,570
Looks good.

784
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,830
Good eye.

785
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,180
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

786
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,180
Grandpa, Tang's here.

787
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,260
Grandpa, Happy New Year.

788
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,360
Tang, Happy New Year.

789
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,220
Happy New Year.

790
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,030
- Grandpa, I brought you a gift.
- Sit.

791
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,550
Wuyi Mountains Da Hong Pao tea.

792
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,180
Good tea, good tea.

793
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,490
It's great for the heart

794
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,650
and softens blood vessels.

795
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,940
It'll be good for you, Grandpa.

796
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,550
Tang, you're so thoughtful.

797
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,800
It's been years since I've seen you.

798
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,790
You've grown more beautiful.

799
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,420
- No.
- Seeing anyone?

800
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,120
Not yet.

801
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,450
I wonder which lucky guy

802
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,070
will have the fortune to be with you.

803
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,890
Why are you laughing?

804
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,940
You're still single too.

805
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,070
Fangping told me

806
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,490
that you got your PhD.

807
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,790
Where are you working now?

808
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,770
I'm currently...

809
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,310
Jiang Shiyan, come start the fire.

810
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,700
Coming, coming.

811
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,030
I'll go check.

812
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,660
Grandpa, I'm working at a bank now.

813
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,490
- Great.
- I work in CBBC.

814
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,150
- Great.
- I'm a director now.

815
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,500
Wonderful.

816
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,470
Grandma.

817
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,420
Red envelopes, Grandma.

818
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,290
Uncle.

819
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,500
Jiang Shiyan.

820
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,740
Jiang Shiyan.

821
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,730
Look.

822
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,790
Look at this.

823
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,010
What's wrong?

824
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,690
I told you

825
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,120
I'd wear my own clothes,

826
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,790
but you insisted on making me wear this.

827
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,650
Now, I do look all proper.

828
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,830
But how am I supposed to work?

829
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,600
Relatives and friends are outside.

830
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,040
The fire's not lit,
and the water's not boiling.

831
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,560
The fire is going. The water's boiling.

832
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,400
It's boiling?

833
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,440
Aunt Yi.

834
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,050
Tang.

835
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,490
This is from my mom.

836
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,660
She picked this out for you.

837
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,390
It's made of silk cotton, short style.

838
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,490
You can wear it indoors

839
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,420
or outdoors.

840
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,940
- For me?
- Yes.

841
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,460
Thank you.

842
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,820
- Does it look good?
- Great.

843
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,280
- It fits perfectly.
- Very nice.

844
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,880
I'll go change and help out.

845
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,180
Why are you helping?

846
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,980
How long since you last came?

847
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,360
Jiang Shiyan.

848
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,970
Hurry up. Show her around.

849
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:34,810
Alright.

850
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,830
Well.

851
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,030
Let me take that.

852
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,400
Let's go, let's go,

853
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,010
I'll go change too.

854
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,930
- Let's go.
- Go.

855
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,770
Let's go.

856
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,630
Uncle Tang and your uncle are probably

857
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,350
down by the pond catching fish.

858
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,660
My dad really loves fishing.

859
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,730
There was a time when he was on break,

860
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,050
he'd get up at 5 in the morning

861
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,970
and drive two hours

862
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,260
to a reservoir to fish.

863
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,030
Ms. Zhou and Aunt are probably

864
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,180
planting vegetables.

865
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,500
My mom really loves gardening.

866
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,120
You know how small

867
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,050
our balcony is,

868
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,310
but she's filled it with greens.

869
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,050
And there's the empty roof

870
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,760
of their building.

871
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,080
She and some of the teachers

872
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,760
took over the rooftop

873
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,080
and made a few garden plots

874
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,940
to grow vegetables.

875
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,290
She said you

876
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,870
taught her how to plant some of them.

877
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,180
When I was in the village,

878
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,500
Grandpa taught me.

879
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,010
Do you think when I get old,

880
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,740
my bloodline will awaken,

881
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,250
and I'll suddenly

882
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,410
love gardening?

883
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,260
That'd be great.

884
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,410
Then I'll pick out a prime spot

885
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,260
for you

886
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,740
and even build a house.

887
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,790
You can grow whatever you like,

888
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,110
and I'll be right next to you, fishing.

889
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,460
Sounds like a solid plan.

890
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,890
These days, it's quite trendy

891
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,550
for friends to retire together.

892
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,980
We could get a house,

893
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,730
hire a designer

894
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,940
to decorate it nicely,

895
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,740
and then invite

896
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,250
Feng Weiran, Jiang Yanan,

897
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,350
and Cheng Hui to join us.

898
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,010
Jiang Yanan and Feng Weiran

899
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,940
wouldn't come.

900
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,030
They've got Feng Yuanqi.

901
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,650
Maybe they'll be off somewhere

902
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,030
taking care of Yuanqi's kids.

903
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:04,810
Taking care

904
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,700
of Yuanqi's kids?

905
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,150
Cheng Hui might join us.

906
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,420
He'll stay with his computer.

907
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,220
We'll have to look after him then.

908
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,870
Now that you mention it,

909
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,930
it seems like

910
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,360
it'll just be the three of us

911
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,630
lonely old folks.

912
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,880
Who says that?

913
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,500
You've got me.

914
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:23,850
What good is that?

915
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:26,810
Well.

916
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,940
I can farm,

917
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,160
plant vegetables,

918
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,940
and cook. I can do it all.

919
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,050
Cheng Hui said

920
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:35,890
that in ten years,

921
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,490
robots will be everywhere.

922
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,350
A robot can do whatever you can.

923
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,830
There are some things a robot

924
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,150
can't replace me in.

925
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,770
Like what?

926
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,960
What is it?

927
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,590
Take a guess.

928
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,350
Tell me.

929
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,120
- We can pickle vegetables.
- Right.

930
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,740
I'll bring you some when they're ready.

931
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,420
Too salty. No, thanks.

932
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,730
Salty is good sometimes,

933
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,110
especially with congee.

934
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,450
- You have some.
- Shiyan.

935
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,690
- Bring me some more.
- Mom.

936
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,550
You're back.

937
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,250
Go get some firewood.

938
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,800
Your aunt wants to cook ginger duck.

939
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,770
- And some tofu.
- Sure.

940
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,610
Alright, alright.

941
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,600
Quick, quick, help Jiang out.

942
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,790
Alright, alright.

943
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,550
You know.

944
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,690
Tang and Jiang Shiyan

945
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,870
are quite a good match.

946
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,880
Look at Tang,

947
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,120
a leader at the bank,

948
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,960
young and promising.

949
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,040
Jiang Shiyan

950
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,550
is running his own company.

951
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,560
His YiXiu

952
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,930
is doing so well.

953
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,980
Not long ago,

954
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,980
I even saw him on some kind

955
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,550
of wealth ranking list.

956
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,940
I can't quite recall the name.

957
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,110
How true.

958
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,520
Those two

959
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,760
were high school classmates

960
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,210
and university classmates.

961
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,220
Logically speaking,

962
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,520
they know each other well.

963
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,110
Why didn't they end up together?

964
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,030
Those two?

965
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,660
It's impossible.

966
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,360
We have

967
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,560
watched them growing up

968
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,590
for so many years.

969
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,930
Jiang Shiyan

970
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,080
truly treats Tang

971
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,940
and our family as his own.

972
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,560
I used to worry

973
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,080
that Tang was in a teenage romance.

974
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,310
But as it turned out,

975
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,280
they were as pure

976
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,700
as it could be.

977
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,150
Jiang Shiyan always saw Tang
as a big brother.

978
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,740
Didn't you notice?

979
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,360
No matter what happens,

980
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,830
as soon as Tang gives him that look,

981
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,550
Jiang Shiyan immediately submits.

982
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,070
I remember one time,

983
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,770
during a school exam,

984
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,610
he didn't do well

985
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,630
and went to the arcade to play games.

986
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:29,970
When Tang found out,

987
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,870
she just stood at the arcade door.

988
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,250
Without saying a word,

989
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,590
Jiang Shiyan ran with his bag.

990
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,440
Honestly,

991
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,490
if it weren't for your Tang,

992
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,400
Jiang Shiyan might not

993
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,590
have even made it to college.

994
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,490
So, even Jiang Shiyan himself says,

995
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,740
"Tang is my benefactor."

996
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,460
That's nonsense.

997
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,080
They've always had

998
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,450
a purely

999
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,500
brotherly bond.

1000
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,250
It's just fate.

1001
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,390
- Indeed.
- Yes.

1002
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,730
Come on, come on.

1003
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,570
Quick, quick.

1004
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,280
Move the table over. Hurry.

1005
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,310
Move it here, quick.

1006
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,410
- Careful.
- Alright.

1007
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,250
Come on, come on.

1008
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,210
Right here, right here.

1009
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,550
- Put it here.
- Right here.

1010
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:07,850
Come on.

1011
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,470
Lay it out.

1012
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,700
Come take a look, Aunt.

1013
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,030
Stretch it out.

1014
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,550
Come on, set the ink right.

1015
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,070
How did the old man fall?

1016
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,370
Well, he wanted to write

1017
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,630
the New Year couplets.

1018
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,050
In the morning, he went upstairs

1019
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,660
to get paper, brush, ink, and inkstone.

1020
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,330
As he reached the second floor,

1021
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,720
somehow

1022
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,370
he twisted his ankle,
but he didn't fall.

1023
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,590
That would've been serious.

1024
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,010
Oh, my goodness.

1025
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:35,990
Is it bad?

1026
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,740
So I'm to blame, then.

1027
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,660
No, no, don't think that way.

1028
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,770
Every family here

1029
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,740
needs one from him.

1030
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,030
I'll write the couplets.

1031
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,650
Dad,

1032
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,120
you can barely stand.

1033
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,380
How are you going to write?

1034
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,610
I'll...

1035
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,820
I'll write it in bed.

1036
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,220
No worries.

1037
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,340
I'll go to town and buy one.

1038
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:56,820
No, no.

1039
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,590
It must be handwritten.

1040
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,070
That's the tradition.

1041
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,990
No need to buy it.

1042
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,180
I've got a solution.

1043
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:04,810
Dad,

1044
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,720
my backup is on the way.

1045
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,300
My old friend, Ms. Zhou,

1046
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,030
is a highly educated scholar

1047
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,780
and a senior Chinese teacher.

1048
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,010
Her calligraphy

1049
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,300
is like flying cranes

1050
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,890
with powerful strokes.

1051
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,890
Stop showing off

1052
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,510
with your half-baked idioms.

1053
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,180
Ms. Zhou's great.

1054
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,850
She's got depth.

1055
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,030
Yes, yes, yes.

1056
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,440
She will write it.

1057
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,410
Whose family?

1058
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,250
Come on, come on.

1059
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,630
Come on.

1060
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,600
Grab it.

1061
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,660
- Keep writing.
- Bye.

1062
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,610
Sure.

1063
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,350
My hand's getting sore.

1064
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,550
Let's write another set.

1065
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,960
Tang.

1066
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,050
Fantastic, fantastic.

1067
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,040
My backup has arrived.

1068
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,340
Tang, help everyone write the couplets.

1069
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,660
It's been ages
since I last held a brush.

1070
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,600
- I believe in you.
- Give it a try.

1071
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,560
Give it a try.

1072
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,030
Come on, Shiyan, come over here.

1073
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,250
I'll grind the ink.

1074
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,990
Alright, I'll give it a shot.

1075
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,700
My hand's gone stiff.

1076
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,960
I'll grind more.

1077
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,040
Nowadays, young people

1078
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,680
hardly practice calligraphy.

1079
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,520
Ms. Zhou,

1080
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,300
your daughter is so talented too.

1081
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,240
- Thank you.
- As they say,

1082
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,340
"The student surpasses the master."

1083
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,120
- Exactly.
- Yes, yes.

1084
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,660
Ms. Zhou, you're really blessed.

1085
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:33,850
Tang,

1086
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:34,950
your writing is great.

1087
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,440
You don't know.

1088
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,660
My goddaughter here

1089
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,010
is not only beautiful,

1090
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,030
but she's highly educated.

1091
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,600
She's got a PhD in economics

1092
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,220
and works as a director at a bank.

1093
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,770
- Impressive.
- So impressive.

1094
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,610
Truly amazing.

1095
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,700
You're so lucky.

1096
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,300
One son and one daughter.

1097
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,810
Both doing so well.

1098
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:51,770
One's a director,

1099
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,910
and the other's a CEO.

1100
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,560
I did nothing.

1101
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Both kids

1102
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,600
work really hard.

1103
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,440
Right.

1104
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,020
(Fortune)
Exactly.

1105
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,120
Tang, write the couplets for everyone.

1106
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,960
I'll go help out.

1107
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,200
Alright, alright, alright.

1108
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
- Tang, give it to me.
- Sure.

1109
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,440
Uncle Bao, Uncle Bao.

1110
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Let me have it, please.

1111
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520
We were here first.

1112
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,370
We've been waiting.

1113
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,720
We all want it.

1114
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,050
Everyone, calm down.

1115
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,380
You'll get it. Write more.

1116
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,890
I'll also draw

1117
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,070
a few paintings for you.

1118
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,330
Great, great.

1119
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,330
We all want it.

1120
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,300
So pretty.

1121
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,150
Good handwriting.

1122
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,160
Good drawing.

1123
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,110
What is he drawing?

1124
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,930
A lucky rabbit.

1125
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:29,950
How cute.

1126
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,110
A little rabbit.

1127
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,010
Really nice.

1128
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,850
So adorable.

1129
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,040
Done.

1130
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,530
Looks great.

1131
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,370
This one's beautiful.

1132
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,550
Draw one for me too.

1133
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,700
I want a "Fu" character

1134
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,520
and a little rabbit.

1135
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,410
This year is the Year of the Rabbit.

1136
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,010
- Yes, yes.
- I want one.

1137
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,370
You know.

1138
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,450
One writes, and the other draws.

1139
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,040
They make quite the pair.

1140
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,080
Yes, they do.

1141
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,990
Such a perfect match.

1142
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,560
Exactly.

1143
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,160
Director Tang, have you considered

1144
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,120
our Mr. Jiang?

1145
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,040
He's handsome,

1146
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,300
makes good money,

1147
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,240
and is the heartthrob in the village.

1148
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,600
Look at his face.

1149
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,430
Obviously, he'll cherish his wife.

1150
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,340
- Yes.
- Isn't that right?

1151
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,740
Yes, yes.

1152
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,260
We've been good friends for years.

1153
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,330
Friendship and love are both emotions.

1154
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,640
Just a little different.

1155
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,450
It can change in an instant, right?

1156
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,660
- Right?
- Yes.

1157
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,110
It's possible.

1158
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,590
- Such a good match.
- Exactly.

1159
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,960
Here.

1160
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:37,850
Your favorite.

1161
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,040
It moved by itself.

1162
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,920
Come on.

1163
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,340
Ms. Tang, you eat.

1164
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,450
Can't we trust each other

1165
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,380
a little bit?

1166
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,660
Of course, we can.

1167
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,170
Enough.

1168
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,290
I'll take one too.

1169
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,820
Look at mine.

1170
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,630
Tang, you're quacking.

1171
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,110
Perfect for soup.

1172
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,550
Hui, hurry with the fish.

1173
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Alright, alright.

1174
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,430
- Careful, careful.
- It's ready.

1175
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,440
Watch out.

1176
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,330
Here it comes.

1177
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,510
- Looks great.
- Sis.

1178
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,120
- Did you put away the stationery?
- Yes.

1179
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,050
- Have the neighbors left?
- Yeah.

1180
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,890
The two little ones

1181
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,990
completed their task.

1182
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,490
It's been years since it was so lively.

1183
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,640
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1184
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,550
This New Year is really good.

1185
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,630
- True.
- Exactly.

1186
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,070
Really nice.

1187
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,370
These two round tables

1188
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,380
won't fit everyone.

1189
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,720
For the New Year's here,

1190
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,680
both of my uncles always

1191
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,760
come over for drinks.

1192
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,810
Handle it for me.

1193
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,220
Then just set up three tables.

1194
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,890
Put the two half-circle ones together.

1195
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,730
Kids can sit there.

1196
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,490
Alright, I'll go take care of it.

1197
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,340
Alright, alright.

1198
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,180
Here, the fish is great.

1199
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,930
This table

1200
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,380
is an old family heirloom.

1201
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,200
They say in the past

1202
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,860
when the master left for business,

1203
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,860
they'd split the table in half,

1204
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,990
placing on either side of the hall,

1205
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,070
for displaying vases or ornaments.

1206
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,660
It wasn't used regularly.

1207
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,890
Only when the master returned

1208
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,860
and the family reunited

1209
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,510
would they reassemble the table

1210
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,880
for reunion.

1211
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,630
Fate brings reunions.

1212
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,150
Our ancestors were really clever.

1213
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,590
It all has meaning.

1214
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,260
Today, we can say

1215
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,430
we've truly reunited.

1216
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,860
Mom, don't overexert yourself.

1217
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,420
(Twelve years ago)

1218
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,400
You're back.

1219
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,820
How have you been living?

1220
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,010
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

1221
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,850
Look at this.

1222
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,600
You haven't done anything

1223
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,780
and haven't bought anything.

1224
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,560
I was planning to change

1225
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,510
and wash all of this.

1226
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,630
Please sit and rest for a bit.

1227
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,610
I'll do that later.

1228
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,640
I'll get you some hot water first.

1229
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,780
- OK.
- Take your medicine.

1230
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,740
This doesn't look like
a celebration at all.

1231
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,950
Sorry, son.

1232
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,560
It's nothing.

1233
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,960
No.

1234
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,150
I still need to clean up a bit.

1235
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,080
Mom.

1236
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,680
- Mom.
- I need to sweep.

1237
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,700
Put that down.

1238
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,720
The doctor said

1239
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,070
you shouldn't move around.

1240
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,330
Yes, I know.

1241
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,770
- But this...
- Aunt.

1242
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,990
- The door is open.
- Bro.

1243
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,950
- Aunt.
- Happy New Year.

1244
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,850
Happy New Year.

1245
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,590
We brought some apples, oranges,

1246
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,680
peanuts, and sunflower seeds.

1247
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,590
Aunt, here are health supplements.

1248
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,010
Good for your health.

1249
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,490
Why bring so much?

1250
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,850
I have some New Year's goods.

1251
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,850
Sausages, dried duck,

1252
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,280
and some smoked fish.

1253
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,240
Oh, I brought a clean black chicken,

1254
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,220
washed by Ms. Zhou.

1255
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,240
Jiang Shiyan, doesn't your rice cooker

1256
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,770
have a soup mode?

1257
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,240
Take it in and make some for Aunt.

1258
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,380
It'll help her health.

1259
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,240
Tang,

1260
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,120
aren't you celebrating at home too?

1261
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,490
Save some for your family.

1262
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,010
We really can't finish it all.

1263
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:25,930
We have plenty at home.

1264
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,780
My uncle and aunt bought a lot.

1265
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,970
- Right.
- It's still the same.

1266
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,700
My dad went
to the construction site again.

1267
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,120
So, Ms. Zhou and I plan

1268
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,160
to go find him in the afternoon.

1269
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,120
If I hadn't come here,

1270
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,600
Ms. Zhou doesn't even know

1271
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,510
where to put all this.

1272
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,950
Drink some water.

1273
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,260
Have some water.

1274
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,990
The house is a bit messy.

1275
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,120
Make yourselves comfortable.

1276
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,150
- We won't sit.
- Rest.

1277
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,910
- Let's get to work.
- Alright.

1278
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,260
Curtains for me.

1279
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,220
I'll mop the floor.

1280
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,400
Windows for me.

1281
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,700
Okay, let's get started.

1282
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,780
Thank you, thank you.

1283
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,240
Feng, thank you.

1284
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,110
It's nothing, Aunt.

1285
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,950
No problem.

1286
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,430
Slowly. The floor is slippery.

1287
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,530
You two are working hard.

1288
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,180
Be careful. Don't fall.

1289
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,010
Hold it steady.

1290
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,520
Alright, no problem.

1291
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,430
Hold on tight.

1292
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,680
Go down, go down.

1293
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,520
