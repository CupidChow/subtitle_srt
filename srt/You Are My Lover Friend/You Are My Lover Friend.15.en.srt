Yanan.

Jiang Shiyan.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,650
Aren't you going to the class reunion?

30
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,580
What brings you here?

31
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,320
I couldn't make it in time
due to some matters at home,

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,220
so I didn't want to go anymore.

33
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,520
I want to eat,

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,570
but everywhere is crowded.

35
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,130
I heard you were at the restaurant,
so I came over.

36
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,300
Come to my place for a meal?

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,720
Come and have a seat.

38
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,390
You're really something,

39
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,020
taking charge in person today.

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,620
It was all arranged by me.

41
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,390
Look at these big lanterns.

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,110
How do you think? Are they good?

43
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,130
Very good.

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,370
When Feng Weiran

45
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,460
and I started business together,

46
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,550
you handled everything

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,340
from the decoration to the hiring.

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,850
Later, when you became pregnant with Qi,

49
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,950
you felt a bit relieved, right?

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,990
I am very capable, aren't I?

51
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,480
Yanan,

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,240
recently my cousin...

53
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
Cheng Hui.

54
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,740
What brings you here?

55
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,780
I'm tired of eating the same food
at the company.

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,390
I'm here to mooch some food.

57
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,760
It's quite rare for you

58
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,780
to come to Leisure House.

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,830
What would you like? Stir-fried dishes
or hotpot?

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,740
Let's forget about hotpot.

61
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,040
Some stir-fried dishes?

62
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,960
Don't bother. Just bring us a bowl
of noodles or

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,800
- fried rice.
- Fried rice.

64
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,860
We have launched a new fried rice dish

65
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,020
in our restaurant.

66
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,970
Would you like to have a taste?

67
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,650
- OK.
- Sure.

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,710
- OK.
- Wait a moment.

69
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,270
Have some tea.

70
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,860
You didn't stay in the office

71
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,830
all the time these days, did you?

72
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,410
Yes, I did.

73
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,620
I haven't been home these days.

74
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,040
Here.

75
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,620
- Try this.
- Thank you.

76
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,830
This was sent by your old classmate
Guo Yinqi.

77
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,590
- Oh?
- Have a try.

78
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,430
You should try this, it's delicious.

79
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,410
Yanan,

80
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,640
you know

81
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,480
that my cousin came over.

82
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,860
He told me something

83
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,580
that I couldn't

84
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,060
quite understand? I wanted
to ask you about it.

85
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,240
Ask me?

86
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,530
Yes.

87
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,450
Don't you always

88
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,910
ask Feng Weiran and Yang
about everything?

89
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,660
Ask me?

90
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,580
About matters of the heart.

91
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,190
Then you really have to ask me.

92
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,960
Asking them is like asking for nothing.

93
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,810
My cousin

94
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,950
has a

95
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,540
female…

96
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,080
A female colleague.

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,610
She has a good relationship with him.

98
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,580
But recently

99
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,160
it became a little strange.

100
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,390
How strange?

101
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,850
Once upon a time, after a meal together,

102
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,510
they drank alcohol.

103
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,390
The two of them

104
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,510
almost…

105
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,800
Have sex?

106
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,010
No, no, no.

107
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,750
Almost kissed.

108
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,220
Kiss? Why didn't they kiss?

109
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,070
The girl pushed him away in the end.

110
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,920
It's over.

111
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,040
No chance.

112
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,010
You reach a conclusion so quickly?

113
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,010
Sure.

114
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,540
The girl definitely doesn't like him.

115
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,730
If a girl has even the slightest affection

116
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,050
for a boy,

117
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,930
she wouldn't push him away

118
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,070
in such a situation.

119
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,210
But why didn't she

120
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,630
push him earlier?

121
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,150
Why wait until the last moment?

122
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,580
Is the female colleague

123
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,690
very familiar with him for a long time

124
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,520
and has gone through a lot of things,

125
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,320
so they have a very good relationship
like brothers?

126
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,580
You can actually guess this.

127
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,090
That must be a dislike.

128
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,930
Well…

129
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,750
She must not like him.

130
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,900
She just treats him as a friend.

131
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,200
Your cousin's

132
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,390
behavior that day

133
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,170
did make his female colleague

134
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,250
feel a bit embarrassed

135
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,950
and hesitant to contradict him.

136
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,320
She may want

137
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,420
to try to accept it

138
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,840
at first.

139
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,780
She hesitated.

140
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,310
But as your cousin

141
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,640
went further,

142
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,480
she found herself

143
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,900
unable to accept it.

144
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,730
She resisted him in her heart,
and didn't like him

145
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,830
so in the end

146
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
she could only push him away.

147
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,660
Understand?

148
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,970
But she…

149
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,130
Fried rice!

150
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:12,970
Over here, over here.

151
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,720
Here.

152
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,330
Thank you.

153
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,480
Come on.

154
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,570
This is hot.

155
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,930
OK, put it here.

156
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,770
Just leave it here.

157
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,870
Here is a bowl of soup for you.

158
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,240
OK.

159
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,160
Here.

160
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,580
Let me serve you some soup.

161
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,770
OK.

162
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,570
Delicious.

163
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,190
You're not eating?

164
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,960
I may have gotten a little too hungry,

165
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,630
so I can't eat anymore.

166
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,010
OK.

167
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,210
And then what happened?

168
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,170
What happened

169
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,810
to your cousin and that female colleague
later?

170
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,920
You said it was over.

171
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
Well…

172
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,660
It's OK, just talk to me.

173
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,970
The female colleague

174
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,420
called him again after returning,

175
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,280
saying she didn't want anything

176
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,630
to effect the friendship

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,840
between the two of them.

178
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,710
See?

179
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,540
She still didn't like him.

180
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,510
Then she said

181
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,870
my cousin

182
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,870
is as important

183
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,200
as her parents are.

184
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,490
It's even clearer.

185
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,690
She treats him as family,

186
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,660
as a brother.

187
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,920
Tell your cousin

188
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,580
not to have any inappropriate thoughts.

189
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,750
That's about it.

190
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,160
Right?

191
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,050
Cheng Hui, please eat slowly.

192
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,420
You are eating too fast.

193
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,010
Jut eat.

194
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,020
It'll be cold in a moment.

195
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I still have something to do.

196
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm going back first.

197
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,020
- You go ahead.
- You don't eat?

198
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,320
Not taking a single bite?

199
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,160
Take your time.

200
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,340
You…

201
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,370
He is really…

202
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,780
What's wrong with him?

203
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,630
His cousin got married three years ago.

204
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,220
The child is one and a half years old.

205
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,070
Who did you hear that from?

206
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,320
He went to Ji'an

207
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
to attend a wedding that year.

208
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,750
He brought back the crystal cakes

209
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,780
and persimmon cakes.

210
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,070
Oh…

211
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,630
Jiang Shiyan just said…

212
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,020
His cousin is having an affair.

213
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,340
Let's go watch a movie.

214
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,480
OK.

215
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,330
I'm sorry I'm late.

216
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,390
It's OK. Here.

217
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,400
Thank you.

218
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,010
Smells so good.

219
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,280
Of course. That's the one I chose.

220
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,510
What are we going to do later?

221
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,480
Everything is OK.

222
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,780
What do you want to do?

223
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,170
Yang.

224
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,330
Liu.

225
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,520
Long time no see.

226
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,870
- They're all inside.
- Let's go.

227
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,850
I have always felt

228
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,080
that being together

229
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,290
is the most important thing for us,

230
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,820
and I don't want anything

231
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,470
to affect

232
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,480
our relationship.

233
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,800
So those

234
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,540
little incidents

235
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,820
won't affect us, right?

236
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,210
(So)

237
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,820
(we can only be friends forever)

238
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,350
(I don't want to just be friends)

239
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,700
(be brothers)

240
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,110
Hello? Miss Sheng.

241
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,020
Happy New Year.

242
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,250
We have all received the red envelopes

243
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,410
you sent on Chinese New Year's Eve.

244
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,300
Thank you so much.

245
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,390
It's OK. Just say it.

246
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,020
Let's do it this way.

247
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,890
I will contact the company in a moment

248
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,600
to see which technical consultant is
at the company.

249
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,560
Then I will create a group.

250
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,640
You guys go discuss

251
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,480
about the time.

252
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,300
No problem, it's not a bother.

253
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,330
OK.

254
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,570
OK.

255
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,090
Happy New Year.

256
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,930
Goodbye.

257
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,300
That female celebrity? What's wrong
with her?

258
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,090
The wifi network at her house

259
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,110
cannot connect.

260
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,110
She said

261
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,610
there is an important video conference

262
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,130
at night and she is afraid of missing it.

263
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,280
She just asked if the company
has any technicians

264
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,270
to help her fix it.

265
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,590
Go to the female celebrity's house?

266
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,470
That's a big villa.

267
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,730
Don't be like this.

268
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,970
That seems very unprofessional.

269
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,990
You are really meddlesome.

270
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:07,970
What's wrong?

271
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,230
Aren't you meddlesome?

272
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,870
I…

273
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,350
Of course, I am meddlesome.

274
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,050
When meddlesome me

275
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,520
is with meddlesome you,

276
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,660
we are a family of meddlers.

277
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,560
But honey, you still need

278
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,970
to find someone reliable to go
to her house.

279
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,390
You can rest assured. I know
what I'm doing.

280
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,350
I'm ready to let Cheng Hui go there.

281
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,020
Even if you throw the gossip

282
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,770
in Cheng Hui's face,

283
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,770
he never pays attention to it.

284
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,610
That's true.

285
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,180
Hello, you have a visitor.

286
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,120
Mr. Cheng.

287
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,820
What brings you here?

288
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,820
Go upstairs, please.

289
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,350
Who is this, Nina?

290
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,490
Who did you call for?

291
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,490
Stand up. Move your butt.

292
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,990
- Who did you call for?
- Move your butt.

293
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,920
A friend who fixes WIFI.

294
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,270
A friend who fixes WIFI?

295
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,920
Come on. Tidy it up.

296
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,940
Tidy it up.

297
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,540
Happy New Year, Mr. Cheng.

298
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,250
I didn't expect you to come here

299
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,700
for such a small matter.

300
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,850
- Feng Weiran said that he was worried,
- A handsome guy.

301
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,850
so he called me to come over.

302
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,060
I just sent you a WeChat message.

303
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,180
Did you?

304
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,700
I didn't see my phone.

305
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,110
Chatting with my friend.

306
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,240
Come in.

307
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,090
No need to change shoes.

308
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:28,930
Fine.

309
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,750
I brought something for you.

310
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,640
You came to fix things for me,

311
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,700
and even brought a gift.

312
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,520
You are too kind, thank you.

313
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,880
It wasn't bought on purpose.

314
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,300
I directly took it from the company.

315
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,530
Feng Weiran said it's not polite

316
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,540
to visit your house empty-handed
during the Lunar New Year.

317
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,370
This is the co-branded braised food
and sauce

318
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,940
with Zhilan Snacks.

319
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,420
Let me introduce you.

320
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,210
Come on.

321
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,920
This is Cheng Hui,

322
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,880
the technical director

323
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,780
and the partner of Yixiu.

324
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,700
These are all my good friends.

325
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,760
Taotao,

326
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,110
Yiyun and Ji Han.

327
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,420
Happy New Year, Mr. Cheng.

328
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,420
Happy New Year, Mr. Cheng.

329
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,150
- Happy New Year, Mr. Cheng.
- Happy New Year.

330
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,570
Please take a seat.

331
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,660
- Take a seat.
- Here. Take a seat.

332
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,060
Where is the router?

333
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,720
Here.

334
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,110
How can it be fixed?

335
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,150
Your router

336
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,730
is too old.

337
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,150
It should have been eliminated long ago.

338
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,640
What should I do?

339
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,900
Change a new one.

340
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,300
You actually brought a new one.

341
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,450
Thank you for that.

342
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,400
It's not new.

343
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,660
I pulled it randomly from the company.

344
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,590
Pull?

345
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,390
It's good.

346
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,510
It's OK as long as it works.

347
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,300
Would you like some water?

348
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,800
Let me pour you a glass of water.

349
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,640
Not need.

350
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,970
What about other beverages?

351
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,870
Coffee or tea?

352
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,090
Not need.

353
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,270
Come on.

354
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,210
Nina,

355
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,420
why does he look so strange?

356
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,970
Maybe tech giants

357
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,870
are always like this.

358
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,590
He talks in a way that could literally
suffocate people.

359
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,660
Does he always talk to you like this?

360
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,630
He

361
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,210
is not very talkative.

362
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,730
Today he talks more than usual.

363
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,510
- Are you serious?
- Not talkative...

364
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,780
He

365
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,270
looks quite handsome.

366
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,240
But he speaks

367
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,180
in a very strange way.

368
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,300
Mom, why did you bring back
so many things again?

369
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,760
Before I left,

370
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,730
your aunt went to the field to dig

371
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,590
many vegetables and radishes.

372
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,230
Anyway, these are all pollution-free
vegetables.

373
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,130
We can put them in the refrigerator
and eat slowly.

374
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,590
- Are they heavy?
- No, they are not.

375
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,850
Ms. Zhou said

376
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,520
Tang loves to eat this kind

377
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,970
of green vegetables.

378
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,540
I will send some over to them tomorrow.

379
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,760
How about I drive over

380
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,010
to deliver it to them in a while?

381
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,530
No need. I have made an appointment

382
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,720
with Ms. Zhou to play cards tomorrow.

383
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,630
I'll bring it over.

384
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,800
Last time I gave the necklace to Tang,

385
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,730
but she forgot to take it.

386
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,990
I brought it back again.

387
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,210
I guess there were too many things
like setting off fireworks that day,

388
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,300
so she left early the next day.

389
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,850
Give it to me.

390
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,690
Why should I give it to you?

391
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,060
I'll bring it over tomorrow.

392
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,300
You forgot that she has been staying
at her own house these days.

393
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,930
She has to be on duty
during the Spring Festival.

394
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,330
Give it to me.

395
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,250
She has to go back to Ms. Zhou's house
sooner or later.

396
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,450
It doesn't matter.

397
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,720
In case she deliberately avoids me,

398
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,560
you…

399
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,900
What do you mean by deliberately
avoiding you?

400
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,710
You mean she doesn't want
to meet you.

401
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,970
Nonsense!

402
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,110
What are you talking about?

403
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,280
It's OK.

404
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,590
Take it. Take it.

405
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,880
Take it.

406
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,510
I don't want this to happen.

407
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,820
Mom, you take a break.

408
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,300
I'll be out for a while.

409
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,470
What are you up to?

410
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,150
The company has several
live broadcasts recently.

411
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,850
I'll take a look.

412
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,810
Here.

413
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,110
Enter the password.

414
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,280
Eight to twelve digits

415
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,780
with a mix of numbers and letters.

416
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,130
Don't enter

417
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,250
wodewifi

418
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,540
1234 and so on.

419
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,900
It's easy to be cracked.

420
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,750
Who would use such a childish
password?

421
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,750
Re-enter.

422
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:41,970
It's done.

423
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,480
All right.

424
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,490
Try to connect the phone

425
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,420
and see if it works.

426
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,040
The username is TPlink1A.

427
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,450
The password is

428
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,700
the one you just entered.

429
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,880
OK.

430
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,640
I'm off.

431
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,420
- Go, go, go.
- Are you in such a hurry?

432
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,630
It's just in time.

433
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,840
Why don't you take a break?

434
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,320
Let's have a meal together in a while.

435
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,160
I am not hungry.

436
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,680
Mr. Cheng,

437
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,410
this braised dried tofu is so delicious!

438
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,560
Can I buy it

439
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,400
on the Yixiu Mall?

440
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,290
It should be launched on the Yixiu Mall

441
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,550
after the Chinese New Year.

442
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,840
I'm going to buy it.

443
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,980
Is it fixed?

444
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,360
Mr. Cheng, would you like

445
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,660
to sit down and have a drink with us?

446
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,570
Wait a moment.

447
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,150
Mr. Cheng is quite handsome.

448
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,590
Is he single?

449
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,420
I don't know.

450
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,640
Give me his WeChat ID.

451
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,640
I..

452
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,900
I don't have his WeChat.

453
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,180
We communicate

454
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,900
within the group.

455
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,520
And I see that he has set it

456
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,740
so that others cannot be added.

457
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,390
And he is

458
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,550
quite strange.

459
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,070
We are not very familiar
with each other.

460
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,220
I will ask him myself later.

461
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,110
I got it. I'm hanging up.

462
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,460
Is your girlfriend urging you?

463
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,530
My program.

464
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,700
Your program?

465
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,080
You mean the voice on the phone
is not a person,

466
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,250
but a computer program.

467
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,890
Yes, I wrote the program myself.

468
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,210
If our company's server

469
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,410
encounters a failure

470
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,650
or any issue,

471
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,070
it will automatically dial me.

472
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,410
Mr. Cheng, you…

473
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,210
Is there something going on
with your company?

474
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,250
Hurry back.

475
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,350
Don't delay your work.

476
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,070
- Fine.
- Let me walk you out.

477
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,030
Take care, Mr. Cheng.

478
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,500
Don't you have his WeChat?

479
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,840
You don't want to give it to Taotao,
do you?

480
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,420
You should know her well.

481
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,790
She thinks every handsome guy
she sees is great.

482
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,770
After the initial excitement wears off,

483
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,030
it's hard to say how things will turn out.

484
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,420
Furthermore, Yixiu is my primary
financial backer.

485
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,460
What if things turn sour?

486
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,110
I will be in trouble, right?

487
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,400
Ms. Tang.

488
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,490
Mr. Ying.

489
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,600
Here.

490
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,040
I just bought it downstairs.

491
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,880
Very sweet.

492
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,550
Do you need anything from me?

493
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,480
(Ying Miao, General Manager
of the CBBC Credit Card Center)

494
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:33,920
Yes.

495
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,760
Although our Credit Card Center

496
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,310
met its performance target this year,

497
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,360
it was

498
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,630
not very outstanding.

499
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,310
I want to open more channels next year.

500
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,640
So,

501
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,740
I want to ask you for help.

502
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,490
Could you please elaborate on that?

503
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,030
I'll see if I can help.

504
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,210
Is the boss of Yixiu Found of Food

505
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,150
your friend?

506
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,310
Yes, we're good friends.

507
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,180
Can you introduce him to me?

508
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,600
We want to organize an event

509
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,660
with Yixiu.

510
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,520
Restaurants registered
on the Yixiu platform

511
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,530
can use our credit card

512
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,460
to purchase coupons,

513
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,120
with a 5% discount on meal expenses,

514
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,160
and we will provide subsidies.

515
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,070
I understand what you mean.

516
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,520
They have a large scale

517
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,940
and a high number of daily active users.

518
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,590
If we can persuade Yixiu
to cooperate with us,

519
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,260
our market share

520
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,250
will basically be able to reach
the first place in Rongcheng.

521
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,290
It does sound

522
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,590
like a win-win situation.

523
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,900
Other banks

524
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,080
also want to compete
for this collaboration.

525
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,940
We scheduled two appointments
before the New Year.

526
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,700
The people who came out
to discuss matters

527
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,790
just wanted to hear the proposals.

528
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,800
I wonder if I can meet

529
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,740
the decision maker directly.

530
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,730
The person in charge of finance and law

531
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,390
should be Mr. Feng, Feng Weiran.

532
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,940
Can you help make a connection?

533
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,650
The settlement subsidy

534
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,010
that the headquarters is giving us

535
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,040
is 3.5 percent.

536
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,310
If we can collaborate with Yixiu,

537
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,890
I can strive to provide the other party

538
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,220
with a subsidy of 4.5%.

539
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,550
I understand.

540
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,110
I'll help you make an appointment
with him first.

541
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,350
OK, thank you.

542
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,700
(Yixiu Found of Food)

543
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,170
Zhang Zhilan said Zhilan Snacks

544
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,280
is not owned by herself.

545
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,600
It is the joint effort

546
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,740
of her and other ten military wives.

547
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,230
So the logo on the co-branded sauce

548
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,420
should be a group photo of 11 people.

549
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,320
Mr. Jiang, Happy New Year!

550
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,010
- The Planning Department said
- Happy New Year.

551
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,420
that there are too many people
and no focus.

552
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,740
Ask them to outline the levels

553
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,740
with simple sketches

554
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,150
or cartoons,

555
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,740
or adjust the positions

556
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,110
of the characters.

557
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,360
Remember,

558
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,010
the core of our cooperation
with Zilan Snacks

559
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,400
is people-oriented,

560
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,560
so don't neglect the essentials.

561
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,900
OK, I will pass it on.

562
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,710
Mr. Jiang, the contracts
of raw material factory

563
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,360
for the co-branded sauce
have all been reviewed.

564
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,260
Before formal production,

565
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,710
would you like to go and inspect it
yourself?

566
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,710
Thank you for your hard work.

567
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,490
I will definitely go.

568
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,500
I will go check it

569
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,930
with the Quality Control Department
later.

570
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,350
I will let you know after we agree
on a time.

571
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,220
- OK.
- You go do your things.

572
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,440
OK.

573
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,160
Here you are.

574
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,460
Yang and others will be here soon.

575
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,730
She helped the people
from the Credit Card Center

576
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,700
to discuss the cooperation

577
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,660
of credit payment.

578
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,110
She contacted you directly?

579
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,330
Yes.

580
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,980
Why didn't she contact me?

581
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,220
Why should she contact you?

582
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,290
I have always been in charge

583
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,650
of these affairs of our company,
haven't I?

584
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,040
When did you start taking charge
of this?

585
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,290
You're right.

586
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,130
But I didn't say…

587
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,260
…didn't say I don't care.

588
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,030
Let me test you.

589
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,770
Which bank is our company's

590
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,870
primary account opened at?

591
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,700
- It's…
- Which one?

592
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,200
It's…

593
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,500
Well…

594
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,200
All right.

595
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,030
I didn't say you couldn't take charge
of it.

596
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,170
We will have a meeting later.

597
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,030
Let's go together.

598
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,850
I'm not going.

599
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,740
Tell her I'm not here in a moment.

600
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,240
(Cheng Hui)
Thank you for the gift.

601
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,150
(Sheng Nina) The fried rice
made with it is very delicious.

602
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,940
(Cheng Hui)
You're welcome.

603
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,340
(Sheng Nina)

604
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,560
We will organize

605
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,010
the contract framework and send it
to you.

606
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,040
We can schedule

607
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,970
a second meeting then.

608
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,410
- OK.
- Feel free to call us anytime

609
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,600
if you have any questions.

610
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,440
OK.

611
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,080
- Thank you.
- Waiting for your message.

612
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,920
OK. Goodbye.

613
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,890
- Goodbye
- By the way,

614
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,840
that batch of sauce that Mr. Jiang
ordered for you

615
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,210
can be delivered to CBBC
this afternoon.

616
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,170
OK, thank you.

617
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,830
OK, I'll go and walk them out.

618
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,010
Go ahead.

619
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,680
Feng Weiran.

620
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,180
Where's Jiang Shiyan?

621
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,180
He has something to do.

622
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,160
Something?

623
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,790
He didn't come to work
right after the Chinese New Year.

624
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,080
He was supposed to come
for the meeting.

625
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,900
He had to leave suddenly
due to an emergency.

626
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,730
Fine.

627
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,850
I'm leaving.

628
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,010
Take care.

629
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,160
Yang.

630
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,600
I'll be right back.

631
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,440
Go ahead.

632
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,330
What's wrong?

633
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,150
Not busy today?

634
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,840
I came with my colleagues
to have a meeting

635
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,740
and discuss a collaboration
on credit payment.

636
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,460
Is everything going smoothly?

637
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,870
It's OK, they are all quite sincere.

638
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,050
That's fine.

639
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,310
Have you seen Jiang Shiyan today?

640
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,070
I

641
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,180
just saw him a moment ago.

642
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,260
Do you know where he went?

643
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,180
Why don't you give him a call?

644
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,640
Forget it.

645
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,590
I have to go back to CBBC
for something.

646
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,840
Fine, I'll leave you to your work.

647
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,970
I'm leaving, bye.

648
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,810
Goodbye.

649
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,030
I sent a WeChat message over there.

650
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,050
It's nothing.

651
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,360
Come on.

652
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,050
Mr. Feng.

653
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,650
This cake

654
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,650
is quite delicious.

655
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,490
Try it.

656
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,590
Here you are, Jiang.

657
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,630
Just leave it there.

658
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,290
How was the meeting?

659
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,150
Did you say something?

660
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,010
It's about the direction of cooperation

661
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,930
and general outline.

662
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,770
That's all.

663
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,530
What did Yang say?

664
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,370
Has she made a statement?

665
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,310
You know Yang, don't you?

666
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,170
You care about her so much.

667
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,550
Why didn't you come to the meeting
just now?

668
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,320
It doesn't matter

669
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,980
whether I attend the first meeting
or not.

670
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,840
I don't mean anything else.

671
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,710
I just want to get to know the partner
a little better.

672
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,760
Our partner

673
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,660
is the head of the Credit Card Center,

674
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,940
not Yang.

675
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,200
Well…

676
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,660
Give me a piece to eat.

677
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,150
I haven't eaten anything
in the past half day.

678
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,760
- Has he slept?
- He has slept.

679
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,310
I told five stories.

680
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,170
Oh my god, come quickly.

681
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,380
- Let me give you a massage.
- Oh my God.

682
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,550
I haven't finished telling you yet.

683
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,220
I just feel this thing

684
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,660
especially strange.

685
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,050
How strange?

686
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,150
If Tang Yang came to our company

687
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,460
normally,

688
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,770
Jiang Shiyan would be eager

689
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,150
to go to CBBC to pick her up.

690
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,350
Today

691
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,650
he not only didn't go to pick her up,

692
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,740
but also avoided seeing her.

693
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,350
Do you know what else he asked?

694
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,660
He asked me

695
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,760
what Yang said

696
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,260
during the meeting.

697
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,250
It's obvious

698
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,800
that they didn't communicate
with each other.

699
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,150
Oh?

700
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,900
This is strange.

701
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,280
What's going on?

702
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,150
I don't know.

703
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,210
I suspect

704
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,560
that Shiyan may have done something

705
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,800
to upset Yang,

706
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,940
and now he feels guilty
and dare not see her.

707
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,700
Impossible.

708
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,360
They have such a good relationship.

709
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,150
Even if the sky falls, they will not
break up.

710
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,290
I don't know.

711
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,560
Honey, you must

712
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,870
not tell Yang.

713
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,040
Don't worry, I won't tell her.

714
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,900
I will keep my mouth shut.

715
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,280
(Jiang Yanan)

716
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,250
Don't you think

717
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,110
Jiang Shiyan is strange?

718
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,500
So,

719
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,970
when I went to the meeting at Yixiu,

720
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:44,940
he was actually in the office,

721
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,870
but deliberately avoided me.

722
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,050
Yes.

723
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,410
Feng Weiran also wondered

724
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,880
if Jiang Shiyan had done something

725
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,940
to upset you.

726
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,690
No.

727
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,590
Right? I also think it's not possible.

728
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
You two have such a close…

729
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,640
Honey,

730
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,410
my silk tie…

731
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,660
Wait a moment, I'll be right there.

732
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,870
OK, I won't talk to you anymore.

733
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,260
Feng Weiran told me not to tell you.

734
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,210
Go to bed early.

735
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,070
Goodbye.

736
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:07,810
Good night.

737
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,500
Avoid me?

738
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,800
(Sauce Zhilan Snacks)

739
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,460
Why did he avoid me?

740
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,900
What's the matter?

741
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,170
Did you burn yourself?

742
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,420
No, no, no.

743
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,070
Oh my goodness.

744
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,940
Luckily, this is warm water.

745
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:03,730
What's wrong with you?

746
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,930
You look absent-minded.

747
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,900
I was just thinking about something.

748
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,320
Maybe I've been reading
too many documents recently.

749
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,360
I always feel like

750
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,870
my mind is foggy.

751
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,630
Are you catching a cold?

752
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,840
Otherwise, I'll go to the office later

753
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,040
to get you some medicine.

754
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,260
No, no, no.

755
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,790
- Are you sure?
- I'm just tired.

756
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,960
Be careful.

757
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,500
OK, don't worry.

758
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,290
Peng Si,

759
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,530
what time and where did Mr. Ying

760
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,790
arrange to meet?

761
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,650
Sichuan Resto at 6:30.

762
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,560
If you decide to go, I will reply
to Mr. Ying.

763
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,450
- Send it to me later.
- OK.

764
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,520
Reply to them.

765
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,360
OK.

766
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,700
I'll go with you and help you
carry your bag.

767
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,260
I don't have a bag.

768
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,160
Take me.

769
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,070
Fine. Go.

770
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,390
Mr. Ying,

771
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,450
I really can't go.

772
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,150
I haven't finished writing a summary
yet.

773
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,740
Qin Yue just reminded me.

774
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,170
I will talk to Qin Yue

775
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,180
and ask for an extension for you.

776
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,530
Jiang Shiyuan

777
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,030
definitely won't go.

778
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,730
Can't you, as a department head,

779
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,980
handle Mr. Feng properly?

780
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,070
Mr. Jiang will go, too.

781
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,410
Peng Si told me

782
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,790
both leaders will attend.

783
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,320
Last time I didn't see Mr. Jiang.

784
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,410
I didn't have any contact with him,

785
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,250
so I feel uncertain.

786
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,630
You have to help me out.

787
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,460
I will call Qin Yue right away.

788
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,790
Or I help you write the summary.

789
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,030
Of course, what I write must
be worse than what you write.

790
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,180
All right, Mr. Ying,

791
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,630
I'll go with you.

792
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,080
I'm sorry, Mr. Ying.

793
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,920
Sorry to keep you waiting.

794
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,180
It's OK.

795
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,630
Let me introduce to you.

796
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,320
This is Mr. Ying,

797
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,380
the General Manager

798
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,440
of the CBBC Credit Card Center.

799
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,080
This is Mr. Cheng, Cheng Hui,

800
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,730
our partner

801
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,460
and also in charge
of the Technical Department.

802
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,890
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Cheng.
- Nice to meet you!

803
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,730
Mr. Ying.

804
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,260
No need for introducing Yang, right?

805
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,210
No need. Please have a seat.

806
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,500
- Dishes can be served now.
- OK.

807
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,810
Sit.

808
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,600
Mr. Ying,

809
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,040
you made a good choice
with this restaurant.

810
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,210
Sichuan Resto

811
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,280
has a particularly good wine cellar.

812
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,600
All wins stored inside

813
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:11,990
are old ones.

814
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,730
It's particularly difficult
to make an appointment.

815
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,210
You need to inform them in advance

816
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,220
in order to reserve wine for you.

817
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,450
I suggest that you can try it next time

818
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,520
if you have the chance.

819
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,410
OK.

820
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,180
Let's make another appointment here
next time.

821
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,930
Sichuan Resto's biggest competitor

822
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,930
is Leisure House.

823
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,320
The owner of Leisure House

824
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,500
is Mr. Feng.

825
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,410
It looks like we should meet
at Leisure House next time.

826
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,260
No, no, no.

827
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,280
To be honest.

828
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,350
the wine at Sichuan Resto
is really delicious.

829
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,770
If I weren't afraid of being scolded

830
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,900
by my shareholders,

831
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,840
I would really like

832
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,490
to store more jars of wine
in this restaurant.

833
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,520
After hearing what you said,

834
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,360
I can't wait

835
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,460
to give it a try.

836
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,180
(Private Wine)
Sorry to bother you.

837
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,560
This jar of wine

838
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,150
is our own brewed aged wine,

839
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,500
with a smooth and mellow taste,

840
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,660
sweet and refreshing aroma,

841
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,970
and a long-lasting finish.

842
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,810
Today

843
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,180
why don't we open it and have a taste?

844
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,900
Well…

845
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,180
Don't we need to make a reservation
for this aged wine?

846
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,740
This is a jar of wine stored by Mr. Jiang.

847
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,890
Mr. Jiang booked a private room

848
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,740
for Miss Tang last year.

849
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,870
Miss Tang was not here.

850
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,920
Mr. Jiang said

851
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,900
that his wine

852
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,790
is reserved for Miss Tang,

853
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,630
and he also left Miss Tang's
phone number.

854
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,800
We just saw Miss Tang

855
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,840
scanning the parking voucher

856
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,790
on the mini program at the bar,

857
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,220
so I brought it over.

858
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,760
Let me explain, Mr. Ying.

859
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,390
You may not be very familiar.

860
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,030
But I am completely used

861
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,800
to the position of Yang
in Mr. Jiang's heart,

862
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,030
which is definitely higher
than anyone else.

863
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,440
See?

864
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,280
Mr. Jiang is on a business trip outside.

865
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,180
When Yang arrives,

866
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,290
the wine is ready.

867
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,390
Stop that. You've said whatever
you wanted to say.

868
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,180
How many days will he be
on a business trip?

869
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,030
About four or five days.

870
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,080
Hurry up and pour the wine.

871
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,310
- Let's have a taste.
- OK.

872
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,260
(Jiang Shiyan)

873
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,940
Are you avoiding me?

874
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,940
(Jiang Shiyan Tang Yang)

875
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,940
(Are you avoiding me?)

876
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:43,020
(Jiang Shiyan Tang Yang)

877
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,980
Now you don't even tell me
when you're on a business trip.

878
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,500
I need to find out from Feng Weiran.

879
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,870
When will you come back?

880
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,590
Let's have a meal together.

881
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,410
Ms. Tang, that batch of sauce
that Mr. Jiang ordered for you

882
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,960
can be delivered to CBBC
this afternoon.

883
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,210
Mr. Jiang said

884
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,180
that his wine

885
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,950
is reserved for Miss Tang,

886
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,990
and he also left Miss Tang's
phone number..

887
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,620
(Certificate of Honor)

888
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,290
I hope you can give me advice

889
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,380
in the future.

890
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,890
Mr. Gan, you are flattering me too much.

891
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,860
No, I'm not flattering you.

892
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,150
You are the outstanding individual
of the headquarters for the year,

893
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,010
while I am just the outstanding
individual of the branch.

894
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:00,910
My wording

895
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,220
is just right.

896
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,810
I vaguely remember

897
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,930
that at the welcome banquet

898
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,770
when you first arrived,

899
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,740
I mentioned

900
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,640
that you have many

901
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,370
scarce resources.

902
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,210
See?

903
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,990
It has all been transformed.

904
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,780
Actually, I also benefited a lot

905
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,300
from you.

906
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,680
I remember when I first arrived
at the office,

907
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,080
my own office had not been

908
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,300
cleaned up yet.

909
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,770
I was squeezed into a cubicle

910
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,630
in a large office.

911
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,930
If you hadn't personally

912
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,490
delivered the Zhang Zhilan case

913
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,560
to me,

914
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,770
how could I be selected

915
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,740
as an outstanding individual
at the headquarters?

916
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,180
Mr. Gan, please.

917
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,930
The results of this year's selection

918
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,860
have been announced.

919
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,970
Let's warmly congratulate Ms. Tang
for being awarded the title

920
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,910
of Outstanding Individual of the Year
at the headquarters.

921
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,260
The headquarters?

922
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,040
Yes, the headquarters.

923
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,340
Ms. Tang is awesome.

924
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,510
Congratulations, Ms. Tang.

925
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,550
Thank you all.

926
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,560
I also tried my best

927
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,860
to help the division win this.

928
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,880
Not worth mentioning.

929
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,970
Mr. Gan is the beacon of our division.

930
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,220
How can we ignore it?

931
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,820
Ms. Tang, well said.

932
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,860
All right.

933
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,030
Less empty talk,

934
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,040
more focus on performance.

935
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,880
In the new year,

936
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,560
let's work together

937
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,450
and achieve great results.

938
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,290
OK.

939
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,660
- OK.
- OK. I'll let you go.

940
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,850
Ms. Tang, Ms. Qin,

941
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,770
come to my office.

942
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,680
Let's talk about this year's

943
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,660
Elite Club.

944
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,080
Elite Club?

945
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,910
If you don't go, I will go.

946
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,590
- Mr. Jiang, you're back.
- Hello, Ms. Zhang.

947
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,480
I know.

948
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,200
I have seen that production line.

949
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,040
No problem.

950
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,150
The origin of raw materials may need
to be revisited several times.

951
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,410
This flight was canceled four times

952
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,380
before finally taking off.

953
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,470
It drove me crazy.

954
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,180
I will call you back later.

955
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,520
OK.

956
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,950
You finally get back.

957
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,490
I just got off the plane.

958
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,430
I was originally planning

959
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,930
to send you a WeChat message,

960
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,820
but I kept calling instead.

961
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,630
I heard that you are starting
to raise Series C funding.

962
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:01,810
Yes.

963
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,030
As usual, you are the consultant.

964
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,720
But I heard

965
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,010
that some funds under CBBC

966
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,030
are also in contact with you.

967
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,260
So…

968
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,770
I understand.

969
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,630
Yes.

970
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,150
You need to avoid suspicion.

971
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,700
What brings you here today?

972
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,470
Well,

973
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,600
Ms. Zhou asked me

974
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,860
to give Ganoderma powder to Aunt Yi.

975
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,630
They dance together every day,
don't they?

976
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,910
Yes, I understand.

977
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,250
You deliberately brought it over
to make it seem more serious.

978
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,160
I mainly

979
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,660
came to see Aunt Yi

980
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,510
and then take a look at these flowers
and plants.

981
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,220
The main thing is to see if it blooms
or not.

982
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,220
Except me.

983
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,860
How would I know when you
will be back?

984
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,330
After all, we haven't been in touch

985
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,590
for several lifetimes.

986
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,550
It's too exaggerated.

987
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,430
How about going in for a sit

988
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,330
or would you like to go out

989
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,340
for something to eat?

990
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,330
If you're busy,

991
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,860
I can drive you home.

992
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,260
Wait for me for half a minute.

993
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,430
Forget it. I'll just leave my luggage
here.

994
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,860
It's OK. I drove here.

995
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,630
I'm off.

996
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:19,850
I'm leaving.

997
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,520
Stand.

998
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,770
Don't move.

999
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,740
Ms. Tang, you are so childish.

1000
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,720
You just got off the plane,

1001
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,070
go back and rest quickly.

1002
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,330
I'm leaving.

1003
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,340
Don't move.

1004
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,290
Dispel.

1005
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,850
Ms. Qin,

1006
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,560
I have thought about it.

1007
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,150
I won't drive today.

1008
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,490
I'm definitely going

1009
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,340
to have some drinks.

1010
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,410
Don't drink and drive,

1011
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,490
don't drive after drinking.

1012
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,150
I still need to strictly abide
by the traffic rules.

1013
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,660
VIP Client?

1014
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,970
I was just transferred here.

1015
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,780
I don't know many people yet.

1016
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,590
I saw the list yesterday.

1017
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,340
Your Yixiu is on the list.

1018
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,040
Well…

1019
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,070
It's not mine.

1020
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,120
They have cooperation

1021
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,640
with the Credit Card Center.

1022
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,180
it is normal to invite them.

1023
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,630
Take me with you? OK.

1024
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:36,820
See you later.

1025
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,170
Goodbye.

1026
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,020
(Little Manor)

1027
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,780
88.

1028
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,690
Very auspicious.

1029
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,660
(Elite Club)

1030
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,180
It seems that the senior leaders
have not arrived yet.

1031
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,450
They should be

1032
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,110
in the VIP room over there.

1033
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,960
Ms. Tang.

1034
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,440
Ms. Qin.

1035
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,070
Linlang, you look so beautiful today!

1036
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,860
Thank you, Ms. Tang.

1037
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,380
I'll go over there and say hello first.

1038
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,880
OK.

1039
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,330
Ms. Tang.

1040
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:09,890
This is my first time

1041
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,260
attending this kind of event today.

1042
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,340
Is there anything inappropriate?

1043
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:18,650
Nothing.

1044
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,110
How well can you hold your liquor?

1045
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,340
I can have a little.

1046
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,700
But I'm not particularly good
at drinking.

1047
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,300
Be careful yourself.

1048
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,640
After all, drinking too much alcohol

1049
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,740
makes people uncomfortable.

1050
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,210
Linlang.

1051
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,130
Ms. Tang.

1052
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,160
Drink less.

1053
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,000
OK.

1054
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,160
Jiang, do you want me

1055
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,000
to accompany you later?

1056
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,910
No need, you must be tired
after a busy day.

1057
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,180
I'll drop you off on my way.

1058
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,430
OK, Mr. Jiang.

1059
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,950
Usually, he…

1060
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:39,850
And then…

1061
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:40,810
- Let's go.
- What's wrong?

1062
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:41,860
Run quickly.

1063
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,210
Go.

1064
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,660
(Cafeteria)

1065
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,490
My aunt is on a business trip
to Hong Kong, China

1066
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,450
and will be back tomorrow.

1067
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,500
She said she bought me

1068
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,680
a limited edition pair of sneakers.

1069
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,690
Why did you buy sneakers again?

1070
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,600
I bought it for you.

1071
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,640
No problem at all.

1072
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,860
It looks good today.

1073
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,330
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with you?

1074
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:59,270
There is also shredded meat.

1075
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,290
It's nothing.

1076
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,680
More meat, please.

1077
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,520
Well…

1078
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,120
Are you OK? You don't look well.

1079
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,070
Just let me take a break.

1080
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,040
Well,

1081
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,560
the food in the cafeteria

1082
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,640
looks very unappetizing today.

1083
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,110
This chicken is delicious.

1084
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,290
By the way,

1085
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,780
I wanted to ask you

1086
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,370
why I noticed

1087
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,850
that you have been avoiding Yang
recently.

1088
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:17,950
Stop talking.

1089
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,080
Before the exam,

1090
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,450
she made me do three big questions.

1091
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,930
The exam had exactly the same
questions.

1092
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,410
I don't know

1093
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,300
why I still couldn't make it.

1094
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,520
The same questions? But you still
couldn't make it.

1095
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,720
You are going too far.

1096
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,560
I think so.

1097
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,810
So after I got the exam paper,

1098
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:31,650
I didn't dare to see her.

1099
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,120
If she catches me,

1100
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,260
just one word.

1101
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,160
Yang.

1102
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,080
Do the exam papers.

1103
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,920
