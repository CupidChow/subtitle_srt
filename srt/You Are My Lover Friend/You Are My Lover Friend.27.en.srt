Mr. Jiang.

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,560
Coffee?

29
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,270
Okay, I want an americano.

30
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,550
- Thanks.
- Another americano.

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,170
Working overtime today?

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,880
My colleagues are,

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,720
but I won't be.

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,720
Professor Wu Qiming from our school

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,830
won the Annual Economist Award

36
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,660
from Fortune Magazine.

37
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,750
We are preparing

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,920
to celebrate with Professor Wu

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
tonight.

40
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,870
There's a party.

41
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,870
What?

42
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,220
Did Tang Yang not tell you?

43
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,900
She'll also go.

44
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,940
She did; I forgot.

45
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,640
I always forget that you both

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,730
went to college together.

47
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,810
Your majors were different.

48
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,500
Professor Wu is a teacher
for their major.

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,230
Yes,

50
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,560
but Professor Wu also teaches

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,290
elective courses for our class.

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,800
Alright.

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,100
I'll take my leave.

54
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,590
(Tang Yang, Jiang Shiyan)

55
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,620
I'll pick you up later.

56
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,820
(Jiang Shiyan)

57
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,150
(Tang Yang)

58
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,040
No need. I have something to do.

59
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,970
I'll find you later.

60
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,670
Okay.

61
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,040
Linlang.

62
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,010
Did you see it?

63
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,800
This internet whiz, KB,

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,040
posted a video saying

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,730
that Sheng Nina's account was hacked,

66
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,280
and they've already identified

67
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,730
the hacker.

68
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,010
Based on this,
I've summarized two points.

69
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,290
First, there's photo editing.

70
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,360
Many netizens have analyzed it

71
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,970
from a technical perspective,

72
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,670
and some even found

73
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,290
the original images before the editing.

74
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,760
The images posted

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,920
on that so-called account

76
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,220
of Sheng Nina are fake.

77
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Second, it's to confirm

78
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,940
if there's hacking.

79
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,550
I checked

80
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,180
and discovered an astonishing fact.

81
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,520
The so-called

82
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,940
lewd chat account

83
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,240
came from the same

84
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
IP address.

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,560
We've encountered

86
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,690
a good Samaritan this time.

87
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,380
We didn't expect KB

88
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
to come out and prove

89
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,130
that the account was hacked.

90
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,240
He's a technical whiz

91
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,900
who's famous internationally.

92
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,880
Right, right.

93
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,760
Well then.

94
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,340
I'll leave the rest to you.

95
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,220
Okay, bye-bye.

96
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,810
This topic has surged to the top.

97
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,140
Nina,

98
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,830
look at the comments below.

99
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,180
They want to punish this hacker.

100
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,420
(Must report to the police.)

101
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,620
(This behavior cannot be tolerated!
Must protect Nina's rights!)

102
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,730
This is great.

103
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,460
The injustice is vindicated.

104
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,950
The company received an email

105
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,910
with the hacker's real IP address.

106
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,560
I had our lawyer contact the police.

107
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,580
Must bring him to justice.

108
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,520
Why would KB help me

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,660
when we are

110
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,170
not even related?

111
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,410
He's just a good Samaritan?

112
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,700
Good people do exist.

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,530
Maybe he's your fan.

114
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,390
I've asked a friend to contact him.

115
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,050
He's not an ordinary person.

116
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,640
His identity and industry status

117
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,580
speak for themselves.

118
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,030
No one will say we bought

119
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,780
the articles to clear our names.

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,220
Anyway,

121
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,000
we have to find a chance

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,220
to thank him in person.

123
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,620
Yang.

124
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,780
A package just arrived with flowers.

125
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,540
I placed them on your desk.

126
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,260
Sure. Thanks.

127
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,300
These flowers are beautiful.

128
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,380
I'm the witness of your love.

129
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,700
Stop joking; stop it.

130
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,540
You get back to work.

131
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,580
(Tang Yang)

132
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,980
(To make up for the past.)

133
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,300
(From: Song Jing)
No, this...

134
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,900
("Tang Yang" recalled a message)

135
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,980
("Tang Yang" recalled a message)

136
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,260
I recalled so quickly.

137
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,500
He's usually busy.

138
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,580
He probably didn't see it.

139
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,180
(Jiang Shiyan)
What

140
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,500
horrible message did you recall?

141
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,020
Mr. Jiang.

142
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,940
Here's the thing.

143
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,580
I just sent you a picture of flowers.

144
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,580
When I saw them,

145
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,940
I thought they were from you,

146
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,100
so I happily took a photo

147
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,740
with them.

148
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,060
But I realized

149
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,620
they didn't seem to be from you.

150
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,260
So, who sent them?

151
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,980
They're from Song Jing.

152
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,540
What's he up to?

153
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,740
He's eating my food on my turf
and sending flowers

154
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,820
to my girlfriend?

155
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,340
Does he want to leave here alive?

156
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,140
No, I don't know.

157
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,020
This person

158
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,780
must have been crazy.

159
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,500
He must have lost his mind.

160
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,300
Now, look.

161
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,740
Look at the flowers.

162
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,980
I'll throw them in the trash can

163
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,620
and let them sit

164
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,260
in this dark little corner,

165
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,180
out of the sunlight.

166
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,460
I won't water them.

167
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,580
I'll just let them

168
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,940
wither and die here.

169
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,020
Is that okay?

170
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,140
If you think that's not okay,

171
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,660
I'll just beat them up a bit.

172
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,980
I'll beat them up.

173
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,820
Okay?

174
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,100
Okay, okay, okay.

175
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,980
My Tang knows how to comfort me.

176
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,980
Wait for me.

177
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,420
I'll get you a bigger,

178
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,420
more beautiful bouquet.

179
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,620
No, no, no, don't.

180
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,060
Please don't send it to the office.

181
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,180
That'd be too silly.

182
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,220
Many people are here.

183
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,180
We can keep

184
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,940
our sweetness to ourselves.

185
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,100
I don't want

186
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,300
a public display of affection.

187
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,740
That's fine.

188
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,020
Take a photo

189
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,420
of the trash can for me.

190
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,780
I'll remember it.

191
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,580
So childish.

192
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,100
Take a picture of it?

193
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,180
Alright, got it.

194
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,420
Bye-bye.

195
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,740
(Tang Yang)

196
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,900
Didn't you say it's childish?

197
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,260
(Jiang Shiyan)

198
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,580
(Tang Yang)
Then I'll recall it.

199
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,860
(Jiang Shiyan)
Saved.

200
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,980
Come on, you've all worked hard.

201
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,940
Have some fruit.

202
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,260
I was looking for you.

203
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,380
- Thanks.
- No problem.

204
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,300
Why did you need me?

205
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,180
Talk to Tang Yang.

206
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,340
No idea what's wrong.

207
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,460
She just got furious.

208
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,700
What's wrong?

209
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,460
Someone

210
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,780
sent her a bouquet.

211
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,620
Look.

212
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,340
She threw it away

213
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,580
and even stomped on it.

214
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,620
Oh, my gosh.

215
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,580
She must really hate whoever

216
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,700
sent those flowers.

217
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,940
Or why would she throw away the flowers

218
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,820
and stomp on them?

219
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,700
What a pity.

220
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,740
Yeah.

221
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,100
Please talk to her later.

222
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,500
Mr. Song, have some fruit.

223
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,020
Okay.

224
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,260
Don't you have plans tonight?

225
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,980
No.

226
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,020
I just

227
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,260
visited Professor Wu

228
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,460
from my alma mater

229
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,780
with some gifts.

230
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,820
He has won

231
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,860
the Annual Economist Award

232
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,620
from Fortune Magazine.

233
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,700
I went to congratulate him.

234
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,740
He said he had a dinner party tonight,

235
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,620
so I left.

236
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Song Jing told me

237
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,500
you were having a party
to celebrate

238
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,740
for Professor Wu.

239
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,500
I looked at that group.

240
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,860
Many of them aren't my classmates.

241
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,900
I don't know a lot of them.

242
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,420
I've only seen them once or twice.

243
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,500
They're all just trying

244
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,380
to get close to Mr. Wu

245
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,660
since he won an award.

246
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,860
I thought about it.

247
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,860
I didn't want

248
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,580
to socialize with those acquaintances

249
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,340
so I didn't go.

250
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,260
Jiang Shiyan.

251
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,620
Do you think the reason

252
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,780
I haven't mentioned

253
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,260
Song Jing much over the years

254
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,860
is that he caused me

255
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,380
a lot of emotional pain?

256
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,500
Actually, I...

257
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,460
It's because

258
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,620
I feel embarrassed

259
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,900
that I don't bring him up.

260
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,020
Can you elaborate?

261
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,620
Regardless of everything,

262
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,660
we were high school classmates

263
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,020
and ended up at the same university.

264
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,060
Though we weren't in the same major,

265
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,180
we were in the same dept.

266
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,940
We took many elective courses together.

267
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,260
So at first,

268
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,500
we went to class together

269
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,900
and went to the library for books.

270
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,460
He was proactive in contacting me.

271
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,860
So, it looked a bit

272
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,500
like we were dating.

273
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,740
But later,

274
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,140
I realized something

275
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,980
was off.

276
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,580
For example,

277
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,140
he asked me to help him

278
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,380
with some volunteer work
in the department,

279
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,660
but he went to attend

280
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,860
some student council events.

281
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,700
What?

282
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,140
He asked me out for dinner

283
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,380
but suddenly canceled,

284
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,020
saying he was going

285
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,660
to a senior's birthday party.

286
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,900
In short, whenever that senior

287
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,860
called him,

288
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,220
he'd show up right away.

289
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,020
For things like picking up packages,

290
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,380
returning books,

291
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,420
and saving seats,

292
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,860
he left all that to me.

293
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,140
I just felt

294
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,300
I was a...

295
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,580
I was like a...

296
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,500
- Backup.
- Yes, a backup.

297
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,380
So what happened next?

298
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,540
Later,

299
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,540
when he asked me out,
of course, I couldn't go.

300
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,100
When he messaged me, I didn't reply.

301
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,140
One day, he came

302
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,300
to explain to me

303
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,140
that the senior
from the student council

304
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,340
came from a finance background.

305
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,740
He wanted to get
an internship opportunity

306
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,180
during the summer.

307
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,300
I suddenly thought it was

308
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,660
too ridiculous.

309
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,380
After that, I completely ignored him.

310
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,660
Then I heard he got a spot

311
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,660
as an exchange student abroad,

312
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,940
and we lost contact.

313
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,220
Why do you feel embarrassed about this?

314
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,780
He's the one with no shame.

315
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,900
Tang, why didn't you tell me earlier?

316
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
Are you an idiot?

317
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,620
You suffered such a huge loss.

318
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,900
I... I...

319
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,300
I didn't suffer any loss.

320
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,740
That's not what I meant.

321
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,780
About this matter,

322
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,980
why did he treat you this way?

323
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,220
Did he treat you as a fool?

324
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,340
Yeah, I also feel like

325
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,100
I've been treated like a fool,

326
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,300
so I don't want to talk about it.

327
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,260
At the beginning of the school year,

328
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,860
he was really proactive with me.

329
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,820
The department started teasing us,

330
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,500
saying Song Jing was pursuing me,

331
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,980
and we were going to date.

332
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,700
I'd never been in a relationship.

333
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,380
I even felt

334
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,620
a little giddy about it.

335
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,260
I even told Jiang Yan'an about it.

336
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,260
But then,

337
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,940
he started going around

338
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,380
with that senior.

339
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,140
Everyone started saying

340
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,460
that Song Jing had dumped me.

341
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,820
I didn't know how to explain that.

342
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,260
I felt like my pride

343
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,780
was being crushed.

344
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,220
So I stopped bringing it up.

345
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,780
Every time I think about it,

346
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,620
I wish

347
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,700
that part didn't happen.

348
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,660
We could just be classmates.

349
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,580
Now, after all these years,

350
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,780
we don't talk anymore.

351
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,860
Let's not talk about it.

352
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,100
But I'm really angry.

353
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,940
You were bullied.

354
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,420
Don't be angry.

355
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,820
Think about it.

356
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,420
It's because he's so terrible

357
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,260
that it made me realize

358
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,500
how special you are.

359
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,300
You should thank him.

360
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,740
Thank him?

361
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,780
While that logic is true,

362
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,020
I'm still really angry.

363
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,660
Tang,

364
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,780
if there's ever something

365
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
that upsets you,

366
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,740
you must tell me.

367
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,660
Don't hold it in, okay?

368
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,060
Then I think you're a big fool.

369
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,220
What's wrong?

370
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,540
Think about it.

371
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,500
If I'm even a little unhappy,

372
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,220
you can instantly tell.

373
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,060
Just like how I can immediately sense

374
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,860
when something's off with you.

375
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,620
So there's no need for either of us

376
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,020
to hold anything in.

377
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,500
We can't hide it.

378
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,540
Don't be angry anymore.

379
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,020
We've cleared everything up.

380
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,460
Tomorrow when I see Song,

381
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,740
I'll definitely still be angry.

382
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,820
No way.

383
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,900
I must vent this anger.

384
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,460
The contract list

385
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,420
of suppliers is here.

386
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,380
Lisa, take a look.

387
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,220
Okay.

388
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,260
Alex, are you alright?

389
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,420
I'm fine.

390
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,420
My rhinitis is acting up.

391
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,940
Why are there suddenly

392
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,900
so many flowers today?

393
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,220
It seems

394
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,460
Mr. Jiang thinks we've been

395
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,500
stuck in the room

396
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,340
every day,

397
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,380
so he asked them to improve

398
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,340
the environment

399
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,500
to lift our spirits.

400
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,260
Can you take them out first?

401
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,100
Sure, sure.

402
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,780
Mr. Song, Peter.

403
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,180
(Conference Room)

404
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,100
Mr. Jiang,

405
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,340
can I help you?

406
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,180
No, no.

407
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,260
I see your eyes are red.

408
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,900
- Boss.
- Do you need some medicine?

409
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,460
- Xu Xiang.
- Coming.

410
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,500
I'll send it over soon.

411
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,660
What's wrong?

412
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,620
Well.

413
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,540
How's the plan

414
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,380
for the store going?

415
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,500
It's almost done.

416
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,580
Are you in a hurry?

417
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,620
Not in a hurry.

418
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,460
Shall I send you what hasn't

419
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,300
been modified yet?

420
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,300
Not in a hurry; finish your part first.

421
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,900
- Then I'll leave.
- Go ahead.

422
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,100
(Conference Room, CBBC)

423
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,040
President Zhou.

424
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,420
President Zhou, President Gao.

425
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,100
Everyone, take a seat.

426
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,740
Let me introduce you.

427
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,300
This is Xiao Qin, a financial engineer

428
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,100
from the HQ research institute.

429
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,780
Hello, everyone.

430
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,980
This is analyst Xu Chuang.

431
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,100
This is researcher Meng Xinxin.

432
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,140
Based on the HQ's,

433
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,940
multi-level, sustainable overall policy

434
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,340
of fully supporting small

435
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,220
and micro enterprises,

436
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,580
the research institute is jointly

437
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,100
piloting the Huijie Loan

438
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,180
with the Rongcheng Branch.

439
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,260
In a moment,

440
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,140
we'll have Mr. Xiao

441
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,260
introduce the details

442
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,260
of this product.

443
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,060
I'd like to announce

444
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,580
the main members of the Huijie Loan

445
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,540
R&D team.

446
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,540
The team leader is

447
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,500
Vice President Gao Haifeng
of the Rongcheng Branch.

448
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,620
The deputy leaders

449
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,060
are Engineer Xiao Qin

450
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,660
from the HQ research institute

451
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
and Deputy Director

452
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,020
Tang Yang of the Credit Audit Division

453
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,980
at the branch.

454
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,980
Besides the two colleagues

455
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,380
from the research institute,

456
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,020
the leader and deputy leaders
will decide

457
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,060
on other members.

458
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,380
Get me an americano.

459
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,780
Oh, right.

460
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,180
I need to talk to you.

461
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
I just went to explain

462
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,420
an accounts receivable to Song Jing.

463
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,220
Why was he sneezing the whole time?

464
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,740
His eyes looked so red.

465
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,260
He has allergic rhinitis.

466
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,380
How do you know?

467
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,660
In high school,

468
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,140
the teacher's birthday came up.

469
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,300
We bought a bouquet and put it

470
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,180
on the desk.

471
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,100
He sneezed

472
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,980
the entire class.

473
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,580
He said he was allergic.

474
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,220
- You forgot?
- Is that so?

475
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,780
You don't remember?

476
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,620
I'm too busy to remember

477
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,860
everything like you.

478
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,580
My talent is having

479
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,700
a good memory and being petty.

480
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,300
Mr. Jiang.

481
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,420
Director Xia and Mayor Yan are here.

482
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,020
Hello, hello.

483
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,860
Mayor Yan.

484
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,980
This is our president,

485
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,180
Mr. Jiang Shiyan.

486
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,020
- Jiang.
- Hello.

487
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,700
This is our CEO,

488
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,460
Mr. Feng Weiran.

489
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,300
Hello, Mr. Feng.

490
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,660
I heard from Tang Yang

491
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,620
you're childhood friends

492
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,940
in high school.

493
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,140
Let me introduce you.

494
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,940
This is Yan Qi, Mayor Yan.

495
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
We're neighbors

496
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,140
and grew up together.

497
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,940
Shall we chat in the office?

498
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,780
Sure.

499
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,420
- This way, please.
- This way.

500
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,860
Alright, today's meeting ends here.

501
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,540
Sis.

502
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,140
Didn't expect to see you so soon.

503
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,980
Mr. Xiao.

504
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,940
I mentioned at the graduation dinner

505
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,340
that we'd see each other again soon.

506
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,700
I didn't know.

507
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,820
I heard that Lanqing

508
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,060
is also in Rongcheng today.

509
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,380
Shall we have dinner tonight?

510
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,380
Sounds good.

511
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,780
- Let's go.
- It's settled then.

512
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,620
Alright.

513
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,900
President Zhou.

514
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,940
President Zhou.

515
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,020
The Huijie Loan

516
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,140
is a pilot credit product from the HQ

517
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,460
and will be promoted to the entire bank.

518
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,700
Since our branch was chosen...

519
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,700
Do you think

520
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,660
you should be the deputy leader

521
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,580
to help with this project?

522
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,660
Tang Yang is still new.

523
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
She isn't that familiar

524
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,820
with the division's business.

525
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,660
The Huijie Loan will need to integrate

526
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,180
data from the past ten years.

527
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,700
Xiao Qin mentioned her
to the research institute.

528
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,580
Xiao Qin only put this project

529
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,780
in our branch

530
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,980
because of her.

531
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,940
Don't you understand?

532
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,420
It's well-known

533
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,740
that this project will have

534
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,260
an innovative product.

535
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,900
All the branches are competing for this.

536
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,820
If our branch wants to secure

537
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,260
an additional commendation

538
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,380
from the HQ by the end of the year,

539
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,620
it all hinges on this.

540
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,140
Tang Yang

541
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,340
brought the project

542
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,940
to our branch,

543
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,380
so her being the deputy leader

544
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,100
is fully justified.

545
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,740
Here, please.

546
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,140
This is our snack product

547
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,140
display area.

548
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,100
So annoying.

549
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,860
Those brands and events are asking

550
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,980
for your schedule

551
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,380
and want you to attend.

552
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,500
I've made a schedule.

553
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,300
With the flight time, it's full.

554
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,100
By the way,

555
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,020
last time we talked about thanking KB.

556
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,220
Did you get in touch with him?

557
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,020
He helped us with such a big favor.

558
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,140
We should really thank him in person.

559
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
I contacted a big shot

560
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,180
who was his colleague

561
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,140
at a major company

562
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,980
and found him.

563
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,060
The big shot told me

564
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,060
that KB went

565
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,420
to participate in a hiking event

566
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,060
and wouldn't be back for two months.

567
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,620
He created a group for us.

568
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,300
KB said no need to thank him.

569
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,180
The supporting files

570
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,980
were sent to him by a friend.

571
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,820
He verified that they were indeed real

572
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,180
before agreeing to help.

573
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,700
A friend?

574
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,740
Did he say who this friend is?

575
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,220
It's another big shot

576
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,260
in their circle,

577
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,460
with a weird online name,

578
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,100
something like "A Feili".

579
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,260
I can't even pronounce it.

580
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,220
Can we reach this Feili?

581
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,540
KB doesn't know him either.

582
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,420
They just chat online

583
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,420
and have never met in real life.

584
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,100
So, this means KB helped me

585
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,540
for someone he doesn't even know?

586
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,540
Why?

587
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,540
Feili had helped KB

588
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,820
with technical issues twice online,

589
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,660
so he asked for KB's help.

590
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,580
After KB received his information,

591
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,500
he verified it

592
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,660
and confirmed it was true,

593
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,500
feeling that we were

594
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,540
indeed wronged,

595
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,620
so he made that video

596
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,780
to help us prove our case.

597
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,140
By the way, the police

598
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,140
have found the hacker.

599
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,580
I'm discussing with the lawyer

600
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,780
about the lawsuit.

601
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,060
Good.

602
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,700
As for Yixiu,

603
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,860
Mr. Jiang is the only one

604
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,740
who supported us,

605
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,140
so we should thank him

606
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,380
in person too.

607
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,140
Days ago, I sent

608
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,700
a lot of fruit over

609
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,620
and ordered some wine

610
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,620
for them.

611
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,300
Do you think we should

612
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,900
invite them for dinner as well?

613
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,300
Absolutely.

614
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,900
OK, I'll ask them.

615
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,940
Let me handle it.

616
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,940
To show my sincerity.

617
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,460
Sure.

618
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,180
Today's talk has been great.

619
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,500
Thanks a lot to Mr. Jiang and Mr. Feng.

620
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,060
- You're too kind.
- Thanks

621
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,300
to Tang for making it happen.

622
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,380
When I get back,

623
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,380
I'll recap these matters with Mayor Yan.

624
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,380
Lanqing, no need to be so polite.

625
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,780
We're all from CBBC.

626
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,340
This is also beneficial

627
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,380
for Yixiu.

628
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,900
I'll have our marketing

629
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,020
and planning colleagues

630
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,420
conduct a field investigation

631
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,620
to collect data.

632
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,740
We'll discuss this later

633
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,820
with a preliminary plan.

634
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,780
Okay.

635
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,940
After I get back,

636
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,900
I'll send over

637
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,420
the relevant data

638
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,940
you need.

639
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,260
Besides the winery,

640
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,220
we'll also collect and organize

641
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,500
some of the unique

642
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,860
local delicacies

643
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,940
to create

644
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,420
what you call

645
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,980
the matrix.

646
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,020
The food matrix.

647
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,740
- Yes, yes.
- Matrix.

648
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,100
Our winery still retains

649
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,500
the unique

650
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,380
ancient brewing methods.

651
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,620
If we can really

652
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,980
cooperate with Yixiu,

653
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,300
implement the project,

654
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,460
and promote

655
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,380
what the ancient town has,

656
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,820
it would certainly boost

657
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,140
our cultural tourism industry.

658
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,900
Well.

659
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,300
We'll head back now.

660
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,540
Xiao, how long do you plan

661
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,020
to stay for this pilot project?

662
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,780
About a month or so.

663
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,020
After getting the initial data,

664
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,100
I'll go back once

665
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,660
to draft a preliminary report.

666
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,620
Your project is getting

667
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,180
attention from the headquarters.

668
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,740
The branches are competing for it.

669
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,460
Are you staying in Rongcheng

670
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,260
because of your Tang?

671
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,100
You picked the right person.

672
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,740
Tang Yang created

673
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,260
a risk control plan for CBBC

674
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,180
and even won

675
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,380
the Newcomer of the Year.

676
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,700
Mr. Jiang knows it so well.

677
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,460
So, Tang,

678
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,860
if I'm not mistaken,

679
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,380
he must be your boyfriend.

680
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,160
During our meeting,

681
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,500
Mr. Jiang took good care of you.

682
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,800
The cap was off before you got it.

683
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,660
Mr. Xiao,

684
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,260
you're wrong about this.

685
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,660
This is really not right.

686
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,820
We've been brothers

687
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,940
with Yang for over a decade.

688
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,460
Jiang Shiyan and Tang Yang

689
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,860
are even closer.

690
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,220
They're like real brothers.

691
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,060
You're wrong about this.

692
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,060
The car is here.

693
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,540
- Well.
- Director Xia, Mayor Yan.

694
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,220
See you next time.

695
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,900
- Alright.
- Hope everything goes well.

696
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,740
Goodbye, Mr. Jiang.

697
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,860
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.

698
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,540
- Bye, no worries.
- Goodbye, Mr. Cheng.

699
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,380
Goodbye.

700
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,700
Xiao, which way are you going?

701
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
We're going the same way.

702
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,780
Then let's go together.

703
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,340
Let's go, bye-bye.

704
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,820
See you next time, bye-bye.

705
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,020
Thanks, thanks, bye-bye.

706
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,420
Sis, we have a meeting at 9 am tomorrow.

707
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,340
Okay, see you tomorrow.

708
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,180
Bye-bye.

709
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,220
Bye-bye.

710
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,420
I didn't drive.

711
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,500
I did.

712
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,380
It's still early.

713
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,620
Are we going to your place

714
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,540
or mine?

715
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,740
There's a new movie I want to see.

716
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,060
Let's go.

717
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,940
Let's see the movie.

718
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,700
What's wrong?

719
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,420
You wait a moment.

720
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,700
What's going on with those two?

721
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,740
Are they together?

722
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,980
Right.

723
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,820
Listen to me carefully.

724
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,500
This is what I'm asking.

725
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,340
What do you mean?

726
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,380
I mean the kind
in a romantic relationship.

727
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,220
Yeah.

728
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,540
No way.

729
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,900
When did this happen?

730
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,180
You might be the only one

731
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,100
who doesn't know.

732
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,300
What?

733
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,900
Where's my phone?

734
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,620
I don't know either.

735
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,100
Yang and Shiyan?

736
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
That's right.

737
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,900
Yang and Shiyan?

738
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,740
Didn't see that coming, huh?

739
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,620
What day is it today, honey?

740
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,620
Today,

741
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,540
Yang and Shiyan held hands

742
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,500
and sweetly

743
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,580
walked past me,

744
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,740
debating whether to go

745
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,460
to his place or her place.

746
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,820
Whose place did they go?

747
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,580
Whose place did they go?

748
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,540
They went to see a movie.

749
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,140
To Yang's place.

750
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,700
Wait a minute.

751
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,060
Why Yang's place?

752
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,460
I won't be able to sleep tonight

753
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,460
until I figure this out.

754
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,300
Can you sleep?

755
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,340
I can't sleep either. Let's go.

756
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,020
Dear, sit down.

757
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,500
Don't rush. I'm asking why we are

758
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,580
going to Yang's place

759
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,540
to find them.

760
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,500
First,

761
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,100
after watching the movie,

762
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,980
Jiang Shiyan will take Yang home.

763
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,500
Second,

764
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,780
Jiang Shiyan's mom

765
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,060
lives...

766
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,940
Next door to him.

767
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,260
If they want to do...

768
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,820
Something indescribable.

769
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,980
So, where can they go?

770
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,420
Yang's place.

771
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,420
Let's go.

772
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,820
Dad?

773
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,740
Mom?

774
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,660
We forgot about our son.

775
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,140
Come here, son.

776
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,660
Don't run. Come on.

777
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,100
This movie is really bad.

778
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,260
Right?

779
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,140
Do you want any drinks?

780
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,460
No need. Last month,

781
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,540
you promoted lemon juice

782
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,940
and brought me several boxes.

783
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,500
What about snacks?

784
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,500
You put so many snacks

785
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,700
at home.

786
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,340
I wouldn't finish them in months.

787
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,060
How about some pastries for breakfast?

788
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,860
Yeah. I just bought you

789
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,060
some vegetable buns

790
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,500
and oatmeal porridge.

791
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,780
You're so annoying.

792
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,460
You've completely ruined

793
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,580
my joy of grocery shopping.

794
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,220
When I think about shopping,

795
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,500
I feel like we already have it.

796
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,220
No. You can shop if you want.

797
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,100
I can take some back to the office.

798
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,380
Wait.

799
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,420
I do need to buy something,

800
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,660
but it's not

801
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,980
convenient to take you along.

802
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,140
So, you wait here for me.

803
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,420
I'll go get it and come back.

804
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,820
No need to buy that.

805
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,220
The online store will have

806
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,260
discounts in a few days.

807
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,380
I've already checked it out.

808
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,460
But how do you know

809
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,740
what brand I use?

810
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,780
The other day, while cleaning,

811
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,020
I wiped down the cabinet
in the bathroom,

812
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,860
so I took it out.

813
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,100
Then?

814
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,860
Then I just went online to check

815
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,860
the reviews to see if it was good.

816
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,540
How did you review it?

817
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,860
I see how others review it.

818
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,420
No big deal.

819
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,860
- I...
- Don't laugh.

820
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
We need some dish soap.

821
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,060
We don't have dish soap.

822
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,460
I have a call.

823
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,220
Peng Si.

824
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,540
Thanks.

825
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,260
Hello, Peng Si?

826
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,740
In two days?

827
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,180
I have no problem.

828
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,260
I'm okay with it.

829
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,140
Okay, okay. Good.

830
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,660
Let's leave it at that.

831
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,980
Alright.

832
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,140
Okay.

833
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,420
Look.

834
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,100
What's this?

835
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,140
Look at the shadow.

836
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,860
You look like you have wings

837
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,860
and are flying.

838
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,020
Every time I hold you,

839
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,340
I really feel

840
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,620
this dizzy happiness of flying.

841
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,420
Good thing we bought dish soap.

842
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,980
I can get rid of your grease.

843
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,740
I quit.

844
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,300
- Go on.
- I won't say it.

845
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,900
Go on, go on.

846
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,260
Greasy.

847
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,980
Greasy, but I like it.

848
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,580
I just like your grease.

849
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,460
You heard Mr. Xiao say

850
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,230
I have a meeting at 9 am tomorrow.

851
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,260
So I definitely need

852
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,380
to rest early tonight.

853
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,180
You should head back early too.

854
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,180
I'm going to drop something off.

855
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,540
To drop off dish soap?

856
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,500
I can put it away myself.

857
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,060
What are you doing?

858
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,340
I...

859
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,540
Godfather, Godmother.

860
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,740
Oh my, you scared me.

861
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,580
What are you doing?

862
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,420
Come out.

863
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,700
Now, even my son knows

864
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,580
you two are a couple?

865
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,420
No.

866
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,500
Qi has always

867
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,580
called us that.

868
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,420
Right.

869
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,620
That's true.

870
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,980
- Let's go.
- Come inside; we need to talk.

871
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,780
You two...

872
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,980
Are you two people I know?

873
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,860
You're not.

874
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,580
You're not either.

875
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,980
You guys. Oh my God.

876
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,940
You two...

877
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,140
You two are too scary.

878
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,980
Dear.

879
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,660
Good for you two.

880
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,500
Impressive.

881
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,460
This is Oscar-worthy acting.

882
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,700
Oscar-worthy acting.

883
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,220
- Best Actor.
- Best Actress.

884
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,740
How long has it been?

885
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,580
Tell us.

886
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,740
Half a month?

887
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,380
Not just half a month?

888
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,540
A month?

889
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,380
Not just a month?

890
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,860
Be honest with us.

891
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,700
How long has it been?

892
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,140
No, when did we

893
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,260
actually start dating?

894
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,260
That time outside your place?

895
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,700
- Which time?
- That doesn't count.

896
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,660
We didn't confirm our relationship.

897
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,580
So, when did it actually start?

898
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,180
- That time at the hospital?
- What?

899
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,300
No, that was a bit late.

900
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,180
It's before that.

901
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,700
Before that...

902
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,340
I can't figure it out.

903
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,420
Forget it; don't count it.

904
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,260
No, no. We need to clarify this.

905
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,380
We'll have our anniversary.

906
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,740
Right.

907
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,980
When do we think we got together?

908
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,180
You even mention an anniversary now.

909
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,060
Feels like we need to go back

910
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,460
a couple of days.

911
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,020
- What's this?
- What's going on?

912
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,420
What do they take us for?

913
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,620
Air?

914
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,940
What do you think we are?

915
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,580
Invisible people? We're right here.

916
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,580
No, we're just counting the days.

917
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,420
Counting what days?

918
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,380
Outside your place.

919
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,020
Didn't you hear about the anniversary?

920
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,980
It's outside my place.

921
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,140
You kissed me.

922
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,340
(Sheng Nina)

923
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,620
(Sheng Nina)
I'd like to treat

924
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,660
you guys to dinner.

925
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,900
Is there anything you like to eat?

926
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,700
(Cheng Hui)
Steak.

927
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,020
The latest news I've heard

928
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,420
is Feng Weiran has told the board

929
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,380
about our cooperation.

930
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,580
This news came from one

931
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,580
of Yixiu's investors.

932
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,740
A manager from Tiange Group

933
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,340
mentioned it during a dinner party

934
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,420
last night.

935
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,540
For this collaboration with Yixiu,

936
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,740
we've set a total budget of 3 billion.

937
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,820
So high?

938
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,300
Yixiu isn't just an ordinary

939
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,940
traditional company.

940
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,180
After this round of financing,

941
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,980
they're aiming for an IPO.

942
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,580
You can check out

943
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,820
what the minimum is
for internet companies

944
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,540
of the same size during their IPO.

945
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,340
The number we've set

946
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,580
could only be lower.

947
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,020
But right now,

948
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,660
we haven't agreed with Yixiu yet.

949
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,220
Even if we do,

950
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,460
according to our proposal,

951
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,340
it will just be

952
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,540
a joint venture with them.

953
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,940
In this company,

954
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,260
can we have

955
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,700
over 51% equity?

956
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,100
Currently, that's the condition

957
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,140
we're discussing with them.

958
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,700
Yixiu hasn't

959
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,580
clearly stated that it's unfeasible.

960
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,580
We just paid off

961
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,940
400 million in bank loans.

962
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,340
Nearly a billion is due next month.

963
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,340
At this time,

964
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,020
investing 3 billion...

965
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,060
As for the 3 billion,

966
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,300
you can trust me.

967
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,660
Investors will want to invest.

968
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,300
So I need

969
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,580
a very detailed plan

970
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,780
to show to the investors.

971
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,860
But the property

972
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,700
we put forward for Yixiu

973
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,580
doesn't have a clear development plan.

974
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,620
Then let's create

975
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,980
a clear development plan.

976
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,940
Mr. Liu, Mr. Wang.

977
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,220
Mr. Zhou Mo.

978
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,620
How is our cooperation

979
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,860
with Yixiu progressing?

980
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,580
It's going smoothly.

981
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,380
Yixiu lacks funding and support

982
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,340
for implementation.

983
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,420
We just happen to fill that gap.

984
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,540
But the several plots

985
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,620
we provided to Yixiu

986
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,780
are about to be transferred

987
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,060
and won't belong to us.

988
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,020
Didn't Ms. Wei say so?

989
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,540
It's not really a transfer.

990
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,620
They just added

991
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,540
a few joint developers.

992
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,220
Even if Jiujiang Property can't

993
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,620
act independently in the future,

994
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,660
there's no problem discussing

995
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,940
a partnership with Yixiu.

996
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,820
This project is also beneficial

997
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,860
for the other

998
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,380
joint developers.

999
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,220
Right?

1000
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,780
We'll make a proposal

1001
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,460
for the investment institutions.

1002
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,740
Okay.

1003
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,340
Mr. Liu,

1004
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,420
there's one more thing.

1005
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,300
Ms. Wei's expectation

1006
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,340
for this project is

1007
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,380
quick progress.

1008
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,940
You know that funds

1009
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,700
have a circulation cycle.

1010
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,580
Institutional investors

1011
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,700
have long and slow
decision-making processes.

1012
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,780
So...

1013
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,420
The last four items have errors.

1014
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,900
- Director Gan.
- Sit down.

1015
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,740
Re-enter this document.

1016
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,260
- Proofread it.
- Okay.

1017
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,100
Check this data,

1018
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,140
and cross-reference it.

1019
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,540
Mr. Xiao, please take a look.

1020
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,500
Some bad loan ratios

1021
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,460
still have some issues.

1022
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,300
Ran the model several times;
it's still wrong.

1023
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,140
- Let me see.
- This 20,480

1024
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,860
should be changed to 10,480.

1025
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,380
Our project's final payment...

1026
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,140
Deputy Director Tang.

1027
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,140
Come on.

1028
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,460
Changed the address.

1029
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,700
It's office hours.

1030
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,540
What's going on?

1031
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,020
Several branches'
bad loan ratios are fine

1032
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,140
when calculated

1033
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,020
on a one-year basis

1034
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,140
but when calculated

1035
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,100
on a two-year basis,

1036
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,740
they exceed the standard by five times.

1037
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,180
- That high?
- Yes.

1038
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,060
Come with me to take a look.

1039
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,060
Let's go.

1040
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,900
This time, to do the Huijie loan,

1041
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,460
all the loan files in the past ten years

1042
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,500
should be put in the model

1043
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
and run again.

1044
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,580
Problems could arise at any moment.

1045
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,180
I completed some transactions
last month.

1046
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,900
Can we slow down this month?

1047
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,860
No.

1048
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,700
Zhou Mo...

1049
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,860
He told me

1050
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,220
he's handled Tang Yang.

1051
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,140
Can Tang Yang

1052
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,580
be so easily handled?

1053
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,260
Zhou Mo is just fooling you.

1054
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,420
Just buy me some time, so I can

1055
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,940
find the funds for construction.

1056
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,860
(Viewed by: Xu Shanshan)

1057
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,460
(Xu Shanshan)

1058
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,100
(Xu Shanshan)

1059
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,820
(Song Jing:
I'll go find you.)

1060
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,140
(Tang Yang: Okay.)
Are you done?

1061
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,980
(Tang Yang)

1062
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,540
Tang Yang.

1063
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,780
You've been here since noon.

1064
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,900
Aren't you going to eat?

1065
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,220
Song Jing said

1066
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,380
he had to leave

1067
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,740
and asked me to watch his bag.

1068
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,660
He'll come back later

1069
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,580
for dinner with me in the cafeteria.

1070
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,220
I just saw Song Jing in the cafeteria.

1071
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,380
He was having dinner

1072
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,620
with the student union members.

1073
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,460
Maybe he's asking

1074
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,060
the student union for something.

1075
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,020
(Song Jing)
Meeting with the student union members.

1076
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,340
Yeah, right there.

1077
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,180
Is it fun?

1078
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,140
Pretty fun.
