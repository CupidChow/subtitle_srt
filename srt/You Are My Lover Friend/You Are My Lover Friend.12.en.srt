She was a child star,

174
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,180
but I read online

175
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,630
that she was not a professional actress.

176
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,780
We don't know that.

177
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,090
She debuted

178
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,660
at It Takes Two when she was seven.

179
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,160
She starred in some movies and dramas
when she was a kid.

180
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,540
She didn't study Theater and Film
in college

181
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,470
but majored in Geography
at Southwest University.

182
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,680
Later, she participated in

183
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,270
National College Drama Competition

184
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,630
and won the championship,

185
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,300
so she became an actress again.

186
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,350
Why do you know her so well?

187
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,300
It's my job.

188
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,180
You're so professional, aren't you?

189
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,370
You should go back.

190
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,350
We can go downstairs ourselves.

191
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,110
Sorry for today.

192
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,330
I was caught up by something

193
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,180
and didn't take care of you.

194
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,290
It's okay.

195
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,760
It's rare to see Rongcheng's first snow
on New Year's Eve.

196
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,650
You should spend time

197
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,390
with your destined person.

198
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,590
His destined person

199
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,590
is me.

200
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,760
Happy New Year.

201
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,270
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

202
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,420
- See you.
- See you.

203
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,600
Let's go.

204
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,350
Making origami lucky stars
to make a wish

205
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,970
might be too childish

206
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,180
for children,

207
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,870
but it's proper for adults.

208
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,060
When we were young,
it was the proper way.

209
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,920
And now it's also proper

210
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,820
for us.

211
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,470
Then it's about age.

212
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,750
We're just the right people.

213
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,210
Stop it!

214
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,490
Mine is better.

215
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,610
Mine is better. It's full.

216
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,300
- My star has angles.
- Mine is bulging.

217
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,920
Come on. It's New Year.

218
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,390
It's time to carry on our tradition.

219
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,450
Come on.

220
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Come on.

221
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,770
When this bottle is full,

222
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,700
we'll be old people.

223
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,020
It's almost dawn.

224
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,180
We haven't stayed up late together
for a long time.

225
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,330
We're too old

226
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,270
to stay up all night.

227
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,680
It takes three days

228
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,940
to recover.

229
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,470
Let's go climbing.

230
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,520
Watch the sunrise.

231
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,520
Okay!

232
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,870
Climbing again?

233
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,370
Honey, please.

234
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,940
Okay. It's been a while.

235
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,060
Fine. Our son is asleep.

236
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,110
We've spent New Year

237
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,390
so many times.

238
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,420
How time flies.

239
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,420
I remember that was

240
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,900
after the model exam
in our senior year.

241
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,020
We also came

242
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
to the top of this hill

243
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,350
and waited for the sunrise.

244
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,150
You failed the exam

245
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,280
and was upset,

246
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,170
so you dragged us

247
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,210
to Jiang Shiyan's home
to eat hotpot.

248
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,660
You didn't go home after that?

249
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,280
I remember we would

250
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,400
come to this place

251
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,230
no matter what happened,

252
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,250
as if the mountain view

253
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,060
could chase away all our trouble

254
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,130
and make us relaxed

255
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,110
and comfortable.

256
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,810
Honey,

257
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,880
I remember you had

258
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,970
long straight hair

259
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,880
back then.

260
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,820
It nearly reached your waist.

261
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,490
You were wearing

262
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,590
a white dress.

263
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,290
So beautiful.

264
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,850
You're showing your affection again.

265
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,050
I feel full now

266
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,450
watching you.

267
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,650
What did we do?

268
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,890
- We didn't do anything.
- Yes.

269
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,800
Stop lying.

270
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,240
If you hadn't fallen in love with
Jiang Yanan,

271
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,760
how could you have remembered

272
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,150
her dress and hair?

273
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,590
You caught me.

274
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,870
Yang is right.

275
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,970
I don't remember what we wore.

276
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,700
I only remember what happened.

277
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,470
I'm so happy for you.

278
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,850
You're lucky.

279
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,270
You've found the right person

280
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,700
without suffering too much.

281
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,230
You two should hurry.

282
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,400
It's not precise.

283
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,350
Each of you

284
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,750
should hurry to find the right person.

285
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,880
- Yes.
- It's not lucky

286
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,540
to have suffered nothing.

287
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,590
The luckiest thing

288
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,180
is to meet a person

289
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,230
who knows you

290
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,540
and can talk to you all the time.

291
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,130
That's what friends do.

292
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,730
You're talking too much.

293
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,940
Yes, you are my friend.

294
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,010
♪Greet and shake hands♪

295
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,940
♪You're my good friend♪

296
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,270
I'm the only one who talks to you.

297
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,180
The luckiest thing in the world

298
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,060
is to be together

299
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,900
with your best friend.

300
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,270
The sun is out.

301
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,350
So beautiful.

302
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,000
Right there.

303
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,970
Okay. Don't move.

304
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,850
Higher, higher.

305
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,450
- Higher?
- Yes, higher.

306
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,290
Is that okay?

307
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,590
Three, two, one.

308
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,990
- Another one.
- Another one.

309
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,270
Three, two, one.

310
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,850
Wait.

311
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,880
Okay.

312
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,990
Three, two, one.

313
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,660
Why are you laughing?

314
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,470
What's this?

315
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,870
Let's take a selfie.

316
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,150
Come on, take a selfie.

317
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,000
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

318
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,840
- Okay.
- Come on.

319
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,060
- Use my phone.
- Come on.

320
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,820
Three, two, one.

321
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,170
Change the pose.

322
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,640
- We can do "Yi" of Yi Xiu.
- Okay. [*Yi: One]

323
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,500
- Okay.
- "Yi" of Yi Xiu.

324
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,350
- Okay.
- Come on.

325
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,200
Yi.

326
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,930
Another one.

327
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,160
Send it.

328
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,330
Send it to our group chat.

329
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,960
I got it.

330
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,180
Send the last one.

331
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,650
Your eyes are closed,

332
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,660
so I deleted it.

333
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,900
My eyes are closed?

334
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,630
How's that possible?

335
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,800
Cheng Hui sent me a message.

336
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,830
Our son is awake.

337
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,560
Let's pick him up

338
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,590
and go home to sleep.

339
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,840
I need to work in the afternoon.

340
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,680
Okay.

341
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,330
How about you?

342
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,840
If you have time,

343
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,210
you can stay for a while.

344
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,890
Do you need to work in New Year?

345
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,250
Mr. Jiang, you're a monster.

346
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,180
I need to work too.

347
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,390
Forget it.

348
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,260
Let's go.

349
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,460
- We're leaving.
- Goodbye.

350
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

351
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

352
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,450
- Give me the key.
- Here.

353
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,390
Slow down. Be careful.

354
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,980
Slow down. Let's go.

355
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,150
On the day Feng Weiran talked about,

356
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,980
you were wearing a white T-shirt

357
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,830
with a cartoon figure.

358
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,790
I remember that T-shirt.

359
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,220
I liked it so much

360
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,730
that I made it my pajama

361
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,280
after its collar

362
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,070
was completely worn out.

363
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,010
I think Ms. Zhou

364
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,730
couldn't stand it anymore

365
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,830
and threw it away.

366
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,980
She didn't throw it.

367
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,590
She cut it and made some rags.

368
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,030
How do you know?

369
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,500
I wiped the windows.

370
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,870
What would you like today?

371
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,040
Is... Is the fish fresh?

372
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,310
Yes. It was cut in the morning.

373
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,040
Well, I want

374
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,450
these two pieces. Pack them for me.

375
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,740
- These two?
- Okay.

376
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,770
Thanks.

377
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,930
Have a good day.

378
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,980
Fish is Mo's favorite food.

379
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,880
Fish tastes good,

380
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,150
- What would you like?
- but it has fishbones.

381
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
He started to eat fish
when he was only six or seven.

382
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,360
He'd sit there in silence,
sipping the fish

383
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,700
and spitting out all the bones.

384
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,630
He's been a quiet person
since he was little.

385
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
He lost his parents

386
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,520
and grew up

387
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,360
in our family.

388
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,210
It's New Year. We can't

389
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,260
let him be alone.

390
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,420
Speak of the devil.

391
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,300
(Aunt, I have something to do.
I can't come. So sorry.)

392
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,110
Tang.

393
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,980
Aunt He went home to make soup.

394
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,760
We need one person
to play mahjong with us.

395
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,600
Come on.

396
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,180
We need a fourth player. Come on.

397
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,120
Okay. Be quick.

398
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,560
Get changed and come out.

399
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,790
We need a fourth player. Hurry.

400
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,050
5 bamboo.

401
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,390
- Pong.
- Thanks.

402
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,630
I win.

403
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,600
Pong.

404
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,460
4 Character.

405
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,640
I win.

406
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,120
I need 3 Dot.

407
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,980
I also win. You lost to both of us.

408
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,210
Added glory to a gong.

409
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,070
What?

410
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:14,760
We've given you chances.

411
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,730
How's that possible?

412
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,570
The soup is ready.

413
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,360
- Aunt He.
- Tang, are you playing for me?

414
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,700
- Hurry!
- Come on.

415
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,180
Hurry. Join us.

416
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,280
She's so weak

417
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,520
and unlucky.

418
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,490
Sorry, Aunt He,

419
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,600
I lost your money.

420
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,930
- It's okay. Don't worry.
- You'll play. Come on.

421
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,840
Well, we're not

422
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,320
at the same level.

423
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,520
You're professional players,

424
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,830
but I'm just a beginner.

425
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,030
How can I win?

426
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,450
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,450
- Okay. Go to your bedroom.
- Not the same level.

428
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,390
It's okay. It's okay.

429
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,390
- Come on.
- It's not my fault.

430
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,120
I'm so glad you came.

431
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,560
If you didn't,
she'd lose all your money.

432
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,110
Hello, Jiang Shiyan. What's wrong?

433
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,150
Come to Yi Xiu to help me out.

434
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,150
What's wrong? Is it serious?

435
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,260
Very serious, Yang.

436
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,250
I need you.

437
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,500
Okay. I'm coming.

438
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,940
Yang, you're my best buddy.

439
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,040
(Working Area)

440
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,980
You came so fast.

441
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,170
You even brought

442
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,310
so many things.

443
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,760
Well, it's New Year.

444
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,070
Tired laborers need some comfort.

445
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,680
Thanks.

446
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,070
Why are you wearing a mask?

447
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,900
I got a cold.

448
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,830
Stay away from me.

449
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,280
Aren't bros supposed to
go through hard times together?

450
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,210
Who are you?

451
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,080
You look familiar,

452
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,420
but I really don't know you.

453
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,530
By the way, why did you

454
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,870
suddenly catch a cold?

455
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,490
Is it because the wind was too strong

456
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,420
in the mountains?

457
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,490
Did you take the pills?

458
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,330
I don't know why.

459
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:31,770
Don't worry.

460
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,110
Maybe I'll recover soon.

461
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,500
Recover soon?

462
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,830
How's it going?

463
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,490
You're here.

464
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,180
Is this how you work overtime?

465
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,350
Listen,

466
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,410
it's very important to play cards

467
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,120
with the most popular blogger

468
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,830
of our platform, okay?

469
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,260
For the sake of Mr. Jiang,

470
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,450
I refused many partners

471
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,320
and chose to visit
Zhilan Snacks instead.

472
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,590
You should play cards

473
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,930
with me, right?

474
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,800
Listen,

475
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,490
don't get carried away.

476
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,560
Zhilan Snacks's video has almost got

477
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,970
as many views as
all your videos from last year.

478
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,870
It's a win-win situation.

479
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,450
Come on.

480
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,490
- Are you going to join someone
- Come on.

481
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,790
or build your own team?

482
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,450
What are you talking about?

483
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,550
She's with me.

484
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,830
You've found an allay, haven't you?

485
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,840
I was just crashed

486
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,120
by three

487
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,550
mahjong masters.

488
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,500
Shiyan, why aren't there
sticky notes on your face?

489
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,030
How can I lose? Well...

490
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,930
Why don't you take off his mask

491
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,150
to see what really happened?

492
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,940
Didn't you say you got a cold?

493
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,320
Yes, I did.

494
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,600
Let me see if it's serious.

495
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Don't. You'll be infected.

496
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,490
Is that so? I'm not scared. We're bros.

497
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,450
Take it off.

498
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,290
- Take it off.
- It's inappropriate.

499
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,690
Oh my god.

500
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,080
What a cruel game.

501
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,010
He's so weak.

502
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,040
Come on. Join us.

503
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Wait. Let me think about it.

504
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
You have to slow down.

505
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,980
I haven't played this for a long time.

506
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,930
If I lose too many times,

507
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,350
Jiang Shiyan's face can't handle
that many notes.

508
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,050
Don't worry.

509
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,530
He has a big forehead.

510
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,700
He'll handle it. Come on.

511
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,940
- Okay.
- Come on.

512
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,160
One, two, three...

513
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,700
One, two...

514
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,920
Bomb!

515
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,040
How can you throw a bomb
in the beginning?

516
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,210
Just tell me if you can defeat it.

517
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,690
- No.
- No one can defeat it.

518
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,530
Draw.

519
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,970
This is too much.

520
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,150
Three, four, five, six. I win.

521
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,530
You...

522
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,500
Come on. I only have one card.

523
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,010
Triple five.

524
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,310
Bomb, double the price.

525
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,660
Now I've realized

526
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,650
you came here to crash us

527
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,970
after being crashed at home.

528
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,350
I didn't mean to.

529
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,630
It's god's wish.

530
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,360
Everyone takes their turn.

531
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,940
You'll get lucky sooner or later.

532
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,080
Don't act like

533
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,260
an outsider.

534
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,010
Yang, take a break.

535
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:46,870
Let him play.

536
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,970
Look how arrogant he is.

537
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,840
Yang is my bro.
Why can't I be proud of her?

538
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,940
Yang, beat them!

539
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,260
Well, you should play for a while.

540
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,250
Okay?

541
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,290
I'll teach you.

542
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,450
You...

543
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,530
Okay. I'm in. Come on.

544
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,980
At least I should get involved.

545
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,980
Which one will you choose?

546
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,440
The smallest one.

547
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,970
Are you silly?

548
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,040
Cheng Hui has four and six.

549
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,890
If you use this,

550
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,070
he'll win.

551
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,600
Financiers are better at calculating

552
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,980
than programmers.

553
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,360
This one.

554
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,530
Ace.

555
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,740
Chain or individual card?

556
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,210
Chian.

557
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,500
They cannot take this.

558
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,550
But all queens are out.

559
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,160
Jack.

560
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:36,850
I quit.

561
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,590
Ridiculous.

562
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,930
There are only five cards,

563
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,830
and still can't remember them.

564
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,800
Yang makes your dreams come true.

565
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,030
Why should he remember the cards?

566
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,730
I've realized that you're

567
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,760
the only sober person

568
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,870
in this game.

569
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,360
He can't count on Yang forever.

570
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,790
I'll get back to him next time.

571
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,070
Yang, Yang, Yang.

572
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,010
What are you doing?

573
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,070
So disgusting.

574
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,200
Go on.

575
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,440
Then...

576
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,600
Pair of Ace.

577
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,930
This is too much.

578
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,520
- I quit.
- I'm so tired.

579
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,180
My face is full of sticky notes.

580
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,290
Look at my head.

581
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,410
Oh god. Well,

582
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,660
where are we going later?

583
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,010
I'm going to Leisure House

584
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,840
for roast suckling pig.

585
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,680
Do you want to join us?

586
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,040
Jiang Yanan will be there.

587
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,890
I remember

588
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,370
you missed roast suckling pig once.

589
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,050
It means I'm destined

590
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,010
to miss it.

591
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,790
I have a video conference tonight.

592
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,980
Whatever.

593
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,350
She's hard-working.

594
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,170
Go on, you have a promising future.

595
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,970
See? This is how a boss

596
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,210
pushes his employees to work.

597
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,010
- Yes.
- Only Yang dares

598
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,220
to express our feelings.

599
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,440
What do you mean?

600
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,300
Okay. Enough.

601
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,200
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

602
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,350
I'll clean my face.

603
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,690
Glues are all over my face.

604
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,530
Come on.

605
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,410
Let's go.

606
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,240
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

607
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,740
(Civility and Harmony)

608
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,550
You're back.

609
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,500
I'm not hungry. No noodles.

610
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,600
I'm versatile.

611
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,490
Don't think I can only

612
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,590
make noodles.

613
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,320
I'll close the door.

614
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,160
Come on.

615
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,390
Pork loins,

616
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,070
imitation crabs,

617
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,870
pork ribs,

618
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,460
vegetables,

619
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,630
and roasted ducks.

620
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,460
Please enjoy

621
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,630
my cuisine.

622
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,800
- This...
- I...

623
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,890
I made these

624
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,250
according to the procedures

625
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,310
written on Yi Xiu.

626
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,460
Try this and tell me what you think.

627
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,250
Mom.

628
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,460
Are you doing this to show your support?

629
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,640
Of course.

630
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,260
I'm your mother.

631
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,120
Thanks, Mom.

632
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,500
The pork loins are a little bit salty.

633
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,550
Imitation crabs are good.

634
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,090
Vegetables

635
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,310
are master-level.

636
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,530
So good.

637
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,100
(Ms. Zhou)

638
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,460
Ms. Zhou.

639
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,010
No, no.

640
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,180
It's ready.

641
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,570
Listen,

642
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,800
I'll impress everyone

643
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,180
in the ballroom tomorrow.

644
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,870
I just can't stand

645
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,030
the arrogant face of Zhang.

646
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,450
She's always showing off

647
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,360
as if she's the only one

648
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,150
who can make sushi in the world.

649
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,880
However,

650
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,210
this is my first time.

651
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,660
I couldn't control the amount.

652
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:09,840
I made too much.

653
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,310
There are some leftovers

654
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,330
and bad ones.

655
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,700
Don't worry.

656
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,150
I didn't waste them.

657
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,280
I fed some of them

658
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,170
to Zhang's dog,

659
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,350
and Jiang Shiyan is eating the rest.

660
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,280
This is so good.

661
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,120
How did you make it?

662
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,740
I followed the guidance on Yi Xiu.

663
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,890
Over-cook the rice and scoop it out.

664
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,740
Add some milk and honey
and put it in the refrigerator.

665
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,870
It's simple.

666
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,800
The Leftovers Challenge

667
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,560
is going to the finals.

668
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,310
It's very popular.

669
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,080
No wonder

670
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,250
all the financial accounts I followed

671
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,700
have been analyzing Yi Xiu.

672
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,170
In terms of trends,

673
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,900
topics, and views,

674
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,790
Yi Xiu is taking the lead
in every aspect.

675
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:12,540
(Leftover Challenge Championship)

676
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,650
It's so good.

677
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,150
It looks delicious.

678
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,170
Hello everyone,

679
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,180
I'm contestant No. 3 Min Mu.

680
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,650
Please vote for me

681
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,350
- and support me. Thanks.
- This kid is impressive.

682
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,800
Little boy,

683
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,210
how did you manage to

684
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,660
turn the leftovers into delicious food?

685
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,530
Actually, my mother

686
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,890
made all the snacks.

687
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,450
She also made

688
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,690
the chicken sauce for me.

689
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,900
(Real-time Online Votes Ranking)
She'd make many snacks in advance

690
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,320
so that I can use them

691
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,360
to make fried rice for my little brother

692
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,740
when she's busy.

693
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,410
By the way,
apart from the chicken sauce,

694
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,600
spicy sliced bamboo

695
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,120
can also be used to make noodles.

696
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,490
My mother often makes

697
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,870
many kinds of snacks and sauces
in advance.

698
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,690
We've promoted five videos

699
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,120
of Lotus Blossom.

700
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,630
Each of them has got
over 100 thousand likes.

701
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,320
He's just a student,

702
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,360
so people like him very much.

703
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,210
What about the positive comments?

704
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,180
Well...

705
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,520
(Meeting Room)

706
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,760
Come on. Over here.

707
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,150
Let me introduce him to you.

708
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,790
This is

709
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,550
the champion of Leftovers Challenge

710
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,900
Lotus Blossom.

711
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,980
This name is impressive.

712
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,840
Min Mu is too young,

713
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,170
so he registered

714
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,180
with his grandmother's ID.

715
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,500
He said he went out

716
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,180
for a school activity in the morning.

717
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,970
If Min Lin hadn't posted the videos,

718
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,590
I wouldn't have known
he participated in the competition.

719
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,160
Zhilan,

720
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,900
Min Mu told me

721
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,360
you made all the sauces

722
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,030
he used in the competition.

723
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,170
Do you know?

724
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,760
The sauces and the snacks

725
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,800
are very popular

726
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,980
on our platform.

727
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,840
Many people want to know

728
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,420
the sauce recipes.

729
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Some even asked

730
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,730
where they could

731
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,740
buy the products.

732
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,420
My son just made it for fun.

733
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,730
Mr. Feng, Mr. Jiang,

734
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,500
please don't take it seriously.

735
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,660
He tried hard to win the championship.

736
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,940
Besides, Zhilan,

737
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,500
we're all addicted to your snacks,

738
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,010
and your secret sauces

739
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,590
are very popular on our platform.

740
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,180
We have to take it seriously.

741
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,200
He saved my Min Lin

742
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,110
when he was blocked by them last time.

743
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,380
Did they block you again?

744
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,560
No.

745
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:18,810
Good.

746
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:20,730
Zhilan,

747
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,490
we were going to talk to you

748
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,410
about producing your snacks

749
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,700
and small dishes
like eight-treasure chicken.

750
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,260
Do you have time?

751
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,920
Yes.

752
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,910
When did you make so much this year?

753
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,040
Your grandfather and your uncle

754
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,010
didn't make them,

755
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,070
so I made more.

756
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,360
Here.

757
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,600
We can share them

758
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,810
with Ms. Zhou,

759
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,820
Tang,

760
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,260
and Yanan.

761
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,920
Okay.

762
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,560
If you need anything, just tell me.

763
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,120
- I'll buy them for you.
- I really need some stuff.

764
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,370
I wrote it in my notebook.

765
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,210
I'll show you later.

766
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,130
Okay.

767
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,780
We never finished the ones
they sent to us every year.

768
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,700
Why are you making them by yourself?

769
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,150
It's a gesture of showing kindness.

770
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,220
We also need to show them
we care about them.

771
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,490
Besides, we need to

772
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,380
share them with Fangping,

773
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,520
Feng,

774
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,360
and Tang's colleagues.

775
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,380
Yes, higher.

776
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,700
(Tang Yang)
She's preparing for the Spring Festival.

777
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,220
(Jiang Shiyan)

778
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,550
My mother is doing the same thing.

779
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,180
Does your vacation start
on the Chinese New Year's Eve?

780
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,700
How are you going to spend the holiday?

781
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,740
(Tang Yang)
Family reunion. Visiting relatives.

782
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,600
It seems that since my father retired,

783
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,550
we've been doing the same thing
every year.

784
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,930
We used to celebrate Chinese New Year
on his construction sites,

785
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,200
and it was so much fun.

786
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,950
Many people would be there.

787
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,780
(Yi Xiu Gourmet New Year's Arrangement)

788
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,160
We've decided on the arrangement
for Chinese New Year

789
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,050
and the gifts for every department,

790
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:20,910
okay?

791
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,510
Besides, as Mr. Jiang said,

792
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,330
if the tickets are sold out,

793
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,990
you can go home a few days early.

794
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,000
However,

795
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,860
don't pretend the tickets are sold out.

796
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,330
Remember to click
the ticket-booking links

797
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,110
your colleagues sent to the group chat.

798
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,490
Last but not least,

799
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,260
you'll receive the year-end bonuses
by the end of this week.

800
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,820
The Chinese New Year happens to be
the end of this month,

801
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,590
and you'll be at home with your family,

802
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,770
so we've decided

803
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,720
to pay this month's salary

804
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,680
in advance.

805
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,520
Okay.

806
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,200
We can also increase the budget

807
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,340
for New Year's gifts.

808
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,330
Of course, I know

809
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,110
everyone prefers cash.

810
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,740
However, gifts from the company

811
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,630
can make your family know

812
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,910
that we care about them.

813
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,740
Okay. That's all.

814
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,660
- Okay.
- You can leave.

815
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:11,810
Oh my god.

816
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,520
We've worked

817
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,860
for another year.

818
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,550
How are you going to spend the holiday?

819
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,780
Same as usual.

820
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,550
Having a family dinner
on Chinese New Year's Eve

821
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,150
and visiting relatives.

822
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,720
It seems we've never celebrated

823
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,560
Chinese New Year together before.

824
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,510
It's not true.

825
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,080
Ya Nan and I

826
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,970
will visit you

827
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:31,890
and your mother on the third day

828
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:32,740
of the Spring Festival every year.

829
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,550
Tang Yang and I...

830
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,590
Ya Nan, and you.

831
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,660
We've never had a meal

832
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,340
on the Chinese New Year's Eve,

833
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,630
stayed up late,

834
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,850
and waited for the new year.

835
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:46,850
Stop.

836
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,200
It's enough to spend time

837
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,160
with you guys in normal times.

838
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,010
This is the Spring Festival.

839
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,330
Go home and spend time

840
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,380
with your family.

841
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:55,860
Listen,

842
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,340
do you know how many people

843
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,220
will come every Spring Festival?

844
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,400
My parents,

845
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:01,910
Yanan's parents...

846
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:13,700
(Operation)

847
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,260
Why is my mother still inside?

848
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,890
It's okay. Don't worry.

849
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,740
She'll be fine.

850
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,770
Uncle,

851
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:38,910
Jiang Shiyan.

852
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,630
Is Aunt Yi inside?

853
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,970
The doctor said

854
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,550
it'd take about two hours.

855
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,260
She went in at 9:00 p.m.

856
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,530
It's been two hours,

857
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,370
and she's still there.

858
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,030
Have you had lunch?

859
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,210
Not yet.

860
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,600
They might call me during the surgery,

861
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,440
so I've stayed here.

862
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,720
I brought you some beef patties.

863
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,560
Take a bite.

864
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,070
Are you Zeng Jianguo's family?

865
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,990
The patient is coming out.
You need to be there.

866
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,640
Is Liu Zhiqiang's family here?

867
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,480
Yes.

868
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,560
Follow me.

869
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,780
My aunt works at a hospital
as an accountant.

870
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,430
She told me

871
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,080
it's not good

872
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,330
to call someone's family

873
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,660
during the surgery.

874
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,810
Really?

875
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,040
Yes.

876
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,490
So, don't worry.

877
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,370
Aunt Yi's surgery

878
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,660
must be successful.

879
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,080
Maybe there was a delay

880
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,340
waiting for the anesthesia.

881
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,300
I've brought my wish bottle.

882
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,600
Write your wish on a note,

883
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,630
make an origami lucky star,
and out it into the bottle.

884
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,660
Your wish will come true.

885
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,290
These are the wishes

886
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,410
I made before.

887
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,600
They've all come true.

888
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,260
It never fails. Trust me.

889
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,590
How can I make a star?

890
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,910
Let me teach you.

891
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,660
