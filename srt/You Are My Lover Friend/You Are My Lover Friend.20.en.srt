Jiang Shiyan.

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,590
Are you okay?

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,920
Let me see.

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not okay.

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,200
What happened?

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,640
The shower water pressure

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,100
of the hotel

35
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,250
is very low,

36
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,640
and the temperature is unstable.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,760
I haven't had a nice shower

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,970
over the past few days.

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,500
Besides,

40
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,620
the shampoo

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,500
has a very strange smell.

42
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,460
I've felt I smell like

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,960
a glutinous rice dumpling

44
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,180
that's been kept for months.

45
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,660
Go upstairs.

46
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,130
My mother asked me to buy
some silvery wormwood.

47
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,460
You can use it to bathe.

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,240
I just told them.

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,670
Why did you buy this?

50
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,030
I wasn't in jail.

51
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,870
So ridiculous.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,850
The teachers have given me orders.

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,010
How can I refuse them?

54
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,460
Oh my god.

55
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,850
Who was the person just now?

56
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,690
Captain Sun from ECIU.

57
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,460
He specially sent me back.

58
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,410
Captain? He's so young.

59
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Not so young.

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,730
He's 33 years old.

61
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,240
Do you know how far

62
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,380
did my mother

63
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,390
and your mother go?

64
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,990
They kept asking him

65
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,640
his date of birth,

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,760
hometown,

67
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,800
educational background,

68
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,640
family conditions,

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,850
and everything.

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,570
Is he single?

71
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,900
I think so.

72
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,200
What do you mean?

73
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,320
Nothing.

74
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,730
You're so thoughtful.

75
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,390
Silvery wormwood
can chase away back luck.

76
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,780
- Absolutely.
- You're back.

77
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,940
Did you buy the stuff?

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
Yes.

79
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
Tang.

80
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,760
Chicken soup will take a while.

81
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,320
Why don't you take a shower first?

82
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,200
Okay. I'll take a bath.

83
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,530
Remember to use the silvery wormwood.

84
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,660
- Okay.
- Here.

85
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,620
They really bought it.

86
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Look, Captain Sun

87
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,990
is quite reliable.

88
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,240
He's sent the information.

89
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,080
He did?

90
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,920
Let me see.

91
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Check it out.

92
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,340
He got both his bachelor's
and master's degrees

93
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,460
at the Provincial
Public Security University.

94
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,060
He's a native? Good.

95
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,620
The young man

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,660
is good-looking.

97
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,920
He was already

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,670
a national-level athlete

99
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,940
in college.

100
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,570
Do you want to help Tang
to find a boyfriend?

101
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,670
She works in a bank,

102
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,060
but Captain Sun
is an economic investigator.

103
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,200
Isn't it inappropriate?

104
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,340
We know that.

105
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,060
We're setting up a database.

106
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
Database?

107
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,310
What is that?

108
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,220
You don't know, right?

109
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,530
Nowadays,

110
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,370
we need to share the resources.

111
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,460
It means while we're looking for

112
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,700
young men at the proper age.

113
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
we also need to introduce

114
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,470
some nice guys

115
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,930
to others.

116
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
Yes.

117
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,000
The more you recommend,

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,820
the more you receive.

119
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,270
- That's how we share resources.
- Yes.

120
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,520
You majored in Internet.

121
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,660
How can you not know?

122
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,990
Captain Sun said

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,480
he realized what was going on

124
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,370
the minute we told him.

125
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,630
He also said

126
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,490
his parents

127
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,230
asked him to make

128
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,580
a blind date resume.

129
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,150
Did you see that?

130
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,660
The resume is very clear.

131
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,290
When will you make one?

132
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,850
Yes, you can also do it

133
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,100
so that we can add you to our database.

134
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,100
I don't think so.

135
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,870
Fine.

136
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
I wonder

137
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,410
how long you will stay single.

138
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,350
When Tang gets married,

139
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,030
she'll be busy with

140
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,120
her husband and kids,

141
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,960
and you'll know

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,560
how hard it is

143
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,400
to be alone.

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,520
He won't.

145
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,800
Don't worry.

146
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,580
Tang told me last time

147
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,050
that Jiang's company

148
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,880
has a programmer

149
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,370
- Mr. Cheng.
- Cheng Hui.

150
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,730
He'll probably be with Jiang
for the rest of his life.

151
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,870
Did Tang Yang say that?

152
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,360
Cheng Hui and I,

153
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,700
two bachelors,

154
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,150
will stay together
for the rest of our lives?

155
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,850
(Incorrect password.)

156
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,050
(Incorrect password.)

157
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,230
- Don't move.
- Son.

158
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,170
I won't move, okay?

159
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,160
Where's your mom?

160
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,410
Where's my Ultraman?

161
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,490
Here it is.

162
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,140
Thanks, Dad.

163
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,310
Qi.

164
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,040
Yuanqi.

165
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,120
Qi, open the door!

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,150
Mom said

167
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,120
if I let you in,

168
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,320
I'll live in the old house

169
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,680
with you.

170
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,490
I don't want to live there.

171
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,400
Qi...

172
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,530
What are you doing?

173
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,800
Qi!

174
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,070
Qi?

175
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,990
It's over.

176
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,170
It smells so good.

177
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,530
Jiang Shiyan.

178
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,700
You're making me cry.

179
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,730
You know me the best.

180
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,780
How can healthy chicken soup

181
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,530
compare to a spicy hotpot?

182
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,850
Try the spam.

183
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,230
They left?

184
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,590
Ms. Zhou went to your room

185
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,430
and found you sleeping,

186
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,370
so they decided to watch a show tonight.

187
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,340
They had some soup and left.

188
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,910
- Do you like it?
- It's good.

189
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,120
I knew you'd like hotpot,

190
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,050
so I ordered takeout.

191
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,580
Actually, I wanted to come out

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,100
after finishing the shower,

193
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,120
but I heard them

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,790
talking about blind date database

195
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,120
when I got to the door,

196
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,170
so I went back immediately.

197
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,760
I knew I shouldn't come out,

198
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,170
so I took a nap to avoid the trouble.

199
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,220
This is so good.

200
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,850
This time...

201
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,120
you missed the resort hotel.

202
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,260
Do you want to make it up next week?

203
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
That hotel

204
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,340
is quite fancy and comfortable.

205
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,490
Maybe a few days later.

206
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,170
I haven't worked for a while,

207
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,790
so there's a lot of stuff to do.

208
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,630
Okay.

209
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,420
Maybe I'll need to work overtime
in the next few days.

210
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,910
By the way, how about the investment

211
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,820
that you were trying to get?

212
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,720
I think

213
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,020
it's not bad.

214
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
You think?

215
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,320
I thought I messed up,

216
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
but it turns out

217
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,490
it's not that bad.

218
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,660
You must've got it.

219
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,280
That's right.

220
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,730
Because

221
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,190
you were born

222
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,260
a pessimist.

223
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,050
If you say

224
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,070
it's not bad,

225
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,600
it means you've nailed it.

226
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,460
It must be good.

227
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,990
You think so highly of me.

228
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,580
Of course, I believe in you.

229
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,030
Maybe we're so close

230
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,930
that you never noticed that.

231
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,230
However, all those investors

232
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,790
are quite interested in

233
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,340
Yixiu Found of Food.

234
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,900
I remember a few days ago,

235
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,020
a friend told me

236
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,680
he met Jiang Shiyan

237
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,050
at a banquet,

238
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,970
and he was so glad
that he got your WeChat.

239
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,730
You have no idea how pleased he was.

240
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,130
I really wanted to tell him,

241
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,040
"Do you know?
I had hotpot with Jiang Shiyan

242
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,200
on the street yesterday,

243
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,350
and I paid for that."

244
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,370
He'd be freaked out.

245
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,350
You must be kidding me.

246
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,850
I wasn't exaggerating.

247
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,630
Maybe in other people's eyes,

248
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,510
we're not
the same kind of people anymore.

249
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,490
So, I want to tell you

250
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,100
you're really

251
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,070
successful.

252
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,190
Tang Yang,

253
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,820
no matter what others think of us,

254
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,250
I'll never change

255
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,540
when I'm with you.

256
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,120
I know.

257
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,070
You don't need to tell me.

258
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,610
You're the person

259
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,340
who boils duck intestines
for seven seconds

260
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,060
and tripes for 15 seconds,

261
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,680
and who won't boil any vegetables

262
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,370
until all the meat is finished.

263
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,540
It takes more than seven seconds

264
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,610
to boil this intestine.

265
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,240
At least eight and a half seconds.

266
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,750
Can I put some vegetables in?

267
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,180
Can we break the rule today?

268
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,610
Yes. Come on.

269
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,040
Put the meat in.

270
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,160
I'll get some chicken soup for you.

271
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,340
- Try it.
- Okay.

272
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,900
(Credit Audit Division)

273
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,490
She's back.

274
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,230
Ms. Tang, good morning.

275
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,440
- Good morning, Ms. Tang.
- Good morning.

276
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,280
Ms...

277
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,640
Ms. Tang,

278
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,820
here's the latest progress
of Qinglai Art Training.

279
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,710
Ms. Qin asked me
to summarize it every day.

280
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,940
I've sent a copy to your mailbox.

281
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,280
I've seen it.

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,490
We're in the parallel process.

283
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,060
Let's set up an on-site interview
with the Sales Department.

284
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,400
Okay.

285
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,940
By the way, there'll be
a cadre training session later.

286
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,370
Ms. Tang, have you received the email?

287
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,240
Yes.

288
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,430
Okay.

289
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,550
You lost weight.

290
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,520
I don't think so.

291
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,130
I'll send you some nutritious food.

292
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,820
Mr. Ying,
you don't have to be so polite.

293
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,180
I'm not.

294
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,540
You should avoid the etiquette.

295
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,610
Credit Audit Division's
Tang Yang is back.

296
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,100
Someone is protecting her.

297
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,820
I'm so surprised.

298
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,540
We can never be like her.

299
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,800
No wonder she skipped the branch's title

300
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,610
and directly won
CBBC Outstanding Employee of the Year.

301
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,480
How much do you think she can get

302
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,320
by pleasing Gu Zhishou?

303
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,300
I'm not sure.

304
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,310
I only know

305
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,850
Gu Zhishou is under investigation,

306
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,880
but they haven't found

307
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,830
much money at his house

308
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,300
and his wife's place.

309
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,890
The money must be somewhere else.

310
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,340
Many people have doubts
about the fairness

311
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,180
of my Outstanding Employee title.

312
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,370
They can gossip as they want.

313
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,940
After all, it won't do me any harm.

314
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,340
Let's go. It's time for the meeting.

315
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,160
She's coming.

316
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,980
(CBBC)

317
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,420
Let's call it a day.

318
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,470
You can leave.

319
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,300
(Yixiu Found of Food & CBBC. Thank You.
Looking Forward to Our Cooperation)

320
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,310
Mr. Ying.

321
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,040
Tang Yang

322
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,890
is so miserable.

323
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,060
They can spread rumors like that.

324
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,490
Anyway, I'm not as tolerant as her.

325
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,220
She's back for a few days,

326
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,100
and the rumors are getting worse.

327
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,120
Besides,

328
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,120
it's too much.

329
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,560
Why haven't your branch

330
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,180
issued a statement?

331
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,230
A branch issues a statement

332
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,580
for a female deputy director's rumors?

333
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,470
Mr. Feng,

334
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,850
don't be ridiculous.

335
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,460
You freaked me out.

336
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,590
When did you come back?

337
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,730
I didn't hear a sound.

338
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,580
I'm thinking.

339
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,370
Thinking?

340
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,370
What are you thinking?

341
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,920
You're not

342
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,010
as busy as Tang.

343
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,580
You have nothing to do every day.

344
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,440
Mom, at least I run

345
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,850
such a big company.

346
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,560
We make

347
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,920
hundreds of millions of yuan every year.

348
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,320
Dear Mr. Jiang, I'm so impressed.

349
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,100
Hundreds of millions of yuan.
That's a lot of money.

350
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,060
But what's the point?

351
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
You're still living here

352
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,240
and eating at home.

353
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,350
Mom, I give you
eight thousand yuan a month.

354
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,970
How many times have I eaten at home?

355
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,470
As for living,

356
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,120
I already bought a house,

357
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,130
but you wouldn't move.

358
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,110
If you find a girl,

359
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,850
get married, and have children,

360
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,230
do you think I'll refuse to move

361
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,250
into the new house you buy?

362
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,830
I'm leaving.

363
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,300
I've sewed the buttons.

364
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,950
Hello, Mr. Ying.

365
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,470
Sorry to bother you.

366
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,940
Can you do me a favor?

367
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,160
Mom.

368
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,870
Did you add Captain Sun's WeChat

369
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,110
last time?

370
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,060
Who's Captain Sun?

371
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,960
Captain Sun, the ECIU police officer

372
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,350
who sent Tang Yang back

373
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,340
last time.

374
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,520
Oh, I did.

375
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,590
Okay.

376
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,880
Share his contact to me.

377
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,920
What do you want?

378
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,850
Introduce a girl to him.

379
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,640
Thanks.

(Tangcheng Police, CBBC, and Yixiu,
Badminton Friendly Match)

381
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,660
(Tangcheng Police, Yixiu Found of Found,
CBBC, Badminton Friendly Match)

382
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,310
Mr. Ying.

383
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,460
Ms. Tang, you're here.

384
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,230
Why did you suddenly want

385
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,650
to organize a friendly match?

386
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,820
I'm the vice president of the union.

387
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,490
It's held by the union,

388
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,750
and Yixiu Found of Food is the sponsor

389
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,100
for the site, beverages, and snacks.

390
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,250
I used this opportunity
to benefit all of us.

391
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,110
Is Jiang Shiyan the sponsor?

392
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,950
Yes.

393
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,400
Mr. Jiang said

394
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,340
CBBC and Yixiu
have many female employees

395
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,850
while Tangcheng Police
have many single male officers.

396
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,220
We can organize

397
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,300
a badminton friendly match

398
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,470
to exercise

399
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,750
and get to know

400
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,820
more people.

401
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,320
Mr. Jiang will be a little late.

402
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,160
He's having a meeting.

403
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,300
He did tell me he'd come,

404
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,990
but he didn't say

405
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,010
this is for match-making.

406
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,130
We can get to know each other better
in daily life.

407
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,070
I get it.

408
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,920
Captain Sun.

409
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,350
Captain Sun.

410
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,550
Ms. Tang.

411
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,470
Let me introduce you to each other.

412
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,130
This is Mr. Yang
from Credit Card Center, CBBC,

413
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,920
and this is Captain Sun from ECIU.

414
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,230
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

415
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,270
Okay, suit yourself.

416
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,200
I'll make some arrangements.

417
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,340
Okay. No problem.

418
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,070
Ms. Tang,

419
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,990
thank you

420
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,920
for last time.

421
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,320
I was going to send a pennant

422
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,300
to you.

423
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,350
No need for a pennant.

424
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,220
This is too much.

425
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,700
I'm glad to have helped you.

426
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,750
By the way,
there'll be a mixed-doubles match.

427
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,970
Each team should consist of
members of different parties.

428
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,560
Ms. Tang,

429
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,610
do you want to

430
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,970
make a team with me for the match?

431
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,460
Okay. No problem.

432
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,920
Well, I'm going to warm up.

433
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,010
I don't want to be your burden.

434
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,800
Ms. Tang, go for it.

435
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,550
Come on.

436
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,810
Defeat them.

437
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,350
Captain Sun, it's your showtime.

438
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,770
Don't be nervous. It's a friendly match.

439
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,800
Come on.

440
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,830
Captain Sun,

441
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,010
duty call. It's an emergency.

442
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,060
Okay, I got it.

443
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,940
Ms. Tang, sorry.

444
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,180
I'm so sorry.

445
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,130
Can anyone take over for me?

446
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,550
I can.

447
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,430
Nice.

448
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,650
Mr. Jiang, water.

449
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,070
Here, Yang, have some water.

450
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,910
Thanks.

451
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,990
Mr. Jiang, I didn't expect you
to be so good.

452
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,830
Not bad.

453
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,360
Jiang Shiyan, I remember you won
the second place

454
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,300
in the badminton competition
in high school, right?

455
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,300
Really? He never told me about it.

456
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,410
You're very low-key.

457
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,000
Ms. Tang.

458
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,520
Mr. Jiang.

459
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
Captain Sun,

460
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,950
let me introduce you to each other.

461
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,750
This is my colleague Wang Yang.

462
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,400
She was caught up by something,
so she's late.

463
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,780
- Hello.
- Let me introduce.

464
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,920
This is Tang Yang, the deputy director

465
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,020
of CBBC Credit Audit Division.

466
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,740
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, Ms. Tang.

467
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,970
This is Jiang Shiyan,

468
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,160
the organizer of the friendly match

469
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,990
and the co-founder
of Yixiu Found of Food.

470
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,060
- I'm Jiang Shiyan.
- Hello, Mr. Jiang.

471
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,980
Ms. Tang, I saw your match.
It's impressive.

472
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,350
Wang Yang,

473
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,360
you can battle

474
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,200
with Ms. Tang later.

475
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,550
Okay. Do you want to play doubles?

476
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,820
Ms. Tang and I will be a team.

477
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,310
Okay. No problem.

478
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,850
Mr. Jiang, shall we

479
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,710
battle with them?

480
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,550
Well...

481
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,790
We're both male,

482
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,980
and you're an athlete.

483
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,020
Are we bullying them?

484
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Wang Yang was the badminton champion

485
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,710
of National University Games.

486
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,680
She can easily crash us.

487
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,520
Really?

488
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,880
Every time I play with her,

489
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,720
I get so exhausted

490
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,270
that I get on the ground like a dog.

491
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,820
Exhausted like a dog.

492
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,990
I can finally see

493
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,060
your true form today.

494
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,450
Stop talking nonsense.

495
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,170
Come on, let's get it started.

496
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

497
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,610
- Learn from each other.
- Come on.

498
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,110
Nice.

499
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,440
Great!

500
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,100
Tang Yang, you're relying on her power
to bully us.

501
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,890
Jiang Shiyan, use your strength.

502
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,780
Why is your shot so weak?

503
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,960
Come on.

504
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,100
It's okay.

505
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,370
One more time.

506
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,170
Bravo!

507
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,060
Excellent!

508
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,410
Listen,

509
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,270
Tang Yang was never involved

510
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,110
in Gu Zhishou's matter.

511
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,160
She was assisting ECIU

512
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,270
at that time.

513
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,210
Really?

514
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,580
Yes. At yesterday's friendly match,

515
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,200
ECIU's officer thanked Ms. Tang

516
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,300
in front of everyone.

517
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,850
I heard it myself,

518
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,160
so did many other people.

519
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,890
That's right. If she made a mistake,
she wouldn't have come back.

520
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,170
- Yes.
- Yes.

521
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,300
(Jiang Shiyan)

522
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,190
(Thanks)

523
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,300
(Tang Yang)

524
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,060
(Feng Weiran:
Honey, I love you. Good night.)

525
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,020
(Honey,)

526
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,680
(it's been 25 days)

527
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
(since I became)

528
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,510
(homeless.)

529
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,740
(Jiang Shiyan)
(Thanks isn't enough.)

530
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,890
(I've missed you every single day.)

531
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,020
(I really want to get back to you.)

532
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,960
What?

533
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,270
Your apology isn't sincere at all.

534
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,040
If I were Jiang Yanan,
I wouldn't forgive you either.

535
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,820
How can you say I'm not sincere?

536
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,650
Come over.

537
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,280
Look,

538
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,920
I send

539
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,070
"Honey, good morning"

540
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,210
to her every morning

541
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,840
and "Honey, good night"

542
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,030
every night.

543
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,070
Sometimes,

544
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,100
I even send

545
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,400
"Honey, I miss you.

546
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,550
Do you miss me?

547
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,470
Honey, I'm sorry.

548
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,540
Honey, I love you".

549
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,230
But you sent her

550
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,270
red heart emoji.

551
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,370
Do you know the difference
between a red heart and a pink heart?

552
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,870
Difference?

553
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,590
Their colors are different.

554
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,540
The difference is

555
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,710
that you need to look for the pink heart

556
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,160
in the emoji list
in the bottom left corner,
that you need to look for the pink heart

557
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,400
in the emoji list
in the bottom left corner,

558
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,300
whereas you can easily find

559
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,260
the red heart in Stickers.

560
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,310
This...

561
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,500
This is too much.

562
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,860
(Qinglai Art Training)

563
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,840
We've attached

564
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,310
a profit-sharing table
after the upgrade.

565
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,230
Check it out.

566
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,610
Do you need anything else?

567
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,780
Ms. Tang, do you have any questions?

568
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,450
No questions.

569
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,980
Thanks.

570
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,600
Today's interview

571
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,440
is over.

572
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,350
We're leaving.

573
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,310
We'll contact you

574
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,150
if we need anything else.

575
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,610
Okay. Thanks, Mr. Chen.

576
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,310
Thanks, Ms. Tang, Ms. Fan.

577
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,260
Our pleasure.

578
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,440
Let's go.

579
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,990
Ms. Tang, thanks for your effort.

580
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,340
It's not a big deal.

581
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,500
It seems

582
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,100
many of your colleagues are absent.

583
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,570
Our branch's staff

584
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,880
need to visit different neighborhoods

585
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,210
every day.

586
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,360
They're usually out

587
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,980
expect for the weekly meetings.

588
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,400
Okay. I got it. Let's go.

589
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,300
Ms. Tang, this way, please.

590
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,220
(Qinglai Art Training,
Colorful Childhood for Children)

591
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,750
Ms. Tang,
I have an appointment with a client.

592
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,060
I won't go back with you.

593
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,650
Okay. Just go.

594
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,840
Bye, Linlang.

595
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,680
Bye.

596
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,910
Yang,

597
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,790
well,

598
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,850
shall we go back?

599
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,060
Are you still at the company?

600
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,340
(Feng Weiran has gone crazy.)

601
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,370
He can't go home anyway,

602
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,550
so he's been staying at the hotel
next to hour company

603
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,670
(and forcing me to work overtime,)

604
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,820
(even on weekends.)

605
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,030
I was going to

606
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,890
ask him for a favor on Sunday.

607
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,360
What is it? Why are you asking him?

608
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,200
Why don't you ask me?

609
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,500
You?

610
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,450
It's also acceptable.

611
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,500
Okay. I'm finished.

612
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,790
He doesn't like to drink water.

613
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,400
Remember to let him drink water
every two hours.

614
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,040
Okay.

615
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,510
There are also some snacks.

616
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,410
Let him have some when he's tired
after playing with you.

617
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,400
Don't worry, I'll bring him back

618
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,680
safe and sound.

619
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,520
Okay.

620
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,210
Qi.

621
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,170
Listen to your godmother,

622
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,350
okay?

623
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,790
- Understand?
- It's okay.

624
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,640
Just let him be himself

625
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,740
as usual.

626
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,110
Time to go.

627
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,310
Let's go.

628
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,510
Take your model car.

629
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,580
Come on. Take it.

630
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,760
Let's go.

631
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,170
Let's go.

632
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,030
Let's go.

633
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,870
Goodbye.

634
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,310
By the way,

635
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,850
haven't you let him go home?

636
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,150
No.

637
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,650
Do you know what he did?

638
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,780
He promised to cancel
the sale of that apartment,

639
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,300
but it turns out

640
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,030
he secretly handed it over
to another agency.

641
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,340
Do you think I should let him come back?

642
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,400
But you must find a way

643
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,580
to solve this.

644
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,580
Can you talk to him?

645
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,990
Maybe he has to sell the apartment

646
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,540
for an important reason.

647
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,680
I'll think about it.

648
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,060
Big car.

649
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,760
Tell me,

650
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,960
do you remember

651
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,040
what you should call me today?

652
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,540
Daddy.

653
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,240
Yes.

654
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,410
What about her?

655
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,720
Mommy.

656
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,590
Brilliant.

657
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,340
I'll buy snacks for you later.

658
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,020
You can go.

659
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,450
- Thank you.
- Bye.

660
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,060
Sweetheart, be a good boy.

661
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,720
Let's go.

662
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,110
- Say goodbye.
- Bye.

663
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,950
Goodbye.

664
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,240
Be a good boy.

665
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,240
Let's go.

666
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,500
(Qinglai Fine Art Class)

667
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,930
Hello, Qi.

668
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,360
Qi's parents, sorry to keep you waiting.

669
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,600
- Here, check it out.
- Okay.

670
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,500
- Thanks.
- I'll give you a brief introduction.

671
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,640
Qinglai Art Training

672
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
focuses on training courses

673
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,070
from pre-school to middle school,

674
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,790
including fine art, singing, modeling,

675
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,200
broadcasting and hosting, dancing,

676
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,650
calligraphy, piano, violin, and so on.

677
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,680
We have first-class

678
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,540
teachers, environment,

679
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,850
and teaching quality.

680
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,550
Our son Qi

681
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,960
is fond of drawing,

682
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,970
so we want

683
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:49,930
to sign up for a drawing class.

684
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,070
However, we need to work
after sending him here in the afternoon,

685
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,270
so we want him to learn
something else apart from drawing,

686
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,400
so that we can pick him up after work

687
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,110
to avoid wasting time.

688
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,440
- Yes.
- We also want him

689
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,850
to find more hobbies.

690
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,640
If that's the case, you can consider

691
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,880
singing, piano,

692
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,840
or dancing,

693
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,930
maybe street dance.

694
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,540
Street dance is good.

695
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,450
What about the fees?

696
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,720
As for drawing class on weekends,

697
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,230
each lesson lasts for 45 minutes,

698
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,270
two lessons per day,

699
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,740
and 20 lessons a semester.

700
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,070
You need to pay 2600 yuan

701
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,920
for one semester,

702
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,030
4500 yuan

703
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,920
for two semesters,

704
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,790
or 6000 yuan

705
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,680
for three or more semesters.

706
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,750
You can get the best price

707
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,380
with a one-time purchase
for three semesters.

708
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,600
I get it. It means each lesson costs

709
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,560
130 yuan,

710
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,400
112.5 yuan, or 100 yuan
with different kinds of purchases.

711
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,170
Qi's mother, you're good at calculating.

712
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,880
You can even get
10 extra lessons for free

713
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,340
if you pay for
five semesters at one time.

714
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,890
Each one will cost less than 100 yuan.

715
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,960
It sounds good.

716
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,800
Yes.

717
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,410
Can we return or change lessons?

718
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,360
Qi's mother,

719
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,170
actually, you can consider
getting an annual pass.

720
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,240
For annual passes,
we charge by the hour.

721
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,360
You can not only change lessons

722
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,470
but change classes.

723
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,790
For example,
if Qi doesn't want to learn piano,

724
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,270
you can let him

725
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,170
attend dance lessons.

726
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,270
Besides,

727
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,920
you get 2000 yuan
for a deposit of 10 thousand yuan,

728
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
equivalent to a 20% discount.

729
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,780
You get 10 thousand yuan
for a deposit of 30 thousand yuan,

730
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,700
equivalent to a 34% discount.

731
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,640
If I get 30 thousand yuan
for a deposit of 60 thousand yuan,

732
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,300
I'll get a 50% discount.

733
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,210
It's really a good bargain.

734
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,550
If we can't finish the lessons,

735
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,400
can we return the fees?

736
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,550
Of course.

737
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,030
However, I won't recommend it

738
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,600
because we'll charge

739
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,740
10% of your deposit in the card.

740
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,590
I suggest that you

741
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,630
transfer it to someone else.

742
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,760
Transfer?

743
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,070
For instance,

744
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,600
our annual pass will be valid

745
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,450
for six years,

746
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,790
and it's registered
with your information.

747
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,400
If Qi wants to quit,

748
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,290
and you have

749
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,440
a second child,

750
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,040
you can send your child here
to take lessons.

751
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,880
If you don't want that either,

752
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,030
you can also transfer it

753
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,960
to other kids.

754
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,750
However, each card

755
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,070
can only pay for one child's

756
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,910
lessons.

757
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,470
Well, 60 thousand yuan

758
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,960
- is a lot.
- Yes.

759
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,920
What if you run away

760
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,760
after

761
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,890
receiving the money?

762
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,400
Qi's father, you're so funny.

763
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,960
Qinglai Art Training
have many branch schools

764
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,850
and many students.

765
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,170
Why would we run away
for 60 thousand yuan?

766
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,590
Yes. That's right.

767
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,980
- I'm just kidding.
- That's true.

768
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,000
Sorry about that.

769
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,350
To be honest,

770
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,030
60 thousand yuan

771
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,230
is not cheap or expensive.

772
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,440
But think about it,

773
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,880
if you lose some money
in the stock market,

774
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,400
have some family trips,

775
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,510
or buy a few bags,

776
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,720
- you'll spend the money too.
- That's true.

777
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,680
However, if you send your son here,

778
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,640
he can improve his abilities

779
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,600
and find hobbies

780
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,310
in primary and even middle schools.

781
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,540
Besides, we have the best teachers.

782
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,550
By the way, our piano teacher

783
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,400
Xu Ruyue

784
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,410
won a lot of international awards.

785
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
Last year, two students

786
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,240
won the gold awards

787
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,490
of international competitions.

788
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,310
Xu Ruyue? I...

789
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,060
Why does it sound so familiar?

790
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,880
Did you forget it? We ate

791
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,840
hotpot together.

792
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,720
With Yanan and the others?

793
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,560
Yes.

794
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,440
Yes, we know

795
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,290
Ms. Xu.

796
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,450
Yes. She's quite famous.

797
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,830
Right?

798
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,650
Sorry, Qi's parents,

799
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,400
they told me

800
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,680
the 60-thousand-yuan Annual Pass

801
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,270
is such a good deal

802
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,980
that it has been sold out.

803
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,910
What?

804
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,880
But if you

805
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,470
really want it,

806
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,360
I can apply

807
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,270
for you,

808
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,650
but it might not work.

809
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Why don't you consider

810
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,400
a 100-thousand-yuan Platinum Card?

811
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,300
It's a great deal,

812
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,840
and there are only three spots left.

813
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,130
It's valid for ten years,

814
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,070
but your kid can get individual tuition

815
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,060
for each class.

816
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,210
100 thousand yuan? This...

817
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,680
Only three spots left?

818
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,790
Yes, only three spots.

819
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,020
You need to hurry up.

820
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,230
It's so popular.

821
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,210
Yes.

822
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,880
How about this? I need

823
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,820
to discuss it with my husband.

824
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,160
Yes, we need

825
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,210
a few minutes for discussion.

826
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,200
Okay.

827
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,650
Then we're taking Qi

828
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,780
to preview the lessons.

829
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,510
Okay. You can start with

830
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,610
the drawing classroom.

831
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,720
Okay.

832
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,510
If you need anything,

833
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,400
please tell me.

834
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,820
Okay. Thanks.

835
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,740
Qi, let's have some fun
at the drawing classroom.

836
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,540
Your acting is good.

837
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,120
(Qinglai Art Training)
Qinglai is cheap,

838
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,200
but I think

839
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,740
they change the teachers so frequently.

840
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,440
I heard

841
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,120
they made deals

842
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,960
with many art schools.

843
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,650
They send their students here
to teach lessons.

844
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,160
This month,

845
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,030
the dance teacher

846
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,300
has been changed twice.

847
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,840
But it's still popular.

848
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,990
On my way here,

849
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,070
I say them handing out flyers

850
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,930
at Nanjin.

851
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,360
The new branch school is about to open.

852
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,510
If you pay 500 yuan,

853
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,880
it can count for 2000 yuan

854
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,210
when it's officially opened.

855
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,310
Many parents are lining up

856
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,170
to pay the fees.

857
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,120
Won't they lose a lot of money?

858
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,610
If 10 thousand people

859
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,880
pay 500 yuan respectively,

860
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,790
they'll lose 15 million yuan

861
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,210
when the school is opened.

862
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,990
They want to attract customers.

863
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,820
There's a lot of competition
in every industry, right?

864
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,110
That's right.

865
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,260
Look who's waiting for us.

866
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,760
Mommy.

867
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,640
Mommy, we went to the bathroom.

868
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,480
Let's go.

869
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,150
Let's go.

870
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,310
Come out.

871
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,170
I paid a lot of money for your lessons.

872
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,750
You're always crying!

873
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,840
What else can you do?

874
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,070
- Hey! How can you...?
- What else can you do?

875
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,920
She's so...

876
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,450
Listen, get up!

877
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,850
I'll punish you when we get home!

878
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,060
I'll beat you up!

879
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,750
What kind of parent is that?

880
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,310
- Exactly.
- How can you hit a kid like that?

881
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,680
- He's so young.
- I'm teaching my son!

882
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,600
It's none of your business.

883
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,790
You can't hit him even if he's your son.

884
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,310
We're in public.

885
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,030
It's wrong to hit your kid,

886
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,350
and there are other kids.

887
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,230
What if they're traumatized?

888
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,440
Yes. There are other kids.

889
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,990
You know this is a public place.

890
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,750
You're not the only one who can speak.

891
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,640
I can also accuse you

892
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,790
of interfering with my education!

893
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,030
Was that education?

894
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,160
You kicked him!

895
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,940
What kind of parent
would hit their children like that?

896
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,650
Sorry, excuse me.

897
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,590
Are you crazy? Why are you apologizing?

898
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,510
Enough. Let's go.

899
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,000
- Get out of here.
- Sorry, everyone.

900
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,400
Sorry, that mother

901
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,750
- made a mistake.
- She pushed you. Are you okay?

902
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,360
Please leave here.

903
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,340
- I'm okay.
- Please leave.

904
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,740
It's okay. Calm down.

905
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,440
Qi, don't move.

906
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,300
You can play later.

907
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,580
Why did you stop me?

908
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,120
That parent and I are both women.

909
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,100
It doesn't matter if we argue.

910
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,740
If you helped me

911
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,650
to argue with her,

912
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,890
they'd think we were bullying her.

913
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,470
After all, you're Yixiu's CEO.

914
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,130
You're a public figure.

915
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,170
I didn't think about myself.

916
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,790
But It's normal for me

917
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,060
to care about you.

918
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,890
Speaking of which,

919
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,500
you haven't changed all these years.

920
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,580
You still like to fight injustice
and help people in need.

921
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,450
If I didn't,
I would be ashamed of myself.

922
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,650
However, as I grow older, I've realized

923
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,640
that the speed and timing of action

924
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,480
is also important.

925
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,580
Really?

926
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,300
When we're old,

927
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,060
I can write a book

928
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,110
of your sayings.

929
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,610
It's called
How Tang Yang Fights Injustice.

930
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,640
- Then you must glorify me
- Of course.

931
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,130
with your best vocabulary.

932
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,150
Okay.

933
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,280
Godmother.

934
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,070
If my mom scolds me,

935
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,300
can I call you?

936
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,060
Qi,

937
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,890
I might get scared

938
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,400
because your mother

939
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,200
is the top martial arts master.

940
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,340
None of us can defeat her.

941
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,920
Okay.

942
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,650
Then I won't take this back.

943
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,650
Why? Don't you want it?

944
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,300
My mom said

945
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,850
if I fall when playing this,

946
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,440
I'll become an idiot

947
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,310
and forget how to eat food.

948
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,890
Then why did you ask me
to buy a big one?

949
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,440
You'll keep it for me.

950
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,750
When I grow up

951
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,680
and get rid of my mom,

952
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,850
I'll pick it up.

953
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,980
Naughty boy.

954
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,410
We need to take his skateboard back.

955
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,390
It's okay.

956
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,740
Qi, if you give it to me,
I'll skateboard,

957
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,850
Aren't you afraid of falling
and becoming an idiot?

958
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,740
I'm good at skateboarding.

959
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,680
(Did Qi fool you)

960
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,030
- (into buying gifts for him?)
- Coffee.

961
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,120
(Don't spoil him.)

962
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,160
(I can take the rest
except for the skateboard!)

963
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,450
- Jiang Yanan.
- (Did you forget Feng Weiran)

964
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,040
(broke his leg in high school
when skateboarding?)

965
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,600
(What if he falls on the head
and becomes an idiot?)

966
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,540
(My son can't become an idiot!)

967
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,540
- (If he...)
- Don't listen to her.

968
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,060
She's so annoying.

969
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,860
She's talkative.

970
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,760
Luckily,

971
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,980
you came with me today,

972
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,460
so we can take the blame together.

973
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,600
No need to take the blame,
(*Blame: Homophone of Pot)

974
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,760
but we can use the pot

975
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,980
to make some dishes.

976
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,150
Have a drink

977
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,990
and a chat,

978
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,650
what a wonderful life.

979
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,910
Come on.

980
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,950
Cheers.

981
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,380
Do you remember?

982
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,630
When we were in high school,

983
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,570
this was the biggest trend.

984
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,630
Of course. Feng Weiran broke his leg

985
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,060
because of this.

986
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,960
Then our school banned skateboards

987
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,460
in campus.

988
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,810
Back then, I was quite good at it.

989
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,990
That's in the past,

990
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,250
not now.

991
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,550
You've got an old body.

992
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,470
Don't play it.

993
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,580
Old body?

994
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,360
I'm still young

995
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,290
and energetic.

996
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,630
For real?

997
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,060
You're almost 30, bro.

998
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,030
Hold this for me.

999
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,910
What are you going to do?

1000
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,060
- Show you what I've got.
- Don't!

1001
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,960
Jiang Shiyan, calm down.

1002
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,670
After all, you're

1003
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,280
a billionaire CEO now.

1004
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,440
If you break your leg,

1005
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,380
how am I supposed to tell Feng Weiran
and your employees?

1006
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:16,920
Do you think I'm

1007
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,400
a clumsy person like him? Watch this.

1008
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,670
Be... Be careful.

1009
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,510
Stay calm.

1010
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,650
Yang, how's that?

1011
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,770
Not bad.

1012
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,460
Come on. Give it a try.

1013
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,470
Not for me.

1014
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,610
I don't want to fall.

1015
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,400
I'll hold your hand

1016
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,730
and help you get on the skateboard.

1017
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,810
- Come on.
- Keep it slow. I'm bad at it.

1018
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,600
Let me think.

1019
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,550
Come on.

1020
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,880
- Step on it.
- Which foot?

1021
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,720
Left or right?

1022
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,210
Jiang Shiyan, you...

1023
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,390
Proposal!

1024
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,840
No.

1025
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,910
Marry him! Marry him!

1026
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,030
Marry him! Marry him!

1027
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,870
Tang Yang.

1028
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,910
You...

1029
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,210
Call the ambulance!

1030
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,430
What?

1031
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,380
What happened?

1032
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,390
Jiang Shiyan!

1033
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,170
What's wrong?

1034
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,880
- Is he okay?
- Please call the ambulance!

1035
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,380
Thanks! What's wrong?

1036
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,180
(Ambulance)

1037
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,470
Save one house for me

1038
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,540
at No. 1 Bay.

1039
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,670
Yanan, our boss is waiting for you.

1040
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,510
Okay.

1041
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,540
I can put a down payment, okay?

1042
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,100
Sweetheart, let's go.

1043
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,720
Yanan.

1044
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,990
Yanan.

1045
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,420
Wan Jun?

1046
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,440
Why are you here?

1047
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,630
I invited my friends over

1048
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,670
for dinner.

1049
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,810
By the way, let me introduce him.

1050
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,470
This is Ge Liang, the sales director

1051
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,550
of most promising property No. 1 Bay.

1052
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,920
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1053
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,880
Ge Liang gave you a 5% discount

1054
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,170
for your apartment.

1055
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,170
Our apartment?

1056
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,940
Yes, the luxury apartment
with a full view.

1057
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,250
You've put a down payment, right?

1058
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,920
Did you sell

1059
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,760
the current apartment?

1060
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
Remember, you have to sign
the digital contract

1061
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,690
in two months.

1062
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,610
Okay. Don't worry.

1063
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,280
- Thank you.
- Not a big deal.

1064
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,480
It's really been a long time.

1065
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,510
Yes. Come here

1066
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,690
whenever you have time.

1067
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,830
Absolutely.

1068
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,610
- Wan Jun.
- My friend is calling me.

1069
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
- Okay.
- I'll talk to him.

1070
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,840
Okay. Goodbye.

1071
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,150
Looking forward to seeing you again.

1072
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,310
Mom, it hurts.

1073
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,900
Sweetheart, sorry for this.

1074
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,640
Li.

1075
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,130
Play with him for a while.

1076
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,860
Qi, be a good boy.

1077
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,350
Honey,

1078
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:07,990
where's our son?

1079
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,290
I asked them to take him away,

1080
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,280
because our conversation
in the next few minutes

1081
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,690
will not benefit his growth.

1082
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,020
Growth?

1083
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,800
Honey, don't be angry.

1084
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,190
I've realized my mistake.

1085
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,110
okay?

1086
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,280
I know

1087
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,630
that's the first apartment we bought

1088
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,610
when we had nothing.

1089
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,030
We don't live there anymore,

1090
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,810
but it's full of our memories.

1091
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,400
I'm not selling the apartment

1092
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,500
but our precious memories.

1093
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,170
Please don't be angry.

1094
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,950
Honey,

1095
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,020
I'm very happy now

1096
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,020
because you finally understand me.

1097
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,670
Then we'll never sell

1098
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,610
that apartment,

1099
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,390
okay?

1100
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,900
Never.

1101
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,950
Come on.

1102
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,860
Let's swear and make a deal.

1103
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,650
Whoever breaks the promise

1104
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
will fail in every investment

1105
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,730
ever since.

1106
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,920
This is so unnecessary.

1107
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,210
Honey, this is too much.

1108
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,470
What's going on?

1109
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,670
You wouldn't dare?

1110
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,510
No.

1111
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,650
Or you just want to please me

1112
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,280
and persuade me to let you

1113
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,130
sell the apartment

1114
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,730
so that you can have the quota

1115
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,400
to buy another one at No. 1 Bay.

1116
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,240
No...

1117
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,540
No. 1...

1118
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,150
Who told you?

1119
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,990
What's this?

1120
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,640
- Gifs.
- Bracelet or watch.

1121
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,560
Bracelet.

1122
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,530
Eight diamonds?

1123
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,470
Shining gold.

1124
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,310
Pearl bracelet?

1125
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,630
Mabe pearls...

1126
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,110
Feng Weiran,

1127
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,500
you're breaking my heart!

1128
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,070
Do you think
I'll forgive you for anything

1129
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,070
if you buy some gifts for me

1130
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,190
when we have a fight?

1131
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,030
That's not what I...

1132
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,730
Do you even know
how to tell the truth now?

1133
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,760
You've even put the down payment
on a No. 1 Bay apartment.

1134
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,150
When are you going to tell me?

1135
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,110
I wasn't going to hide it from you!

1136
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,500
I went to see the apartments
with my college friend the other day

1137
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,650
and found that the apartment
well-designed,

1138
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,650
close to schools

1139
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,600
and big malls,

1140
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,610
and very cheap.

1141
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,350
Most importantly,
it has purchase restrictions.

1142
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,400
I bought it

1143
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,250
on an impulse.

1144
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,720
Then I realized

1145
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,760
I didn't tell you about it,

1146
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,360
so I wouldn't dare to bring it up.

1147
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,610
- I was afraid you'd be angry.
- Feng Weiran.

1148
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,770
Listen to yourself.

1149
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,990
If it was that good,

1150
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,170
why wouldn't you tell me?

1151
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,590
Am I that unreasonable?

1152
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,800
- You're not...
- Or do you think

1153
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,880
I've become an idiot

1154
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,580
since I quit my job

1155
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,670
and became a housewife a long time ago?

1156
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,280
- I didn't, honey...
- No?

1157
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,730
Then it's because of you.

1158
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,110
Your business is growing rapidly,

1159
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,720
and you're a shining star,

1160
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,030
so you don't care about
my opinions, right?

1161
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,190
I'm not a shining star!

1162
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,960
I couldn't talk.

1163
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,050
Couldn't talk? You didn't even tell me
about selling the apartment.

1164
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,400
It's not like that.

1165
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,670
You didn't tell me about your company.

1166
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,510
It's not true.

1167
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,650
Every time I ask about your company,

1168
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,950
- you change the topic.
- I didn't.

1169
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,960
You did. You did.

1170
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,150
You always change the topic!

1171
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,150
Can't you put yourself in my shoes?

1172
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,290
Everyone is watching us!

1173
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,360
I made a mistake about the apartment.

1174
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,690
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

1175
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,110
It was Shiyan who made

1176
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,150
most decisions for our company.

1177
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,950
Blame Shiyan?

1178
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,170
I'm not blaming him...

1179
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,070
(Yang)

1180
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,580
I'm not blaming him.

1181
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,790
I wouldn't dare

1182
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,110
to tell you many things

1183
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,070
until he made the final call.

1184
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,580
I was afraid that you'd be upset

1185
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,920
when it failed,

1186
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,980
- and you might...
- Shut up.

1187
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,860
(Yang)

1188
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,280
Hello, Yang.

1189
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,540
Jiang Shiyan?

1190
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,350
Okay.

1191
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,730
We're coming. I'm with him.

1192
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,810
Okay. Bye.

1193
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,240
What's wrong?

1194
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,210
Jiang Shiyan is in hospital.

1195
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,560
Appendicitis.

1196
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,730
Hurry. I'll drive the car.

1197
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,800
Let's go.

1198
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,880
I also have a car. See you later.

1199
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,250
Stop joking, ho...

1200
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,610
- Don't...
- Move.

1201
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,250
Honey, wait!

1202
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,140
(Out-patient Clinic)

1203
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,980
Pay attention to
postoperative gas excretion.

1204
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,000
He can't eat anything

1205
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,250
until the next day.

1206
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,880
In the first two days
after he starts to eat,

1207
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,210
he can only eat liquid food

1208
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,020
What should we do?

1209
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,950
Are you okay?

1210
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,190
Stop shaking.

1211
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,030
I can't.

1212
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,100
I'm so tired.

1213
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,380
- What?
- I can't carry him.

1214
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,110
Jiang Shiyan, you're up.

1215
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,420
I can't. I'm also exhausted.

1216
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,770
Feng Weiran, you're...

1217
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,400
you're thin, but...

1218
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,210
you're too big and heavy.

1219
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,200
Yes.

1220
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,170
I'm literally exhausted.

1221
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,580
I nearly fell

1222
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,980
on the way here.

1223
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,380
What should I do?

1224
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,900
Skip the class? Stay here?

1225
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,960
Hurry. It's class time.

1226
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,550
Why is the hallway so long?

1227
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,440
Come on. I'll try again.

1228
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,810
You're so weak.

1229
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,150
Slow down!

1230
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,470
Guys.

1231
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,770
- Yang.
- Why are you so silly?

1232
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,170
Why don't you borrow a stretcher
to carry him?

1233
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,130
Is there a stretcher?

1234
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,510
I borrowed it

1235
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,350
from our health teacher.

1236
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,880
Didn't we learn to use

1237
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,400
stretchers and bandages

1238
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,240
in the rescue class?

1239
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,020
Hey! Be careful!

1240
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,330
Yang, you're the best.

1241
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,190
Hurry up!

1242
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,130
Come on.
