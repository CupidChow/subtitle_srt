=You Are My Lover Friend=

=Episode 17=
=I Really Like You=

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,500
I founded Yixiu Found of Food

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,740
because of you.

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,190
Because of me?

30
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,850
Yes.

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,740
You were studying abroad.

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,970
You complained to me all day

33
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,830
about lacking goodies

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,450
and having to munch bread

35
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,300
while making models.

36
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,930
You'd grumble to me about the food

37
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,180
you wanted to eat.

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,740
So you ate it all on my behalf.

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,090
You'd go to all these

40
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,430
incredibly delicious restaurants

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,740
and write reviews for me.

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,640
Meanwhile, I was gnawing on cold bread,

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,530
reading about you

44
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,480
eating clay pot rice,

45
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,510
spicy skewers,

46
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,090
cold pot fish,

47
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,110
nine-grid hotpot,

48
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,580
and trotters soup.

49
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,690
Isn't this the modern version
of filling the hunger

50
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,580
with pictures of food?

51
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,880
So, as I kept writing,

52
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,720
I became a blogger

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,510
with a million followers.

54
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,410
Then, I teamed up with Feng

55
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,180
to film those food review videos.

56
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,200
The videos you made

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,920
were my only source of motivation

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,710
during those long, soulless nights

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,020
working on assignments.

60
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,710
Whenever I filmed those videos,
I thought,

61
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,020
"I have to make it look
incredibly delicious,"

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,640
"so Yang can imagine"

63
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,670
"how tasty it is."

64
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,810
One time,

65
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,710
I really wanted to eat at this

66
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,410
offal hot pot place.

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,550
I posted in advance

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,710
that I was going.

69
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,950
Guess who I ran into?

70
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,160
Who?

71
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,370
Cheng Hui.

72
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,720
He'd traveled around the world

73
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,990
with his parents,

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,830
who worked abroad,

75
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,270
so he ate various foods.

76
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,340
When he grew up and came back,

77
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,990
he followed my notes

78
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,990
to visit those restaurants.

79
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,990
Finally, at the offal hotpot place,

80
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,270
he caught me.

81
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,020
Then it was me, Feng Weiran,
and Cheng Hui,

82
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,950
who founded Yixiu Found of Food.

83
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,860
So, without you,

84
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,780
there wouldn't be Yixiu today.

85
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,550
Back then, every time

86
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,760
I went to a restaurant,

87
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,600
I'd think,

88
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,670
"If only Yang were here."

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,850
So when I found
an especially good place,

90
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,850
I'd make a note

91
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,830
on my phone,

92
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,020
thinking that when you came back,

93
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,530
I'd take you to eat.

94
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,580
But when you finally returned to China,

95
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,430
you joined CBBC

96
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,340
and had training from HQ,

97
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,000
job rotations,

98
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,330
and tasks abroad.

99
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,830
After these years,

100
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,830
you finally came back for real.

101
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,100
But many of the places
I saved on my phone

102
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,100
are no longer there.

103
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,190
Some must still be around, right?

104
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,410
Yes.

105
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,310
I'm sure many are there.

106
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,930
You can take me to those places

107
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,980
one by one.

108
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,310
Didn't I just say?

109
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,240
Back then,

110
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,830
I didn't know how
to repay you.

111
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,190
You were genuinely good to me,

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,930
but I didn't know

113
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,420
if you were this kind to others too.

114
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,950
So, I was always a bit uncertain.

115
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,340
I really like this.

116
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,190
I like

117
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,070
that after work, we could dine together,

118
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,340
enjoying meals and drinks.

119
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
On holidays,

120
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,900
we could shop together

121
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,980
or play badminton.

122
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,340
When we were working overtime,

123
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,420
we'd focus on our tasks.

124
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,100
I really want things to stay this way,

125
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,980
but I don't know how long it will last.

126
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,510
When will things change?

127
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,660
When will I upset you

128
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,980
or make you unhappy?

129
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,440
Recently,

130
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,750
I watched a drama,

131
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,200
and in it, the female lead,

132
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,510
on the day of graduation,

133
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,970
shouted to the boy

134
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,750
who liked her.

135
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,120
She said,

136
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,660
"I like you."

137
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,310
"It's the kind between classmates"

138
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,100
"and desk mates,"

139
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,320
"but it's also the heartfelt kind"

140
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,660
"between teenagers."

141
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,780
In fact, I like it too.

142
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,310
Or maybe I'm just used

143
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,190
to hanging out with you every day.

144
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,460
Maybe it's because all these years,

145
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,150
we've always been there for each other.

146
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,730
So, during that time

147
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,540
when I wasn't in Rongcheng,

148
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,390
I didn't feel particularly lonely.

149
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,340
But I still wondered

150
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,580
what exactly

151
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,630
this feeling was between us.

152
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,270
How about we...

153
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,720
How about...

154
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,630
Let's just let things happen naturally.

155
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,950
Just like before.

156
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,420
No need to force any changes.

157
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,540
We don't need to overthink or worry.

158
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,840
We've known each other

159
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,630
well enough to have a strong bond.

160
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,830
Let things happen naturally?

161
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,680
It's...

162
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,040
It's...

163
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,630
How exactly should we do that?

164
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,770
Well.

165
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,100
For example, like now.

166
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,810
If we want to see each other,

167
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,150
we'll just meet up.

168
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,760
If we're too busy to meet,

169
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,900
that's okay too.

170
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,950
There's no pressure.

171
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,100
No need to prove anything,

172
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,660
and no fear of losing.

173
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,720
Hello, Mom.

174
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,510
I'm just taking out the trash.

175
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,780
I'll be right up.

176
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,850
Well then.

177
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,170
Good night.

178
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,090
President Zhou.

179
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,590
Director Gan took sick leave.

180
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,020
From the way he sounded,

181
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,630
it seems like he'll take a long break.

182
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,320
Should we have Deputy Director Qin

183
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,490
handle the work

184
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,330
in the division?

185
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,630
Let Tang Yang take over.

186
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,880
Understood.

187
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,230
Where is Fan Linlang?

188
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,530
She messaged me,

189
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,650
said she was feeling unwell,

190
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,820
and requested a sick day.

191
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,750
Director Gan took sick leave?

192
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,180
Took leave? Is it true?

193
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,290
No idea.

194
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,390
The management asked Director Tang

195
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,660
to cover for Director Gan for now.

196
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,770
So, for today's meeting,

197
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,180
Director Tang will preside.

198
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,590
Alright, let's begin.

199
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,210
Everyone, share the status

200
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,330
of your projects,

201
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,650
and we'll discuss the project

202
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,770
of increasing the loan

203
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,660
for Qinglai Art School.

204
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,250
This is our first

205
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,650
(A Food Leisure Database for Everyone)
co-branded product:

206
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,780
(Yixiu)
Zhilan Snacks.

207
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,300
It's officially online today.

208
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,020
Once it's launched,

209
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,090
the product's page will appear

210
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,700
on Yixiu's splash screen,

211
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,250
home page,

212
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,090
and shopping mall.

213
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,370
From now until 10 p.m.,

214
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,820
our five live streamers will be

215
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,890
live-streaming for 10 hours straight

216
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,820
to promote this product.

217
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,560
We really appreciate

218
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
your trust in Yixiu.

219
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,940
- Here.
- Hope we'll work well.

220
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,080
Let's take a picture. Smile.

221
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,300
- Sure.
- Okay.

222
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,180
(A Food Leisure Database for Everyone)

223
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,900
Let's choose this one.

224
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,090
Everyone's clapping.

225
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,320
Alright, I'll have them use this photo

226
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,610
in the public account post.

227
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,610
Okay, send it to me.

228
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,450
Okay.

229
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,850
Do you think if I

230
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,660
sent that group photo to Yang,

231
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,510
it'd feel unnatural?

232
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,110
I mean, would it disturb her work?

233
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,420
It's up to you

234
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,180
whether you send it or not.

235
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,180
What if she's busy?

236
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,010
She'll just reply

237
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,110
when she's free.

238
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,420
Why don't you ask her?

239
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,610
How can I ask her?

240
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,660
That'd be too deliberate.

241
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,000
What did you say?

242
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,210
Nothing.

243
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,050
What's with you?

244
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,150
Hello? No need for a loan.

245
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,050
Chang Xinyi?

246
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,540
Oh, sorry, sorry,

247
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,870
I thought it was a spam call.

248
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,230
Okay, alright, got it.

249
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,230
Sure, bye.

250
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,990
Wait. Did I hear that right?

251
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,420
Chang Xinyi called you?

252
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,990
Your dream girl, Chang Xinyi,

253
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,290
actually called you?

254
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,630
What are you talking about?

255
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,090
I remember back then,

256
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,660
you used to talk about her every day.

257
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,120
You took the same bus

258
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,870
just to see her.

259
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,610
You sang love songs to her every day.

260
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,450
Enough.

261
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,160
Don't say anything like that anymore.

262
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,540
I have a kid now.

263
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,390
So, what did she want?

264
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,850
She said she was back and wanted

265
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,940
to meet up with classmates.

266
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,970
Let's meet then.

267
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Didn't we agree last time

268
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,850
that we'd meet up again?

269
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,780
It's perfect.

270
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,110
Why are you so worked up?

271
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,870
I'll tell Yang about it.

272
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,520
Forget it.

273
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,360
It feels unnatural.

274
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,300
It's natural,

275
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,210
but you're

276
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,940
acting anything

277
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,120
but natural today.

278
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,640
Come on, tell her.

279
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,630
It's not a big deal.

280
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,180
Telling her on purpose feels unnatural.

281
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,270
So, have you guys

282
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,700
confessed to each other?

283
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,230
Don't say that.

284
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,590
There's no confession.

285
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,490
It sounds so forced.

286
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,700
So unnatural.

287
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,210
Alright.

288
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,060
So, how naturally are things going

289
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,170
between you two now?

290
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,630
It's not going anywhere.

291
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,960
After we decided

292
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,520
to let things happen yesterday,

293
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,990
I said "Good morning".

294
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,990
I was having meetings this morning.

295
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,920
It's been a whole morning

296
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,990
without any contact.

297
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,700
(Zhilan Snacks)

298
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,390
Then you reach out to him,

299
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,630
texting "This sauce is amazing."

300
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,180
I'm not sure.

301
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,610
If I initiate,

302
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,680
won't it feel like

303
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,820
I'm pushing him to text me?

304
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,730
Then don't reach out.

305
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,800
But if I don't, it'll seem

306
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,770
like I don't care at all.

307
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,610
You know?

308
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,520
So do you want

309
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,700
to text him or not?

310
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,610
I just don't want him

311
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,820
to feel like I'm annoying,

312
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,520
but I also don't want him to think

313
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,820
I don't care enough.

314
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,940
It's so strange.

315
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,450
Before, I could text or call

316
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,780
whenever I wanted.

317
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,180
But ever since we agreed on this,

318
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,920
everything feels deliberate
and unnatural.

319
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,350
Seems I can't do anything right.

320
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,540
How about this?

321
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,870
Go to Yixiu now.

322
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,300
No, no, no.

323
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,250
Well.

324
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,610
That's way too much.

325
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,990
He'll think I'm being unnatural.

326
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,370
Stop laughing.

327
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,660
Help me think of something.

Yan...

330
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,020
Good afternoon.

331
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,640
Good afternoon.

332
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,180
- Did you eat...
- Did you...

333
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,990
Did you eat lunch?

334
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,250
I already ate.

335
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,090
Did you have lunch?

336
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,350
I just finished.

337
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,050
What did you eat?

338
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,480
Eel rice.

339
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,880
Was it good?

340
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,000
It was delicious.

341
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,590
For lunch today,
I had the co-branded sauce

342
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,490
of Zhilan Snacks and Yixiu.

343
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,250
It was amazing.

344
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,420
Qin Yue kept raving about it.

345
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,350
Speaking of sauces,

our co-branded product with Zhilan

347
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,390
officially launched today.

348
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,880
Congrats.

349
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,250
I spent the whole morning

350
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,350
in meetings.

351
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,970
Really?

352
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,880
So,

353
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,700
do you think we're being

354
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,350
natural now?

355
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,900
Natural enough, I guess.

356
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,450
What do you think?

357
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,930
I think it is

358
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,940
pretty natural too.

359
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,400
Right?

360
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,110
Excuse me.

361

Alright.

00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,770
Is it urgent?

365
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,980
No, it's nothing. You go ahead.

366
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,110
We'll talk later.

367
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,980
- President Gao.
- Tang Yang.

368
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,550
- Please, have a seat.
- Sure.

- Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

381
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,630
Got lattes and americanos.

382
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,690
- Pass them around.
- Come on.

383
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,530
Mr. Jiang.

384
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,550
Saw the trending news?

385
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,900
You mean Yue Ya got fined
over 40 million?

386
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,680
Yeah, I saw that.

387
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,650
False advertising,

388
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,520
counterfeiting,

389
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,420
and the violations.

390
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,420
There were so many penalties.

391
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,870
Karma caught up to her fast.

392
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,150
We should be careful too.

393
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,630
I've told Peng Si

394
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,520
to be extra cautious during our

395
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,360
live streams.

396
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,550
Though it has nothing to do with us,

397
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,180
she might pull some tricks.

398
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,500
Over 40 million isn't a small sum,

399
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,150
and she's got a huge team to support.

400
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,590
Kuaiqi is a new company.

401
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,790
Her deal adds pressure.

402
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,810
Understood.

403
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,490
Come on, clean up.

404
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,390
We're going for dinner.

405
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,120
Alright.

406
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,030
(Jingjing)
Everyone,

407
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,450
a small classmate gathering

408
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,070
this Saturday at the tavern.

409
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,640
Mr. Jiang,

410
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,590
are you joining us for dinner tonight?

411
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,560
Whether I can go depends

412
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,590
on Mr. Feng Weiran.

413
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,170
He's been making me stay up

414
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,010
for meetings lately.

415
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,070
Ask Mr. Feng to join us.

416
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,500
You've still got to eat.

417
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,210
I know a great underground kitchen

418
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,050
near the CBD,

419
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,070
right next to CBBC.

420
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,050
I'll think about it.

421
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,360
I can make it.

422
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,290
Alright then.

423
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,300
(First People's Hospital)

424
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,180
Since the top is

425
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,550
promoting Tang Yang

426
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,350
as a top candidate for HQ,

427
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,280
I want to see what kind

428
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,590
of person she really is.

429
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,700
She's not as easygoing as me.

430
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,690
The Qinglai case

431
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,500
is being supervised
by Vice President Gao.

432
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,280
But Qinglai

433
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,170
was rejected by other banks last year

434
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,550
before they came to us.

435
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,980
I can already picture it.

436
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,700
If Tang Yang rejects Qinglai,

437
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,660
the faces of those guys upstairs

438
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,550
will be priceless.

439
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,420
What if she approves it?

440
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,590
That's good too.

441
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,870
At least it'll show she's just the same,

442
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,450
still playing

443
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,350
by the same unspoken rules.

444
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,390
I'd love to see that happen.

445
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,950
(CBBC: Know Credit Cards)

446
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,280
I thought we'd head straight home

447
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,350
after visiting Gan Yiming
at the hospital,

448
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,070
but we got called into a meeting.

449
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,550
How about a bite before going home?

450
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,760
Earlier this afternoon,

451
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,450
I was on a call with Jiang Shiyan,

452
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,790
but it got cut off.

453
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,210
Do you think I should

454
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,590
call him back now?

455
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:35,840
Would it be unnatural?

456
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,350
Maybe I should just send him a message?

457
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,450
Just call him back.

458
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,700
Why overthink it?

459
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,360
But calling him

460
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,760
would feel unnatural.

461
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,600
- I mean...
- Yang.

462
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,960
What a coincidence.

463
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,880
Hello.

464
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,390
What are you doing here?

465
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,030
My team

466
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,830
was having dinner,

467
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,410
but I stepped out halfway through.

468
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,250
Otherwise, they would

469
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,740
have felt unnatural.

470
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,290
I didn't expect

471
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,880
to bump into you

472
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,720
so easily.

473
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,680
What a coincidence.

474
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,660
It really is.

475
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,400
How natural.

476
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,660
Feels natural now, huh?

477
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,600
Bye.

478
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,590
What is she saying?

479
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,680
Nothing.

480
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,220
It's pretty natural.

481
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,770
Did you drive?

482
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,330
No.

483
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,700
I drove here. Want to ride with me?

484
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,700
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

485
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,010
Let's go.

486
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,450
So, it's just

487
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,730
perfect timing to ride with you.

488
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,570
Yeah, perfect timing.

489
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,530
You...

490
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,360
Why didn't you tell me

491
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,110
that you were coming today?

492
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,220
What if I had left straight after work?

493
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,260
I just happened

494
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,460
to walk by

495
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,900
and see you.

496
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,350
By the way, earlier today,

497
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,830
the call was cut off.

498
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,980
What were you saying?

499
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,490
It's nothing.

500
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,400
Alright.

501
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,740
Recently, Yixiu has been

502
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,450
organizing

503
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,070
valuable online food brands.

504
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,310
We can often go out for goodies later.

505
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,350
We're going to share the blessings.

506
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,630
Good food is a blessing too, right?

507
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,070
Absolutely.

508
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,850
Let me help.

509
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,640
So,

510
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,030
are you planning to launch

511
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,050
your own brand on top

512
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,700
of the existing online brands?

513
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,400
Not just that.

514
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,590
We're going to create a series

515
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,980
of Yixiu's food brands.

516
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,360
The first step is basically

517
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,150
sharing the offline dining experience

518
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,350
online.

519
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,350
The second step is

520
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,660
integrating those food brands online

521
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,220
and expanding them back to offline.

522
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,170
So, our food internet ecosystem

523
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,010
will form

524
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,180
a complete cycle.

525
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,360
You tell me everything.

526
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,320
What if I'll leak

527
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,550
your business secrets?

528
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,590
You should be asking me
if I have any secrets.

529
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,790
Do you have any secrets?

530
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,660
Didn't you say to let things happen?

531
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,050
Well.

532
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,830
What if we don't?

533
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,260
Seems like we don't have any secrets.

534
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,700
(Xinguang Tiandi)

535
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,050
Well.

536
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,660
Thanks for driving me home.

537
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,590
No need to thank me.

538
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,050
The least I can do.

539
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,730
I'm off then.

540
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Go back now.

541
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,400
I'll head up now.

542
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,390
No rush, I'll wait till you're inside.

543
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,110
Then you rest early.

544
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,600
You too.

545
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,160
Alright.

546
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,330
Good night.

547
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,640
Good night.

548
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,250
I'm heading off now.

549
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,330
Go on.

550
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:51,810
I'm really leaving.

551
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,050
Tang Yang.

552
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,120
Well.

553
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,980
Miss Tang, Miss Tang.

554
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,180
Just got off work?

555
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,560
I just bought some plums outside.

556
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,460
Really delicious.

557
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,410
Try some, try some.

558
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,760
Oh, sure, thanks.

559
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,890
You can't just take one.

560
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,840
- Enough.
- Take more.

561
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,930
No need to be so polite.

562
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,770
This is plenty.

563
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,280
Last time, you helped me a lot

564
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,360
with my kid.

565
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,210
Not at all, Aunt.

566
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,840
Here, handsome, try one.

567
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,700
- Me too?
- More.

568
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,680
You take some too.

569
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,600
Thank you, thank you.

570
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,760
Have more, have more.

571
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,800
It's too much, Aunt.

572
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,690
It's nothing.

573
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,900
You guys go on now.

574
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,070
Don't stay too late.

575
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,360
I'll get going now.

576
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,630
- Goodbye.
- Thanks, Aunt.

Let me tell you.

The noodles you made are amazing.

618
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,070
You know this house.

619
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,460
She's lived here for so long.

620
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,630
But she hasn't moved.

621
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,280
Didn't you say last time

622
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,260
you wanted to get her

a bigger place with an elevator?

624
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,420
- Yes.
- She refused.

625
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,280
Good thing the neighbor next door

626
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,460
is selling their house,

627
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,700
so you could buy it.

628
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,040
Otherwise, what if the investors

629
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,930
decide to investigate

630
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,500
how many properties Mr. Jiang owns?

631
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,010
They'll find out

632
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,690
you and your mom live

633
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,280
in a 66-square-meter old place.

634
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,660
People would think
our company is a scam.

635
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,110
As for this house,

636
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,420
I persuaded him for 6 months.

637
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,290
His daughter-in-law

638
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,130
got pregnant later,

639
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,760
so I told him to sell

640
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,690
both his and his son's

641
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,590
wedding house

642
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,150
to buy a bigger one.

643
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,200
That would be great.

644
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,090
And it's all because

645
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,790
of his grandson that he sold it to me.

646
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,110
I paid an extra 200,000.

647
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,700
You spent an extra 200,000?

648
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,980
Are you crazy?

649
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,250
This house is old.

650
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,150
Won't hold its value.

651
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,550
There's no room for appreciation.

652
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,630
If Aunt really likes this area,

653
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
you can just find her

654
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,170
a nicer place nearby,

655
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,420
and she can move over, right?

656
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,900
She said it was left by my dad.

657
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,810
If she moves,

658
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,150
she'll sell it.

659
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,600
She can't do that.

660
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,830
So what should you do?

661
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,940
You're still single.

662
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,630
You don't have the qualifications.

663
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,940
The house I have

664
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,500
is under my mom's name,

665
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,110
so I have a quota.

666
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,150
What are you waiting for?
You should buy one.

667
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,180
Why should I buy a house now?

668
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,980
Are you nuts, Jiang Shiyan?

669
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,930
New houses are quite cheap right now.

670
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,770
What a good deal.

671
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,660
I'm even planning to sell our old place

672
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,630
in Rongcheng Duhui

673
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,790
and buy a new one.

674
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,800
These years, you didn't even take

675
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,660
your dividends.

676
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,840
Now, cash flow

677
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,170
and profits are good.

678
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,660
The Series C funding is coming.

679
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,870
You can buy a pretty decent house.

680
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,640
I'm planning

681
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,870
to keep this quota for my

682
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,440
future wedding house.

683
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,360
Wedding house?

684
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,330
Who's it for?

685
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,250
Where is this person?

686
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,030
You're not even at that stage.

687
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,840
Your main goal right now

688
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,010
should be to increase

689
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:52,940
your fixed assets.

690
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,090
No way.

691
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,220
What if she has a house she likes

692
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,290
but I can't buy it?

693
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,180
But what if she has a quota?

694
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,820
What if she's capable

695
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,900
and she's bought a house?

696
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,090
Well...

697
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,660
You can always sell it.

698
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,170
Enough, you're so annoying.

699
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,010
Seriously.

700
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,900
I'll just keep this quota

701
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,310
and pick a house for her.

702
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,940
It's that simple.

703
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,250
It sounds like

704
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,160
there's actually

705
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,460
someone in your mind.

706
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,790
Jiang Shiyan.

707
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,490
We're back. Come help out.

708
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,420
Tang is here too.

709
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:28,730
Aunt.

710
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,600
Aunt Yi, should I put this inside?

711
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,320
Put it here, put it here.

712
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,250
Let me help you.

713
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,660
- No need.
- Lots of things to dry.

714
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,940
What brings you here, Yang?

715
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,010
I just happened to...

716
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,320
- Feng is here too.
- Aunt.

717
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,250
I came to find Jiang about something,

718
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,210
and he mentioned someone

719
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,790
was coming to fix the washing machine.

720
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,050
I thought I'd hold a meeting

721
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,070
at home with him.

722
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,730
What brings you here?

723
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,200
I...

724
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,650
Her dad's friend,

725
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,360
who used to do engineering,
visited them,

726
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,590
with a lot of gifts.

727
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,350
Ms. Zhou insisted I take some.

728
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,460
How can I carry that all?

729
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,760
Tang helped me.

730
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,790
Just a little favor.

731
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,960
Thank you.

732
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,290
Thank you, Yang.

733
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,110
Tang, are you hungry?

734
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,630
Anything to eat at home?

735
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,350
Jiang Shiyan just made some noodles
with savory sauce.

736
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,660
Do you want it tossed or in soup?

737
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,680
Mom, how about you?

738
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,680
I'm not eating.

739
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,730
I've been cutting back on

740
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,660
my carb intake lately.

741
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,110
I'll...

742
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,980
Got it. I'll make one each,

743
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,800
but use less noodles in each serving.

744
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,690
If you can't finish,

745
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,790
you can eat half each.

746
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,200
Alright.

747
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,530
Give me ten minutes.

748
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,360
Okay, okay, let's go.

749
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,450
Come on in, hurry.

750
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,320
- Go inside.
- Aunt.

751
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,490
- I'll carry your bag.
- OK.

752
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,530
No need. Just go in.

753
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,550
Let's go, let's go.

754
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,400
Hurry up.

755
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,200
Drink some water.

756
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,700
Have you finished your meeting?

757
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,550
We wrapped it up ages ago.

758
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,960
Let me tell you.

759
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,550
You know who's back?

760
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,570
Who?

761
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,200
Guess.

762
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,790
I can't guess. Who?

763
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,460
Chang Xinyi.

764
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,400
She said

765
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,080
she wants to gather with classmates

766
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,970
next week.

767
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,550
See if you're free
next Friday evening.

768
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,760
Not many people will come.

769
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,360
Maybe around ten.

770
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,900
Anyway, whoever can will come.

771
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,660
Chang Xinyi?

772
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,920
Yeah.

773
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,430
Jiang Shiyan's dream girl.

774
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,070
His first love, you know.

775
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,160
Even though they broke up,

776
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,860
and I don't know why,

777
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,910
but let me tell you.

778
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,520
All these years,

779
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,010
Jiang Shiyan hasn't dated anyone.

780
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,240
It's definitely because

781
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,470
he can't forget Chang Xinyi.

782
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,680
Or, to put it another way,

783
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,290
he hasn't found

784
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,770
someone who can

785
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,610
replace her.

786
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,030
Isn't that a bit exaggerated?

787
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,150
Am I exaggerating?

788
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,380
Weren't you also...

789
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,040
Weren't you also with Song Jing?

790
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,880
You two.

791
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,180
You don't even know.

792
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
After you broke up

793
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,630
with Song Jing,

794
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,640
Jiang Shiyan told us not to mention him

795
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,910
in front of you,

796
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,030
lest it upset you.

797
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,080
No.

798
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,120
Song Jing and I...

799
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,680
A first love. I get that.

800
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,990
The meaning is different.

801
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,930
- No.
- Just like

802
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:13,910
Yanan and I.

803
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,230
We're also first love.

804
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,970
Thank goodness we ended up together.

805
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,370
I can't even imagine

806
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,660
how my life would be

807
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,550
if I weren't with her.

808
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,700
- He...
- Feng, why did you close the door?

809
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,660
Why's the door closed?

810
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,470
What are you hiding from me?

811
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,510
You closed the door.

812
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,590
What could I possibly be hiding?

813
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,070
Have the soup first.

814
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,680
I'll make you the tossed one later.

815
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,740
- OK.
- Or it'll be mushy.

816
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,820
Buddy,

817
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,160
the toppings

818
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,370
are more than mine.

819
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,300
Give me another serving.

820
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,740
Time to pick up your son, right?

821
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,040
Oh, man.

822
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,220
The noodles confused me.

823
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,680
Well, I'm heading out now.

824
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,780
Enjoy your meal.

825
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,880
Aunt.

826
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,080
I'm leaving

827
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,030
to pick up my son.

828
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,250
Okay.

829
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,360
Is it hot?

830
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:02,690
No.

831
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,950
By the way, Feng Weiran just told me

832
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,590
there's a class reunion next Friday.

833
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,680
Not too many are going.

834
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,380
Maybe about ten people.

835
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,220
Are you going?

836
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,650
Are you going?

837
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,210
Well.

838
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,860
It depends on if you're going.

839
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,720
Doesn't this feel a bit

840
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,660
childish?

841
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,110
Also, I went to the last gathering.

842
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,030
- So...
- I'll go then.

843
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,430
I didn't go last time.

844
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,430
So, are you going?

845
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:35,930
I'll think about it.

846
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,260
I might have to work overtime.

847
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,470
Is the noodle not good?

848
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,290
It's good.

849
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,130
It's quite delicious.

850
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,680
You don't look to be

851
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,520
enjoying it to me.

852
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
You used to slurp down

853
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,430
a serving in no time.

854
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,110
Now, you're eating so slowly.

855
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,920
Don't burn yourself.

856
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,720
I think I might have

857
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,380
eaten something at my mom's place,

858
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,470
so I'm not hungry now.

859
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,520
I'll head back first.

860
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,700
What about tossed noodles?

861
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,340
No need. I'm full.

862
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,220
Aunt Yi, I'm leaving.

863
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,470
Tang, drive safely.

864
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,520
Don't worry.

865
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,180
See you. Bye-bye.

866
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,480
Okay.

867
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,300
I just checked.
There are about 15 items.

868
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,010
Some of them are pretty good.

869
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:36,850
Be careful.

870
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,990
Take it slow.

871
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,260
What is this?

872
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,910
A telescope.

873
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,380
Last time, Mr. Cheng got me interested.

874
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,770
He took me to try it,

875
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,860
and it was impressive,

876
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,380
so I bought one for myself.

877
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,080
Is this Mr. Cheng Hui's choice?

878
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,200
No, his choice was too expensive.

879
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,290
I couldn't afford it.

880
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,930
I found it online.

881
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,260
It's cheaper.

882
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,680
I see this is

883
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,070
an 80 mm, right?

884
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,560
- Yeah.
- This brand

885
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,950
just released a 90 mm.

886
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,340
It's not much more pricey than this one.

887
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,990
It has smart star-finding features.

888
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,820
You can spend
a little more for that one.

889
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,330
Then I'll return it to buy that.

890
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,330
You wouldn't believe it.

891
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,410
Cheng Hui saw me with this.

892
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,330
I told him I bought it.

893
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,720
He looked at my order page

894
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
and just said, "Garbage."

895
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,590
Then he ignored me.

896
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,430
That's totally his style.

897
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,970
This model is quite suitable

898
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,560
for beginners,

899
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,890
but it has an equatorial mount

900
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,950
that needs calibration,

901
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,490
or you won't observe anything.

902
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,490
No worries.
Customer service said they'd help me.

903
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,640
If it doesn't work out,

904
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,770
I can always ask Mr. Cheng for help.

905
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,680
I'll just buy him

906
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,520
a few meals.

907
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,070
Ms. Sheng, you seem pretty professional.

908
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,360
Just playing around.

909
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,510
Our Nina likes this too.

910
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,560
She has a Newtonian

911
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,630
telescope at home.

912
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,620
Right.

913
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Sounds amazing.

914
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,820
I haven't used mine in ages.

915
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,450
I'm missing a part

916
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,410
and can't find it,

917
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,180
so it's been sitting in the dry box.

918
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,210
Got it.

919
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,070
What do you like to observe?

920
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,730
The moon

921
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,610
or nebulae?

922
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,430
I love watching Saturn's rings.

923
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,170
What's going on?

924
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,410
Why did he come over?

925
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,680
Did he hear us talking

926
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,550
about him?

927
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,490
Don't worry. He probably heard

928
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,490
you mention treating him

929
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,330
so he came.

930
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,030
Alright, Ms. Sheng, let's go.

931
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,430
Bye-bye, Ms. Sheng.

932
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,630
Hello, Feng Weiran.

933
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,250
Hello, Yang.

934
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,640
The class reunion is tomorrow.

935
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,220
Are you coming or not?

936
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,890
Those who can join

937
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,990
will come early
to Leisure House for tea.

938
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,200
If the weather's nice,

939
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,120
we can have a BBQ
in the courtyard at night.

940
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,200
If not,

941
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,300
we can eat hotpot indoors.

942
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,180
If the weather's good,
we can also do hotpot.

943
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,470
Audience member, you're right.

944
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,640
Why so much nonsense?

945
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,180
Just confirm if you're coming.

946
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,160
Jiang Shiyan said

947
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,950
you didn't reply to his text.

948
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,470
I was tending to the flowers.

949
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,560
By the way,

950
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,150
ask Jiang Shiyan

951
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,680
about my porkbush

952
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,930
on the balcony.

953
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,300
It looks a bit wilted.

954
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,820
Did you overwater it?

955
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,780
Should I come to help you later?

956
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,780
No. I haven't watered it in days.

957
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,720
But I've been

958
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,680
keeping it outside.

959
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,640
Is it because

960
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,780
of the heavy rain days ago?

961
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,850
How about tomorrow?

962
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,380
After the reunion, I'll come.

963
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,440
Sounds good.

964
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,080
Can you two stop

965
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,520
changing the topic?

966
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,450
Hurry up and confirm

967
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,470
if you can make it.

968
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,150
I'll come.

969
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,770
But I can't guarantee what time.

970
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,660
I have a meeting.

971
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,640
If it's short, I'll finish

972
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,430
by four or five
and can go straight there.

973
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,010
If someone's giving a long report,

974
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,510
then it might take

975
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,260
until seven or eight. Who knows?

976
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,260
Once I'm done, I'll head over.

977
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
Don't worry about that.

978
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,550
It's easy.

979
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,820
Have Jiang Shiyan cast a spell on them.

980
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,430
Something

981
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,480
to silence them.

982
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,550
I guarantee the meeting will
wrap up in under 10 minutes.

983
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,160
Stop with the nonsense.

984
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm hanging up.

985
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,300
So it's settled then?

986
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,660
You'll come however late.

987
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,470
Got it.

988
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,180
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

989
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,590
I must get my dark circles

990
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,260
from working overtime lately.

991
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,550
Dear, I'm back.

992
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,530
Where's our son?

993
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,510
He's asleep.

994
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,330
Oh, my.

995
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,820
What are you doing here?

996
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,150
Meditating.

997
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,030
Meditating?

998
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,740
I recently enrolled

999
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,070
in a meditation therapy class.

1000
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,550
I find that this state

1001
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,150
of mind

1002
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,560
is really great.

1003
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,290
What are you doing,

1004
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,920
wearing a face mask at this hour?

1005
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,880
What's wrong with it?

1006
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,860
You still look as cute as ever.

1007
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,590
You should go get cute too.

1008
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,120
This thing?

1009
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,110
I don't really need it.

1010
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,640
Aren't you having a class reunion?

1011
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,180
What does it have to do with face masks?

1012
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,590
All the classmates

1013
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,850
attending tomorrow

1014
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,690
will definitely

1015
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,740
have a face mask on.

1016
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,120
No one wants to show up with a face

1017
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,630
that looks worn out from life.

1018
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,470
Let me tell you.

1019
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,770
Tang Yang isn't using

1020
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,030
a face mask right now

1021
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,910
because she doesn't care about it.

1022
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,070
That's true.

1023
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:34,060
(Truth or Dare)

1024
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,300
Can't you just sit over here?

1025
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,690
I'll go first.

1026
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,290
Say the name

1027
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,110
of the person you like.

1028
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,470
It has to be a classmate.

1029
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,040
Hurry up.

1030
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,370
So that's how it is.

1031
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,210
Thanks.

1032
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,080
- You go first.
- No, you go first.

1033
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,920
You say it.

1034
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,860
Of course, it's Chang Xinyi.
My dream girl.

1035
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,660
Chang Xinyi.

1036
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,430
Chang Xinyi.

1037
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,180
No one doesn't love Chang Xinyi.

1038
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,250
What about you?

1039
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:06,910
Chang Xinyi.

1040
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:10,730
What about you?

1041
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,910
I don't have anyone I like.

1042
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,380
See? I knew it.

1043
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,220
- How boring.
- Hurry up and say it.

1044
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,430
Come on, say it already.
