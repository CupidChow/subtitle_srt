=Episode 7=
=Our Friendship Ends Here=

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,050
I've been restricted a lot,

28
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,760
but in the little freedom

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
I have,

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,530
you are my best friend.

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,730
You are my reason.

32
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,890
If we got caught,

33
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,080
would we have to write

34
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,760
a self-reflection?

35
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,920
Then, the next day,

36
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,920
we'll have to read it
in the assembly.

37
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,680
Isn't that what you're best at?

38
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,050
You'd handle it with ease.

39
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,050
You'd deal with it calmly.

40
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,520
I'm worried about you.

41
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,920
The perfect student

42
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
in teacher's eyes.

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,480
If they knew you'd

44
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,760
climb the wall with me,

45
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,520
would their jaws drop in shock?

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,330
I remember once,

47
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,760
you read your self-reflection

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,680
on that platform.

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,570
I actually thought,

50
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,200
as your good buddy,

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,850
I should stand there with you.

52
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm so moved.

53
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,050
I never would've thought

54
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,360
your biggest regret from back then

55
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,010
was not reading a self-reflection

56
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,760
with me.

57
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,080
Security.

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,290
Has the security guard left?

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Let me check.

60
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,570
It seems he hasn't.

61
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,800
Then let's wait a little longer.

62
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,190

74
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,080
Why does your hair

75
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,050
smell like Chinese medicine?

76
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,170
Do you use anti-hair-loss

77
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,010
shampoo?

78
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,530
No, I don't.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,320
That's too harsh.

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,050
I was wrong.

81
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,000
Sorry, just kidding.

82
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,090
Besides, baldness is

83
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,530
a common worry for many ladies.

84
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,440
I'm just being proactive.

85
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,050
No, Jiang Shiyan, I'm not going bald.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Alright.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,210
But actually,

88
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,920
every night,

89
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,970
I use a hair growth oil.

90
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,850
It works pretty well.

91
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,050
What brand?

92
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,920
Are you going bald too?

93
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,730
Just in case.

94
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,080
Right.

95
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,970
Good to be prepared.

96
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,720
I commend that.

97
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,560
I'll go check.

98
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,480
He should be gone, right?

99
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,610
Probably.

100
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
But I just thought

101
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,440
of something.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,240
If we play at the court,

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,050
won't we need to turn on the lights?

104
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,290
If we do, the security guard
will see us, right?

105
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,170
We can't play in the dark, can we?

106
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,730
Maybe we should

107
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,810
just skip it.

108
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,880
Owe me for next time.

109
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
No way.

110
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't want to owe you.

111
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,480
I just thought of a place,

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,050
where we can play freely.

113
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,930
Where?

114
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,050
Don't you think I'm always

115
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,610
true to my word?

116
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,170
I promised to play with you.

117
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,640
Too slippery.

118
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,170
I'd play with you.

119
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,290
No obstacle will stop me.

120
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
I'm still good

121
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
at everything.

122
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,120
I can argue against Shiyan

123
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,610
and climb walls like a champ.

124
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,530
My unbeatable spike

125
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,650
is as invincible as ever.

126
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,560
If you say so,

127
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,120
I won't hold back.

128
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,650
Don't cry and say I bullied you.

129
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,290
You? Bullying me?

130
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,680
That's hilarious.

131
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,880
Over a decade ago,

132
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,800
in your prime,

133
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,170
you couldn't beat me.

134
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,650
Now with your old bones,

135
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,090
you think you can defeat me?

136
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,920
Impressive you remember here.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,050
It's been a long time.

138
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,440
It's funny

139
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,240
that we can talk about something

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,240
from a decade ago.

141
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,620
(Seafood: Freshly Caught)

142
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,930
Yeah.

143
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,730
It's been over a decade.

144
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,800
You're back.

145
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,240
Are you hungry? Want some noodles?

146
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,810
No.

147
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
Jiang Shiyan.

148
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,320
Don't you feel lucky

149
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,650
to have a good buddy

150
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,650
like me,

151
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
who is reasonable,

152
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,440
always ready to apologize,

153
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
and can even ease

154
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,560
your anxiety?

155
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,770
You should cherish me.

156
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,560
I do cherish you.

157
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,460
(Good Buddy)

158
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,530
(Good Buddy)
How long to ship?

159
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,560
It's paid.

160
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,130
I heard that each one is numbered.

161
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,370
Can I choose the number?

162
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,270
(Bei: It'll arrive tomorrow.)

163
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,540
(You can pick one from the two.)

164
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,400
Thank you so much.

165
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,920
This is a due diligence report

166
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,680
of Zhang Zhilan's case.

167
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,010
Do you have any questions?

168
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
Thank you.

169
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,370
Zhang's husband is a martyr.

170
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,050
Her daily behavior data

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,490
can mitigate the risk of fraud.

172
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,080
How can we avoid the risk

173
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,960
of misappropriation?

174
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,890
Phase receipt and narrowing the loan.

175
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,010
Early recall agreement.

176
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,410
She's the sole and independent

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,680
loan payer.

178
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,560
How do we ensure her ability

179
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,410
to handle major family changes?

180
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,320
This is a joint liability guarantee

181
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,720
from the vice manager of the hotel

182
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,200
where Zhang Zhilan used to work.

183
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,770
It includes restaurant equipment

184
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,080
that can be forcibly executed

185
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,130
as collateral.

186
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,530
The total value exceeds 1.5 times

187
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,490
the loan amount.

188
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,370
I still don't think personal factors

189
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,410
should dominate risk control
and approval.

190
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,650
There are many unknown risks

191
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,560
at the operational level
in Zhang's case,

192
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,130
such as income-to-expense ratios,

193
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,560
customer sources, renovation,

194
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,560
and other...

195
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,050
The purpose of microloans

196
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,010
is to benefit the people.

197
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,130
Ms. Tang's effort in due diligence
and regulation

198
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,370
is something we can learn.

199
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,840
In terms of both content and form,

200
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
Zhang Zhilan's case

201
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,250
is pioneering.

202
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,390
I hope everyone

203
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,840
can follow Ms. Tang's example.

204
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,890
Thank you, Director Gan.

205
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,380
(Conference Room, CBBC)

206
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,440
Mr. Gan,

207
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,440
Ms. Qin's concerns are reasonable.

208
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,080
From an operational perspective,

209
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,290
Zhang's case does present

210
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,440
significant potential risks.

211
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,130
Tang Yang

212
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,320
is young and impulsive.

213
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,680
We might as well let her stumble a bit.

214
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,610
Once she's hurt,

215
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,050
she'll know how to walk properly.

216
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,740
(Storefront for sublease)

217
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,920
Zhang Zhilan.

218
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,250
Zhang Zhilan.

219
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,840
(Jiang Noodles)
Mr. Xu.

220
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,530
Your loan was approved.

221
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,130
Check your account later.

222
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,520
Really?

223
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,970
That's great.

224
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,720
I didn't expect to get it this time.

225
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,960
Ms. Tang fought very hard for you.

226
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,420
(Fragile)

227
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Cosmos Bear?

228
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,080
But Shiyan wouldn't have

229
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,960
listed the recipient as Tang Yang.

230
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,290
Who sent it?

231
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,170
I used to think these

232
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,050
trendy collectibles

233
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,290
were like blind boxes.

234
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,720
Thought they were small things.

235
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,250
Now I see there's a lot more to it.

236
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,410
So many details.

237
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,720
Those co-branding series

238
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,250
should have collectible value, right?

239
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,320
Yeah, yeah.

240
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,170
Since you're into these things,

241
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,840
do you have a particular favorite?

242
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,890
Mo, do you have time tomorrow?

243
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,680
I'd like to invite you for a coffee.

244
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,500
(SYKO)

245
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,320
- Sorry.
- Mo.

246
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,680
I had a meeting, so I'm late.

247
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,680
No worries.

248
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,560
Waiter, over here.

249
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,520
What would you like?

250
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,800
An iced Americano. Thanks.

251
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,680
Alright.

252
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,320
You were in a hurry. What's wrong?

253
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,080
You're not an outsider,

254
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,600
so I'll get straight to the point.

255
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,080
Actually, we've had

256
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,320
quite a connection.

257
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,840
You joined CBBC first,

258
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,410
and then I came.

259
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,250
Though you're now in Jiujiang,

260
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,650
you've always been a senior

261
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,320
that I really admire.

262
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,650
We're also like-minded

263
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,960
friends, right?

264
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,010
You're flattering me.

265
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,560
What's going on?

266
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,090
I'll just say it.

267
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,130
The gift you gave me

268
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,840
is beyond what I can accept.

269
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,050
If possible,

270
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,290
could you return it?

271
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,600
What gift?

272
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,680
Thank you.

273
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,610
You're welcome.

274
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,170
You mean the little bear figure

275
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,290
I gave you?

276
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,250
Yes.

277
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,680
It's a limited-edition
camouflage version.

278
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,840
It's very hard to get.

279
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,650
I asked you for advice

280
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,920
the other day, right?

281
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,840
I saw everyone talking about this.

282
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,370
The cosmos camouflage series.

283
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,490
It's pretty popular.

284
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,920
I thought you'd like it,

285
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,130
so I just grabbed one for you.

286
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,960
It's not an expensive gift.

287
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,320
Plus, I've bought it.

288
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,250
It's non-refundable.

289
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,610
Non-refundable?

290
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,290
In that case,

291
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,130
tell me the price.

292
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,250
I'll pay you for that.

293
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,770
You want to pay me

294
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,960
for a gift I gave you?

295
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,370
Yes.

296
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,200
We're old friends.

297
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,770
It's normal for me to give you a gift.

298
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,050
That's exactly why

299
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,920
I really

300
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,010
value our friendship.

301
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,680
Plus, Jiujiang and CBBC

302
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,170
are collaborating, right?

303
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,440
So, please tell me the price.

304
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,010
Do I have to?

305
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,090
Yes.

306
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,010
Alright, let me check.

307
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:03,970
Sure.

308
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,560
8,722 yuan.

309
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,250
8,722?

310
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,170
Okay, I'll transfer it now.

311
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,370
Done.

312
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,100
(Description: For limited-edition
Cosmos Bear. Thanks, Mo.)

313
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,770
Can I at least

314
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,770
pay for this coffee?

315
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,650
The coffee's on me too.

316
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,920
I invited you out, after all.

317
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,920
Last time, your friend paid
for the meal,

318
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,410
so let me cover the coffee, alright?

319
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,440
Alright, no problem.

320
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,050
I'll accept your kind offer.

321
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,410
But next time, you have
to let me treat you.

322
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,650
As long as there's a next time.

323
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,560
Of course.

324
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,200
I got the bear because I was buying one

325
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,410
for my business partner,

326
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,290
and I figured

327
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,200
I'd get you one too.

328
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,250
But somehow it got

329
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
complicated.

330
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,410
Don't be upset over this, okay?

331
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,440
No, not at all.

332
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,290
I was planning to buy the bear anyway.

333
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,050
Consider it a purchase from you.

334
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,490
This money...

335
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I have one more question.

336
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,810
Go ahead.

337
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,400
If this gift

338
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,160
wasn't from me

339
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,640
but from one

340
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,480
of your friends,

341
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
like Mr. Jiang we met

342
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,330
last time,

343
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,930
would you still insist on paying him?

344
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,880
You don't think I would?

345
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,360
Please accept it.

346
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,000
Sure.

347
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,930
Alright, the transaction is complete.

348
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,440
Director Tang.

349
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,640
Zhilan, what brings you here?

350
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,450
My new store just opened.

351
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,600
You might be too busy to come,

352
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,880
so I brought you
some spicy snacks from my shop.

353
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,000
Thank you.

354
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,490
Congratulations on your new opening.

355
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,600
But your loan

356
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,880
is just part of my job.

357
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,930
No need for gifts.

358
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,880
Please take it back.

359
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,690
This isn't valuable.

360
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,050
No, no, no, Zhilan.

361
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,880
Regardless of its value,
I can't accept it.

362
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,010
I had a colleague

363
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,530
who accepted a bag of apples,

364
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,050
and someone reported him.

365
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,450
I can smell your spicy snacks.

366
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,450
It smells amazing.

367
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,160
Consider your kind gesture received.

368
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,600
When I get some time off,

369
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,120
I'll come to support your business.

370
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,290
You must come by.

371
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,730
- I will.
- I'll leave you to it.

372
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,730
I'll head off now.

373
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,050
Director Qin.

374
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,000
You're off work?

375
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,120
Was that your friend?

376
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,800
No, that was Zhang Zhilan.

377
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,840
My lender.

378
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,250
She brought me some spicy snacks.

379
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,450
I sent her back with them.

380
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,050
Zhang's case isn't

381
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,770
as simple as you might think.

382
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,560
Gan wants you to fall for it,

383
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,010
so he approved it so quickly.

384
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,600
The business is highly volatile,

385
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,840
and future repayments may not be stable.

386
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,210
You should pay attention to that.

387
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,490
(Tasting)
The Michelin restaurant

388
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,640
is amazing.

389
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,730
A tasting event

390
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,600
featuring Le Cordon Bleu chefs.

391
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,690
Even the invitations
are embossed with gold.

392
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,450
Don't think about it.

393
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,250
The invitation says "plus one".

394
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,240
Plus one.

395
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,010
You're the head of Yi Xiu.

396
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,120
How can you

397
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,800
go alone?

398
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,400
If nothing else,

399
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,880
I definitely can't take you.

400
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,250
The place

401
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,600
doesn't allow pets inside.

402
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,160
I'll kick you straight

403
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,600
to Michelin.

404
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,240
Hello, Jiang Shiyan?

405
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,320
I'll drive over to pick you up.

406
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,330
What's going on?

407
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,010
Did you forget?

408
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,640
I...

409
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,840
Oh, my god.

410
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,450
I really did forget.

411
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,490
I have a conference call

412
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,640
at 8:30 tonight.

413
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,120
Can we finish dinner before 8?

414
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,970
Finish by 8?

415
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,160
It isn't rice bowl dish.

416
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,400
Even appetizers take time.

417
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,320
Come on, it's Michelin.

418
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,320
Oh, my god.

419
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
I seriously forgot.

420
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,560
How could I forget

421
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,490
about Michelin?

422
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,880
Feng Weiran pestered me,
and I didn't agree.

423
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,840
How can you forget?

424
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
No. Next time,

425
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
you still have to take me first,
understand?

426
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,970
You have to take me next time.

427
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,200
Alright, alright.

428
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,400
I'll take you first.

429
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,930
What are you having?

430
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,560
Since I have a meeting tonight,

431
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,730
I prepared myself

432
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,840
a grand feast.

433
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,960
Seriously?

434
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,130
Of course.

435
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,730
Then enjoy your grand feast.

436
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,250
I'll head to the banquet.

437
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,770
Bye-bye.

438
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Okay, I'll go have my meal.

439
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,090
Bye-bye.

440
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,900
(Michelin Tasting Event)

441
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,290
Yours now.

442
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,640
We'll go together?

443
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,210
You should go with Yanan.

444
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,490
Suddenly, I feel like

445
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,050
having some rice bowl dish.

446
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,490
I love you.

447
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,440
Babe.

448
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,370
I'm going.

449
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,640
You're everywhere.

450
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,930
Why are you here?

451
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,450
I knew your grand feast couldn't

452
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,450
be anything else.

453
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,160
The classics never die.

454
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,090
You know?

455
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,120
What's that in your bag?

456
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,050
I brought something for your

457
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,090
grand feast.

458
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,640
For a once-in-a-lifetime

459

Michelin tasting event,

460
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,600
why am I here with you

461
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,160
and not my wife?

462
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,450
Because when Jiang

463
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,640
gave you the invitation,

464
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,970
I was by your side.

465
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Your wife wasn't.

466
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,320
Haven't you noticed

467
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,690
that you spend more time with me

468
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,930
than with her?

469
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,000
Not really.

470
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,010
Go on, play your game.

471
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,530
Come on.

472
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,530
Cheers.

473
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,080
To a happy time.

474
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,450

476
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,290
Oh, my.

477
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,120
It smells amazing.

478
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,610
Wait a minute.

479
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

480
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,840
Please come in.

481
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,920
Thank you.

485
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,920
- Yes.
- Great.

486
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,160
Sorry.

487
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,120
Minors are not allowed at the event.

488
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,250
Alcohol will be served.

489
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,600
See? This always happens.

490
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,120
I told you I didn't want you here.

491
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,810
Sorry about that.

Please come in.

493
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,930
It's fine.

494
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,730
This butter is already three years

495
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,000
past its expiration.

496
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,080
The chili sauce was from last year, too.

497
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,480
As expected.

498
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,450
And this wrapper.

499
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,800
You were going to use it

500
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,120
for spring rolls in Feb.

501
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,120
You cut this fruit so well.

502
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,320
You could set up a fruit stall.

503
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,290
Go and sell fruit.

504
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,530
All the tools I'm using

505
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,370
were bought

506
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,730
from your Yi Xiu Mall.

507

508
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,400
has a unique purpose,

00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,840
perfect for all kinds of fruit.

- How's that?
- Wow, impressive!

513
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,360
Okay, stop bothering me now.

514
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,730
Go grab a drink

515
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,770
and sit there.

516
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,010
A proper host looks after their guests.

517
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,490
You're bossing your guest around.

518
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,450
Most guests,

519
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,730
when visiting someone's home,

520
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,640
compliment the hosts,

521
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,690
like "You're so capable"

522
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,400
or "Your house is so clean."

523
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,050
But you? You say

524
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,530
I'm suited for running a fruit stall.

525
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,730
It's still a compliment.

526
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,000
Enough.

527
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,240
It got into my eyes.

528
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,160
It got into my eyes.

529
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,290
Let me see.

530
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,000
Enough already.

531
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,400
Tang Yang.

532
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,840
Isn't it the bear

533
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,080
you've been wanting to buy?

534
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,800
Yeah, Zhou Mo helped me get it.

535
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,640
Who?

536
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,010
Zhou Mo.

537
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,130
What's wrong?

538
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,690
Nothing, nothing.

539
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,770
Why?

540
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,770
My bear hasn't arrived.

541
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,640
Why are you here?

542
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,010
You don't belong here.

543
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,010
How was

544
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,890
the tasting event?

545
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,640
Feng Weiran went with Cheng Hui.

546
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,330
Don't touch my bear.

547
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,330
I'm not touching it.

548
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,000
Tell me.

549
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,050
What's Zhou Mo up to,

550
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,920
sending you here?

551
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,490
He's definitely up to no good.

552
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,290
What a pity.

553
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,730
It's okay. We'll go together next time.

554
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,530
No matter what he's up to,

555
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,290
you definitely can't stay here tonight.

556
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,970
I've never stayed alone here.

557
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,160
Why should you get to stay?

558
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,890
Speak up.

559
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,730
Oh, you can't talk.

560
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,730
But Zhou Mo can,

561
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,050
and he talks a lot.

562
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,480
Right?

563
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,600
Don't touch my bear!

564
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,240
I didn't.

565
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,800
What are you mumbling about? Come here.

566
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,160
I have to say,

567
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,050
when I'm at your place,

568
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
I feel so relaxed.

569
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,490
You said the same thing

570
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,970
when I stayed at my parents' place.

571
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,010
When I moved to Lancheng,

572
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,640
you still said so.

573
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Now that I'm here,

574
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,930
you're still saying it.

575
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,400
So, is it my home

576
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,560
that makes you feel relaxed,

577
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,730
or is it my fatherly presence

578
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,080
that gives you comfort?

579
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,240
Honestly,

580
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,770
that night we welcomed you back,

581
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,930
though I only 5 five hours,

582
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,250
lying right here

583
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,530
on the floor,

584
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,560
I slept so well.

585
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,640
What was that sound?

586
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,570
I don't know.

587
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,480
Something's off.

588
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,010
Oh, my.

589
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,210
Jiang Shiyan!

590
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,450
I told you not to touch my bear!

591
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,800
Why can't you
keep your hands off things?

592
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,560
I told you.

593
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,050
It's expensive and hard to get.

594
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,730
It sells out as soon as it's restocked.

595
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,250
I'm telling you.

596
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,010
You have to fix it for me.

597
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,130
Great.

598
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,440
Great?

599
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,120
Why do you look so happy

600
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,400
about this?

601
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,570
I'm not.

602
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,730
I'm very sad.

603
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,530
Really?

604
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,730
There's a famous psychologist who said

605
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,850
extreme joy... No.

606
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,690
Mixed feelings... No.

607
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,160
Anyway, when people
feel deeply sad inside,

608
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,930
they might show happiness

609
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,050
on the outside.

610
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,840
I'm really heartbroken.

611
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,600
Poor little bear.

612
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,970
Alright, Tang Yang.

613
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,120
You go and work.

614
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,210
I'll take this

615
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,560
poor little bear

616
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,320
for treatment.

617
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,930
Be careful.

618
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:01,970
Don't drop it.

619
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,960
Don't worry.

620
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,560
I promise it'll be as good as new.

621
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,530
Dear Mr. Jiang.

622
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,450
Hope you're having a wonderful weekend.

623
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,450
By the way,

624
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,050
has my bear been fixed?

625
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,770
Dear Ms. Tang.

626
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,850
Happy weekend to you.

627
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,640
And no, your bear is beyond repair.

628
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,250
Our friendship ends here. Goodbye!

629
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,980
(Zhilan Snacks)

630
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,850
Go easy on the chili.

631
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,010
- Got it.
- Less chili.

632
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:44,890
How about cilantro?

633
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,290
Just a little.

634
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,200
What's this?

635
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,920
That's pig ears.

636
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,320
I'll give you some in a bit.

637
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,050
Zhilan,

638
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,770
it seems like business isn't...

639
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,770
Right.

640
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,840
The old place was tiny,

641
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,450
but it was always packed.

642
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,800
Now, the new shop is spacious,

643
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,010
yet it's empty now.

644
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,800
You can't rush it.

645
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,640
Let's wait and see.

646
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,120
You can say that,

647
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,160
but I'm really worried.

648
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,800
What do you think the problem is?

649
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,690
Maybe it's because

650
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,970
you moved locations,

651
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,290
and the old customers

652
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,160
can't find you.

653
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,320
Give it some time.

654
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,690
It might get better.

655
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,050
Let's hope so.

656
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,010
Wait, I didn't order that.

657
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,770
No, that's too much.

658
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,770
I didn't order those.

659
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,770
It's fine.

660
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,050
This shop could open

661
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,050
thanks to Ms. Tang.

662
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,400
Without the loan she approved,

663
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,730
I wouldn't have opened it.

664
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,400
It's nothing, Zhilan.

665
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,160
It's just part of my job.

666
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,930
But don't give us food anymore.

667
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,770
We can't finish it.

668
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,800
It'll all go to waste.

669
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,600
Go find a seat.

670
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,770
I'll bring the food over.

671
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,250
- Sure, thanks.
- Okay, let's go.

672

(Zhilan Snacks)

673
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,770
Here comes the food.

674
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,400
- So much.
- Thanks.

675
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,490
Let me. No need.

676
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,370
It's okay.

677
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,610
Here, gloves.

678
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,530
Sure.

679
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,610
Please enjoy.

680
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,560
- I'll be there.
- OK.

681
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,800
Okay, thanks.

682
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,290
Here, gloves.

683
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,360
You approved a loan,

684
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,730
and now you're her customer.

685
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,250
Just quit being a deputy director

686
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,290
and run a charity.

687
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,600
That's different.

688
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,450
Zhilan was my first assignment

689
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,640
in the division.

690
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,010
Our director is waiting for me

691
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,970
to mess it up

692
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:31,930
and mock me.

693
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,090
Alright, alright.

694
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,250
Keep at it.

695
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,290
Looks good.

696
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,200
Is it delicious?

697
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,770
The pig trotter is incredible.

698
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,970
If you hadn't brought me,

699
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,690
I would've walked right past this place.

700
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,120
It doesn't stand out.
Doesn't look appetizing.

701
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,200
But the pig trotters

702
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,770
are good.

703
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,930
Not appetizing?

704
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,600
You sure seem to have an appetite now.

705
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,930
What I meant was

706
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,210
it didn't look appetizing.

707
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,680
Is that so?

708
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,690
(YI Xiu Gourmet)
It's settled then.

709
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,120
The next few live streams will

710
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,000
follow this schedule.

711
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,880
But since Nina will be

712
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,770
mostly on set,

713
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,160
you'll need to adjust to her needs.

714
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,250
The live stream location is up to her.

715
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,570
No worries.

716
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,010
Mr. Cheng's team

717
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,160
will have technical support

718
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,360
for Ms. Sheng's live streams.

719
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,090
Great.

720
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,330
Ms. Wang.

721
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,920
There's something

722
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,120
I need to tell you.

723
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:45,850
What is it?

724
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,320
Could you tell Ms. Sheng something?

725
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,810
We can eat.

726
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,080
Eat?

727
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Eat what?

728
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,570
She'll know.

729
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,160
Take a break. Five minutes is nothing.

730
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,050
Come on, eat up.

731
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,290
- Thanks, Mr. Feng.
- Thanks.

732
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,210
Don't thank me. Thank my wife!

733
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,840
- Thanks, Mrs. Feng.
- Thanks.

734
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,770
No problem.

735
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,250
Come on, you'll all get it.

736
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,400
Zhilan Snacks usually has

737
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,600
a long line, right?

738
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,050
They opened a new place.

739
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,450
Not that crowded, just downstairs.

- Go ahead.

743
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,330
What to drink?

744
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,330
Juice, please.

745
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,240
A glass of juice.

746
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,210
Weren't you with Yang?

747
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,200
Why are you here?

748
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,080
We just had dinner.

749
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,600
She went back to work overtime.

750
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,970
She's trying to think

751
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,970
of ways to help Zhilan.

752
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,600
Apparently, the loan Zhilan got

753
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,210
was the first one Yang approved

754
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,400
after she transferred over.

755
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,130
Do you think

756
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,010
if Zhilan's business

757
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,160
doesn't do well,

758
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,600
it could affect Yang?

759
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080

821
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120

will know you're a bully.

Please don't post it.

828

I'm begging you. Don't post it.

We'll do anything you say.

831
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,730
Three conditions.

832
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,250
First,

833
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,170
apologize.

834
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,250
Second,

835
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,930
there won't be a next time.

836
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,120
Third,

837
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,250
if you see any

838
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,280
similar bullying,

839
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,240
you must stop it.

840
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,760
If you can't stop it, call the police

841
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,010
or a teacher for help.

842
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,200
My office is just upstairs.

843
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,970
If these three bully you again,

844
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,330
come find me,

845
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,680
and I'll expose them.

846
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,210
Got it?

847
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,370
Apologize.

848
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,810
Sorry.

849
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,010
Be more sincere.

850
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,760
I'm sorry.

851
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,050
Will you do it again?

852
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,120
No.

853
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,720
You're not very tall.

854
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,850
Does that mean someone taller

855
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,050
can bully you?

856
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,410
You aren't top students.

857
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,200
Does that mean the top student

858
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,080
can bully you?

859
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,930
Someone's weaknesses are not

860
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,200
an excuse for you to bully them.

861
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,970
Nobody is perfect,

862
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,050
but a person with bad character

863
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,050
is not a good person.

864
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,720
I hope you remember this forever.

865
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,770
Leave then.

866
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,770
Let's go.

867
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,690
Are you okay?

868
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,970
- Min Lin.
- Are you hurt?

869
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,170
Min Lin.

870
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,290
Is this your brother?

871
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,280
How are you?

872
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,810
Did you get hurt?

873
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,330
Are you in pain?

874
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,280
You're all covered in dust.

875
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,680
Mom's going to worry when she sees you.

876
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,200
It's my fault for not protecting you.

877
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,760
Where's your home?

878
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:49,810
Let me take you back.

879
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,850
Hurry. Say thank you.

880
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:51,810
Thank you, sir.

881
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,490
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

882
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,560
Let's go.

883
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:55,810
- Okay.
- Let's go.

884
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,970
Drink slowly. Don't choke.

885
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,720
Actually, I grew up without a dad too.

886
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,370
My mom raised me

887
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,530
by selling seafood.

888
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,410
Back then, people would

889
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,760
also insult me with limericks.

890
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,560
My mom was too busy and tired.

891
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,450
To save her worries,

892
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,450
I didn't dare tell her.

893
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,050
There was someone

894
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,410
who helped me out like I just did.

895
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
I can even recite

896
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,200
every word

897
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,810
she said back then.

898
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,560
That person must be

899
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,010
a close friend to you, right?

900
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,760
She keeps threatening

901
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,120
to cut ties with me,

902
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,450
but I've told her

903
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,370
that'd never happen.

(Fangping Seafood)

905
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,560
Son.

906
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,600
Do your homework
while watching the shop.

907
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,010
I'm going to deliver these
to the restaurant next door.

908
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,760
Mom, how about I go instead?

909
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,930
No, no, no.

910
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,050
- Let me go.
- Do your homework.

911
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,890
Your teacher said high school

912
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,160
is a countdown

913
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,810
to the college entrance exam.

914
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,290
Do your homework.

915
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,330
Alright.

916
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,410
Alright, stop there.

917
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,560
Mom, be careful.

918
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,920
Wen.

919
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,080
Help me move this over there.

920
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:50,890
Alright.

921
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:53,890
Tang Yang.

922
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,200
My mom's on a business trip in Beijing.

923
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,530
My dad's in a meeting.

924
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,440
I forgot my keys,

925
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,200
so I came here to do my homework.

926
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,410
Take a seat.

927
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,850
Here's today's homework.

928
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,080
After you finish,
let me know how to solve it.

929
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,850
Haven't you finished your homework?

930
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,010
Yeah.

931
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,410
Can't I work on some extra exercises?

932
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,560
I'll solve this problem first.

933
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,650
Isn't that Jiang,

934
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,970
our school's heartthrob?

935
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:39,850
What's wrong?

936
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,850
Is the heartthrob selling seafood now?

937
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,490
Doesn't that make you seaweed?

938
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,200
I can smell the fishy scent from here.

939
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,330
Can you smell it?

940
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,250
Yeah, I can smell it.

941
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,490
Give me a fish.

942
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,770
Which one?

943
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,920
That one.

944
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,600
Seaweed,

945
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,120
make sure to clean

946
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,160
and gut it for me.

947
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,490
I don't do dirty work like that.

948
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,560
Sure.

949
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,400
Wait a moment.

950
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,170
What's wrong?

951
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,200
Calm down, calm down.

952
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,720
I understand what you mean.

953
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,370
Alright, alright, just cool down.

954
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,250
Tang Yang, you...

955
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,960
Go play.

956
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,050
Sorry.

957
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,530
This fish just told me

958
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,280
it thinks your IQ is too low

959
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,240
to eat it.

960
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,240
What do you mean?

961
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,280
I mean you're too dumb to eat fish.

962
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,600
Is that hard to understand?

963
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,200
What? Don't believe it?

964
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,080
Well, I just happen to have

965
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,280
a set of competition papers

966
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,330
for all subjects.

967
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,530
You can choose any subject.

968
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,640
If you can pass,

969
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,160
I'll gut this fish

970
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,600
and treat you to it. Deal?

971
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,080
Those papers in her hand

972
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,370
are hellishly difficult.

973
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,450
Teachers spent a day

974
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,450
creating them.

975
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,200
Let's go. Don't provoke her.

976
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,080
Tang Yang.

977
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,080
Who is Seaweed to you?

978
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,280
Why are you protecting him?

979
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,010
I'm his big brother, alright?

980
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:05,850
So nosy.

981
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,120
Has your previous self-reflection essay

982
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,280
for Director Zhang expired?

983
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,450
Are you planning to write another one?

984
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,080
I remember the last time
your dad came to school,

985
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,330
Director Zhang asked me

986
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,850
to pick him up at the school gate.

987
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,930
Next time, I'll have

988
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,810
a good chat with him.

989
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:22,410
Why do you love eating fish

990
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,160
but never use your brain?

991
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,930
Alright, let's go.

992
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,840
Let's go, let's go.

993
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:28,530
- Let's go play.
- Don't talk to her.

994
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,810
Have you figured out how to solve it?

995
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,640
I can't figure it out,

996
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,600
big bro.

997
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,720
Big bro? Why are you calling me that?

998
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,050
When did I become your big bro?

999
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,280
Didn't you just say

1000
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,120
you're my big bro?

1001
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,970
I was just saying that casually.

1002
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,240
But I took it seriously.

1003
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,010
Then I'll have

1004
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,200
to accept you as my minion.

1005
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,640
Big bro, how to solve this?

1006
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,960
Have no idea?

1007
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,680
Jiang Shiyan, you...

1008
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,930
If you have a brain, use it.

1009
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:15,970
You're not even trying,

1010
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:16,930
and now you gave up.

1011
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,490
What do you keep your brain for?

1012
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,200
If you don't use it, you might as well
toss it in the hotpot.

1013
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,370
How about

1014
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,640
fish hot pot tonight?

1015
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,680
My mom can make it.

1016
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,170
Sounds good.

1017
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,450
I'll have it with a dry dip.

1018
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,850
I'll have an oily dip.

1019
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:32,710
Alright.

1020
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,760
Why don't we slice the fish now?

1021
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,640
You got distracted again.

1022
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,680
I almost got sidetracked by you.

1023
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,000
Hurry and solve it.
