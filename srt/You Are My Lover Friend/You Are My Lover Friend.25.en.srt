Sorry for being late.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,860
The traffic was awful.

What a coincidence.

55
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,970
Mr. Xiao, see you later.

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,710
Don't be so polite.

57
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,550
Just call my name.

58
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,130
I think Mr. Xiao sounds nice.

59
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,410
Then can I call you Sis?

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,200

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,730
Are you younger than me?

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,590
Yeah, I saw your resume.

63
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,430
I'm a year younger.

64
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,660
Okay, you can call me Sis.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,340
- See you later.
- See you.

66
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,220
Oh my, did you
install surveillance on me?

67
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,430
Once I got in my room,

68
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,810
you called me right away.

69
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,530
I'm about to go to a meeting.

70
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,620
We only have 5 minutes.

71
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,800
You go ahead.

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,480
I really want to be your suitcase

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,340
so I can follow you.

74
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,460
What's the use of that?

75
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,320
Let me show you.

76
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,250
Here's our schedule.

77
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,100
It's packed for the whole week,

78
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,050
plus group discussions at night.

79
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,510
It seems more intense

80
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,950
than our senior-year classes.

81
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,290
It's really outrageous.

82
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,600
Come on.

83
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,340
Let me show you my schedule.

84
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,460
(Preview of the itinerary)

85
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,020
I feel a bit comforted.

86
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,880
You're suffering like me.

87
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,780
It makes me feel so much better.

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,970
When you circle back,

89
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,120
it'll be at least

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
ten days, right?

91
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,880
Yeah, Feng Weiran's terrible.

92
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,660
He treats me like a human tool.

93
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,220
Show me your room.

94
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,190
What's up?

95
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,050
Here's the sink.

96
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,660
Here's the bed.

97
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,820
I'm a bit jealous.

98
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,780
I'm jealous of your bed.

99
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,560
Jiang Shiyan, can you be serious?

100
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
You wanted to be my suitcase just now,

101
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,530
and now you're jealous of my bed.

102
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,220
Don't you have any sense of being

103
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,150
a young CEO,

104
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,170
an internet elite,

105
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,730
and a rising entrepreneur?

106
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,430
Even if I'm a young CEO,

107
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,440
a rising entrepreneur,

108
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,350
and an internet elite,

109
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,660
I still miss my girlfriend.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,050
I'm not a monk.

111
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,140
Stop this nonsense.

112
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,140
I'll wash my face
and get to the training.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,850
By the way, send me your hotel address.

114
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,480
Why?

115
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,800
I need directions

116
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
in my dreams at night,

117
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,020
or how will I find you?

118
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,580
You really...

119
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,760

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,880
It was canceled.

190
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,710
Where are you going?

191
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,160
Pujiang.

192
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,130
Really?

193
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
Really.

194
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,720
You didn't think I'd

195
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,830
miss your birthday,

196
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,890
did you?

197
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,160
No, I definitely know

198
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,770
you remember my birthday.

199
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,820
But I always feel

200
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,820
that you're swamped by work.

201
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Work can't stop me

202
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,770
from being with you.

203
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,280
I originally planned

204
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,440
to take the latest flight

205
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,610
on the evening of the 8th,

206
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,160
but after the meeting,

207
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,010
there's a banquet,

208
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,350
so I've booked a flight

209
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,850
in the morning on the 9th to Pujiang.

210
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,800
Wait for me.

211
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,800
I'll wait for you.

212
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,470
Alright, get some rest early.

213
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,310
Bye-bye.

214
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Everyone,

215
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,440
Professor Peng has something urgent.

216
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,750
We need to adjust

217
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,940
the class schedule next week.

218
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,420
On the 9th, we'll have a day off.

219
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,510
The class will start
at 1 pm on the 10th.

220
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,820
Full-day classes on the 11th.

221
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,850
Rest on the 12th.

222
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,160
Please complete the course assignments

223
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,680
Professor Peng assigned earlier

224
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,520
as a group

225
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,080
and submit them before 9 am

226
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,920
on the 10th.

227
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,580
That concludes today's class.

228
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,890
You can take a break

229
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,880
and have dinner.

230
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,100
(Jiang, Tang)
A day off in two days.

231
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,110
(Tang Yang)

232
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,580
(Jiang)
The heavens are helping us.

233
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,550
Lanqing.

234
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,760
You're a local.

235
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,630
I want to ask

236
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,040
if there are any fun places nearby.

237
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,130
Tell me more.

238
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,340
Just don't make it too far.

239
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,440
There's Lanxi Ancient Town

240
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,610
over two hours away by car.

241
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,920
It's named

242
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,300
after the Lancao Stream

243
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,770
and has beautiful scenery.

244
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,200
The ancient town has

245
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,440
previous tea houses,

246
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,350
breweries,

247
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,490
and guesthouses to stay in.

248
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,920
I'm from that area,

249
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,540
so I have "lan" in my name.

250
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,010
Great. I'll check it out.

251
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,970
By the way,

252
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,160
if you happen
to catch the wine festival,

253
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,130
it's especially lively,

254
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,220
with lots of people.

255
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,630
The winery there

256
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,890
has famous wine.

257
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,470
If you get the chance,

258
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,310
you can taste some.

259
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,540
Okay, thanks.

260
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,520
Ms. Wei,

261
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,710
you needed me?

262
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,920
Have a seat.

263
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,420
I asked you to find new pilot projects.

264
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,520
How's it going?

265
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,590
The two companies from last time

266
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,850
are valuable for investment.

267
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,700
One is a biopharmaceutical company.

268
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,460
The other is in encrypted payments.

269
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,770
Both are too specialized.

270
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,700
I want something
that isn't so technical.

271
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,160
Ordinary people should

272
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,220
be able to understand it.

273
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,610
So, do you mean

274
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,770
we should aim our project

275
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,010
as much as possible
at individual investors,

276
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,310
not institutions?

277
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,830
Working with institutions

278
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,180
takes too long.

279
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,060
Got it, I'll look for more options.

280
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,280
Okay.

281
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,560
Mr. Jiang, the weather forecast

282
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,250
says many flights are grounded.

283
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,370
They canceled all flights?

284
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,880
Yeah, Mr. Jiang.

285
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,590
The weather forecast says there's going

286
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,840
to be heavy rain from tonight

287
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,770
until tomorrow.

288
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,320
The weather won't

289
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,460
improve until at least 4.

290
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,470
Should I reschedule your flight?

291
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,310
I'll think about it.

292
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,550
Hello?

293
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,240
Yes, the earliest flight

294
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,220
is at 5:30 pm tomorrow.

295
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,830
I just checked.

296
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,340
The weather over there is terrible.

297
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,110
If you

298
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,750
take off at 5:30,

299
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,460
you won't arrive here until 7.

300
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,850
I have a class the day after tomorrow,

301
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,300
and you'll have to travel again.

302
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,080
I thought about it.

303
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,960
Such little time isn't

304
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,940
worth the hassle.

305
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,200
Let's just celebrate my birthday

306
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,300
when I get back.

307
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,970
What's your plan for tomorrow?

308
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,540
I haven't figured that out yet.

309
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,610
Well.

310
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,180
I'll sleep until noon.

311
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,250
How about a movie together tomorrow?

312
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,890
How do we do that?

313
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,490
We'll both buy

314
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,180
tickets for the same showtime,

315
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,800
in the same row,

316
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,820
in two seats nearby.

317
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,470
It'll feel just like

318
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,100
we're together.

319
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,970
That's interesting.

320
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,750
It's your birthday; I don't want you

321
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,100
to spend it alone in your room.

322
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,590
I'll be with you.

323
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,420
Alright, I'll check.

324
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,370
10:30.

325
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,660

(Ticket collection)

328
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,770
(Tang Yang)
I'm here.

329
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,850
Have you arrived yet?

330
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,890
Don't tell me you're not at the cinema.

331
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,930
(Tang Yang)

332
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,990
Seems like the first time

333
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,320
to watch a movie together

334
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,850
as your girlfriend.

335
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,100

Didn't you say

341
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,370
the flight was canceled?

342
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,220
I bought a slow train ticket

343
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,440
last night from Kunzhou

344
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
to Pujiang.

345
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,180
I arrived here just after 7 am.

346
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,240
Then I rented a car

347
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,370
and drove for over two hours.

348
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,340
You silly.

349
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,870
Didn't I tell you

350
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,580
not to go through all this trouble?

351
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,130
Why did you have to do this?

352
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,430
Aren't you tired?

353
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,250

Yes.

I was pretty sad

360
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,060

Honey, you're back.

367
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,280
Did you miss Daddy?

368
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,200
Yes. Did you bring me gifts?

372
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,340
Go and finish writing.

373
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,650
I will give you gifts.

374
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,950

375
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,540

- I missed you so much.

379
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,720
You're awake.

380
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,930
The movie is already over?

381
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,300
Why didn't you wake me up?

382
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,160
You slept so soundly.

383
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,170
Didn't want to bother you.

384
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,630
Let's go.

385
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,630
Let's go.

386
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,120
Are you still tired?

387
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,070
Want to go to my hotel

388
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,910
for some sleep?

389
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,870
No.

390
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,850
The nap was enough.

391
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,980
Today is your birthday.

392
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,780
Your colleague recommended
Lanxi Ancient Town.

393
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,160
I've rented a car.

394
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,060
Let's drive there.

395
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,270
But it takes two hours to get there.

396
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,500
I think it's a bit far.

397
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,210
But you wanted to go.

398
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,210
Birthdays are all about fulfilling

399
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,370
all wishes.

400
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,260
Let's find something to eat here,

401
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,930
stay there overnight, and come back

402
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,980
the next morning.

403
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,960
You won't miss class.

404
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,930
Then I'll go and pack some toiletries.

405
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,470
Isn't this a mall?

406
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,310
We can buy it here.

407
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,110
That works.

408
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,720
It won't waste time.

409
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,000
Grapes.

410
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,340
It's seedless.

411
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,630
Really?

412
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,280
It should be here.

413
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,450
Peng Si booked it for me.

414
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,270
Finally, we've arrived.

415
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,210
It's already dark.

416
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,510
I thought maybe

417
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,300
we could visit the brewery.

418
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,440
Who would've thought the traffic

419
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
would be so awful?

420
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,280
Right.

421
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,170
I'm a bit hungry now.

422
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,610
After we drop off our luggage,

423
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,680
let's go grab a bite.

424
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,590
Sounds good.

425
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,650
Is this the entrance?

426
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,910
I think so.

427
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,650
Why does it feel so empty?

428
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,130
Jiang Shiyan, over here.

429
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,420
(Tang, happy birthday)

430
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,860
(Tang, happy birthday)

431
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,900
(Tang, happy birthday)

432
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,910
Happy birthday.

433
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,760
My Tang.

434
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,580
You wanted to see the festival.

435
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,210
I planned to go to the winery,

436
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,390
but we didn't.

437
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,130
However, I've prepared lots of wine

438
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,980
from various years.

439
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,390
Take a look.

440
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,500
2010.

441
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,980
Grateful for that year.

442
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,020
I met Tang Yang,
the most important person

443
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,650
in my life.

444
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,450
2011.

445
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,610
Tang Yang became my buddy.

446
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,210
2012.

447
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,740
My essay was published in the magazine.

448
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,450
Yang used her scholarship

449
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,100
to celebrate with milk tea.

450
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,500
2013.

451
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,060
On graduation day,

452
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,130
we sat by the river all night

453
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,350
until sunrise.

454
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,720
2014.

455
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,310
Yang inspected

456
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,410
our school's cafeteria.

457
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,690
I wrote my first food review,

458
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,170
ranking the university cafeterias.

459
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,100
2015.

460
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,740
I went to do field research.

461
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,070
Yang went abroad

462
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,210
as an exchange student.

463
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,410
We didn't see each other for 7 months.

464
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,780
2016.

465
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,740
Yang decided to apply for a PhD.

466
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,470
I decided to stay at City Weekly

467
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,310
as an editor.

468
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,390
2017.

469
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,030
Yang gave me a camera

470
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,100
as a graduation gift.

471
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,040
2018.

472
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,680
I teamed up with Feng and Cheng

473
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,210
to start Yixiu Found of Food.

474
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Yang helped us negotiate

475
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,920
six months of free office space

476
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,020
in the business park.

477
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,150
2019.

478
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,930
Yang worked overtime with us for a month

479
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,540
to finish the business plan.

480
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,980
We secured Series A.

481
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,110
2020.

482
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,260
While Yang was writing her thesis,

483
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,370
she wrote over 70

484
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,370
food reviews on Yixiu.

485
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,760
2021.

486
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,650
Yang joined CBBC's management program

487
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,890
and had to leave,

488
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,710
but on the day of our first

489
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,100
food ranking release,

490
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,390
she rushed back.

491
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,680
2022.

492
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,850
Yang finally returned to her post,

493
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,610
but I didn't want her
to be my buddy anymore.

Yes.

500
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,060
In thirteen years,

This is sushi and coffee from someone.

531

There's a message.

532
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,070
Zhou Mo,

533
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,070
I enjoy your lectures.

534
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,920
The coffee and sushi

535
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,820
are a token of thanks.

536
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,070
I don't need this, thanks.

537
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,300
Can you give it to me?

538
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,310
Of course.

539
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,310
Then thanks.

540
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
This coffee and sushi,

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,310
plus my delivery fee, will be fifty.

542
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,150
Can't waste it.

543
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,030
You're a delivery person?

544
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,870
Yes.

545
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,640
Within the school grounds,

546
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,170
if you want to buy or send something,

547
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,980
(Tomb)
you can order it on WeChat.

548

551
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,910

552
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,110
Pretty good.

553
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,360

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,850
I won't miss lessons.

555
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,100
What's your major?

556
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,410
I'm Zhou Mo.

557
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,200
I know. You're my senior.

558
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,100
I'm also in management.

559
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,130
I'm Xu Shanshan.

560
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,410
I thought...

561
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,370
I really was

562
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,550
planning to book

563
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,390
the whole hotel.

564
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,500
There's a great

565
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,880
penthouse suite on the top.

566
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,370
But when I asked Peng Si to book it,

567
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,920
I found out that this hotel

568
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,100
had many rooms booked months ago.

569
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,500
There's only this room left.

570
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
I checked other hotels.

571
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,850
They were average.

572
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,300
This one is pretty good.

573
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,210
I thought of that time in college.

574
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,130
Do you remember?

575
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,300
We went on a trip.

576
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,510
To save money,

577
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,640
we only booked one room

578
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,840
and brought sleeping bags

579
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,710
and damp-proof mats.

580
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,230
Girls slept on the bed.

581
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,300
Boys slept on the floor.

582
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,460
Right.

583
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,510
That time in Mordaga.

584
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,350
Yes, yes.

585
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,260
Feng Weiran

586
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,130
snored really loudly.

587
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,440
Later, we had no choice.

588
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,070
- You found an abandoned
- Right.

589
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,370
train car beside the hotel.

590
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,750
We set up a tent and slept

591
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,690
in the sleeping bags.

592
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,310
That time was really nice.

593
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,980
Felt like we had endless energy
every day.

594
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,840
Now, whenever I work overtime,

595
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,580
I feel like it takes me days to recover.

596
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,910
I...

597
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,370
I'll go take a shower first.

598
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,630
Wait a minute.

599
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,980
(Call from Mr. Xiao)

600
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,260
Hello, Mr. Xiao, go ahead.

601
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,690
I finished my tasks yesterday.

602
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,100
Okay, okay, when?

603
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,130
Got it.

604
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,800
Bye-bye.

605
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,590
What's wrong?

606
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,060
It's true
that what you fear will happen.

607
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,120
A colleague from my group

608
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,360
called me and said

609
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,470
one of our group members

610
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,610
had a fever and was sick.

611
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,920
This assignment was

612
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,260
divided among us.

613
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,880
Now that he's sick,

614
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,790
the others have

615
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,060
to help him with his part.

616
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,450
In summary,

617
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,260
I have to work overtime.

618
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,410
Does it have to be now?

619
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,310
He just told me

620
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,360
others are already online and ready.

621
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,200
I'm the last one.

622
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,440
I'll be quick.

623
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,890
Wait for me a moment, okay?

624
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,780
Then give me a kiss.

625
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,960
You're so nice.

626
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,410
We'll still split it into three parts.

627
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
As for the value of microfinance,

628
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,310
Mr. Xiao currently

629
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,020
has more detailed data.

630
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,740
How about Mr. Xiao write this part?

631
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,720
I'm fine with that.

632
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,930
The difficulties and solutions for me.

633
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,300
Tang, you write
the analysis of previous cases.

634
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,210
Okay, no problem.

635
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,240
Sis,

636
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,200
I saw that your previous section

637
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
on innovative model design

638
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,780
was very complete and detailed.

639
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,520
Sis?

640
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,120
Continue.

641
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,020
I didn't hear you.

642
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,910
Sis,

643
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,400
I said I saw

644
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,310
your previous section

645
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,550
on innovative model design

646
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,100
was very complete and detailed.

647
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,310
I feel you have
a good grasp of the past cases

648
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,300
related to this model.

649
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,680
Well.

650
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,540
Yes, that's right.

651
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,710
When I was writing the summary report

652
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,890
on Zhang Zhilan's case,

653
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,820
there were many data
I could use directly.

654
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,110
So, I think...

655
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,590
Sis?

656
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,980
It just lagged for a moment.

657
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,880
Well, I'll send that report
to the group.

658
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,130
You can take a look at it.

659
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,470
Is 5 minutes enough?

660
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,260
After five minutes, we'll continue.

661
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

662
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,340
I need to leave for now.

663
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,850
Jiang Shiyan.

664
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,690
What are you doing?

665
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,590
I'm in a meeting.

666
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,980
How can you interrupt me like this?

667
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,200
How am I interrupting you?

668
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,370
I'm here negotiating friendly
with a panda.

669
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,780
You're making it hard
for me to concentrate.

670
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,540
Can't I just watch you?

671
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,500
If so, I'll only watch you.

672
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,820
Then don't work.

673
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,650
No way, dear.

674
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,300
- Ouch, it hurts.
- Well.

675
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,310
Right? I know

676
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,850
you had a tough time yesterday

677
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,850
and didn't rest well.

678
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,740
I'll finish the meeting soon.

679
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,120
Once I'm done, I'll call you, okay?

680
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,960
You should sleep.

681
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,910
When will it end?

682
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,300
Within an hour. I promise.

683
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,820
Why does it still take an hour?

684
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,060
Close your eyes.

685
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,690
Let it accompany you for a while.

686
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,720
Okay?

687
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,800
Deal.

688
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,310
Good morning.

689
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,470
Good morning.

690
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,720
What time is it?

691
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,160
Ten o'clock.

692
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,440
Ten? Why didn't you wake me up?

693
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,480
I'll be late for work

694
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,320
this afternoon.

695
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,510
No need to rush.

696
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,920
You can have breakfast.

697
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,760
You'll have time.

698
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,250
Forget it; I'll just pack it
to eat in the car.

699
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,720
What's wrong?

700
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,280
You're making me

701
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,500
want to do something.

702
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,430
Well.

703
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,280
I should change first.

704
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,900
It's better to wash up afterward.

705
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,910
Honey,

706
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,330
do I look good in this outfit?

707
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,350
You look good.

708
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,860
Did you even look before you said that?

709
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,920
I looked.

710
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,760
You're pretty.

711
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,770
Do I look good in this dress?

712
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,550
Custom-made.

713
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,390
Feng Weiran,

714
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,810
am I wearing a dress?

715
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,210
So beautiful.

716
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,240
If

717
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,190
I were this beauty's husband,

718
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,070
I would buy her

719
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,190
every beautiful outfit

720
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,250
in the world.

721
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,810
Go away.

722
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,800
I want it. I want it.

723
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,590
Just buy it. Just buy it.

724
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,430
Stop it.

725
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,320
Yang's training should be

726
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,170
ending soon, right?

727
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,120
She'll be back soon?

728
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,110
I don't know.

729
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,320
When I met Jiang the other day,

730
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,210
he didn't say anything.

731
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,400
How could Tang come back
without Jiang knowing?

732
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,730
Who knows?

733
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,560
Pay the bill.

734
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,690
I'll pay the bill now.

735
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,160
Hi, I'd like to pay.

736
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,240
Coming right up.

737
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,290
- Mr. Xiao.
- Sis.

738
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,380
After tonight's graduation dinner,

739
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,500
our group and a few other classmates

740
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,400
are planning to go to a bar

741
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,240
for drinks.

742
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,940
Are Lanqing and others going too?

743
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:06,950
They're all going.

744
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,360
- Sure.
- Great. See you later.

745
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,200
See you later.

746
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,980
Check it before uploading.

747
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,110
Mr. Jiang, you're back.

748
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,950
Yeah.

749
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,810
- Mr. Jiang.
- Wasn't it tomorrow?

750
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,280
It's fine.

751
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,510
Didn't you say I should
return a day early

752
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,500
for Dingshen's team?

753
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,760
What's your plan?

754
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,600
Dinner together?

755
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,720
Spit it out.

756
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,560
No time tonight.

757
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,800
What are you doing?

758
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,130
I'll clean the house.

759
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,220
(Graduation Ceremony
of CBBC Xinlei Training)

760
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,190
The highest overall score

761
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,130
and the best team award

762
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,100
for this Xinlei Training Program

763
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,460
goes to Group 3.

764
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,210
Welcome Chen Zhong, Xia Lanqing,

765
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,980
Tang Yang, and Xiao Qin

766
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,100
to receive the award.

767
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,760
By the way, Tang.

768
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,810
I have a favor to ask.

769
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,670
I told you my hometown

770
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,130
is in Lanxi Ancient Town, right?

771
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,940
The local wine-making is famous.

772
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,470
The town mayor is my classmate

773
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,730
and has called me several times,

774
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,540
saying the products are indeed good,

775
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,760
but they lack some

776
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,940
promotion channels.

777
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,670
The other day, I saw you

778
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,650
watching the product launch
of Yixiu Found of Food.

779
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,500
You said you knew the owner.

780
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,990
Is there a chance

781
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,100
he could help promote it?

782
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,510
How about this?

783
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,730
I'll mention it to him,

784
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,360
and I'll create a group for you

785
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,200
to talk about it.

786
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,160
That sounds great.

787
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,670
- Thanks.
- No problem.

788
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,510
It's nothing.

789
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,600
Come on.

790
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,120
Sis.

791
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,200
Thanks.

792
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,730
We'll meet again soon.

793
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,720
Tang.

794
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,510
Welcome home.

795
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,460
These chopsticks

796
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,860
are so cute.

797
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,080
Yeah.

798
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,120
These chopsticks

799
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,500
represent our zodiac signs.

800
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,150
From now on, I'll have

801
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,460
my chopsticks at your home.

802
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,060
You can come over for dinner every day.

803
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,880
Our fans all know

804
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,650
that Nina has recently been nominated

805
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,400
for Best Actress at the 19th

806
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,650
Starlight Film Festival

807
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,070
with a female-themed film,

808
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,460
Swimming Against the Current.

809
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,650
We've also noticed

810
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,280
Nina hasn't had many projects

811
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,210
this past year.

812
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,380
Are you intentionally

813
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,550
taking a break

814
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,390
or do you

815
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,060
have other plans?

816
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,730
I also noticed you've been

817
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,210
- live streaming, right?
- Yes.

818
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,780
(Nina, Cheng Hui)
Are you back?

819
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,130
Found a place with delicious wontons.

820
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,250
This year, I'm indeed

821
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,290
focusing on resting,

822
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
because I was quite tired

823
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,950
(Nina looks great)
from work.

824
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,070
(Expecting)
Two dramas

825
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,980
(Gets nominated)
and three films in two years.

826
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,800
But now,

827
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,670
I've been

828
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,510
fully prepared.

829
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,770
I have my follow-up work arranged,

830
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,940
and it's quite full.

831
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,540
Your fans must be

832
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,340
looking forward to it.

833
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,400
(Are you back?)
Here.

834
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,280
(Found a place with delicious wontons.)
I hope

835
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,170
your work can go well.

836
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,510
Thanks.

837
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,690
(Rongcheng West Station)

838
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,560
Welcome back.

839
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,460
Cheers.

840
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,760
So, Jiang Shiyan

841
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
doesn't know

842
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,100
about your relationship yet?

843
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,170
Of course.

844
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,380
How could I tell him?

845
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,810
You're my best friend,

846
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,690
my classmate, and my good friend.

847
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,690
He's also my cousin.

848
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,580
Though he's just a cousin...

849
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,980
Just a cousin?

850
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,060
Sounds a bit strange.

851
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,380
His dad and my dad are cousins,

852
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,690
not brothers.

853
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,330
I'm his cousin too,

854
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,650
so it's just a cousin.

855
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,980
Okay, it doesn't matter. Go on.

856
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,630
If I tell my cousin,

857
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,060
it's like telling my whole family.

858
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,440
That's true.

859
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,540
What if one day

860
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,100
we break up?

861
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,100
Then I'd have to explain it
to my family.

862
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,080
Indeed.

863
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,810
Yanan, you can't think like that.

864
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,330
We won't break up.

865
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,720
I've officially joined

866
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,150
the capital group now.

867
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,330
When I finish
my lawyer internship this year,

868
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,240
you'll be about to graduate.

869
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,550
I'll bring a betrothal gift

870
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,210
to ask your parents at your house.

871
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,540
Ask my parents?

872
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,960
You haven't even asked me yet.

873
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,730
Who are you? Go away.

874
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,250
You two are good together.

875
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,200
You know each other.

876
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,100
What's good about that?

877
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,650
Look, we're each other's first love.

878
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,280
When we're old, we won't have exes

879
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,210
to reminisce about.

880
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,550
But I can also change boyfriend styles

881
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,510
to make you happy.

882
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,900
- Can you?
- Yes.

883
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,100
Cute.

884
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,160
Domineering.

885
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,240
He's cute, right?

886
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,250
He's really cute.

887
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,760
If you keep this up,

888
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,980
I might really leave.

889
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,990
Yang,

890
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,860
you have to choose wisely.

891
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,670
Keep your eyes wide open

892
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,020
and choose well.

893
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,060
Choose wisely?

894
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,120
Right.

895
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,350
Okay.

896
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,320
I'll take this

897
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,420
as your blessing for me.

898
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,510
Of course.

899
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,100
- Choose wisely.
- Right.

900
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,170
Choose wisely.
