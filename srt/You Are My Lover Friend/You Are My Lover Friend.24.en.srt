Yang.

29
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,200
Okay. Thanks.

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,360
Here.

31
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,030
When did you move in?

32
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,020
Why didn't you tell me?

33
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,820
I terminated
the lease of that apartment,

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,160
and I couldn't find
another suitable one.

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,950
You had a surgery
and stayed in the hospital for a while,

36
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,850
so I stayed in the same hotel

37
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,730
as Feng Weiran.

38
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,500
He had a fight with his wife.

39
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,690
Then they got back together,

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,100
so I rent this place.

41
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,990
It's a nice apartment.

42
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,410
Everything is new.

43
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,900
Haven't you seen it before?

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,200
I...

45
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,150
I just looked at the picture,

46
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,780
but I didn't get in.

47
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,810
Are you living in
this big two-bedroom apartment alone?

48
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,590
Feng Weiran said one more room

49
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,640
wouldn't cost much more money,

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,680
and he can come over

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,100
when he has a fight with his wife.

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,220
You can also come here
when you have time.

53
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,500
No need.

54
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,800
Didn't you say

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,050
going back and forth was inconvenient?

56
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,430
I... I'm worried that my mom

57
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,270
will be scared of

58
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,970
living alone in that apartment,

59
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,130
so I'll come back to see her
from time to time.

60
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,780
Yes. A good son.

61
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,180
Cheng Hui, where are the dishes?

62
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,250
There's disposable tableware.

63
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,520
You've rented this place.

64
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,460
Why don't you buy some dishes?

65
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,310
I don't know how to wash dishes.

66
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,820
Disposable tableware
can only be used once,

67
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,060
and it's not environmentally friendly.

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,550
I bought

69
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,220
biodegradable products.

70
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,620
Cheng Hui, what's this?

71
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,180
(Rover No. 1)
Rover Space Probe.

72
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,840
It's the furthest space probe

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,850
humans have ever launched so far.

74
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,290
Is it streaming?

75
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,590
It's actually

76
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,030
a programmed

77
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,240
simulated return signal,

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,810
which shows its flight path.

79
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,620
How far is it from us now?

80
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,180
22 billion kilometers.

81
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,940
It's still in the solar system.

82
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,180
With its speed,

83
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,530
it'll take around 10 thousand years

84
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,780
to leave the solar system.

85
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,730
10 thousand years?

86
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
That's so long.

87
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,570
We'll be long gone.

88
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,240
Hearing this,

89
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,340
I suddenly feel

90
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,930
the solar system and the universe

91
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,260
are so small.

92
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,140
Humans living on the earth

93
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,170
are smaller and shorter.

94
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,490
Why do you sound so desperate?

95
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,480
But maybe it's because

96
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,660
we're small and short,

97
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,460
we need to cherish

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,630
everything we have in this life.

99
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,170
If everything can last forever,

100
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,370
then we won't have to

101
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,820
cherish them anymore.

102
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,390
(Sheng Nina)
When will you come back?

103
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,340
- Do you have hand sanitizer?
- (Do you want me to pick you up?)

104
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,220
(Cheng Hui)
I'll get some disinfectant for you.

105
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,220
Or maybe some soap.

106
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,620
(Cheng Hui: When will you come back?
Do you want me to pick you up?)

107
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,410
I didn't except

108
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,480
the normally silent

109
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,880
and weird Cheng Hui

110
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,410
to be quite sensitive.

111
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,600
How can you tell

112
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,660
he's sensitive?

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,520
When we were having dinner,

114
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,610
he told me

115
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,490
Rover

116
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,230
is going to lose contact

117
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,410
with the earth,

118
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,270
and it will only

119
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,700
wander in the universe alone

120
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,970
and not be able to
send any messages back.

121
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,190
When he said this,

122
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,780
he looked so sad.

123
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,260
So, I'm glad

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,600
that we've never

125
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,580
lost contact.

126
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,850
I know you've

127
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,900
always been there.

128
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,700
But to be honest,

129
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,730
sometimes I'm scared.

130
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,660
I'm scared

131
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,220
that it's just a dream.

132
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,340
I'm scared when I wake up,

133
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,730
I'll find we've never been together,

134
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,970
and you've never loved me.

135
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,100

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,170
I love you.

137
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,530
Do you want to go to my place?

138
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,460
I'm afraid if I go upstairs,

139
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,410
I'll be reluctant to leave.

140
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,990
It's...

141
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,730

and been through a lot.

175
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,360
I've always felt

176
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,630
that the most important thing

177
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,610
is to stay with each other.

to affect

00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,650
our friendship.

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,820

hanging out with you every day.

184
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,770
Maybe it's because we've been

185
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,490
by each other's side for many years,

186
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
I never felt lonely

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,610
in another city alone.

189
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,490

I can't imagine

198
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,850
if one day,

199
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,720
we'll drift away

200
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,770
from each other's world.

201
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,460

Feng Weiran called me

209
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,420
and told me a stupid joke.

Mr. Jiang has five meetings today.

Oh my god.

223
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,560
Why do I feel

224
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,440
that Jiang Shiyan has been
more energetic than ever

225

High kinetic energy parameters

227

When we're emotional,

229
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,540
we'll move and talk faster.

230
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,850
For example, we'll yell
when we're happy or angry,

231
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,630
walk faster when pleased,

232
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,060
and scream when scared.

233
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,230
Driven by such high kinetic energy,

234
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,130
we'll be much more efficient at work.

will be held

239
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,580
next week.

240
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,630
You'll introduce the system

241
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,820
and applications.

242
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,560
When can I get the material?

243
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,040
I need to send it to the PR in advance

244
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,150
to let them write a press release.

245
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,820
Can I give it to you tonight?

246
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,820
So efficient?

247
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,970

248
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,940
Also tonight.

249
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,120
Wait.

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,480
I need to visit a client
in the afternoon,

254
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,600
so I ordered take-out dumplings

255
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,540
to save some time.

256
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,060
I heard you're going to
New Bud training.

257
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,180
It's going to take three weeks, right?

258
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,560
I remember Mr. Gan was going.

259
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,700
Why did they let you go instead?

260
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,270
However, I heard the training

261
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,200
is quite good,

262
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,050
and some leaders from the head office
will also be there.

263
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,130
It's good for promotion.

264
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,160
Indeed, some people

265
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,420
got promoted after they went there,

266
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,960
but Gan Yiming went there
for three consecutive years

267
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,850
and never got promoted.

268
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,730
I think

269
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,320
they let you go this time

270
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,610
because they needed to compensate you

271
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,650
for erasing you

272
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,250
from the Qinglai's case.

273
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,220
You knew that, right?

274
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,400
They think

275
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,340
they're rewarding me.

276
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,940
But I don't want it.

277
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,460
Why?

278
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,100
Don't want a long trip?

279
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,420

who finished a full makeup

281
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,530

just updated.

282
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,130
Did you watch it?

283
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,700
Really? Let me see.

284
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,730
Which one?

285
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,240
This one.

286
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,490
The blogger Ya

287
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,840
is very interesting and professional

288
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,340
when talking about makeup.

289
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,700
Well, is she popular now?

290
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,160
Quite popular.

291
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,250
She's got many viewers.

292
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,650
Really?

293
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,250
Hello, what's wrong?

294
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,460
I'm in the office.

295
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,190
Now?

296
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,010
Upstairs now?

297
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,470
Okay.

298
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,950
I'm coming.

299
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,820
Where is Ms. Tang going?

300
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,600
During lunch,

301
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,930
she said she was going to
visit a client.

302
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,440
She's in a hurry. This client

303
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,730
must be very important.

304
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,250
Aren't you supposed to
have meetings all day?

305
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,150
I just finished two meetings

306
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,420
and came here
to send you some pudding.

307
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,130
You can eat it in the office.

308
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,280
I have another three meetings.

309
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,400
Oh my god.

310
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,630
Mr. Jiang, you're so busy,

311
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,080
but you're still here to send me food.

312
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,950
No matter how busy I am,
I'm always thinking about you.

313
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,010
God. Why are you so sweet?

314
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,840
Is it because you majored in media

315
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,720
and learn many sweet talks?

316
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,650
You're so good at it.

317
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,770
Did you come here
because you're going to

318
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,580
work overtime tonight?

319
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,400
I knew you'd figure it out.

320
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,970
Smart girl Tang Yang.

321
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,510
Not only tonight

322
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,350
but tomorrow.

323
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,020
We're going to have
an online launch event next week.

324
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,480
Feng Weiran invited the executive team

325
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,200
to talk about details tomorrow,

326
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,650
but I think we'll finish it
during the day.

327
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,470
Okay.

328
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,480
So, someone just

329
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,400
backed out.

330
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,730
I didn't break the promise anyway.

331
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Just one day.

332
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,580
I'll be free tomorrow night.

333
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,130
I can send you on Sunday when you leave.

334
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,720
If you're busy,

335
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,200
my dad can send me.

336
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,320
How can I hand over
this opportunity to others?

337
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,540
Even if he's your dad.

338
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,960
By the way, I sent some kiwis

339
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,200
to your parents.

340
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,320
Those were the most delicious ones

341
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,370
based on our test results.

342
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,460
Kiwi is good for blood sugar control.

343
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,800
By the way,

344
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,600
Aunt Yi asked me to change

345
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,890
the cartridge of the water purifier.

346
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,650
I bought a set of three.

347
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,510
She also mentioned
the range hood has been making noises.

348
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,600
I also hired a maintenance team.

349
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,030
They'll come tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

350
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,060
Remember to tell them.

351
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,270
Sometimes I can tell

352
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,750
whether you're my boyfriend

353
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,300
or the almighty magic lamp.

354
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,100
Your sweet talks

355
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,820
are at the next level.

356
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,070
How about this? I'll go to your company

357
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,410
and wait for you
after I get off tomorrow.

358
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,450
We can do whatever you want.

359
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,030
Okay. You decide.

360
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,890
What do you want to do?

361
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,450
What do couples usually do?

362
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,000
Having a meal,

363
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,740
seeing a film, and shopping.

364
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,030
But we did it all the time

365
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,500
when we were friends.

366
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,370
What else?

367
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,850
I think

368
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,400
we should think of

369
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,750
some things

370
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,850
we haven't done together before

371
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,240
and make a list.

372
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,400
We'll finish them one by one

373
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,240
when we have time.

374
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,160
What are you thinking?

375
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,690
No dirty thought, you...

376
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,400
I'm not thinking about that.

377
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,540
I was just thinking about

378
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,340
the things we haven't done.

379
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,370
Nothing else.

380
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,300
You certainly did.

381
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,610
I know it.

382
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,540
Isn't it normal?

383
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,870
I'm leaving.

384
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,310
Nina.

385
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,030
Our flight is delayed.

386
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,100
I think it'll be two hours late.

387
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,500
Two hours?

388
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,930
That's so long.

389
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,020
Yes.

390
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,650
This crew is so annoying.

391
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,640
They promised
to let you finish last night,

392
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,300
but you worked till morning.

393
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,600
Check if there are

394
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,650
other earlier flights.

395
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,550
When we rebooked the flight,

396
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,470
all the other flights had been sold out

397
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,410
except for this one at 3:00 p.m.

398
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,690
What about alternate flights?

399
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,980
Can we rebook them?

400
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,570
Is there any alternate flight?

401
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,260
Let me see.

402
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,650
(Cheng Hui)
(My flight is delayed.)

403
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,070
(Sheng Nina)
(If I can't make it,)

404
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,650
(can I treat you to a meal next time?)

405
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,170
That's all.

406
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,200
Mr. Cheng's part

407
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,120
takes about 15 minutes

408
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,170
to introduce the data,

409
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,300
features, and cases.

410
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,380
What about other parts?

411
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,590
How's brand cooperation going?

412
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,430
Give me the file.

413
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,180
(Sheng Nina: My flight is delayed.)

414
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,860
(If I can't make it,
can I treat you to a meal next time?)

415
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,470
(It's already booked.)

416
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,310
(You don't need to cancel it.)

417
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,980
(I'll wait for you.)

418
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,860
(Cheng Hui)

419
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,020
Hello, Yanan.

420
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,100
Yes,

421
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,370
we can't celebrate
the birthday together.

422
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,510
They're sending me
to a training session all of a sudden.

423
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,500
What a pity.

424
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,280
Tonight?

425
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,210
I can't. I have something to do.

426
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,070
Aren't Feng Weiran and the others

427
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,270
going to have a meeting tonight?

428
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,110
Yes.

429
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,260
We can't make it. Forget it.

430
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,440
Maybe another day.

431
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,240
Bye.

432
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,590
Tang.

433
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,160
Why don't you
have dinner at home tonight?

434
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,200
I made

435
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,270
braised beef with potatoes.

436
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,370
I have something to do tonight.

437
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,210
Who are you having dinner with tonight?

438
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,170
Yanan is busy,

439
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,170
and Feng and the others have a meeting.

440
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,260
Who else can it be?

441
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,160
Besides, your dad
wanted to send you tomorrow,

442
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,690
but you said someone else
would send you.

443
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,540
Who is that?

444
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,820
Who will send you?

445
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,500
Tell me.

446
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,060
Is he your...?

447
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,300
Jiang Shiyan.

448
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,340
Oh, it's Jiang.

449
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,210
Then what are you going to do tonight?

450
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,820
Work overtime with Jiang Shiyan.

451
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,130
Work with him?

452
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,070
You're already tired.

453
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,060
Why do you want to work with him?

454
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,070
Why don't you go out to have a meal,

455
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,780
see a movie, and have a boyfriend?

456
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,800
I...

457
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,910
I...

458
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,100
I'm leaving.

459
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,060
Have you finished the meeting?

460
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,720
My part is finished.

461
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,910
They're still having a meeting.

462
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,440
Where are you going?

463
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
Having lunch.

464
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,680
Actually, Mr. Cheng Hui

465
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,160
has introduced

466
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,640
the algorithm technology
of Fruit Platform.

467
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,480
We can

468
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,100
look at the details.

469
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,640
Sir, here's the menu for tonight.

470
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,480
Take a look.

471
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,130
Ms. Sheng is allergic to mango.

472
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,160
Can you please

473
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,540
change the dessert mango mousse?

474
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,680
Okay, is chocolate mousse okay

475
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,520
for you?

476
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,440
Okay.

477
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,590
Would you like to choose

478
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,450
the wine?

479
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,780
The main course is fish,

480
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,690
so I'd like a bottle of white wine.

481
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,760
Okay.

482
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,130
Okay. Thanks.

483
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,660
(Saturday Night)

484
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,890
Yang, hurry up.

485
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,200
What's wrong? Have you finished?

486
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,030
Yes, but Feng Weiran heard you came

487
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,370
and insisted on having a meal with you.

488
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,020
He's in the bathroom. Let's get out now.

489
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,150
Let's go.

490
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,390
Jiang Shiyan.

491
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,070
Tang Yang?

492
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,410
Where are they?

493
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,960
Peng Si.

494
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,690
- Mr. Feng.
- Where's Mr. Jiang?

495
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,920
He left with Ms. Tang

496
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,070
in a hurry.

497
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,170
Maybe it's an emergency.

498
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,650
What about Cheng Hui?

499
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,000
Mr. Cheng left in a hurry

500
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,990
two hours ago.

501
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,310
He also seemed to have an emergency.

502
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,260
They all have emergencies?

503
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,340
Why didn't they tell me?

504
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,850
I'll go to work.

505
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,960
Sorry,

506
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,960
the subscriber you dialed
is not answered for the moment,

507
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,610
- He didn't answer my call.
- please dial again later.

508
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,610
Maybe we should take this.

509
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,340
Okay, or he'll keep calling us.

510
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,000
Hello.

511
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,400
I've told you

512
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,550
I can't come today.

513
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,030
I have an emergency.

514
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,170
I can't leave.

515
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,990
I'm not driving.

516
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,210
Jiang Shiyan gave me a ride.

517
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,610
Yes. I can't come today.

518
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,600
Tomorrow? Haven't I told you

519
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,100
I'll catch a train early in the morning?

520
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,680
By the way, don't call Jiang Shiyan.

521
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,650
He's driving.

522
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,680
Bye.

523
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,500
No one can bother us now.

524
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,980
It's so strange to look at you

525
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,740
this close.

526
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,710
Your eyes,

527
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,130
nose, and mouth

528
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,690
are all strange.

529
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,650
Didn't you say

530
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,980
we should

531
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,740
try something new?

532
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,550
What is it?

533
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,610
Follow me.

534
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,550
So, the thing

535
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,710
you haven't done

536
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,060
is to pack for me?

537
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,800
What else could it be?

538
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,710
The four of us

539
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,960
traveled together,

540
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,740
but each of us would pack our own stuff.

541
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,240
I've never packed things

542
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,130
for you.

543
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,310
But there's not much

544
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,880
you can do about it.

545
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,000
Who told you? I good at

546
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,100
packing stuff.

547
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,510
You speak, and I work.

548
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,340
I'll pack and fold

549
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,400
everything you tell me

550
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,020
and put it in your suitcase.
I won't let you down.

551
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,100
Okay. Hurry up.

552
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,780
Where's the storage bag?

553
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,100
It's in the middle
of the drawer over there.

554
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,170
The bottom...

555
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,270
You must be thirsty.

556
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,450
I'll get a cup of water for you.

557
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,870
Sir.

558
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,230
Sorry,

559
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,840
our chef gets off at nine.

560
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,790
Shall we start

561
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,130
to serve the dishes?

562
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,720
Okay.

563
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,350
Have you finished?

564
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,720
Except for skincare

565
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,850
cosmetic products.

566
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,300
I can do that.

567
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,170
Can you?

568
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,760
Of course.

569
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,260
How do you know what I'm going to take?

570
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,020
Just tell me, and I'll remember it.

571
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,450
Then I need

572
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,070
a night cream,

573
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,920
a facial cream

574
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
a facial cleaner,

575
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,160
a serum,

576
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,600
a box of overnight masks​​,

577
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,790
a box of daily masks,

578
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,020
and a box of soft masks.

579
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,750
As for cosmetic products,

580
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,960
I need lipstick,

581
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,250
eyeliner pencils, eyeshadow palettes,

582
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:01,980
mascaras,

583
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,240
bro trimmers...

584
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,870
I suddenly realized
I needed to drink some water.

585
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,130
...blushers as well.

586
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,820
(Sheng Nina)

587
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,820
(Cheng Hui)

588
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,920
Hello, Miss.

589
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,960
Can I help you?

590
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,890
I had a reservation.

591
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,680
Sorry, Miss, our restaurant

592
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,520
is closed.

593
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,030
Closed?

594
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,210
- Yes.
- It's...

595
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,580
Thanks.

596
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,800
You're here.

597
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,690
You haven't left.

598
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,450
Sorry, I...

599
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,550
Did you eat?

600
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,390
I ate all the food

601
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,740
for both of us.

602
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,060
No waste.

603
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,310
Okay.

604
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,650
But I saved the wine for you.

605
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,000
Have a seat.

606
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,980
Hello, I'd like
two bowls of braised pork noodles.

607
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,210
- Okay. Wait for a second.
- Two bowls?

608
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,000
You just ate all the food.

609
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,840
Aren't you full?

610
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,920
I was,

611
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,760
but

612
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,130
I can eat more now.

613
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,980
Impressive.

614
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,310
Come on.

615
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,200
Have a drink.

616
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,980
Now?

617
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,370
There's no bottle opener.

618
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,590
I'll ask my driver

619
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,470
to send one.

620
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,310
No need.

621
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,040
Can I borrow your scarf?

622
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,110
Okay.

623
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,340
You can do that?

624
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,240
Let me see.

625
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,740
Where did you learn it?

626
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Food sharing posts

627
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,130
on Yixiu Found of Food.

628
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,720
Wait a minute.

629
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,270
Hello, can I get two bowls?

630
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,390
Okay.

631
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,150
Here.

632
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,800
Come on.

633
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,610
Here's to...

634
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,890
the first time I drink wine with a bowl.

635
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,300
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

636
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,500
I've got a feeling

637
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,400
that at least three bowls of wine

638
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,210
can get it started.

639
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,780
Then another one.

640
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,520
Come on.

641
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,260
The noodles are ready.

642
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,630
Thanks.

643
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,520
Thanks.

644
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,400
It smells good.

645
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,130
Eat it while it's hot.

646
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,930
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

647
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,610
- It's good.
- Good?

648
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,310
Wipe your mouth.

649
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,650
Did you pay?

650
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,650
I was going to treat you to a meal,

651
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,630
and you've paid twice.

652
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,210
Now I owe you three meals.

653
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,430
Then...

654
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,650
you'll treat me three times.

655
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,460
Okay. Deal.

656
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,560
Deal.

657
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,120
It's here.

658
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,940
Then I'm leaving.

659
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,650
Okay. Rest early.

660
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,310
- Bye.
- Bye.

661
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,390
Tomorrow...

662
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,860
If you want to eat together,

663
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,650
I'll be free.

664
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,170
But I'm going to
fly to Beijing tomorrow.

665
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,590
I have a commercial event there

666
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,610
on Monday.

667
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,870
Okay.

668
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,130
I'll be waiting for you.

669
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,900
Be safe.

670
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,560
I'm leaving.

671
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,770
I'll pick you up at 10:00 a.m.

672
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,690
Can I get a goodbye kiss?

673
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,840
You're getting

674
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,380
more and more shameless, aren't you?

675
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,810
Of course.

676
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,480
I've learned from you,

677
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,290
Feng Weiran and Jiang Yanan's arguments

678
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,900
for more than ten years.

679
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,500
Of course I've improved myself.

680
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,250
Okay. Just go back.

681
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,510
Let go of my hand.

682
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,290
I can't close the door.

683
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,650
I want to, but

684
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,830
it doesn't.

685
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,110
It doesn't?

686
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,980
What's wrong with you?

687
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,560
I'm asking you.

688
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,500
Tell me.

689
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,510
Louder.

690
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,800
I got it.

691
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,730
What did it say?

692
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,230
It said it put a gift for you

693
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,580
on the table next to the sofa,

694
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,860
and you should get it.

695
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,990
What is it?

696
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,900
See for yourself.

697
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,770
Bye. Good night.

698
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,310
Good night.

699
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,730
Be Safe.

700
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,340
(Hero)

701
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,610
Did you look for it on purpose?

702
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,920
I found someone

703
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,290
who collects pens on the internet

704
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,540
and saw a pen that looked
just like your old pen,

705
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,650
so I talked to him

706
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,580
and bought it.

707
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,590
Do you still remember it

708
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,580
after all these years?

709
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,800
Of course.

710
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,380
I remember everything about you.

711
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,610
Feng Weiran, don't run!

712
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,240
You...

713
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,480
Feng Weiran, can you stop?

714
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,770
It's the classroom. Don't...

715
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,760
Move!

716
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,330
Feng Weiran, what's wrong with you?

717
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,440
Sorry.

718
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,400
It's just a pen.

719
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,550
I'll buy you another one tomorrow.

720
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,690
You know nothing.

721
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,630
It's already broken.

722
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,980
- I'll buy a new...
- Shut up!

723
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,030
Hey, Yang.

724
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,100
Why are you making it such a big deal?

725
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,720
Yang.

726
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,730
Are you still angry at him?

727
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,720
No.

728
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,060
I won't talk to him anymore.

729
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,170
Don't be angry.

730
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,280
He broke your pen.

731
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,540
I'll pay for him.

732
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,160
No.

733
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,770
It's a nice pen.

734
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,500
It's a Parker. It doesn't leak.

735
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,760
My grandmother gave me

736
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,810
that pen.

737
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,170
She went to college in the 1950s.

738
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,720
It was very difficult for them

739
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,500
to get into college at that time.

740
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,000
That was the pen

741
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,940
she used.

742
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,280
It's been kept well

743
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,540
with no damages.

744
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,330
She died last year.

745
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,980
She left me this pen

746
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,860
to bless me
to get into a good university.

747
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,110
I've kept this pen

748
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,580
as my lucky charm.

749
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,420
Now it's broken.

750
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,210
Stupid Feng Weiran.

751
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,690
Yang.

752
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,480
No matter what happens,

753
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
you'll definitely

754
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,500
get into your dream university,

755
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,730
and you'll get perfect scores.

756
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,130
You have my word.

757
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,610
How do you know?

758
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,540
Do you remember
the wish bottle you gave me?

759
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,060
I write a note every day

760
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,800
to wish that you can

761
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,860
go to your dream school.

762
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,670
I fold them into stars

763
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,770
and put them in the bottle.

764
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,380
There have been over 60 stars.

765
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,510
I did the calculation.

766
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,050
When the College Entrance Examination
comes,

767
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:49,980
you'll have 100 lucky stars.

768
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,730
Look how sincere I am.

769
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,940
Your dream will come true.

770
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,210
You're a big idiot.

771
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,550
You should've made wishes

772
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,210
for your dream university.

773
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,390
I did.

774
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
I made two lucky stars

775
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,710
for Feng Wei and me

776
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,550
and put them in.

777
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,540
One for each?

778
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,420
That's not enough.

779
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,000
You're not sincere at all.

780
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,290
You should've made more.

781
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,190
I can help you.

782
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,460
That's more efficient.

783
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,160
Okay.

784
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,810
Come on, help me.

785
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,510
Let's go.

786
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,510
Give me the pen,

787
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,550
and I'll ask someone to repair it.

788
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,460
Maybe it'll work.

789
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,170
Use this one for now.

790
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,200
No.
