I've been working on this matter.

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,690
And these.

29
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,530
See?

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,720
Tang Yang.

31
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,890
Come here.

32
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,910
This is my senior Zhou Mo.

33
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,320
This is Jiang Shiyan,

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,360
my high school classmate

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,740
and also my best buddy.

36
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,190
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

37
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,280
Buddy?

38
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,830
Yeah. We are sworn brothers.

39
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,850
- Sit down, please.
- Take a seat.

40
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,220
I am her best friend.

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,850
We are now dealing
with the Converge Business Bank

42
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,920
and also Jiansheng.

43
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,180
This number.

44
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,510
If they are unwilling,

45
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,160
it's unlikely to reach one billion.

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,620
So guess a smaller number.

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,130
Ten million?

48
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,410
Much smaller.

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,130
- 1000?
- 1,000.

50
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,270
Oh my goodness.

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,970
It's 1,000.

52
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,810
If

53
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,130
Pengxing wants to save Boxing,

54
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,290
it has to find a few more backers.

55
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,240
I don't think

56
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,090
the others will agree.

57
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,600
So I don't dare to offend any party.

58
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,950
I can only choose one side.

59
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,410
If I cooperate with Pengxing,

60
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,570
the pool is just a bit small.

61
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,410
200 million.

62
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,740
You guys

63
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,730
chat about 200 billion

64
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,270
as easy as 2,000.

65
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,430
I forgot to introduce.

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
Mr. Jiang works in the media industry.

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,670
He's the founder of Yi Xiu Gourmet.

68
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,570
Yes, I am also the CEO.

69
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,410
Yes.

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,270
My senior Zhou Mo

71
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,410
used to do risk management

72
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,690
at the Converge Business Bank.

73
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,320
Now he is working as a CEO

74
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,060
in Jiujing Investment.

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,900
Jiujiang Investment is the one

76
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,060
that separated from Jiujiang Property,
isn't it?

77
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,670
- Yes.
- Do you know about that?

78
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,160
I met Ms. Wei

79
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,600
at an entrepreneur summit.

80
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
- She mentioned it.
- Is that so?

81
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,460
Yes.

82
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,510
Do you know who Wei Changqiu approached

83
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,990
before me

84
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,280
to take over Jiujiang Investment?

85
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,410
Who is it?

86
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,010
When we were in graduate school,

87
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,690
the teacher who taught us modern finance

88
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,410
and modern financial practices.

89
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,300
It's hard to avoid getting involved.

90
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,050
- Drink some water.
- And then it was left unsettled.

91
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,640
But the teacher
is under too much pressure.

92
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,150
Put crab sticks in the hot pot?

93
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,760
If they continued to investigate…

94
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,900
Actually, you know

95
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,010
the weight of an official position
can crush people.

96
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,850
So…

97
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,110
I also went there at that time.

98
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,900
I was not here at that time.

99
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,950
If I were here, I would
have gone too.

100
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,240
Feng Weiran are nearby,

101
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,480
looking for a place to eat.

102
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,740
If you don't mind,

103
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,860
I will ask him to come over
and eat together.

104
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,670
Oh my god. That's terrifying.

105
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,740
Pardon?

106
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,210
Is it OK?

107
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,950
OK. Clear soup is OK.

108
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,130
So you know…

109
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,620
I know you work
in Credit Audit Division.

110
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,580
(Xiaobei Soup, Jiang Shiyan)
Emergency! Come quickly.

111
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,510
- Fine.
- No matter what,

112
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,710
it depends on who the partners are

113
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,780
and whether they are reliable.

114
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,540
Exactly.

115
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,640
Do you still remember that teacher?

116
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,710
Yes. He's a good teacher.

117
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,210
I remember

118
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,050
he is quite kind.

119
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,390
I did not expect this to happen.

120
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,830
How is he doing now?

121
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,780
What's going on?

122
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,050
Jiang Shiyan sent a message,
saying "Emergency!

123
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,890
Come quickly."

124
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,870
But he doesn't answer the phone.

125
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,730
Come on.

126
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,970
I simmered the soup for two hours.

127
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,080
I didn't have time to drink.

128
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
Don't lose your temper.

129
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,650
Let's just play it by ear

130
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,510
when we get there.

131
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,720
Fine.

132
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,650
Honey,

133
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,630
have you ever felt

134
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,390
this person looks very familiar?

135
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,710
He's like….

136
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,510
- Cheng Hui.
- Cheng Hui.

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,280
Honey,

138
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,090
have you noticed

139
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,170
that Cheng Hui always manages

140
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,420
to take a different path from others?

141
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,580
His mind

142
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,310
is quite extraordinary.

143
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,420
(Xiaobei Soup)

144
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,280
Let me take a look.

145
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,630
Do you like my new manicure?

146
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,090
They have grown out.

147
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,100
You can go change it tomorrow.

148
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,780
No. I just posted these pearls.

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,580
Change to a better one.

150
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,850
Cheng Hui.

151
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,150
What are you doing here?

152
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,310
Why don't you go in?

153
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,530
Inside,

154
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,580
the situation is very strange.

155
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,110
What does it mean?

156
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,010
How strange?

157
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,460
There is a man I don't know.

158
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,310
It is crowded, isn't it?

159
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,440
No, it's not.

160
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,660
Come on, Yang.

161
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,220
You sit here.

162
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,460
We sit separately by gender.

163
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,690
Let's squeeze in, come on.

164
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,540
- Just bear with it.
- OK.

165
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Come and have a seat.

166
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,800
Come on.

167
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,340
Yanan, here.

168
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,410
Waiter.

169
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,310
Add three more sets of tableware.

170
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
OK.

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,120
Take a seat.

172
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,870
Put some crispy meat in.

173
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,540
Seems a bit crowded.

174
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,950
Look. We can all sit down.

175
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,870
It is indeed a bit crowded.

176
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,880
You three sit.

177
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,830
It's OK for me to squat.

178
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,440
What about let my husband

179
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,310
sit here with me?

180
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,160
Can I?

181
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,610
Sure.

182
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,450
Thank you.

183
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,600
Come on.

184
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,750
Let me introduce you to each other.

185
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,830
This is Cheng Hui.

186
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
And Feng Weiran.

187
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,610
The three of us are good friends.

188
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,070
They are also my partners.

189
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,570
This is Jiang Yanan,

190
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,750
Feng Weiran's leader.

191
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,240
My wife.

192
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,390
This is

193
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,640
Yang's senior Zhou Mo,

194
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,220
the CEO

195
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,310
- of Jiujiang Investment.
- CEO?

196
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,570
- Hello, Mo.
- Hello, Mo.

197
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,630
Nice to meet you.

198
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,580
Come on. Let's eat.

199
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,960
What a coincidence today.

200
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,460
You also want to eat at this place.

201
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,980
Jiang Shiyuan asked us to come.

202
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,570
The traffic jam is terrible.

203
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,050
I think

204
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,020
gathering together is fate.

205
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
We have been friends with Yang

206
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,200
for more than a decade.

207
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,250
Yang's senior

208
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,460
is our senior.

209
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,760
I suggest

210
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,830
we raise our glasses

211
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,800
to toast to Mo.

212
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,390
Here. To Mo.

213
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,530
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

214
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,460
Nice to meet you.

215
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,970
I guess we're here to help Yang.

216
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,010
- I got it.
- Thank you.

217
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,370
- Here we go.
- Here, Mo.

218
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,870
- Thank you.
- Cheng Hui, eat more.

219
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,390
Are you single, Mo?

220
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,700
I'm sorry.

221
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,320
My wife is always like this.

222
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,290
I'm so sorry.

223
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,770
How can you directly ask him

224
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,180
such a private question?

225
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,350
How many years older are you
than Yang?

226
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,280
I am single,

227
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,390
three years older than Yang.

228
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,970
It is appropriate.

229
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,920
Yes, that's right.

230
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,940
It's good.

231
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,600
Mo,

232
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,350
what kind of girls do you like?

233
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,010
Beautiful? Excellent?

234
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:07,850
Or…

235
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,730
Excellent? Beautiful?

236
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,780
Are you meaning Tang Yang?

237
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,180
Great minds think alike.

238
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,410
From the time I met Tang Yang,

239
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,560
she never lacks suitors.

240
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,650
No, no, no.

241
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,570
That's nonsense.

242
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,800
I have never been pursued
by anyone.

243
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,820
How come I didn't know?

244
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,160
No one pursued me.

245
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,150
Did you pursue her?

246
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,170
I…

247
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,400
Yanan, you…

248
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,990
- Why are you laughing?
- You always laugh.

249
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,130
Did you?

250
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,010
You just laugh.

251
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,490
Why don't you speak?

252
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,900
- What do you think of her?
- Did you pursue her?

253
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,880
What are you doing?

254
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,560
You go ahead. I go

255
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,660
wash my hands and use the toilet.

256
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,680
Don't do this.

257
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,060
I'm joking.

258
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,020
Mo…

259
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,110
Many suitors.

260
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,230
Never lack suitors.

261
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,270
Did you pursue her?

262
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,660
Nonsense.

263
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,150
I am so silly.

264
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,610
Mom, you are really amazing!

265
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,180
You actually know Mr. Xu.

266
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,730
We have been wanting to send our son

267
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,970
to him to learn the piano.

268
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,920
If you need,

269
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,270
I'll try to help you
make an appointment.

270
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,120
Really?

271
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,400
I studied piano with him for ten years.

272
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,420
Ten years?

273
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,010
Mo had won the Gold Prize

274
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,780
of HSINGHAI CUP.

275
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,370
Really?

276
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,370
You are a hidden gem.

277
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,610
Yes.

278
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,490
If Mo doesn't work
in Changjiang and that stuff,

279
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,640
- he must be…
- Come on.

280
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,610
It's Jiujiang Investment.

281
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,730
She's just like that.

282
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,520
- Jiujiang Investment.
- I'm sorry.

283
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,730
Then he is now

284
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,020
a great pianist.

285
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,480
Here.

286
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

287
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,110
A05, check, please.

288
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,090
OK.

289
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,940
Sir, the amount is 988.

290
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,010
Add a box of mung bean cakes.

291
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,850
OK.

292
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,730
After adding a box of mung bean cakes,

293
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,750
it's 999.

294
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,780
(Tonight, jiu is everywhere.)
[*jiu: referring to Jiujiang Investment]

295
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,750
Cheers.

296
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,330
Thank you

297
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,730
for hanging in Yi Xiu a little longer.

298
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,730
As long as you leave there,

299
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,820
the future is bright.

300
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,080
The conditions

301
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,520
I have negotiated for everyone
in Youbei

302
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,630
are equally favorable.

303
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,400
As long as I have it,

304
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,920
you all have it.

305
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,280
Thank you, Yue Ya.

306
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,640
Everything is up to you.

307
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,230
- Right, it's up to you.
- It's up to you.

308
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,330
Meng, Bella,

309
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,630
you did very well this time.

310
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,540
Youbei is very satisfied with it.

311
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,800
Yi Xiu Gourmet

312
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,150
can't find any evidence.

313
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,020
Moreover, even if he found,

314
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,590
what can he do to you?

315
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,900
- Exactly.
- By the way, Yue Ya,

316
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,450
Sheng Nina

317
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,770
has been having some issues recently.

318
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,090
Yi Xiu Gourmet is in a state of chaos

319
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,350
right now.

320
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,250
How can Sheng Nina

321
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,640
compare with Yue Ya?

322
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,480
Am I right?

323
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,820
That's incomparable.

324
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,300
Don't say anything else.

325
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,420
He abandoned such a treasure like me

326
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,820
and let me go.

327
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,560
Then I'll make

328
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,150
Yi Xiu Gourmet live streaming

329
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,590
completely collapse.

330
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,460
(Xiaobei Soup)

331
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,900
- I'm so sorry, Mo.
- Are you full?

332
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,920
That's all right. I like

333
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,990
your friends very much.

334
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,150
They have a good personality.

335
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,610
Well, let's call it a day.

336
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,900
I'm just going to see a friend nearby.

337
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,130
- OK.
- See you.

338
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,450
Thank you for your hospitality,
Ms. Tang.

339
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,700
Don't mention it.

340
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,760
I'm going.

341
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,390
- Goodbye.
- Thanks for that, Mo.

342
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,780
Please take care of that matter.

343
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,090
What should we do now?

344
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,350
Go home or what?

345
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,520
Go to my house. The pomegranates
are ripe.

346
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,730
Let me share them with you.

347
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,650
Fine, I'd like some.

348
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,300
I'll go home and check some information.

349
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,810
Wait a moment.

350
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,760
You cannot leave.

351
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,640
You have to go with me.

352
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,140
- What's wrong?
- I have something to tell you.

353
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
- Fine.
- Let's go.

354
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,300
- Let's go.
- What do you want to tell me?

355
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,840
You eat so much. Are you not full?

356
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,680
Mind your own business.

357
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,820
(Xiaobei Soup)
You have eaten a lot.

358
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,600
Yang.

359
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,020
What do you think of Zhou Mo?

360
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,900
I think he's quite handsome.

361
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,020
If you think he's good,

362
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,820
you can catch him.

363
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,040
He is quite nice.

364
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,230
He also helped me a few times.

365
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,780
But

366
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,470
I don't like him.

367
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,730
You don't like him now.

368
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,350
It doesn't mean you won't like him
in the future.

369
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,180
Love can be cultivated.

370
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,660
Zhou Mo

371
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,020
seems

372
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,750
deeply affectionate and loyal.

373
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,600
Why didn't I

374
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,450
see these words written

375
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,510
on his forehead?

376
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,770
Yanan

377
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,890
just describes him.

378
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,040
Are you really going to check it out?

379
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,250
Jiang Shiyan, do you know the reason
why you are single?

380
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,780
- I roughly know.
- Talk more about it.

381
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,020
Zhou Mo definitely knows.

382
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,450
Zhou Mo is clearly

383
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,700
a refined

384
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,080
and well-read individual

385
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,590
who has experienced wind and frost.

386
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,920
I think you should divorce

387
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,760
Feng Weiran.

388
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,880
You!

389
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,990
Feng Weiran loves me so much.

390
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,120
Cheng Hui,

391
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,150
you're quite sensible.

392
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,610
You know that the shotgun is reserved
for my wife,

393
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,470
so you sit in the back.

394
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,560
I always sit in the back
when taking a taxi.

395
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,970
Cheng Hui, if you can't say
anything nice,

396
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,700
can you please shut your mouth?

397
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,150
You are a killjoy.

398
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,630
I think

399
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,020
Zhou Mo is a quite introverted person.

400
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,540
I posted a test in the group.

401
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,110
What test?

402
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,730
The other day I asked Cheng Hui

403
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,820
make a program.

404
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,680
Enter the names of two people

405
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,300
to test the fate between them.

406
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
There are numerous programs like this.

407
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,420
Why did you bother…

408
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,760
It's different.

409
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,520
These programs are mechanical.

410
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,270
By stroke order, birth year,
and zodiac sign.

411
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,350
But my program is a system-generated
random collapse.

412
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,490
Nothing special in appearance,

413
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,900
but a vast world inside.

414
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,280
- Almost.
- See.

415
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,290
(Rapport Index: 94)
My husband and me, 94.

416
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,800
Yang and me,

417
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,640
91.

418
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,160
Yang and me,

419
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,270
81.

420
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,750
93, Jiang Shiyan and me.

421
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,490
What about you, Yang?

422
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,450
I just tested the two of us.

423
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,610
(Rapport Index)
90.

424
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,850
Why are you testing me?

425
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,690
Test Zhou Mo.

426
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,050
I didn't test him.

427
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,420
- Test him.
- Test him.

428
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:55,960
- Quick.
- How many?

429
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,010
It must not be too high.

430
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,890
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

431
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,820
Hurry up.

432
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,070
(Tang Yang Zhou Mo Rapport Index)
93.

433
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,730
93. That's not correct.

434
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,660
See? You two are destined
to be together.

435
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,880
What about Jiang Shiyan?

436
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,330
- Test Jiang Shiyan.
- I'm telling you,

437
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,020
she has been friends with Jiang Shiyan
for so many years.

438
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,920
That must be higher than 99.

439
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,150
It's off the charts.

440
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,290
What are you talking about?

441
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,940
Cheng Hui made a program

442
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,130
testing the matching rate

443
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,150
between two people.

444
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,510
What about Yang and me?

445
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,520
Test it.

446
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,390
Test it.

447
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,620
It will be definitely high.

448
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,290
How many?

449
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,300
(Tang Yang Jiang Shiyan
Rapport Index 52)

450
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,300
52.

451
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,970
- So low.
- It failed.

452
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,130
This is ridiculously low.

453
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,160
52.

454
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,330
Your program has a bug, doesn't it?

455
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,600
It's impossible. Even if you have a bug,

456
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,760
it won't.

457
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,520
How could it be 52?

458
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,380
Too low.

459
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,850
I just give it algorithms.

460
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,730
I can't control

461
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,940
the randomness of collapse.

462
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,180
What does this mean?

463
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,730
The red string of fate

464
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,630
is tied between you and Zhou Mo's hands.

465
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,060
Yang,

466
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,660
actions speak louder than words.

467
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,940
Don't miss it when you pass by.

468
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,090
Listen to me.

469
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,040
This program

470
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,160
is randomly generated,

471
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,530
so I can also randomly choose

472
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,700
not to believe in this program.

473
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,690
Between Shiyan and me,

474
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,220
do we need to take a test?

475
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,560
Our friendship is as solid as gold.

476
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,490
We are as close as brothers,

477
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,460
willing to help each other

478
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,890
at all costs.

479
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,600
- What else?
- That's enough.

480
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,640
You guys say something. Quick.

481
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,480
Word chain?

482
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,240
You two are like Tom and Jerry.

483
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,280
Too uncultured.

484
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,350
You are like her shadow.

485
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,770
Oh my god.

486
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,180
You are really good
at growing pomegranates.

487
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,590
Oh my.

488
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,900
Let me tell you.

489
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,870
Look at these.

490
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,490
The purple-red ones are ripe.

491
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,260
- Take care.
- Eat them quickly.

492
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,900
And there are

493
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,920
green ones.

494
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,840
Just put an apple or a pear in

495
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,760
to ripen them.

496
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,700
Don't rush to eat.

497
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,920
What's wrong with you?

498
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,440
Not happy?

499
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,120
No.

500
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,800
Why do you look unhappy

501
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,360
tonight?

502
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,200
What's up?

503
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,220
I took pictures of you.

504
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,460
Do you know Zhou Mo?

505
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,440
No.

506
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,590
Do you understand him?

507
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,080
No.

508
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,500
What did you stand on his side?

509
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,080
I called you guys over.

510
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,800
It's because I couldn't stand him
hinting at Yang

511
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,700
openly and secretly.

512
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,500
Yang's mom has always been very pushy.

513
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,630
If she

514
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,840
impulsively decides

515
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,320
to try dating Zhou Mo

516
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,690
and Zhou Mo is not a good person,

517
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,690
aren't we

518
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,210
pushing Yang into the fire pit?

519
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,220
Can you live up to the kindness
that Yang has shown us?

520
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,800
Do you know Zhou Mo?

521
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,700
No.

522
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,930
Do you understand Zhou Mo?

523
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,790
No.

524
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,040
You don't know him at all.

525
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,930
Why do you think Zhou Mo
is not a good person?

526
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,290
What if Zhou Mo

527
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,800
is the true love of Yang?

528
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,120
What if

529
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,960
we help them

530
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,360
create a relationship

531
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,350
tonight?

532
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,400
Zhou Mo

533
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,410
can stand firm in this
fiercely competitive place.

534
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,520
Is he simple?

535
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,360
Yang was able

536
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,120
to rise to the position
of deputy director

537
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,320
of the Credit Audit Division,

538
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,930
the youngest one
at the Converge Business Bank,

539
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,170
within a few years

540
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,940
in such a competitive environment.

541
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,110
Is she simple?

542
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,420
Do you think

543
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,170
she is blind in love?

544
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,420
How is that possible?

545
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,800
I know

546
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,080
you are closer with Yang

547
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,590
than we.

548
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,860
You two have been through so many
ups and downs over the years.

549
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,040
But your horoscopes don't match.

550
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,010
- You don't match.
- I…

551
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,600
As soon as you meet, you start
teasing each other.

552
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,320
There is still Song Jing in the middle.

553
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,660
You can't have a secret crush
on each other, let alone be together.

554
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,220
Now Yang is going on a blind date.

555
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,320
As Yang's

556
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,550
most sincere

557
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,120
and intimate best friend,

558
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,800
shouldn't you

559
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,560
support her

560
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,040
to go out and meet more people,

561
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,210
boldly pursue

562
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,420
her own happiness?

563
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,520
Think about it carefully.

564
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,800
Your brain is really...

565
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,970
I really don't want to talk to you.

566
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:47,810
Honey.

567
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,980
What are you talking about?

568
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,080
We are saying

569
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,260
the best brothers are naturally
the best wingman.

570
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,550
Whose wingman?

571
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,880
That must be

572
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,930
our big brother,

573
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,030
Yang.

574
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,660
Who's the target?

575
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,730
Honey, where should we go this weekend?
[*weekend: referring to Zhou Mo]

576
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,970
Go

577
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,360
where we should go.

578
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,660
You two are so annoying.

579
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,390
- She's shy.
- She's shy.

580
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
Try this pomegranate.

581
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,740
Very sweet.

582
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,630
Not sweet at all.

583
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,690
I'll give Cheng Hui a ride on my way.

584
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,980
- We are leaving now.
- OK.

585
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,120
- Goodbye.
- Please be careful.

586
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,040
- Bye.
- We're going.

587
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,880
Goodbye.

588
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,900
Yang, I'll give you a ride.

589
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,450
No need for that.

590
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,450
I can take a taxi by myself.

591
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,590
It's too late. Let me drive you home.

592
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,600
Mrs. Jiang,

593
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,880
you are not sleeping.

594
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:39,870
I heard you.

595
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,960
Yang,

596
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,310
let Jiang Shiyan drive you home.

597
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,080
It's so late.

598
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,500
It's unsafe and wasteful to take a taxi.

599
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Anyway, he is idle all day
and doesn't do anything serious.

600
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,760
He is idle.

601
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,150
Anyway, I don't do anything serious

602
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,660
and I am idle.

603
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,260
Fine, let him drive me home.

604
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,440
Yang,

605
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,180
come and eat fish in a couple of days.

606
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,080
I recently developed a new formula.

607
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,070
It's absolutely delicious.

608
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,420
I will come to eat in a couple of days.

609
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,630
I go get the key. Wait for me.

610
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,600
OK.

611
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,570
Yang.

612
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,120
What's up?

613
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,570
By the way,

614
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,080
I've transferred the money for dinner

615
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
to you just now.

616
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,630
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

617
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,120
And

618
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,170
you called Feng Weiran there

619
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,700
on purpose, didn't you?

620
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,490
I…

621
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,770
Actually, I…

622
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,980
You are really smart.

623
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,460
No one knows me better than you.

624
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,250
I wasn't very familiar with Zhou Mo at first.

625
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,530
I think it might be a bit awkward

626
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,010
for the three of us to have a meal
together.

627
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,110
We don't know what to talk about.

628
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,930
You called Feng Weiran
and the others over.

629
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,760
The atmosphere suddenly heated up.

630
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,030
We had a great chat.

631
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,290
And I became familiar

632
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,740
with Zhou Mo.

633
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,600
Afterwards, if I have

634
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,970
a cooperation

635
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,260
or something else with him,

636
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,890
you must be

637
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,990
the first major contributor.

638
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,040
Something else?

639
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,880
Not important.

640
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,330
By the way,

641
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,730
my mom arranged me

642
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,080
some appointments this weekend.

643
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,170
Maybe I still need you

644
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,320
to help me.

645
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,500
Are you free this weekend?

646
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,740
Are you saying Saturday and Sunday?

647
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,770
Saturday and Sunday

648
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,070
is the weekend, right?

649
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,330
Are you free?

650
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,440
I'm busy.

651
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,870
Are you not available this weekend?

652
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,890
You don't have any plans
for the weekend.

653
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,260
(Natural Soul)
(Gentle breeze, picnic, sunshine)

654
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,440
Guys,

655
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,450
if Tang Yang

656
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,390
were here today,

657
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,690
would we have gathered

658
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,240
all the top swordsmen
from our finance school?

659
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,090
Yes.

660
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,200
Mr. Huo,

661
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,520
you still remember

662
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
our nickname.

663
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,360
Of course.

664
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,640
I heard Tang Yang
has just been transferred back.

665
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,920
She works at the Credit Audit Division

666
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,440
of the Converge Business Bank,
doesn't she?

667
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,830
I just had dinner with her a few days ago.

668
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,360
She has been busy working overtime
recently.

669
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,370
She is as busy as a bee.

670
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,120
When we just graduated,

671
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,940
we can still meet once a month.

672
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,940
Now everyone is busy.

673
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,120
She was transferred back this time.

674
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,800
Other roommates and I discussed

675
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,830
to give her a welcome party.

676
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,690
As a result, it was delayed
by trainings

677
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,840
or business trips.

678
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,830
We failed to make an appointment
after three attempts.

679
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,660
Did you share a dormitory with her?

680
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,840
Her parents used to be always out
before.

681
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,030
No one will bother her.

682
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,970
Every time we got together,

683
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,390
we all went to her house for hot pot.

684
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,970
She has a job now.

685
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,460
She doesn't live with her parents,
does she?

686
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,320
She bought a small house

687
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,520
in the high-tech zone.

688
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,690
It's closer to the bank

689
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,790
and convenient for work.

690
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,830
Her mom was a senior teacher.

691
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,650
She seemed to be a model worker

692
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,450
in our city.

693
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,260
She was allocated a house in the city
back then.

694
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,690
A house in the high-tech zone

695
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,790
is not cheap now.

696
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,930
Exactly.

697
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,180
You don't know it.

698
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,980
She has been buying it for over a year.

699
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,220
She was on rotation in another city
at that time.

700
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,390
She bought it when she came back
for the Chinese New Year.

701
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,970
She said that she will be back
eventually.

702
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,630
It is more cost-effective to buy
early than late.

703
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,170
It seems

704
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,490
that at that time their bank

705
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,560
had a special loan offer

706
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,700
for internal employees.

707
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,150
So she took out a loan to buy it.

708
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,450
However, she chose

709
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,890
a shortest duration.

710
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,290
She has to use more than half
of her salary

711
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,830
to repay the loan every month.

712
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,730
She said

713
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,790
she doesn't like being in debt.

714
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,070
As a result,

715
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,450
she even hesitated

716
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,970
to buy her favorite figurine,

717
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:58,840
thinking twice

718
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,870
before making the purchase.

719
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,350
She likes figurines?

720
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,940
She likes them very much.

721
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,690
She spent all the money she earned
from working

722
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,890
on this.

723
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,730
You don't know

724
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,870
her room is full of these.

725
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,070
Tang Yang is quite interesting.

726
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,260
Let me introduce you to each other.

727
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,760
This is Tang Yang.

728
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,170
She is the daughter

729
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,590
of Ms. Zhou dancing with us.

730
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,490
She is 29 this year.

731
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,970
She works at the bank.

732
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,120
She is

733
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,260
a top student with a PhD degree.

734
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,080
In the future,

735
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,170
she can arrange

736
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,120
finances

737
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,280
and insurance clearly.

738
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,170
She must be

739
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,590
a good helper.

740
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,110
This is Xue Yi.

741
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,390
33.

742
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,360
The captain of the Western Airlines.

743
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
His income is considerable.

744
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,280
No need to say it.

745
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,600
He has a good personality.

746
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,830
He also cooks well.

747
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,010
Marrying him

748
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,410
is really a win.

749
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,070
You are exaggerating.

750
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,080
Miss Tang is also very outstanding.

751
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,180
No, no, no.

752
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,500
Thank you for the compliment.

753
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,870
You guys continue.

754
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,350
I'll go take a look.

755
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,880
Miss Tang,

756
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,830
are you busy working at the bank?

757
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,260
What kind of work do you mainly do?

758
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:33,810
Not quite busy.

759
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,940
We all have cycles.

760
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,650
Sounds impressive!

761
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,790
It's just normal work, nothing special.

762
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,930
I heard that you…

763
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,700
Look. His appearance is good.

764
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,460
- Look.
- I am watching.

765
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,080
They are talking.

766
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,310
Yes, we also have cycles.

767
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,830
Handsome!

768
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,760
They look like a married couple,

769
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,900
don't they?

770
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,700
A little bit indeed.

771
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,850
Well,

772
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,310
he speaks gently.

773
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,310
His personality

774
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,360
will not be bad.

775
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,030
I have a hunch.

776
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,310
He is Yang's type.

777
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,460
- Mom, why didn't my alarm clock go off?
- Not bad.

778
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,570
Ms. Zhou.

779
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,530
My alarm clock…

780
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,170
This is the weekend.

781
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,210
Why do you need it?

782
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,690
The alarm rang once but you didn't
wake up.

783
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,530
I just turned it off.

784
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,220
Come and take a look.

785
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,790
Ms. Zhou and I

786
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,690
arranged a blind date to Yang.

787
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,550
Take a look.

788
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,010
From the perspective of a man,

789
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,890
you talk about him.

790
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,000
He is a captain.

791
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,800
I have urgent matters to attend to,
so I have to leave now.

792
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,650
- Come on.
- Let him go.

793
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,220
(SYKO)

794
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,200
Miss Tang,

795
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,030
do you like to travel usually?

796
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,390
Yes, I do.

797
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,050
Pretty good.

798
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,210
This coffee

799
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,550
seems to have cooled down.

800
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,290
Is that so?

801
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,150
Miss Tang, by the way,

802
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,940
what zodiac sign are you?

803
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,590
I am a Pisces.

804
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,540
(One message)

805
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,600
Just a moment.

806
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,570
It's OK.

807
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,370
(Jiang Shiyan)
Assistance is ready.

808
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,570
Miss Tang,

809
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,460
do you have something to do later?

810
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,760
Yes, I

811
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,650
am a bit busy.

812
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,890
I have a meeting later

813
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,740
and a date.

814
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,360
I happened to drive today.

815
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,930
How about I drive you there in a while?

816
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,740
No need. I'll wait here for the others.

817
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,400
Miss Tang,

818
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,900
then I won't bother you.

819
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,870
OK.

820
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,960
Nice to meet you.

821
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,090
Nice to meet you.

822
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,900
Miss Tang, then I will leave first.

823
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,880
OK.

824
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,840
I worked in a securities firm
for several years before.

825
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,450
Later, I resigned and went
to a large company.

826
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,660
Generally speaking,

827
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,140
we can consider ourselves colleagues.

828
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,350
Miss Tang,

829
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,450
you look very good.

830
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,900
I can tell at a glance
that you are my type.

831
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,550
Gentle and virtuous.

832
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,030
In the future,

833
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,970
you must be very good
at taking care of people.

834
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,840
Is that so?

835
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,590
I think we can deepen our understanding.

836
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,310
Miss Tang, why don't we chat more
about you?

837
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,120
What are your hobbies?

838
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,310
Excuse me. Is this Tang Yang?

839
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,800
Yes, may I ask who you are?

840
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,640
Hello.

841
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,690
I was introduced to you for a date

842
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,530
by my family.

843
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,010
- Blind date?
- Yes.

844
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,850
Blind date.

845
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,880
Well,

846
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,590
he is the one in front of you.

847
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,320
Do you come too early?

848
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,160
Is that so?

849
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,280
There are five minutes left.

850
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,690
I'll wait a little longer.

851
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,010
OK.

852
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,080
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

853
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,110
- You guys go ahead.
- OK.

854
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,490
If I finish the date with him,
I will let you know.

855
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,450
It's OK. Just ignore him.

856
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,630
Let's continue chatting.

857
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,150
We just talked

858
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,420
about hobbies, right?

859
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,440
Miss Tang,

860
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,730
since your schedule is so full,

861
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,450
I won't delay any longer, goodbye.

862
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,940
We just talked about hobbies, right?

863
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,900
What a pity.

864
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,460
You are going?

865
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,290
Goodbye.

Oh my. I…

890
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,490
My nose is itchy.

891
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,830
Did I rub too much?

892
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,790
I seem to want to sneeze,

893
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,350
but I can't.

894
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,520
I feel like

895
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,740
my rhinitis is acting up today.

896
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,740
Your nose is all scratched up.

897
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,150
It is definitely red anyway.

898
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,900
Of course. 11 persons!

899
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,490
11 persons!

900
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,070
- Can't you just have two less?
- 11!

901
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,350
That can't be less.

902
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,310
Ms. Zhou set KPI warning.

903
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,660
She is watching me. You know?

904
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,660
After working for a day,

905
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,170
the extras have a boxed meal
to eat at least.

906
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,080
After working for a day,

907
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,980
I receive a warning.

908
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,110
I am a free labor.

909
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,360
You can have a boxed meal if you want.

910
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,410
I will take you to Ms. Zhou's house

911
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,350
to get a free meal.

912
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,660
You go to Ms. Zhou's house?

913
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,790
I need to report to my superiors

914
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,760
about today's situation

915
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,970
and seek guidance

916
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,220
on the next steps.

917
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,880
Let's go for a free meal.

918
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,920
Let's go.

919
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,650
I don't know what delicious food
Ms. Zhou has made today.

920
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,220
It must be shredded potatoes.

921
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,530
You know this?

922
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,940
It's shredded potatoes every time.

923
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,740
- Let's go.
- Wait a moment.

924
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,420
I don't think we can go in together.

925
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,440
What's wrong?

926
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,410
If the two of us go upstairs together,

927
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,730
they might discover

928
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,010
that we teamed up

929
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,190
and messed up the blind dates.

930
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,730
That's right.

931
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,440
Let's do this.

932
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:57,890
You go upstairs first.

933
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,490
I walk around the neighborhood.

934
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,830
Then I'll go upstairs. Let's split up.

935
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,830
Wait a moment. Your logic
is not correct.

936
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,250
- Why is it not correct?
- This is your home.

937
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,220
Sure, you go upstairs first.

938
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,210
Then I pretend to call you.

939
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,050
You turn on the speaker

940
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,630
and I will ask you out for dinner.

941
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,660
Ms. Zhou will definitely say,

942
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:12,810
"Shiyan,

943
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,940
I have made dishes at home.

944
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,110
Come over for dinner."

945
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,200
And then what?

946
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,120
Then I will say,

947
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,500
"It's too troublesome."

948
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,170
Ms. Zhou will definitely say,

949
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,890
"We are so close. It's not troublesome.

950
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,730
Come over for dinner."

951
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,490
Your plan

952
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,980
is perfect.

953
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,730
Go quickly.

954
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,850
20 seconds.

955
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,740
Ms. Zhou.

956
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,500
You're back.

957
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:45,810
How is it going?

958
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,180
Is there anyone you like?

959
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,220
How's it going today?

960
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,700
It's…

961
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,770
Hello?

962
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,590
Go out for a meal?

963
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,220
I can't. I just got home. I'm so tired.

964
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,460
Near our house?

965
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,310
I'm too lazy to go downstairs.

966
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,660
You know.

967
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,550
Who is it? Shiyan?

968
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,930
I have made dishes at home.

969
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:13,910
Ask him come over to eat.

970
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,510
Ms. Zhou asked you to come up
and have dinner.

971
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:19,690
Ms. Zhou,

972
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,630
no need. It's troublesome.

973
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,600
Nothing to be sorry about.

974
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,450
We are so close.

975
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,290
Come upstairs.

976
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,210
Come on have dinner.

977
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,150
Shiyan, don't…

978
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,410
Yang, you do it.

979
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,080
- It's fine, Ms. Zhou.
- You're so polite.

980
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,950
You sit down.

981
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,000
Yang…

982
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:41,860
So fragrant!

983
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,160
- Shiyan.
- Dad.

984
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,000
Mr. Tang.

985
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,000
Where did you go?

986
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,110
Why did you come back so late?

987
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,820
I just worked out.

988
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,990
Work out?

989
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,150
You just took a walk downstairs,
didn't you?

990
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,770
Taking a walk is also a form
of exercise.

991
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,700
Fine.

992
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,050
I just saw you two are together

993
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,030
downstairs.

994
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,700
Why did you come up alone, Yang?

995
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,240
Shiyan came up

996
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,400
after you.

997
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,680
Is there something wrong between you?

998
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,770
Dad, hurry up and wash your hands.

999
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,050
We're all waiting for you to have dinner.

1000
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,820
Fine, wash my hands.

1001
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,410
- Hurry up!
- Wash hands before eating.

1002
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,340
You finally come back.

1003
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,340
I was thinking that if you didn't
come back,

1004
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,150
we wouldn't wait for you anymore.

1005
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,040
Take a seat.

1006
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,380
How is it? Is it delicious?

1007
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,150
Smells good.

1008
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,300
Shiyan,

1009
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,120
next time, just come straight up
to my place

1010
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,330
when you're nearby.

1011
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,490
I never stand on ceremony

1012
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,630
when I visit your house with Yang.

1013
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,290
Why are you being so polite to me?

1014
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,330
Yeah, don't be so polite to us.

1015
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,330
Although my dishes

1016
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,150
are not as good as your mom's,

1017
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,820
they're edible.

1018
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,210
Ms. Zhou,

1019
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,260
my mom cooks with a lot of oil and salt.

1020
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,470
You pay special attention
to diet collocation.

1021
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,820
Take this Mapo Tofu for example.

1022
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,770
Salty with a hint of sweetness,

1023
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,590
sweet with a hint of spice.

1024
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,180
Based on my speculation,

1025
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,370
Ms. Zhou must have mistaken sugar

1026
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,590
for salt.

1027
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,160
After she realized it,

1028
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,430
she added salt generously again,

1029
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,740
trying to bring back that taste.

1030
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:21,850
Yang,

1031
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,200
between these blind dates

1032
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,340
I arranged for you,

1033
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,370
there was some free time.

1034
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,720
How could a time conflict occur?

1035
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,000
It's hard to say.

1036
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,410
I chat with some people
for a longer time,

1037
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,530
and with others for a shorter time.

1038
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,590
It's not so punctual.

1039
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,850
Yang, have you been going on blind dates
all day today?

1040
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,000
Yes.

1041
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,990
No pain, no gain.

1042
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,160
It's really hard.

1043
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,000
It's hard.

1044
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,470
What are you talking about?

1045
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,640
What do you mean
by disciplining my daughter?

1046
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
A blind date

1047
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,300
does not mean a committed relationship.

1048
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,040
Are you OK?

1049
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,490
Making several friends

1050
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,970
is normal.

1051
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,260
My daughter

1052
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,080
is independent, elegant, charming,

1053
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,600
generous, intelligent, and kind.

1054
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,930
You are not qualified

1055
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,970
to criticize her.

1056
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,810
That's right.

1057
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,380
Whatever.

1058
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,550
It's as if without this group,

1059
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,780
my daughter won't be able
to get married.

1060
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,920
That's right.

1061
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,330
I quit.

1062
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,360
Here.

1063
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,360
I support you.

1064
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,260
Sometimes,

1065
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,370
this kind of blind date groups

1066
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,450
are not necessary.

1067
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,330
Fate is something

1068
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,290
that no one can predict.

1069
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,860
Blind dates are not necessary.

1070
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,280
Sometimes it's fast, sometimes
it's slow.

1071
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,560
Sometimes it's right beside me.

1072
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,550
I need to go find it.

1073
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,030
Yang, don't worry.

1074
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,700
I only leave one group.

1075
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,700
There are nine more blind date groups.

1076
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,110
What's wrong, Shiyan?

1077
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,560
I can't believe it.

1078
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,380
This dish is so delicious!

1079
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,720
Come on, eat more if it's delicious.

1080
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,040
- Thank you, Mr. Tang.
- Eat more.

1081
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,410
Come on. Have more.

1082
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,600
No worries. I

1083
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,510
always have a way out in whatever I do.

1084
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,380
Yang, you eat.

1085
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,010
Ms. Zhou, you've worked hard today.

1086
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,200
Come on. Let me help you relax.

1087
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,040
OK.

1088
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,610
Yang,

1089
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,080
you take the fruits

1090
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,260
to your dad and mom.

1091
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,040
Let me wash the dishes.

1092
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,160
What do you mean?

1093
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,300
This is my home.

1094
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,200
You bring it over. I'll wash them.

1095
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,930
It's fine. Let me do it.
No need to be polite.

1096
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,040
There're just several bowls.

1097
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,080
I'm willing to help my brother.

1098
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,430
- Here?
- Yes.

1099
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,390
Sure.

1100
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,250
Be gentle.

1101
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,110
Open.

1102
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,520
This action, look.

1103
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,430
Twist.

1104
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,550
Here we go. Let's eat fruits.

1105
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,510
Yang, you take a look.

1106
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,510
I feel like my waist has gotten
a bit thicker recently.

1107
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,180
Stop that. I'm going to cook something.

1108
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,550
Drink some wormwood water.

1109
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,520
Honey,

1110
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,200
do you know where the pot is?

1111
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,030
The one I usually use to cook wormwood.

1112
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,340
The black one

1113
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,660
with blue words and white flowers.

1114
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,110
The black one with blue words
and white flowers?

1115
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,430
Yang, do you know where it is?

1116
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:56,930
Mom,

1117
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,600
in the past few years,

1118
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,770
I came back three times every year.

1119
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,970
How could I possibly know

1120
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,180
where your pot is?

1121
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,300
Ms. Zhou, it is here.

1122
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,290
I found it.

1123
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,860
Yes, that's the one.

1124
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,890
When I came with my mom before,

1125
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,910
I remember I put it here.

1126
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,630
Yes, that's the pot.

1127
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,380
Where is my herbal medicine bag?

1128
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,700
Shiyan, it is the one you prescribed
for me.

1129
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,400
Let me think.

1130
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:19,770
Here it is.

1131
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,550
Be careful.

1132
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,780
Great!

1133
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,180
It's time to get rid of dampness.

1134
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,590
My waist can feel more comfortable.

1135
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,120
We unanimously decided

1136
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,470
to leave the biggest and sweetest piece
for you.

1137
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
I personally decided to leave

1138
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,890
the biggest and sweetest for you.

1139
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,990
Come on. Give me some face.

1140
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,340
The last piece.

1141
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,740
You cleaned up so neatly.

1142
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,210
Later,

1143
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,720
as long as you need,

1144
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,260
I will spare no effort to praise you.

1145
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,470
I thank you in advance.

1146
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,260
You're welcome. Wash this bowl.

1147
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,220
Let me do something, too.

1148
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,430
Where should this be placed?

1149
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,430
- Here.
- OK.

1150
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,480
Shiyan,

1151
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,180
I have to talk to you

1152
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,740
about you and Yang.

1153
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,960
What's the matter?

1154
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,260
In the future,

1155
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,520
when seeing Yang

1156
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,590
outside,

1157
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,180
don't call her

1158
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,780
Bro.

1159
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,490
If she turned all her blind dates

1160
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,740
into brothers,

1161
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,260
just like you two,

1162
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,590
this is a big issue.

1163
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:33,850
Here.

1164
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,630
It's not easy.

1165
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,380
- Enough?
- Enough.

1166
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,660
It can be cut like this.

1167
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,470
I have never seen this way
of cutting before.

1168
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,430
Cut along this white line.

1169
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,700
Cut along this membrane.

1170
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,920
Yes.

1171
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,480
Pat it.

1172
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,430
Gently, gently, gently.

1173
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,950
It's going to be juiced.

1174
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,780
- This is too convenient.
- Yes.

1175
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,080
When I was eating pomegranate before,

1176
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,810
I always felt too troublesome.

1177
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,150
That's a great method.

1178
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,380
This is my unique method.

1179
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,360
Try it.

1180
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:00,730
Cool.

1181
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,910
This teaches us a lesson.

1182
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,010
Just like methodology

1183
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,370
we learned in a political science class.

1184
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,260
When you do something,

1185
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,630
you need to find methods.

1186
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:12,780
For example,

1187
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,550
if you are doing mathematics…

1188
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,890
Just like doing math and physics papers.

1189
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,150
I knew you would say that.

1190
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,080
After eating the pomegranate, I'll

1191
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,300
do the papers again.

1192
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,150
I strive to get into the same university
as you.

1193
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,080
Why are you so persistent

1194
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,260
to go to same university with me?

1195
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,150
You decided to take the entrance exam
for CUFE.

1196
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,990
Feng Weiran told me

1197
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,030
if I didn't go to the same university as you,

1198
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,240
there may be someone to replace me

1199
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,720
and become your most trusted
henchman.

1200
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,630
How can that be possible?
I can't let him succeed.
