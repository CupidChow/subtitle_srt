32
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,020
I sent the bank's

33
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,210
inquiry letter two weeks ago.

34
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,020
No need to send it again.

35
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,090
Just a moment.

36
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,900
The current disagreement lies

37
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,580
in the recognition of overdue payments.

38
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,930
Yes, I confirmed it myself.

42
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,740
Come on, sit.

43
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,770
What are you reading?

44
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,930
Tagore's poems.

45
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,930
Very few students of our major read it.

46
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,930
Running models

47
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,250
makes my head hurt.

48
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,180
I came out to relax.

49
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,260
Don't work today?

50
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,260
An evening shift.

51
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,930
Why do you always
have the evening shift?

52
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,490
There are classes during the day.

53
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,810
Just borrowed it

54
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,930
(Stray)
from the library?

55
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,750
Right, how did you know?

56
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,660
It's written there.

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,630
You used to borrow this book too?

58
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,020
(Zhou Mo)

59
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,540
Like which poem?

60
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,240
I just started reading it.

61
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,310
Have you finished it?

62
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,400
Many people start reading Tagore's work

63
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,030
because they like that line:

64
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,310
Let life be beautiful
like summer flowers

65
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,350
And Death like autumn leaves.

66
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,770
That's the only line

67
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,160
I can recite.

68
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,420
There's another poem

69
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,030
that's beautiful.

70
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,250
Which one?

71
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,460
Whenever I hear old chronicles of love,

72
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,460
it's age-old pain.

73
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,060
It's ancient tale

74
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,780
of being apart or together.

75
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,260
As I stare on and on into the past,

76
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,500
in the end you emerge.

77
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,020
Clad in the light of a pole-star

78
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,700
piercing the darkness of time.

79
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,380
You slowly,

80
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,700
yet gracefully,
came to me.

81
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,420
(Piercing the darkness of time.
You slowly, yet gracefully, came to me.)

82
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,340
What's the name of this poem?

83
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,060
It's called Unending Love.

84
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,700
When is the server upgrade

85
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,900
expected to be completed?

86
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,260
By the end of May.

87
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,420
After the upgrade,

88
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,100
the annual expenses will be...

89
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,820
100 million?

90
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,340
You're the most costly

91
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,180
department we have.

92
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,300
Mr. Jiang,

93
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,340
Mr. Feng and Mr. Song

94
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,180
are arguing.

95
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,060
Wannian Foods

96
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,340
is an international conglomerate

97
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,860
with many food sub-brands.

98
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,700
It's also our long-term partner.

99
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,660
We have various collaborations
every year,

100
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,620
from online live streams

101
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,500
to offline events.

102
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,100
The contract for this payment

103
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,580
is written in great detail.

104
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,100
On what basis do you think

105
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,100
we can't recover it?

106
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,300
Wannian Foods

107
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,940
is affiliated with Huanyu Group.

108
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,500
What we know is

109
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,860
that Huanyu Group is packaging Wannian

110
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,180
for sale.

111
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,060
Wannian Foods has
a very high bad asset ratio.

112
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,060
We believe there will be issues
about whether it

113
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,260
can be recovered.

114
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,180
It's a bad debt.

115
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,460
Mr. Song,

116
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
Wannian has always

117
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,980
been our client.

118
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,740
We are indeed negotiating

119
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,420
about this receivable,

120
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,700
but the news you mentioned today

121
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
is something we just heard about.

122
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,540
I'll discuss it

123
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,220
with Mr. Feng later.

124
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,420
Wannian's debt ratio is too high.

125
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,020
The parent company is handling it.

126
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,420
I believe that regardless

127
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,300
of the age of this receivable,

128
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,260
we should consider it as bad debt.

129
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,460
Let's go.

130
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,060
Call to confirm if it's true.

131
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,300
Understood.

132
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,980
What factors did you eliminate

133
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,020
to get the data back to normal?

134
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,620
Everything

135
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,740
is normal now.

136
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,900
So is the bad debt rate.

137
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,860
Is it adjusted based on industry

138
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,620
or sudden risk?

139
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,860
No.

140
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,260
It's based on indicator anomalies.

141
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,700
Extension anomalies.

142
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,020
After I eliminated
these extension anomaly samples,

143
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,420
the set of data became normal.

144
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,940
Extension?

145
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,100
It means failing
to repay the loan on time

146
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,220
and requesting a longer period
from the bank.

147
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,740
There's a three-year limit.

148
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,180
It's quite common.

149
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,980
I've looked at these extended loans.

150
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,340
They're within three years.

151
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,980
Why did you think to eliminate this?

152
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,620
Three years is the general limit,

153
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
but there's one thing.

154
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,900
The extension

155
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,380
cannot exceed the loan term.

156
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,540
For example, if a loan

157
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,580
has a total term of only one year,

158
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,220
and can't be repaid on time

159
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,860
after one or two months,

160
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,860
but the branch approves

161
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,180
a three-year extension,

162
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,820
will it still be normal?

163
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,700
There is indeed a problem.

164
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,420
I sorted out these problematic cases.

165
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,660
They're mostly
in three or four branches.

166
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,620
The overall amount involved

167
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,620
is around several billion.

168
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,420
What do you plan to do?

169
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,340
I need to verify it again
with my

170
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,780
post-loan management colleagues.

171
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,620
Tang Yang.

172
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,460
I will return to the HQ tomorrow,

173
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,220
but

174
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,780
if you need any assistance,

175
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,020
remember to let me know.

176
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,740
Don't worry.

177
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,100
I'll keep an eye on this work.

178
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,820
Once you have the results

179
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,140
from the research institute,

180
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,500
we can proceed to the next step

181
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,860
of substantial product design.

182
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,740
Don't worry.

183
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,780
Mr. Wang of Wannian Foods is not

184
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,620
answering my calls.

185
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,940
He may be afraid
I'll push him for payment.

186
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,100
I called a few friends
in the capital circle.

187
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,820
I didn't ask directly

188
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,900
and just chatted about it vaguely.

189
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,060
Their replies were

190
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,020
they hadn't heard it.

191
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,980
I'm wondering if Song Jing is

192
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,180
intentionally messing with us

193
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,500
by using rumors.

194
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,780
If this receivable

195
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,340
is classified as bad debt,

196
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,820
it will affect our working capital

197
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,580
and impact the valuation.

198
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,100
No matter how much of a grudge

199
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,180
he had with Tang Yang,

200
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,060
he's a professional.

201
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,460
I don't think he'd fabricate it.

202
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,660
They're closer

203
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,020
to asset evaluation.

204
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,780
If Huanyu wants to sell Wannian,

205
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,780
they'll need an asset evaluation report.

206
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,220
You can start investigating

207
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,100
from this angle.

208
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,900
I think what matters now

209
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,940
is to understand

210
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,700
the truth of Wannian.

211
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,940
Okay, I'll book a ticket.

212
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,700
I'll fly over early tomorrow.

213
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,180
Liqin is about to finish.

214
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,460
I think you should stay.

215
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,340
I'll go to Wannian.

216
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,740
That works.

217
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,100
By the way,

218
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,420
how about the cooperation with Jiujiang

219
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,620
that Zhou Mo mentioned?

220
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,380
I talked to a few shareholders.

221
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,460
They believe

222
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,980
it's feasible and promising.

223
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,540
Then let's proceed.

224
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,140
They can provide funding and venue

225
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,380
for the Food Map project,

226
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,300
combined with our online channels

227
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,660
and a complete promotion plan.

228
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,940
It's a win-win situation

229
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,100
with our strengths.

230
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,580
Great, I'll set up a meeting with him

231
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,300
and have the lawyer draft a proposal.

232
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,700
Sure.

233
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,620
One more thing I need

234
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,460
to discuss with you.

235
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,980
What is it?

236
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,660
When are you marrying Yang?

237
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,540
Are you okay?

238
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,980
I'm being serious.

239
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,940
Stop the nonsense.

240
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,780
When to get married?

241
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,220
We have only been

242
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,100
dating for a few days.

243
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,140
We haven't had enough dating.

244
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,260
Why rush into marriage?

245
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,500
Let me tell you.

246
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,980
Dating just

247
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,460
brings two strangers

248
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,300
together.

249
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,900
It's a way to let them

250
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,140
know each other

251
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,700
and confirm if the other person

252
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,020
is the right one.

253
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,220
Do you two need that?

254
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,700
Do you need to confirm?

255
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,380
Isn't dating a waste
of time for you?

256
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,180
Why not be more efficient?

257
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,380
I...

258
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,580
You're speechless.

259
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,220
You can't retort me.

260
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,140
Let me tell you.

261
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,220
There's a unique huge benefit

262
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,620
to getting married.

263
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,220
What is it?

264
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,140
She'll be your wife.

265
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,700
I'm going to find my wife.

266
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
You should find one too.

and

275
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,220

00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,940
I'll pick you up.

278
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,500
No need.

279
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,940

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,420

I'll go.

283

Park your car at CBBC.

284
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,500
Driving is more exhausting.

stay long here.

Nothing.

349

351

That's great.

370
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,300
Many people are waiting
for the letter of intent.

371

Once it arrives,
they can transfer the funds.

372
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,820
So we need to hurry.

373
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,660

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,940

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,460
I hope you can arrange

380
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,300
to meet her

381
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,820
and find a chance

382
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,900
to tell her

383
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,380
some things are

384
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,780
better left undisturbed.

385
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,940
Can you

386
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,940
clarify this for me, Ms. Wei?

387
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,340
I need to ensure that Tang Yang

388
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
doesn't misunderstand.

389
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,100
A few years ago,

390
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,580
we borrowed some money from CBBC.

391
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,780
Mom, Dad, I'm back.

392
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,060
Tang is back.

393
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,500
The food is all heated up.

394
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,180
I'll get you a bowl of soup.

395
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,740
You wash your hands.

396
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,220
Dad isn't back yet?

397
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,940
Your dad?

398
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,340
He's out

399
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,140
in the garden playing chess

400
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,180
with someone.

401
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,900
Look at you.

402
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,540
It's been days since you last came home.

403
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,220
We have a pilot project going on.

404
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,580
I'm working overtime every day.

405
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,580
Overtime, overtime.

406
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,700
I know.

407
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,980
Why did you come back today?

408
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,740
Jiang Shiyan is on a business trip.

409
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,020
What does that

410
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,740
have to do with you coming back?

411
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,780
Well...

412
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,180
Because he treats me

413
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,860
to dinner every day.

414
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,740
When he's away,

415
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,820
I have no dinner.

416
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,180
Okay, okay.

417
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,700
Are you going to work overtime

418
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,780
this weekend?

419
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,860
I don't think so.

420
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,020
I can take two days off.

421
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,700
By the way,

422
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,700
this weekend is your
wedding anniversary, right?

423
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,820
What's your plan?

424
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,060
Should I book

425
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,300
a vacation resort for us?

426
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,860
We can have fun there; it's on me.

427
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,740
It's not what I mean.

428
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,420
I want to arrange

429
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,900
a blind date for you.

430
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,740
No way.

431
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,820
I'm not going; I'm not going.

432
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,060
You found various excuses.

433
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,780
It's the New Year;
you have training soon.

434
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,220
It's been a long time.

435
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,340
I won't arrange

436
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,060
too many this time; just a few.

437
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,660
A few decent ones for you to check out.

438
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,700
I really don't want to go.

439
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,700
I'm super tired, Mom.

440
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,140
My voice is already hoarse.

441
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,460
I just want to sleep well.

442
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,380
I understand it.

443
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,180
You can sleep in the morning

444
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,300
and go afterward.

445
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,420
I won't arrange too many.

446
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,260
Just a few.

447
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,620
They are decent candidates.

448
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,540
Just take a look then.

449
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,380
I'm really not going.

450
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,020
Mom, I'll go with you

451
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,180
to celebrate your anniversary.

452
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,220
It's been arranged

453
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
long ago by your dad and me.

454
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,300
We're going to a five-star hotel

455
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,540
for a buffet

456
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,060
and Qinglong Lake for some fun.

457
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,820
You weren't there at our wedding,

458
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,900
so our anniversary

459
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
doesn't need you.

460
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,700
Going on a blind date

461
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,700
is the best gift you can give us

462
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,620
for our anniversary.

463
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,260
Tang?

464
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,020
I'll fly to Shenzhen.

465
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,180
Arrange a meeting with Mr. Chen
from Tiange.

466
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,660
And one with Ding Shen Capital.

467
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,420
Okay. How did the meeting
with Wannian Foods go?

468
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,300
I suddenly had an idea,

469
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,100
but right now, I'm still in the car.

470
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,300
I'll talk to you later.

471
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,700
Bye-bye.

472
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,260
(Tang)
When will you be back?

473
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,980
Ms. Zhou arranged a blind date

474
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
this weekend.

475
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,180
Hello?

476
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,180
Why is your voice hoarse?

477
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,020
I had meetings all day today.

478
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,420
My voice is almost gone.

479
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,420
Drink some water

480
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,260
with tangerine peel.

481
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,940
I won't go on a blind date.

482
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,900
Of course not.

483
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,180
Absolutely not, okay?

484
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,700
Why don't you tell your parents

485
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,020
that we're dating?

486
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,660
That way, she won't

487
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,500
force you to go.

488
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,260
Sounds good.

489
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,220
Good idea. Let's do it.

490
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,180
I'll tell her right now.

491
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,860
I have something to announce to you.

492
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,300
What is it? You're so serious.

493
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,580
I'm in a relationship.

494
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,300
You're in a relationship?

495
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,980
Great. Who is it?

496
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,340
Is it a colleague or...

497
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,380
With Jiang Shiyan.

498
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,540
Tang,

499
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,540
I know you don't want a blind date,

500
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,140
but there's no need to lie to us.

501
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,180
I...

502
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,700
I'm not lying to you.

503
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,060
- You and Jiang Shiyan?
- Right.

504
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,740
You two are dating?

505
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,580
Yes.

506
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
I see.

507
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,620
You're just like

508
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,860
those people online,

509
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,900
making up a fake relationship

510
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,260
with a good friend

511
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
to avoid

512
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,100
family pressure

513
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,220
and to save yourself
from nagging at home.

514
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,980
Tang,

515
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,660
I'm not urging you to get married.

516
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,100
I just think

517
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,460
you should date.

518
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,540
It's a normal

519
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,500
emotional need in life.

520
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,820
You can't just work

521
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,060
without a life.

522
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,220
I'm not avoiding blind dates.

523
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,780
I really am dating him.

524
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,100
We're truly in love.

525
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,540
Tang, don't forget

526
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,580
I'm a teacher.

527
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,660
I've been teaching for decades.

528
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,220
Early relationships are common.

529
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,420
I can tell right away

530
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,900
whether there's a romantic thing.

531
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,220
You and Jiang Shiyan?

532
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,740
Do you want to fool me

533
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,060
with your small tricks?

534
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
If I can be fooled,

535
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,020
I've truly wasted my years

536
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,900
as a senior teacher.

537
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,700
You... You...

538
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,620
Forget it, forget it.

539
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,300
It's fine.

540
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,820
Our talk ends here.

541
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,060
I'm leaving.

542
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,180
Tang, where are you going?

543
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,380
I'm going back. I don't want to stay.

544
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,660
Then be careful

545
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,500
on the way.

546
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,300
Do you think my analysis is correct?

547
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,740
Well,

548
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,580
there's some truth to it.

549
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,980
You're pretty sharp.

550
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,620
I never expected that Tang

551
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,900
doesn't even want to date.

552
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,620
Of course.

553
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,380
When I was

554
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,780
a head teacher,

555
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,620
I could tell

556
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,060
when a student lied

557
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,380
with one look.

558
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,460
Are you sure you didn't wrong Tang?

559
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,980
I wronged her?

560
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,220
What do you mean?

561
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,940
Do you think they might

562
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,820
really be dating?

563
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,980
Cut to the chase; what's going on?

564
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,220
How could that be?

565
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,100
I knew it.

566
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,300
I think

567
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,460
maybe this idea

568
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,740
is Jiang Shiyan's.

569
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,780
No way.

570
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,540
I know my son too well.

571
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,900
He often can't come up with anything,

572
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,740
but when it comes to sneaky stuff

573
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,980
or tricks,

574
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,820
he's always spot on.

575
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,180
Look, it must be like this:

576
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,980
Tang tells Jiang Shiyan

577
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,580
that you want her to go on a blind date.

578
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,500
She doesn't want to go.

579
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,860
So Jiang Shiyan

580
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,340
comes up with the idea.

581
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,660
You can tell your mom

582
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,540
that we're already dating,

583
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,220
so you don't have to meet anyone else.

584
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,340
This bad idea

585
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,900
must have come from Jiang Shiyan.

586
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,940
That's right. You are

587
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,020
getting better.

588
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,500
Not bad, right?

589
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,100
These two kids

590
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,620
can't trick us.

591
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,260
(Ding Shen Capital)

592
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,540
- Here.
- It's okay.

593
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,380
Have you caught a cold?

594
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,500
No, no.

595
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,540
I suddenly have an itchy nose.

596
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,220
Maybe someone's badmouthing me.

597
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,580
(Dong Liang, Investment Manager)

598
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,140
Mr. Qiu's meeting is about to end.

599
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,220
Please wait a moment.

600
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,500
It's fine, no rush.

601
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,420
Mr. Qiu.

602
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,780
Mr. Jiang.

603
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,380
- Long time no see.
- Indeed.

604
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,540
- Please sit.
- Sure, sure.

605
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,420
I heard from Dong

606
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,900
that you urgently need me.

607
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,940
What's up?

608
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,700
It's about Wannian Foods.

609
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,020
Do you know this company?

610
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,860
Yes. What's going on?

611
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,160
Before coming to Shenzhen,

612
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,540
I visited Wannian.

613
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,420
Their parent company, Huanyu,

614
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,020
is planning to package them for sale.

615
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,700
I had an idea.

616
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,460
I wanted to discuss it with you.

617
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,740
Mr. Song,

618
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,380
I heard your work

619
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,450
is almost done, right?

620
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,530
Yes, we've checked

621
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,620
everything that we need to.

622
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,580
The follow-up work

623
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,140
is just to compile the summary report.

624
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,380
We plan to leave Rongcheng and return

625
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,220
to Beijing tomorrow.

626
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,060
Great.

627
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,420
To thank you

628
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,500
for your efforts,

629
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,700
let's go to Leisure House

630
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,780
for dinner tonight.

631
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Mr. Jiang's not here.

632
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,100
I'll thank everyone on his behalf.

633
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,140
Thanks, Mr. Feng.

634
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,540
You're too kind.

635
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,220
During this time, we've enjoyed

636
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,780
a lot of delicious lunches and snacks.

637
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,580
Lisa is already in love

638
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,420
with a few of your signature products.

639
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,860
Right.

640
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,100
I haven't gone home yet,

641
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,420
but I've placed my orders.

642
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,700
I can eat when I get back.

643
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,980
Thanks, thanks.

644
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,860
Mr. Feng,

645
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,060
before we leave,

646
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,380
I wonder if I can ask you

647
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,420
for a favor.

648
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,460
What is it?

649
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,020
I'd like to meet with Tang Yang.

650
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,460
Why?

651
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,780
Hello?

652
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,740
I wanted to tell you something.

653
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,700
Song Jing said today

654
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,380
he wanted to meet with Yang.

655
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,220
I didn't agree.

656
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,420
I called you first to ask.

657
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,180
Then just tell Yang.

658
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,020
Why tell me?

659
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,060
Of course.

660
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,380
Yang is your girlfriend.

661
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,940
He wants to meet your girlfriend.

662
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,100
I have to check with you first

663
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,940
about what you think.

664
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,620
Thank you very much.

665
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,620
She's my girlfriend,

666
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,700
but first,
she's an independent individual.

667
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,180
Whether she meets him

668
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,300
is her choice.

669
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,900
I have no right to interfere.

670
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,100
I'm just worried that Song Jing

671
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,060
might say something

672
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,540
that would upset Yang.

673
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,060
I'm just trying to protect her.

674
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,940
Right.

675
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,620
But she's a strong

676
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,500
and determined adult.

677
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,780
I think if she decides

678
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,660
to meet him,

679
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,220
she must have

680
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,060
prepared mentally.

681
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,020
I'm her boyfriend

682
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,500
and should protect her,

683
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,260
but I can't treat her like a child.

684
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,860
Alright, alright.

685
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,700
You always win.

686
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,620
I'll just ask Yang later.

687
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,060
If she wants to meet,

688
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,460
it'll be at Leisure House anyway,

689
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,460
so we're not worried.

690
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,940
Okay.

691
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,420
Alright, bye-bye.

692
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,940
My wife

693
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,100
often helps

694
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,980
manage the store.

695
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,260
I mostly work in the company,

696
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,940
following that...

697
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,780
Feng Weiran.

698
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,420
Come on, Yang.

699
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,540
You're here.

700
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,140
Feng Weiran told me

701
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,180
that you wanted to see me.

702
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,180
Come on, Tang Yang. Sit here.

703
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
You two have a good chat.

704
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,260
I'll get back to work.

705
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,660
If you need anything, let me know.

706
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,820
Okay, go ahead.

707
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,700
What's going on?

708
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,180
I'm going back to Beijing.

709
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,620
Finished your work? Congratulations.

710
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,860
I wanted to say a few things

711
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,660
to you before I leave.

712
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,060
Go ahead.

713
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,020
Back then, my actions

714
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,860
might not be right.

715
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,300
I didn't consider your feelings.

716
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,060
But, Tang Yang,

717
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,100
I really did like you sincerely,

718
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,220
and I've always felt

719
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,060
we were suitable,

720
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,660
both professionally

721
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,220
and for future

722
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,060
development.

723
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,380
I've always believed

724
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,860
we could end up together.

725
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,980
I just had a lot on my mind

726
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,860
at the time.

727
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,860
On one hand, I hoped

728
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,380
to intern at a company soon

729
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,260
to gain some work experience.

730
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,700
On the other hand,

731
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,180
I wanted the opportunity
to study abroad,

732
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,060
so I neglected your feelings.

733
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,540
Song Jing,

734
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,100
you've misunderstood one thing

735
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,940
all along.

736
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,460
We're not suitable at all.

737
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,340
You have your full life plan,

738
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,420
but none of your plans

739
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,660
have anything to do with me.

740
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,500
And I don't need

741
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,700
to waste my time

742
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,180
because of your plans.

743
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,900
That's why I stopped seeing you.

744
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,340
So, are you really

745
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,060
daring Jiang Shiyan?

746
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,500
Yes.

747
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,780
Why did it take

748
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,860
so long for you to date?

749
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,340
Didn't you choose to settle

750
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,700
because you have

751
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,460
reached the right age and had

752
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,420
no better choices?

753
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,980
Song Jing, you're really funny.

754
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,380
Do you think

755
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,220
someone like Jiang Shiyan

756
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,620
needs to settle?

757
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,460
As for why it took so long,

758
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,620
I've asked myself

759
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,460
that question too.

760
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,380
Then I seem to have figured it out.

761
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,380
Maybe this is

762
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,740
the best arrangement

763
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,940
from fate.

764
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,300
Who isn't impulsive and immature

765
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,300
when they're young?

766
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,940
Jiang Shiyan and I grew up

767
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,820
and matured together.

768
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,940
I think now we are

769
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,900
more determined,

770
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,260
more mature,

771
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,620
and have become more resilient.

772
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,780
Being together now

773
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,180
is definitely more relaxed

774
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,380
and we better

775
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
understand how to love each other.

776
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,660
I understand.

777
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,620
Wish you both well.

778
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,180
Thanks.

779
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,700
Mr. Liu,

780
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,220
how much wine

781
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,620
does the plant produce annually?

782
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,580
Our distillery produces

783
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,900
about less than 500,000 kilos annually.

784
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,340
In the past,

785
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,740
it was mostly purchased

786
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,580
by larger companies

787
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,020
as base liquor,

788
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,260
then rebranded and sold.

789
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,780
It's at a lower price.

790
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,300
Mayor Yan said

791
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,740
our wine was good,

792
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
but we needed

793
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,620
to establish our brand.

794
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,940
The creek here

795
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,460
is called Orchid Creek,

796
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,340
so it's called Lanxi Ancient Town.

797
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,620
The creek water

798
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,460
flows down from the mountains.

799
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,740
It's all spring water,

800
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,820
very clear.

801
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,380
Yes, the water used for brewing

802
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,260
is filtered

803
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,540
and treated creek water.

804
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,300
That's why the wine brewed

805
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,860
has a unique sweetness.

806
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,260
I'm home.

807
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,940
I planned to have night snacks with you,

808
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,700
but the flight was delayed.

809
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,420
Forget it; don't come.

810
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,620
I'm about to sleep.

811
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,340
No overtime tomorrow?

812
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,820
I'll go see you tomorrow.

813
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,540
Alright, I'm going to sleep now.

814
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,820
Without material food,

815
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,340
you should give me some spiritual food.

816
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,300
Jiang Shiyan, you're becoming...

817
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,260
Becoming what?

818
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,340
Forget it.

819
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
I'm going to sleep.

820
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,580
Good night.

821
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,740
You're back.

822
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,340
Are you talking to Yang,

823
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,540
whom you've known for 14 years?

824
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,420
No.

825
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,340
It should be your girlfriend.

826
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,100
I told Ms. Zhou

827
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,700
that this absurd idea

828
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,260
must have come from you for Tang.

829
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,260
Tang is a good kid.

830
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,060
She'd never think of such a crazy idea.

831
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,140
Why aren't you asleep yet?

832
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,300
I'm binge-watching.

833
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,180
There's a good costume drama lately.

834
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,140
Who is it?

835
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,020
It's me.

836
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,300
Why are you here so early?

837
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,420
There are only 24 hours in a day.

838
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,900
If I come an hour early,

839
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,100
we can spend an extra hour.

840
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,340
If I come late,

841
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,540
we'll just have less time.

842
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,140
I feel like there are
only 23 hours in a day.

843
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,980
I don't accept that.

844
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,420
Sounds like nonsense.

845
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,580
You have the password to my house.

846
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,860
Why do you still knock?

847
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,980
In the past, you were my bro.

848
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,300
To pack things for you,

849
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,780
of course, I could just walk in.

850
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,060
Now you're my girlfriend.

851
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,220
If I want to come in,

852
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,260
it's better to get your consent first.

853
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,100
I brought you
your favorite tofu pudding,

854
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,940
osmanthus cake, and xiaolongbao.

855
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,540
By the way,

856
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,420
Ms. Zhou won't come today, right?

857
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,860
She definitely won't.

858
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,620
She's celebrating her anniversary

859
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,940
with my dad today.

860
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,260
We can be alone too.

861
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,500
Wait a minute.

862
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,220
I need to go wash up first.

863
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,940
Alright.

864
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,420
What's wrong?

865
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,420
I...

866
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,420
I was about to brush my teeth.

867
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,460
Then I thought

868
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,500
about getting my phone,

869
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,340
and as a result,

870
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,660
it fell over here.

871
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,900
It's fine; the sun is shining bright.

872
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,060
We can dry it after washing.

873
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,540
We can change all the bedding.

874
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,580
Okay.

875
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,820
Let's change.

876
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,460
This one.

877
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,180
How do you think

878
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,460
my daughter's temper is?

879
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,540
I told her off a bit,

880
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,260
and she hasn't

881
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,220
called me since.

882
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,020
My husband said

883
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,260
today was the weekend,

884
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,620
so I should deliver some veggies.

885
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,340
Moms and daughters don't stay mad.

886
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,220
Tang is very busy.

887
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,540
Maybe it isn't because she's mad.

888
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,740
It's so early.

889
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,580
She must be sleeping.

890
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,140
It's okay; I know her house password.

891
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,540
I'll just put

892
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,900
the veggies in the fridge.

893
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,940
When she wakes up,

894
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,980
she can eat them.

895
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,300
I'm afraid it will be too late

896
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,420
after our dance.

897
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,780
Right, right.

898
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,100
Alright.

899
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,500
Come on.

900
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,500
The duvet cover.

901
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,660
Don't move.

902
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,420
I have a really good method

903
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,700
that I saw online.

904
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,660
What method?

905
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,940
Look, just like this.

906
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,620
Put my hands inside.

907
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,220
Flip the duvet over.

908
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,020
- And then?
- You go there.

909
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,020
Okay.

910
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,620
Then you

911
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,100
grab this corner.

912
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,460
- Grab it.
- Yes, hold it tight.

913
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,300
Don't let go.

914
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,940
Tang Yang, you're done for.

915
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,900
I'm not done.

916
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,820
You're forcing me to offer myself.

917
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,660
I'm telling you.

918
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,580
Tang,

919
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,820
are you up?

920
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,460
No, don't move.

921
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,700
Right now, you...

922
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,300
Tang, you...

923
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,900
You...

924
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,420
- Mom.
- Mom.

925
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,060
- Ms. Zhou.
- Aunt Yi.

926
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,860
Jiang Shiyan.

927
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,900
What are you doing

928
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,260
on Tang's bed so early

929
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,620
in the morning?

930
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,740
Mom.

931
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,100
Ms. Zhou.

932
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,180
I'm dating Tang Yang.

933
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,020
I brought her

934
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,980
breakfast.

935
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,460
Breakfast is good.

936
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,460
Good.

937
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,100
Breakfast gives you energy.

938
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,740
No.

939
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,660
Good for your health.

940
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,020
Well, Mom.

941
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,220
Didn't you and Dad

942
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,580
go to Qinglong Lake

943
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,900
for your wedding anniversary?

944
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,180
That's tomorrow.

945
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,580
So why are you here today?

946
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,700
Well, we just happened

947
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,580
to be nearby

948
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,260
and came to look around.

949
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,980
You two continue.

950
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,780
We're leaving. Goodbye.

951
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,140
Wait, Mom.

952
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,900
- We're leaving, bye-bye.
- Well.

953
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,380
Why does my mom look

954
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,420
a bit scared?

955
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,220
Right.

956
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,140
I was scared to death.

957
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,580
I was afraid she'd scold me.

958
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,940
Why does it seem she's more scared?

959
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,780
Why?

960
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,820
We forgot our shoes.

961
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,820
We came for shoes.

962
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,860
It's fine; we won't disturb you.

963
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,980
You go ahead.

964
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,500
Goodbye, goodbye.

965
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,500
Goodbye.

966
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,340
The veggies.

967
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,940
No, no, forget about the veggies.

968
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,900
I'm really, really nervous.

969
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,900
I'm telling you.

970
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,020
Let's take the veggies back.

971
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,380
My heart has been racing until now.

972
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,180
Why is your heart racing?

973
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,780
I don't know; I'm just nervous.

974
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,900
They said they were dating.

975
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,700
Are they really dating?

976
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,660
Seems like it.

977
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,500
Otherwise,

978
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,100
why would they be on the bed?

979
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,460
The bed.

980
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,380
Ms. Zhou.

981
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,780
I'm really sorry.

982
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,420
Our Jiang Shiyan...

983
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

984
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,580
What's there to be sorry about?

985
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,180
Two young people dating

986
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,660
is the most normal thing.

987
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,900
Besides,

988
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,100
Tang and Jiang Shiyan

989
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,460
are a perfect match.

990
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,700
Do you really think so?

991
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,900
Ms. Zhou.

992
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,940
Well.

993
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,500
If you have any problems

994
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,460
or opinions,

995
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,140
just tell me directly.

996
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,700
I'll properly educate Jiang Shiyan.

997
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,940
What are you saying?

998
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,380
What problem can I have?

999
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,980
To be honest, while our Tang

1000
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,420
hasn't been in Rongcheng these years,

1001
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,140
Jiang took care of us.

1002
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,180
At that time, I thought

1003
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,980
this kid was too good.

1004
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
Whichever girl

1005
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,580
marries him will truly be lucky.

1006
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,220
It's a pity that our Tang and Jiang

1007
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,620
have been friends for so long

1008
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,580
without a spark.

1009
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,380
I didn't expect in the end

1010
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,340
that Jiang would end up with us.

1011
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,260
That's great.

1012
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,140
I'm not going to dance today.

1013
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,940
I need to go back and tell my husband.

1014
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,940
We'll sort this out.

1015
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,020
I'm telling you.

1016
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,540
I've liked your Tang

1017
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,540
since childhood.

1018
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,660
She's well-read and well-mannered.

1019
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,140
I really think

1020
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,300
Jiang Shiyan isn't worthy of her.

1021
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,980
But I didn't expect

1022
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
that Jiang Shiyan

1023
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,380
would figure things out with Tang.

1024
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,380
Nonsense.

1025
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,180
Jiang is great.

1026
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,580
I've heard people say

1027
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,300
that his Yixiu is about to be listed.

1028
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,060
How wonderful. They're quite a match.

1029
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,020
No, no, no.

1030
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,420
Tang is a doctoral.

1031
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,180
Jiang's education level is lower.

1032
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,500
Enough about that.

1033
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,860
That's great, that's great.

1034
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,540
Why hasn't the elevator arrived?

1035
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,180
You didn't press it.

1036
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,300
How awkward.

1037
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,220
Feels like they feel
more awkward than us.

1038
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,500
You're right.

1039
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,340
They feel awkward,

1040
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,740
so we don't have to be.

1041
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,220
When is Yang out of class?

1042
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,580
I'm starving.

1043
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,420
Her advisor wants to talk to her.

1044
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,020
- Oh my god.
- There's a supermarket.

1045
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,260
Let's buy something first.

1046
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,500
Let's go, let's go.

1047
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,820
Isn't that Song Jing over there?

1048
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,780
Yeah.

1049
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,740
Seems like they got

1050
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,660
into the same college.

1051
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,700
Let me tell you.

1052
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,460
Yanan told me

1053
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,660
that Song Jing and Yang

1054
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,380
are getting pretty close.

1055
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,020
They go to class and eat together.

1056
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,540
Is he waiting for Yang?

1057
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,100
Is that true?

1058
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,860
- Someone's there.
- No.

1059
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,500
You said you wanted to read these books.

1060
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,860
I borrowed them from the library.

1061
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,380
Thanks.

1062
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,900
That's not Yang.

1063
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,220
That definitely isn't Yang.

1064
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,460
Obviously, she's not as tall as Yang.

1065
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,060
Have you eaten yet?

1066
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,940
Not yet.

1067
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,940
Then let's eat together.

1068
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,090
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1069
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,420
I'm telling you.

1070
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,500
The tall girl is coming.

1071
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,820
Yang.

1072
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,940
Sorry for the wait.

1073
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,700
How did it go?

1074
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,940
Not bad.

1075
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,460
You're really tall.

1076
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,300
Who?

1077
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,420
No one.

1078
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,700
The security guard just now.

1079
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:32,980
