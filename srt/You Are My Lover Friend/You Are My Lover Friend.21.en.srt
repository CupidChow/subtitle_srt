=Episode 21=
=Really Not Being Polite=

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,970
Focus on passing gas after surgery.

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,840
Only on the second day

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,380
of passing gas can eating begin.

30
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,760
For the first two days,

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,910
stick to liquids

32
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,530
and light foods.

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,030
Avoid greasy

34
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,200
or hard-to-digest foods,

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,140
including bone broth.

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,190
Have him talk less and move around more.

37
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,440
This will help him

38
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,330
pass gas.

39
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,270
If there's bloating, abdominal pain,

40
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,640
or a fever,

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,940
contact us immediately.

42
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,200
Okay, okay.

43
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,050
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

44
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,860
Is there anything else to watch out for?

45
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,340
To prevent adhesion,

46
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,010
it's good to move around a bit.

47
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,080
If it's bearable,

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,110
he can walk around.

49
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,010
- Okay.
- Thanks.

50
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,220
- Alright.
- Thanks, thanks.

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,320
You're awake.

52
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,830
Aunt, how is he?

53
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,810
He's fine, he's fine.

54
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,990
You guys are here.

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,320
How are you?

56
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,520
It was just a minor surgery.

57
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
How did he suddenly

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,460
get sick?

59
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,020
I don't know what he ate yesterday.

60
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,860
He suddenly collapsed

61
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,180
at the skate park.

62
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,620
- Oh, my.
- Luckily, Tang was there.

63
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,540
You see.

64
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,220
I always say to find a companion.

65
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,420
You're so stubborn.

66
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,540
Now you know the feeling
of being all alone.

67
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,660
What?

68
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,500
Don't talk.

69
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,100
Talking can cause bloating.

70
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,460
Aunt, he seems a bit thirsty.

71
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,140
Are you thirsty?

72
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,140
You can't drink water right now.

73
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,660
I'll use a cotton swab

74
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,820
to moisten your mouth.

75
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,300
Any other discomfort?

76
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,110
Are you feeling
a bit of chest tightness?

77
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,580
I'll open the window for fresh air.

78
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,820
No, no, no.

79
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,420
Is the ceiling light blinding?
It's too bright.

80
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,260
Let me turn off the light for you.

81
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,900
Just talk.

82
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,620
- If you...
- He can't talk after surgery.

83
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,820
The anesthesia
hasn't worn off completely.

84
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,580
It'll take about three or four hours.

85
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,180
After that, you can
drink a little rice soup.

86
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,060
Are you feeling uncomfortable now?

87
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,540
- Yeah.
- Uncomfortable.

88
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,100
- Of course.
- Uncomfortable.

89
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,380
Not uncomfortable?

90
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,700
Uncomfortable or not?

91
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,620
Do you feel a bit uncomfortable,

92
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,020
but not too much?

93
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,500
How about this?

94
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,700
Let me help you.

95
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,900
Lie on your side for a bit.

96
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,420
The doctor said it was
to promote intestinal movement.

97
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,660
Once you feel uncomfortable,

98
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,980
I'll lay you back down, okay?

99
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,420
Feng, help him turn to the left side.

100
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,220
Alright, come on.

101
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,020
No, no, no.

102
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,180
- Left.
- Turn him to his left.

103
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,180
His wound's on the right.

104
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,500
Then why did you say to the left?

105
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,820
- I meant his left.
- Alright.

106
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,670
Let her do it.

107
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,660
Be gentle, be gentle.

108
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,340
Alright, be gentle.

109
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,100
Then be clear about it.

110
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,660
Aunt Yi,

111
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,180
I just went to the store

112
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,340
and bought some wet wipes,

113
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,900
a straw, and a cup.

114
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,100
Is there anything else

115
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,020
you need?

116
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,580
Or do you want to go back to get it?

117
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,580
Of course, I'll stay overnight with him.

118
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,660
I just asked.

119
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,380
They have beds and blankets here,

120
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,380
so I'll just go get some toiletries.

121
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,060
Okay, I'll stay here with him

122
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,900
and wait for you.

123
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,020
What about you? Want to stay too?

124
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,420
Where did Qi go?

125
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,780
He's at Leisure House.

126
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,780
I'll pick him up later.

127
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
Right, dear.

128
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,460
You go pick up Qi first

129
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,700
and hurry back home to sleep.

130
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,020
If necessary, I'll come later.

131
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,500
- Come on.
- We'll go together.

132
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,340
Let's go together.

133
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,140
- I'll go with Aunt.
- Let's go.

134
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,180
Then I'll leave.

135
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,020
Okay.

136
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,700
I'll be back soon.

137
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Hurry back.

138
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,140
I'll bring you some

139
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,780
millet porridge tomorrow morning, okay?

140
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,940
Now,

141
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,620
the most important thing is to pass gas.

142
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,740
I've put your phone

143
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,220
next to you.

144
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,540
Once you fart...

145
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,540
pass gas.

146
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,940
Once you pass gas,

147
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
just let me know.

148
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,060
Don't laugh.

149
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,700
What if it pulls

150
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,540
your wound?

151
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,940
If you pass gas, just let me know.

152
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,300
(Just now: Jiang: [Victory])

153
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,700
(Jiang Shiyan)

154
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,620
Passed gas?

155
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,740
(Tang Yang)

156
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,580
(Jiang Shiyan)

157
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,860
The doctor said no milk or soy milk.

158
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,780
They can easily cause bloating.

159
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,540
Tomorrow I'll bring millet porridge.

160
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,740
(Tang Yang)

161
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,020
My back.

162
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,100
Mom, can't you sleep?

163
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Don't talk.

164
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,300
I'm already asleep.

165
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,820
Good morning.

166
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,260
- Tang.
- Good morning.

167
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,180
You're here so early.

168
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,100
Yang is here.

169
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,340
Yeah, I have a meeting this morning,

170
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,740
so I wanted to come early

171
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,180
and bring you some breakfast.

172
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,180
I thought

173
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,300
I'd eat at the hospital,

174
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,500
but unexpectedly,

175
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,380
his liquid diet

176
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,780
is really liquid.

177
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,020
Just a bowl of clear broth.

178
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,380
A couple of sips are enough.

179
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,460
That's perfect.

180
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,260
I brought buns and soy milk.

181
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,540
Hurry up and have some.

182
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,700
I thought the pillows here

183
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,420
wouldn't be comfortable,

184
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,900
so I brought him a memory foam one.

185
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,860
Change it for him later.

186
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,180
I also brought an electric steamer

187
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,260
and some millet.

188
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,180
You can cook something

189
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,060
easy to digest.

190
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,540
Tang is really thoughtful.

191
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,500
Aunt, did you not rest well yesterday?

192
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,740
Don't mention it.

193
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,860
The bed at the hospital

194
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,100
is hard as a rock.

195
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,420
My back aches like crazy.

196
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,260
The nurse comes in every hour
to do rounds.

197
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,260
You could say I slept, but it feels

198
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,340
like I didn't sleep at all.

199
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,900
I have a history of neurasthenia,

200
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,740
and now,

201
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,860
I borrowed a BP monitor.

202
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,740
It showed high BP.

203
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,580
Then hurry up

204
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,460
and eat something.

205
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,980
Alright, you guys get ready.

206
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,980
I'll return this first.

207
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,180
Alright, alright.

208
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,300
Feng Weiran, bring that over.

209
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,740
Buns and soy milk, have a bite.

210
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,260
I can't eat a single bite right now.

211
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,500
I want to eat my wife's egg pancakes.

212
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,020
I don't know

213
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,860
when I can go home.

214
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,140
You need to be sincere
when comforting her.

215
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,620
You can't just brush it off.

216
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,500
It won't work.

217
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,980
She's not a child.

218
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,820
Yang,

219
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,260
we've been friends for so long.

220
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,060
You know how I treat her, right?

221
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,020
What do you mean I lack sincerity?

222
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,100
Does Yanan like americanos?

223
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,820
She likes lattes, with extra sugar.

224
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,580
Every morning during college,

225
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,460
I bought her a latte.

226
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,380
No need to ask me this.

227
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,020
When she was pregnant with Qi,

228
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,500
she had gestational diabetes.

229
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,820
She quit sugar long ago.

230
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,500
Now she only drinks americanos.

231
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,300
Is that having sincerity?

232
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,020
I'm swamped by work.

233
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,020
This...

234
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
What are you

235
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,580
saying over there?

236
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,340
She listens to you the most.

237
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,260
Can't you persuade her?

238
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,940
I can't. It depends on you.

239
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,140
Yang,

240
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,540
I've never asked you

241
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,140
for a favor in my life.

242
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,860
Can you help me with this?

243
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,260
You have asked Yang

244
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,700
many times in high school.

245
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,060
Didn't have your paper.

246
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,780
You asked her not to report it.

247
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,740
You couldn't do computer programming.

248
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,900
You asked her for help.

249
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,060
Jiang Shiyan,

250
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,540
when the doctor stitched your wound,

251
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,900
he should've sewn your mouth shut.

252
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,660
Though you only didn't speak

253
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,540
for one night,

254
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,220
it feels like

255
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,260
it's been so long

256
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,820
since I've heard your voice.

257
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,700
Of course.

258
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,420
The appendix is also an organ.

259
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,460
Having it removed

260
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,260
does affect your voice to some extent.

261
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,740
Look how busy I am every day.

262
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,060
The planner called me.

263
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,780
Hello?

264
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,940
I'm in the hospital.

265
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,500
I wanted to make you
purple rice porridge,

266
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,620
but purple rice isn't easy to digest.

267
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,060
I thought about rice porridge,

268
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,900
but I felt rice

269
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,500
was too plain and tasteless,

270
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,860
so I added some millet.

271
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,340
How could you have millet at home?

272
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,780
I bought some yesterday

273
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,420
before the supermarket closed.

274
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,100
It tastes good.

275
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,620
You always

276
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,780
do things that make me happy.

277
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,620
It's not that I always do things

278
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,940
to make you happy.

279
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,900
These things

280
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,740
are actually inconsequential.

281
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,220
It's just I'm the one doing them,

282
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,340
so you always

283
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,420
foolishly feel particularly happy.

284
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,940
Based on your logic,

285
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,100
I'm just foolish

286
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,980
when I'm with you.

287
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,300
Aunt Yi didn't rest well.

288
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,780
Her hypertension flared up.

289
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,220
Yes.

290
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,140
Don't let her stay here

291
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,260
with you tonight.

292
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,140
I think so too.

293
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,940
Let her rest well.

294
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,780
Then...

295
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,940
How about...

296
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,940
Alright.

297
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,260
Okay.

298
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,220
I'm back.

299
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,020
Aunt Yi.

300
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,900
I noticed you didn't
sleep well yesterday.

301
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,460
Go home and rest well today.

302
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,500
I'll stay with him.

303
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,380
Yes, Mom, you rest.

304
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,860
Great. I can use a break.

305
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,820
My back is sore.

306
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,140
What are you saying? I'm here.

307
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,220
Let Aunt go rest.

308
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,260
No worries. I'll stay with him.

309
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,060
You still have to work.

310
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,660
I'll stay to watch him.

311
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,900
I...

312
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,220
It's fine at work.

313
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,380
The workload isn't heavy.

314
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,340
I'll just tell them

315
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,260
I'll be a bit late.

316
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,540
It's just an appendectomy.

317
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,620
Not a serious illness.

318
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,100
Why do you need to take leave?

319
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,940
No need for that.

320
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,860
Besides,

321
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,380
Yanan is not letting me go home.

322
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,220
I have nowhere to go.

323
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,220
I'm telling you.

324
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,500
You need to help me with this.

325
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,100
Or I'll have to stay here with him.

326
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,580
That's how it is.

327
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,700
You're usually

328
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
so careless.

329
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,500
He just had surgery.

330
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,740
I can take better care of him.

331
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,460
You're wrong.

332
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,540
You're a girl.

333
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,780
I'm a guy.

334
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,820
If he needs to use the toilet at night,

335
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,820
I can help him. What can you do?

336
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,580
Right, Tang.

337
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,620
You can't do this.

338
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,100
Well...

339
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,940
You're hungry, right?

340
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,380
- Hurry and eat.
- I can't do that.

341
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,100
Alright, then let's eat.

342
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,900
Aunt.

343
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,270
You...

344
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,700
There are buns here.

345
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,740
Which one do you want?

346
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,660
Pork and green onion.

347
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,700
Delicious.

348
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,980
Yang, you're so considerate.

349
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,380
- Great choice.
- Shut up.

350
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,340
(Sheng Nina)

351
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,020
The schedule for the livestream

352
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,140
has been released.

353
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,860
We're responsible from 10 am to 2 pm.

354
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,380
Oh, no live streams for Sheng Nina?

355
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,700
No.

356
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,380
She's in Milan for Fashion Week.

357
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,580
Her photos at the shows are everywhere.

358
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,260
- Mr. Cheng.
- Mr. Cheng.

359
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,620
Working overtime today?

360
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,620
No.

361
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,980
But we can if needed.

362
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,220
I'll treat everyone to a hotpot later.

363
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,180
Call the colleagues

364
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,260
from the tech department.

365
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,220
Do you need me to make a reservation?

366
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,180
Of course.

367
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,860
Well.

368
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,420
He's been in a good mood lately.

369
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,260
Yeah.

370
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,820
He was smiling just now.

371
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,940
I'll go reserve it.

372
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,900
I used to work at the branch

373
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,300
where Qinglai opened its account.

374
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,860
I checked the details.

375
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,220
Qinglai's salary payments have

376
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,780
sharply decreased in the last 3 months.

377
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,340
There are also rumors on the forums

378
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,980
about Qinglai delaying teacher salaries,

379
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,500
but it hasn't gained much attention.

380
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,980
Okay, keep following up.

381
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,060
Alright.

382
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,060
Director Tang.

383
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,020
The top wants to see you.

384
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,740
Ms. Tang, thanks for your efforts

385
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,780
on the Gu Zhishou case.

386
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,180
Thanks, Mr. Zhou.

387
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,340
The least I could do.

388
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,500
The ECIU also

389
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,180
holds you in high regard.

390
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,380
I heard Mr. Gan has been discharged

391
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,380
and will be back to work

392
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,260
in a couple of days.

393
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,140
How have you been? Busy lately?

394
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,940
It's okay. Just some routine matters.

395
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,340
What cases have you been busy with?

396
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,780
Mainly Qinglai Art Training

397
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,620
and some other microloans.

398
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,900
Qinglai Art Training is quite famous.

399
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,460
It's the largest art training center

400
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,820
in the Southwest region now.

401
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,460
They might even plan to go public.

402
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,100
Yes.

403
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,380
Vice President Gao

404
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,580
mentioned it during the meeting

405
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,460
yesterday.

406
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,420
He asked if we could ease

407
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,540
the requirements

408
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,380
and speed things up

409
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,860
for some quality borrowers.

410
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,260
Think about it.

411
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,740
Got it, President.

412
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,980
Qinglai's development

413
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,580
has been evident to everyone.

414
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,700
So, this loan expansion
isn't just a single case.

415
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,020
It's also an opportunity for us

416
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,140
to reestablish a long-term

417
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,820
strategic partnership.

418
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,980
Qinglai's salary payments

419
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,620
have decreased in the last three months.

420
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,140
There are also rumors on the forums

421
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,780
about Qinglai delaying teacher salaries.

422

(Credit Audit Division)

423
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,220
Qinglai is urging for progress again.

424
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,740
Actually,

425
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,860
it would be okay to approve it.

426
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,540
After all, the leaders'

427
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,700
attitudes are clear.

428
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,380
I want to take a couple of days off.

429
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,900
If they ask you,

430
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,740
just say

431
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,140
I'm not in the division.

432
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,500
Are you sure

433
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,060
not to approve it at all?

434
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,940
The written materials

435
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,140
look fine,

436
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,340
but I still feel like

437
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,060
there are probably significant issues.

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,980
(Rongcheng First People's Hospital)

439
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,140
Oh, my goodness.

440
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,660
What happened?

441
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,340
My ear hurts.

442
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,620
Your ear hurts.

443
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,220
Oh, my goodness.

444
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,060
What's wrong?

445
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,340
What's wrong with you?

446
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,180
Let's sleep, sleep.

447
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,500
What are you doing?

448
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,740
Want some barbecue?

449
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,580
Chicken feet?

450
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,340
Do I look like I can

451
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,820
eat barbecue right now?

452
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,820
Get lost.

453
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
How about noodles?

454
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,380
Some watermelon?

455
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,780
What's wrong?

456
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,900
Do you have to eat in my room?

457
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,020
Of course.

458
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,100
I won't be allowed

459
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,220
in the next ward.

460
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,300
I don't know them.

461
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,150
Hello?

462
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,140
You wouldn't believe

463
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,660
what I experienced these nights.

464
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,060
What?

465
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,020
Feng Weiran snores and grinds his teeth.

466
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,260
That's one thing.

467
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,580
But he came to me at midnight

468
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,780
and asked if I wanted a BBQ.

469
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,900
He scared me.

470
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,420
Not the crazy part.

471
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,620
At 4 am,

472
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,740
he ordered sour rice noodles

473
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,420
or luosifen...

474
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,260
I forgot.

475
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,260
It's not important.

476
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,500
He kept slurping noodles until dawn.

477
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,540
Oh, my goodness,

478
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,780
Let him go back.

479
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,820
I'll stay with you today.

480
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,460
Really?

481
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,540
You're really coming?

482
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,660
Yeah.

483
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,140
I took three days off,

484
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,420
plus the weekend,

485
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,380
so I can stay until you're discharged.

486
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,460
Why say "weekend"?

487
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,060
What?

488
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,620
What are you saying?

489
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,700
Saturday and Sunday, okay?

490
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,380
Okay, I'll wait for you.

491
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,220
Bye-bye.

492
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,340
How are you feeling?

493
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,260
Does it still hurt?

494
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,740
Good morning, doctor.

495
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,820
It doesn't hurt. I'm recovering well.

496
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,380
If there are no major issues,

497
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,700
you'll finish your IV
and go home to rest in the afternoon.

498
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,260
So quickly?

499
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,700
Of course. Appendicitis is

500
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
a minor surgery.

501
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,500
Many patients are discharged
within two days.

502
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,820
You've observed for an extra day.

503
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,620
But I feel like

504
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,220
I'm not quite recovered yet.

505
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,420
There's nothing wrong.

506
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,740
Just two indicators

507
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,100
are slightly elevated.

508
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,140
Is that so? I thought I should

509
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,620
be observed for two more days.

510
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,820
It's nothing serious.

511
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,220
Just go home and rest well.

512
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,740
Hey, Yang.

513
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,740
The doctor said
I go home this afternoon.

514
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,740
Maybe you don't need to come.

515
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,540
Let my mom come instead.

516
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,540
I'll talk to Aunt Yi

517
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,580
and tell her not to come.

518
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,380
I'll come to help you

519
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,420
with the procedures in the afternoon

520
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,460
and then take you home.

521
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,340
Okay.

522
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,820
How's it going?

523
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,980
The delivery guy called me

524
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,900
about the fruit. Did you order it?

525
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,100
It's for you.

526
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,980
Watermelon, green grapes, and mangoes.

527
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,020
All your favorites.

528
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,220
Come on.

529
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,940
Are you the patient or am I?

530
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,940
Who's being taken care of?

531
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,220
Isn't it the same?

532
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,660
Did you not sleep well last night?

533
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,620
I slept okay.

534
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,980
I got home before ten

535
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,820
last night.

536
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,420
I even messaged you.

537
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,380
Wait, didn't you reply to me?

538
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,620
You told me to go to bed early.

539
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,700
Right.

540
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,100
I was supposed to sleep

541
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,140
by nine,

542
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,020
but Feng Weiran woke me up.

543
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,780
How much longer does this IV need?

544
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
Probably half an hour.

545
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,500
Just this bottle?

546
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,860
Do you want to take a nap?

547
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,580
I'll keep an eye on it.

548
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,300
Let me adjust it.

549
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,940
What do you mean?

550
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,940
Are you asking me to comfort you?

551
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,900
Jiang Shiyan, since you got sick,

552
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,140
you've become a little kid.

553
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,580
Should I sing you a lullaby

554
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,180
and dance for you?

555
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,180
Hurry and sleep.

556
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,940
(Rongcheng First People's Hospital)
Bed 58.

557
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,740
Bed 58 is calling.

558
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,460
Bed 58 is calling.

559
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,100
Bed 58 is calling.

560
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,900
The IV for bed 58 is likely done.

561
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,940
You should check it out.

562
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,900
Okay.

563
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,420
Please press here.

564
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,260
Okay, thanks.

565
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,100
Alright.

566
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,660
He just napped a bit,

567
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,220

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,580
I mean being observed

585
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,260
in the hospital for another day

586
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,620

00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,020
I'll supplement it immediately.

757
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,380
I've been on leave for under a month,

758
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,780
and everyone's stopped working,

759
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,820
making a mess of things.

760
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,740
You two deputy directors

761
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,020
can't be the first

762
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,140
to claim honor

763
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,540
but stand by when it's time

764
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,700
to share responsibilities.

765
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,700
Director Gan,

766
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,580
the volume of processed cases this month

767
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,660
is perfectly normal.

768
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,500
No one has neglected their duties.

769
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,460
Is that so?

770
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,740
Then what's going on

771
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,580
with Qinglai's loan?

772
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,780
As soon as I got back,

773
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,740
President Gao found me

774
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,900
and said our division

775
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,580
was too inefficient

776
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,860
and lacked sensitivity to market

777
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,740
and customer needs.

778
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,620
What's going on?

779
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,420
Based on the last meeting,

780
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,940
it's in the normal process.

781
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,300
Right, Lianlang?

782
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,140
Yes.

783
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,020
We conducted a site visit

784
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,820
with the business specialists

785
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,820
and need to further

786
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,420
confirm some situations,

787
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,100
especially their payroll records.

788
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,580
Don't give me excuses.

789
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,180
Today, you must submit

790
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,540
the loan review report to me

791
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,580
before getting off work.

792
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,300
- But...
- But what?

793
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,620
But Ms. Tang is not here.

794
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,020
Someone in her family is sick,

795
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,340
so she took a few days off.

796
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,300
This is Deputy Tang's case.

797
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,180
She was responsible

798
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,620
for the pre-loan review,

799
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,660
and the report also needs her signature.

800
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,060
Call her.

801
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,700
Send her a message or an email.

802
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,180
You're not a caveman who needs

803
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,780
to tie knots to remember things.

804
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,340
Think before you act.

805
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,180
Okay?

806
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,940
Okay.

807
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,740
(Admission Management Regulations)

808
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
Sugar-free americano.

809
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,980
Thanks.

810
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,980
You haven't let Feng Weiran go home.

811
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,100
I feel like you're not
doing well either.

812
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,740
I don't know what's wrong.

813
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,780
I feel like I can't be happy at all.

814
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,300
Actually, Feng Weiran

815
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,620
has been doing quite well.

816
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,980
He orders flowers every day,

817
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,300
trying to make me happy.

818
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,260
When he's not on a business trip
or at work,

819
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,340
he picks up our son

820
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,340
and takes him out to eat.

821
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,700
But for some reason,

822
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,140
I just can't feel happy.

823
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,380
I'm not seriously ill, am I?

824
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,180
How could that be?
Don't say such things.

825
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,700
Think about it.

826
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,380
You met in high school,

827
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,180
started dating

828
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,500
after getting into college,

829
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
got married,

830
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,860
and had children after graduation.

831
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,340
You've been together for over a decade.

832
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,940
It's normal to hit a rough patch.

833
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,900
Maybe.

834
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,460
But Feng Weiran is

835
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,700
indeed getting busier now,

836
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,220
so we're often just busy

837
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,900
with our own things.

838
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,140
I don't have much to do,

839
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,580
so I think about what he's up to.

840
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,620
I ask him what he's doing,

841
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,900
but he doesn't explain it fully.

842
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,820
So, I just...

843
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
I don't know.

844
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,140
I just...

845
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,340
I just can't feel happy.

846
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,500
What were you doing

847
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,620
before having your son?

848
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,940
I was shining brightly

849
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,340
as an excellent designer.

850
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,860
- Did you feel happy?
- Yes.

851
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,100
- Fulfilled?
- Very fulfilled.

852
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,300
Then you should find a job.

853
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,140
I...

854
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,860
That'd be great.

855
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,340
I can do that.

856
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,540
But if I

857
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,460
find a job,

858
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,100
Feng Weiran and I will be busy

859
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,940
with our own things.

860
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,830
We'll have less time,

861
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,100
and we'll grow apart even more.

862
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,300
So, you feel like

863
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,780
you and Feng Weiran are

864
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,660
increasingly out of sync.

865
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,780
The issue

866
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,420
with the house is just...

867
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,460
A trigger.

868
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,300
Yes.

869
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,060
You need to consider

870
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,060
the issues behind it.

871
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,060
It seems like a bouquet of flowers

872
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,260
or a candlelit dinner

873
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
won't solve this.

874
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,260
Can you imagine

875
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,140
your life

876
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,420
without Feng Weiran?

877
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,220
Impossible.

878
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,340
How could that be? That's absurd.

879
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,540
Exactly.

880
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,300
So, hiding from him like this

881
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,060
and thinking by yourself

882
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,460
is pointless.

883
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,260
The biggest relationship taboo

884
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,420
is lack of communication.

885
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,300
I think you should

886
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,420
take all your thoughts

887
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,300
and talk to Feng Weiran

888
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,980
about them.

889
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,660
Maybe after you two communicate,

890
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,780
the issue will be resolved.

891
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,740
If it still doesn't work,

892
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,780
perhaps we can find

893
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,980
a marriage expert for you two.

894
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,580
That marriage expert said

895
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,060
that the scariest thing

896
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,740
in a marriage

897
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,980
is a fatal habituation.

898
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,180
He said when one person feels

899
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,380
that everything is taken for granted,

900
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,540
then the marriage

901
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,580
is heading toward death.

902
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,780
And he also asked me

903
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,060
whether

904
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,940
it's always me who apologizes

905
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,340
and backs down

906
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,580
when problems

907
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,980
or conflicts arise.

908
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,580
If that's the case,

909
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,500
she'd get used to it

910
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,980
and take me for granted.

911
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,660
So, this expert advised me

912
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,020
to do the opposite this time.

913
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,060
So what you mean is

914
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,780
that the expert told you not to go home,

915
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,620
not to apologize,

916
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,740
and just stay here?

917
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,580
No, no, no.

918
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,220
It's not that I shouldn't apologize.

919
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,420
I've been ordering flowers
for Yanan every day.

920
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,460
He thinks that this act

921
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,700
can show my patience

922
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,580
and express my apology.

923
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,220
But he needs me to demonstrate my stance

924
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,420
and my boundaries

925
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,500
in other ways.

926
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,420
That expert doesn't

927
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,420
have a grudge against you, right?

928
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,180
What grudge?

929
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,580
I don't even know him.

930
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,020
It's a course I found online.

931
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,020
How much does it cost?

932
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,220
I think

933
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,540
for one class, it's 50...

934
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,820
It's 68 for a class.

935
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,660
If you buy 5 classes, with a discount,

936
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,700
it's 300.

937
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,300
I only bought one class.

938
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,860
I listened to it,

939
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,660
and I feel like he's making a point.

940
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,420
What are you doing?

941
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,700
Wishing you happiness.

942
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,460
Thanks.

943
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,500
It's a change.

944
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,700
(Lianlang)

945
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,660
Aunt Yi.

946
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,700
Tang.

947
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,100
Yanan left?

948
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,940
Yes, she's going to pick up Qi.

949
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,220
Are you going back too?

950
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,860
Jiang Shiyan insisted that I go back

951
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,020
and said it'd be congested.

952
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,180
Can you heat up

953
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,380
that egg custard for him later?

954
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,580
Sure, don't worry.

955
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,620
By the way, I just asked the doctor.

956
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,100
He can be discharged tomorrow.

957
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,940
Yes.

958
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,140
- Bye.
- Okay.

959
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,420
There's a guest in the room

960
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,460
you should know.

961
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,780
Leaving now.

962
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,220
- Goodbye, Aunt.
- Goodbye.

963
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:43,620
(Fangping Seafood)

964
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,460
Tang.

965
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,940
You've been fooled.

966
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,460
This crab is so small.

967
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,420
It can't have any roe inside.

968
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,660
There's definitely no meat in the legs.

969
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,780
It's not even

970
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,180
the season for this crab.

971
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,140
He said this crab is great.

972
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,460
Didn't I tell you?

973
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,300
If you want to eat seafood,

974
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,740
just come to my stall.

975
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,300
Don't go to other places.

976
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,100
They think you're
a gullible little girl.

977
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,220
My stall has the freshest

978
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,180
and best seafood, you know?

979
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,020
No, no, no.

980
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,460
You look down on it?

981
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,820
No, Aunt Yi.

982
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,740
You always don't charge me.

983
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,580
When I go back,

984
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,220
Ms. Zhou will scold me.

985
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,980
You're really funny.

986
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,940
(Fangping Seafood)

987
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,220
Aunt, please don't give me this.

988
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,060
I...

989
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,580
These crab and shrimp

990
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,540
aren't worth anything here.

991
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,940
Jiang Shiyan said

992
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,220
that he scored

993
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,300
in the top thirty

994
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,740
of the entire grade in this exam.

995
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,140
I should be thanking you.

996
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,020
No, he worked hard.

997
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,020
No need to be polite.

998
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,300
No, Aunt, I can't.

999
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,620
Ms. Zhou will scold me.

1000
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,660
No, no.

1001
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,500
Take it back.

1002
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,580
I'm unhappy now.

1003
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,340
Then I'll take it.

1004
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,900
Okay, go.

1005
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,420
I really find it difficult.

1006
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,700
If I don't buy seafood from your place,

1007
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,500
Aunt Yi gets unhappy.

1008
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,780
If I buy it, she won't accept my money.

1009
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,460
When I go back and tell Ms. Zhou

1010
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,980
I buy seafood but don't pay,

1011
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,460
she'll educate me

1012
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,140
and force me to give this money

1013
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,100
to Aunt Yi.

1014
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,580
But Aunt Yi will refuse to take it.

1015
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,460
I really feel stuck.

1016
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,060
Yang, I have a solution.

1017
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,180
Tell me.

1018
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,020
You can buy seafood

1019
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,140
from our place as usual.

1020
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,020
If my mom refuses your money,

1021
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,900
you can give it to me.

1022
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,020
I'm Yi Fangping's son.

1023
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,900
Give it to you?

1024
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,740
Exactly.

1025
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,620
Then I'll take that money

1026
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,540
to treat you to other goodies.

1027
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,100
You can eat seafood at your place,

1028
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,620
and we can eat something else.

1029
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,660
I get what you mean.

1030
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,420
Oh my gosh, why are you so clever?

1031
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,620
How did you come up with this?

1032
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,300
It's because you helped me with math.

1033
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,460
Then I'll treat you to ice cream.
