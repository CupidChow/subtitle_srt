(Bella 4)

Meng and Bella's live stream popularity

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,930
has always been in the Top 3
during this time.

30
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,570
This time,
it dropped out of the Top 10.

31
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,410
The sales for Fengrun Food barely

32
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,040
reached half of the signed minimum.

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,850
- Mr. Feng.
- Fengrun wants

34
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,300
to halt annual cooperation.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,060
Get me a cup of coffee.

36
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,370
The top seller for Fengrun,

37
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,010
Peng Bobo and Yoyo.

38
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,180
Which company are they from?

39
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,990
I've never heard of them.

40
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,780
It's called Youbei.

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,890
A new company.

42
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,510
It's recently entered the food market.

43
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,850
That Peng Bobo

44
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,330
and Yoyo were always

45
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,830
outside the top thirty

46
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,180
but have recently surged.

47
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,170
Yue Ya and Youbei

48
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,230
have signed a contract.

49
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,920
Which company is Youbei?

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,970
Who is Yoyo?

51
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,670
I haven't heard of any of this.

52
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,530
Come on, everyone, listen to me.

53
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,250
Yi Xiu has the biggest discount

54
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,580
(Bella)
for Fengrun.

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,780
If you don't believe it, challenge me.

56
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,670
It's right here.

57
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,760
(Meng)
What Youbei and Peng Bobo?

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,710
What 60% off?

59
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,040
If you keep posting these,

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,060
you'll be kicked out.

61
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,460
I'm saying this.

62
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,810
It's impossible.

63
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,860
You can go check it out.

64
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,460
Betraying us. Interesting.

65
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,580
Should we notify HR?

66
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,740
(Jiang Shiyan)

67
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,440
Hello?

68
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,460
I know. Don't worry.

69
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,900
Mr. Jiang means

70
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,430
to keep it low-key.

71
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,650
Okay.

72
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,810
Since Jiujing Investment's acquisition,

73
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,170
in the first three quarters,

74
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,760
(Jiujiang Group)
the net profit is

75
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,880
293 million.

76
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,550
A year-on-year growth of 117%.

77
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,570
(Wei Changqiu, Chairman)
This net profit

78
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,550
has increased by 98%.

79
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,920
Our joint loan agreement

80
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,050
with Pengxing, Huishang,

81
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,430
and Jiansheng banks

82
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,520
is now

83
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
in the final stages.

84
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,950
The groundwork has been well laid,

85
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,580
but we can't slack off

86
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,740
on the follow-up work.

87
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,430
The joint loan is our stepping stone.

88
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,970
We mustn't forget

89
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,270
why we started this.

90
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,050
The loan for Linjiang Phase I

91
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,320
is 2.1 billion.

92
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,340
We're always pressured.

93
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,900
We can't let this loan

94
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,710
tie up our funds,

95
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,750
so we need to activate our capital.

96
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,420
Keep a close eye on Huishang.

97
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,850
Understood.

98
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,010
Everyone knows my relationship

99
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,310
with Gan Yiming.

100
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,390
My influence is very limited.

101
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,310
So, Mr. Zhou, it'll trouble you.

102
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,450
Sure.

103
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,410
They've just transferred
a new deputy director

104
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,270
to the audit division.

105
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,870
Seems to be appointed by headquarters.

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,420
Her name is Tang Yang.

107
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,600
Ms. Wei,

108
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,310
Tang Yang is my junior.

109
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,900
You can trust her.

110
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,850
Ms. Tang,

111
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,370
the cases from yesterday

112
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,460
are all recorded.

113
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,750
Here are the special cases.

114
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,900
Here are the regular ones.

115
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,020
I've screened the special ones for you.

116
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,340
I've left the ones for you on your desk.

117
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,930
Some cases

118
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,250
have been returned

119
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,660
and then resubmitted,

120
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,190
so I removed those directly.

121
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,930
Working with credit auditing

122
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,880
isn't like working with tech

123
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,900
and investments.

124
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,460
We deal with a lot
of miscellaneous cases.

125
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,190
Now it's a lifetime thing.

126
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,690
We're not keen

127
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,980
on those leftover cases,

128
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,580
let alone you.

129
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,510
I still need to take a look,

130
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,770
so please help me

131
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,750
retrieve them.

132
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,680
Okay.

133
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,020
But I did it quickly.

134
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,510
Maybe it's gone to the client.

135
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,280
Some branches are more efficient,

136
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,810
so they may have gone to the clients,

137
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,280
while others might

138
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,950
take another day or two.

139
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,460
Alright, thank you.

140
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,420
No problem.

141
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,010
I'm new here.

142
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,710
I don't know many things here.

143
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,240
I just want to get familiar

144
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,270
with everything.

145
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,510
Sorry.

146
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,340
Thanks for your help, though.

147
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,660
Oh, don't mention it.

148
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,390
I overstepped it.

149
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,900
If there's nothing else,

150
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,220
I'll take my leave.

151
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,530
Linlang,

152
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,100
I just looked at your profile.

153
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,780
It seems I'm a bit older than you.

154
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,150
You can just call me Yang

155
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,770
since we'll be

156
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,510
working together a lot.

157
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,330
Okay.

158
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,480
You have a cold?

159
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:58,970
Director Gan.

160
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,150
I caught a chill last night.

161
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,680
Let me have a look.

162
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,830
Your hands are so cold.

163
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,050
No, no, no.

164
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,400
If it's nothing, I'll leave.

165
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,270
Thanks, Director Gan.

166
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:19,980
Director Gan.

167
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,220
I'm having lunch.

168
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,630
Eating this late?

169
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,460
Yeah, I organized the documents.

170
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,540
Any thoughts?

171
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,970
I remember your cases.

172
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,020
We can discuss them.

173
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,220
There's actually a microloan.

174
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,570
The applicant is Zhang Zhilan,

175
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,980
who runs a snack shop.

176
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,560
She's a single mother

177
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,490
with two kids

178
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,750
and her mother-in-law,

179
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,880
but her family's annual income

180
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,070
is under 100,000.

181
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,390
Her house is appraised at 90,000,

182
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,800
but she's applying

183
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,840
for a loan of 600,000,

184
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,220
which exceeds by nearly 6 times.

185
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,210
That's not feasible.

186
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,750
It can't be done.

187
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,360
This case just

188
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,630
came to me.

189
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,200
It's a filler case

190
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,830
from the branch,

191
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,150
refused and resubmitted again,

192
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,900
with all sorts of purposes,

193
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,070
like business expansion

194
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,400
and equipment repairs.

195
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,440
It's been back and forth

196
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,340
for nearly half a year.

197
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,980
You can just return it.

198
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,840
Have we done a site visit?

199
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,420
This can't go on like this.

200
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,440
Our division

201
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,640
is a business department.

202
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,750
We're short-staffed
with heavy workloads,

203
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,310
so our limited energy

204
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,340
should go to useful places.

205
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,780
That's true.

206
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,230
Drink more water.

207
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,730
Thanks, Director Gan.

208
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,570
Okay.

209
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,170
For two and three,

210
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,610
if I play this one

211
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,490
and get this one...

212
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,900
I'll play this one.

213
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,020
I was really foolish.

214
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,130
Back then,

215
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,630
I could've played Two of Bamboo

216
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,130
and gotten a flush.

217
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,020
I would've won.

218
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,680
(Thoughts now; Post)
How could I play

219
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,850
(Pumpkin's paintings.)
those?

220
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,100
(I heard he's having an exhibition.)
I played terribly.

221
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,320
(I wonder if I can)
Whatever.

222
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,880
(to collect a piece.)
Winning is good.

223
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,750
But I didn't win.

224
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,800
Not only that,

225
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,090
I screwed up here.

226
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,610
Character of Eight helped others.

227
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,130
What do you think? Am I silly?

228
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,590
No worries. I'll reimburse you.

229
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,020
It's not just about that.

230
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,730
My technique and mindset

231
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,660
is too green.

232
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,420
I'll reflect on that too.

233
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,040
You can't deny it.

234
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,210
Your Aunt Yi is really

235
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,060
good at this.

236
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,530
She often sings that song.

237
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,370
What's it called?

238
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,090
♪One step forward is a big win♪

239
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,510
♪One step back is a small win♪

240
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,430
(Sudden news)
She has a flair for this.

241
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,960
("Yi Xiu Wins")
I'll learn from her

242
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,940
(Many Honors)
to keep up.

243
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:57,860
(WeChat; Just now:
1 unread message from Tang Yang)

244
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,280
(Tang Yang)
Congratulations.

245
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,780
Let me take a look at the trophy.

246
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,820
(Jiang Shiyan)
Ten yuan to look.

247
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:04,990
Two hundred to touch.

248
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,140
(Tang Yang; Waits for a response)

249
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,390
Good evening, Mr. Jiang.

250
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,350
Good evening, Ms. Tang.

251
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,180
Hello, Jiang.

252
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,750
Good evening, Ms. Zhou.

253
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,440
Can I take a look at your trophy?

254
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,350
What does it look like?

255
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,900
Shouldn't you see me first?

256
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,020
To express how you miss your friend.

257
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,770
I saw you. I'm looking at you now.

258
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,820
Show me the trophy now.

259
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,270
Jiang, you won an award.

260
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,520
Let me see your trophy too.

261
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,360
Quick, quick.

262
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,470
Ms. Zhou, it's here.

263
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,900
This is for Top Ten

264
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,630
Emerging Internet Companies.

265
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,130
This is for Top Ten Business Models.

266
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,170
- Impressive.
- This award from Wealth List

267
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,470
is quite prestigious.

268
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,630
Keep it up.

269
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,700
Ms. Zhou, I'm feeling shy.

270
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,210
So impressive.

271
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,420
I need to analyze this well.

272
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,450
Gotta keep pushing in Mahjong.

273
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,060
How many days for the business trip?

274
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,230
I have a banquet to attend later.

275
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,060
I'll meet two groups tomorrow.

276
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,450
Back the day after.

277
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,660
The day after?

278
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,040
I ordered some

279
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,330
dried tangerine peel for my mom.

280
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,350
Do you need some?

281
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,540
Thanks, Yang.

282
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,300
See you at Alley Hotpot.

283
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,520
No problem.

284
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
By the way,

285
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,060
any blind dates lately?

286
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,060
Absolutely no way.

287
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,610
It's just too exhausting.

288
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,880
The pressure is too much.

289
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,840
My hair is falling out

290
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,350
in clumps.

291
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,770
And Director Gan

292
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,760
in our division

293
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
never speaks clearly,

294
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,180
always making me guess.

295
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,450
More blind dates

296
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,150
will make me bald.

297
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,660
I'll think about it

298
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,510
at least after the new year.

299
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,270
The spirit of the contract

300
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,510
is fundamental to life.

301
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,940
You promised me

302
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,370
at least once a month

303
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,110
for no less than four hours.

304
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,110
During times like this,

305
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,640
I'm especially grateful.

306
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,600
Ms. Zhou wrote

307
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,970
a 100,000-word thesis

308
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,390
after reading "Du Contrat Social",

309
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,350
while my mom

310
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,990
fell asleep once she

311
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,420
saw that book.

312
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,640
Yang,

313
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,490
in front of the erudite

314
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,510
Ms. Zhou,

315
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,270
you can only surrender.

316
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,600
You think you can just sit there

317
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,940
and enjoy my pain?

318
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,110
I'm telling you.

319
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,540
If I go on a blind date,

320
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,250
you'll have to go with me

321
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,490
for hours.

322
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,900
I'll definitely drag you down.

323
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,760
Honestly,

324
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,900
I've never seen anyone talk

325
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,420
about finding extras so greatly.

326
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,170
Alright.

327
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,990
I need to dry my hair and head out.

328
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,270
Bye, I'm hanging up.

329
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,540
You go ahead, bye.

330
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,820
Here, have some fruit.

331
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,720
Okay.

332
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,590
(Why do I feel a bit hot?)

333
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,630
This feeling is really strange.

334
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,700
Nina, look over here, Nina.

335
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,990
You go ahead first.

336
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,600
No photos here.

337
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,640
- Don't go.
- Stop it.

338
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
Take a look back.

339
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,520
Stop it.

340
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,870
No photos here.

341
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,470
So scary.

342
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,880
That guy in the black hoodie again.

343
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,490
He was at the last meeting too.

344
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,900
Security dragged him away.

345
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,300
It's him again?

346
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,080
Why does he know

347
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,920
my home address?

348
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,590
Ju, you need to tell Xingyue about this.

349
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,020
Report it to the cops

350
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,290
and ask

351
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,490
for the surveillance footage

352
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,330
for the police.

353
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,420
Alright, got it.

354
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,970
Nina.

355
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,370
The driver in that nearby car

356
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,850
seems to be wearing

357
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,700
a black hoodie.

358
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,060
Is he following us?

359
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,400
Ignore him.

360
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,060
Find a chance to lose him.

361
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,700
He's taking pictures.

362
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,020
What a weirdo.

363
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,340
(Picking up an item)

364
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,540
(Scan the code for the item)

365
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,690
Throw this away.

366
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,600
Just got it.

367
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,090
I'll test it in a bit

368
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,270
and send the data to the lab.

369
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,760
Alright, bye.

370
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,370
I haven't seen that car since then.

371
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,350
He didn't follow us.

372
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,240
Okay.

373
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,540
My phone is in the car.

374
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,900
I'll go get it for you.

375
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,240
I'll head up first.

376
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,500
(Yi Xiu Tank; Food Think Tank)

377
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,780
Please delete that, thanks.

378
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,110
I told you to delete it.

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,090
It's been several times.

380
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,230
Is this never-ending?

381
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,260
You've even got a Yi Xiu card?

382
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,550
Impressive.

383
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,310
What do you want to shoot?

384
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,320
Ugly face and poor condition?

385
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,110
Who's trying to outshine me here?

386
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,490
Eight months without acting.

387
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,660
You want to film how lost I am?

388
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,320
Maybe I've gained weight

389
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,350
from drinking some water.

390
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,360
My belly is bulging.

391
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,460
Maybe I'm pregnant?

392
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,310
Stalking me, huh?

393
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,600
What if something happens?

394
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,590
You'd love that, right?

395
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,960
I'm...

396
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,030
I'm talking to you!

397
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,250
You must

398
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,790
delete that photo today.

399
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,250
It's broken.

400
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,070
No worries. I'll pay you back.

401
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,420
But I'm telling you.

402
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,830
I've called the police.

403
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,740
This is a private company.

404
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,170
Stalking me with this kind

405
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,210
of hidden camera here

406
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,790
seriously threatens my safety.

407
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,630
You can't leave
before the police arrive.

408
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,030
- Cheng.
- The police...

409
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,070
Good morning, Miss Sheng.

410
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,730
By the way, the code rollout

411
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,800
came out one-third short

412
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,980
of what we expected.

413
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,420
What cool glasses are you wearing?

414
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
VR glasses

415
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,940
with thermal imaging.

416
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,970
With the software,

417
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,700
it can directly generate data models.

418
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,980
How did this get broken?

419
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,770
Some people's brains

420
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,150
can't control their limbs properly.

421
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,550
Do you really work here?

422
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,980
So you don't recognize me?

423
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,640
Is that a crime?

424
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,550
Not really a crime.

425
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,800
A misunderstanding.

426
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,630
This morning, someone
was secretly filming me.

427
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,180
He dressed exactly like you.

428
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,980
Is wearing this outfit a crime?

429
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,740
I'll buy you the glasses to compensate.

430
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,870
You can't buy them in the market.

431
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,790
Nina, over here.

432
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,500
Why are you with Mr. Cheng?

433
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,880
Mr. Cheng?

434
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,450
Cheng Hui.

435
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,900
Another partner at Yi Xiu.

436
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,830
Why have I never seen him before?

437
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,890
I hear he's a top-tier tech expert.

438
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,890
He shows up when he wants

439
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,260
and disappears when he doesn't.

440
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,400
Where's Mr. Jiang?

441
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,400
He's on a business trip.
I just went over

442
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,790
the upcoming process with Mr. Feng.

443
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,810
Take a look.

444
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,260
Is this what Tang sent you?

445
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,260
You found out.

446
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,740
I thought it was just

447
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,890
tangerine peels.

448
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,500
No need to send it.

449
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,010
When He from the dance troupe

450
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,290
sent me dance costumes,

451
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,180
he told me

452
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,550
tangerine peel was gold.

453
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,310
The older, the more expensive.

454
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,030
Without heartfelt friendship,

455
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,980
it's impossible to give this.

456
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,850
Wait a minute.

457
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,700
Did you go get lip fillers?

458
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,390
Isn't it good to maintain a good mood?

459
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,310
I smelt it. What are you making?

460
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,740
Fotiaoqiang.

461
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,700
I've been saying I'd make it for Tang.

462
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,770
Now that she's back,

463
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,110
I need to practice right away.

464
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,530
Your son just got back.

465
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,370
Nothing for me?

466
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,660
Look. It's here.

467
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,030
Let me wash my hands.

468
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,260
I remember

469
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,740
one time I made

470
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,080
Fotiaoqiang

471
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,180
for you,

472
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,460
and it turned out...

473
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,330
That time.

474
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,390
It's so fun.

475
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,180
The meatballs weren't cooked.

476
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,830
You ended up
with a three-day stomachache.

477
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,790
Was it three days?

478
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,900
Right, three days.

479
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,490
This time,

480
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,210
it's perfect

481
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,870
with the timing.

482
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,220
There should be no problem.

483
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,660
I'm thinking

484
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,120
I have to practice

485
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,590
more often.

486
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,770
Once I reach

487
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,220
an edible level,

488
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,120
I'll make it for Tang

489
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,030
and give her a big surprise.

490
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,690
If it's inedible, then I...

491
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,030
Of course, you can eat it.

492
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
You can try it.

493
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,700
Come on. Try it.

494
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,570
Try it.

495
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,880
Son.

496
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,450
Tang is back this time,

497
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,080
so I won't rush you to go

498
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,980
on blind dates.

499
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,880
She's back.

500
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,360
Does that have anything

501
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,760
to do with my blind dates?

502
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,310
Of course, it's directly related.

503
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,970
Tang is single at her age now

504
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,220
because she wants it.

505
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,870
You're single now is just your fate.

506
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,740
Can't you

507
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,410
learn a little?

508
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,120
Learn from Tang

509
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,030
to develop a likable personality.

510
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,110
That way,

511
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,800
I can introduce you to someone.

512
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,900
Otherwise, it's all for nothing.

513
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,830
I have a bad feeling.

514
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,110
By the time Feng Weiran

515
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,500
becomes a grandpa,

516
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,170
you'll still be single.

517
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,420
- Still single.
- Well.

518
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,930
Shouldn't they learn

519
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,410
from my carefree attitude?

520
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,040
Right? I live so freely.

521
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,660
He's always anxious.

522
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,770
Let me ask you.

523
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,010
Do you know

524
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,490
if I should put winter bamboo shoots

525
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,310
or vermicelli first in Fotiaoqiang?

526
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,700
How would I know?

527
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,310
I knew you wouldn't know.

528
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,260
I just wanted an excuse to scold you.

529
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,080
Your brain is just...

530
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,930
So foolish.

531
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,550
Just so foolish.

532
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,460
If it weren't for Tang,

533
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,220
you wouldn't have gotten into college.

534
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,500
You're a complete waste!

535
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,080
Tang Yang and Yi Fangping.

536
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,150
Hit me harder and harder.

537
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,660
What did I do in my past life?

538
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,830
Hey, Jiang Shiyan, what's up?

539
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,570
Tang Yang,

540
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,500
have you ever faced despair?

541
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,730
What's wrong?

542
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,460
I sensed something off in your tone.

543
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,350
Didn't you just get home?

544
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,690
Did you argue with Aunt Yi,

545
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,530
or is it just

546
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,790
work stress?

547
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,600
I...

548
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,650
What's wrong?

549
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,980
Don't scare me.

550
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,650
Well, tell me where you are.

551
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,180
I'll find you. Let's talk in person.

552
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,980
Do you remember

553
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,550
the big dog at my door

554
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,560
that always barks at me?

555
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,630
Did it bite you?

556
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,330
It...

557
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,120
What's wrong? Just tell me.

558
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,960
Hurry.

559
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,080
It trampled the gift

560
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,980
I prepared for you.

561
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,450
So, as compensation,

562
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,450
can you get me a piece

563
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,650
of the honey cake you love

564
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,660
to comfort me?

565
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,110
Are you serious?

566
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,030
What kind of logic is that?

567
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,010
It trampled my gift,

568
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,590
so I should treat you to cake?

569
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,520
Go wash up and sleep.

570
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,830
Dreams have everything.

571
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
I...

572
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,730
You have three seconds to finish,

573
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,570
or I'll hang up.

574
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,180
I'm downstairs at your place.

575
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,220
How did you end up outside my place?

576
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,120
But I think

577
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,450
our friendship doesn't deserve

578
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,310
my time to come down, right?

579
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,390
Is that so?

580
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,650
Then I'll just

581
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,730
call Ms. Zhou.

582
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,700
I'll ask her,

583
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,320
"Is Tang Yang next to you?"

584
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,770
"She just yelled at me for no reason."

585
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,980
"I don't know what I did wrong, Aunt.”

586
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Alright, alright.

587
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,170
Got it, got it.

588
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,120
You win this round.

589
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,960
I'll be right down.

590
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,200
Bye-bye.

591
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,090
Forget it.

592
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,570
What's wrong?

593
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,290
Since you're so stingy

594
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,550
and don't want to treat me,

595
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,260
I'll treat you instead.

596
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,010
Do you really think

597
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,210
a piece of honey cake

598
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,840
can change a materialistic woman's

599
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,460
decision to block you?

600
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,740
Then add two more dishes.

601
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,070
What about a grand feast?

602
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,460
That might be difficult.

603
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,740
The tangerine peel smells great.
Thanks, Ms. Tang.

604
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,260
Why are you being so polite?

605
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,940
Sorry.

606
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,920
Hello.

607
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,390
Wait a moment.

608
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,120
Can you grab something

609
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,960
from the backseat?

610
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,120
Come on.

611
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,050
Aren't you right here?

612
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,930
Just go get it.

613
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,770
I...

614
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,800
Alright, I'll go.

615
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,790
Sure.

616
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,350
What's going on?

617
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,500
Isn't it us?

618
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,600
Yeah.

619
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,220
(Pumpkin)

620
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,740
Aren't his paintings not for sale?

621
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,250
I also heard he's going

622
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,840
to hold an exhibition
after the New Year.

623
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,260
It might even go up for auction.

624
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,010
I helped him once,

625
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,180
so he owes me.

626
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,700
Oh, my gosh.

627
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,930
I'm getting emotional.

628
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,800
Oh, my gosh.

629
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,650
Then...

630
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,030
What is this?

631
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,800
This is about that day...

632
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,980
You were chased by a dog.

633
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,490
Ms. Yi makes me learn from you

634
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,970
how to be likable.

635
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,520
Her nagging is so annoying.

636
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,390
So, I wanted to show some sincerity

637
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,460
to learn from you.

638
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,010
But how did you know

639
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,390
my lipstick shade?

640
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,550
I have eyes.

641
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,120
Now I understand

642
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,080
why you can be so annoying

643
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,900
yet still get along with girls.

644
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,070
You just can't say nice things.

645
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,600
Fine.

646
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,890
You're the first one

647
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,890
to gift me lipstick

648
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,890
and high heels.

649
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,590
I won't hold it against you.

650
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,530
Do I look good?

651
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,550
Song Jing never gave you?

652
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,160
No.

653
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,150
That's just his personality.

654
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,500
You know.

655
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,980
It's not that he's bad.

656
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,170
He was quite caring

657
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,110
when we were together.

658
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,500
But...

659
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,660
Sorry.

660
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,070
Why say sorry?

661
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,890
I...

662
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,180
I just find it a bit wistful.

663
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Think about it.

664
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,660
We used to be so close.

665
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,870
Now it's been
eight years without contact.

666
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:35,770
- I...
- Yes.

667
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,250
Love is an instant

668
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,350
emotional bubble.

669
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,980
Friendship lasts forever.

670
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,010
Breaking the bond of friendship

671
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,420
is a huge challenge

672
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,180
for both people.

673
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,740
Looking back,

674
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,030
I really regret it.

675
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,150
There must be a difference

676
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,250
between having

677
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,650
a history and just being friends.

678
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,700
Yes.

679
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,460
The difference is

680
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,790
friends can always stay friends,

681
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,250
but for those who've been in love,

682
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,320
when love disappears,

683
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,030
they can't be friends anymore.

684
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,120
Yang.

685
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,700
That's long been behind me.

686
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,390
It's been so long.

687
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,490
The past dissipates with a puff.

688
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,870
Don't take it to heart.

689
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,110
Alright, I'll head up first.

690
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,050
I'll help you take it back.

691
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,940
No, it's fine.

692
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,660
You must be tired
from your business trip.

693
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,500
Go rest early.

694
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,900
You take care too.

695
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,940
Alright, I'm leaving.

696
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,830
It's just a piece of honey cake.

697
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,500
Give me.

698
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,960
Choose.

699
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,420
Cake.

700
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,840
Wait. You gave this to me.

701
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,030
Why should I refuse?

702
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,290
Bye.

703
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,220
I wanted us to eat together.

Nina's manager,

748
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,390
Wang Xingyue, is here.

749
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,630
Let's go and discuss it.

750
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,210
This meeting is mainly

751
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,410
about reviewing the last

752
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,900
and preparing for the next.

753
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:26,870
Peng Si can handle it.

754
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,310

755
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,940
on having you there.

756
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,550
I'm telling you. This is serious.

757
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,800
It's not for discussion.

758
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,660
Not that simple.

759
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,740
Okay, dear, I got it.

760
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,460
Don't worry. I'll head back early.

761
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,830
We'll have dinner together.

762
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,730
Sheng Nina's last two live stream

763
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,900
went really well.

764
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,980
Here are the data for review.

765
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,560
Her total sales

766
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,840
(Jiang: Dinner together?)
and

767
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,170
the increase in follower count

768
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,870
are always at the Top 10 of Yi Xiu.

769
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,800
Some categories' total sales

770
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,650
even surpassed

771
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,120
Yi Xiu's sales records,

772
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,070
like Rosemary.

773
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,970
We have a movie coming

774
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,150
at the end of the month,

775
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,080
so the schedule for future live streams

776
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,760
can't be confirmed right away.

777
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,470
It'll depend on the film's schedule.

778
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,970
But if the timing is uncertain,

779
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,640
the live streams will be interrupted.

780
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,010
As for our shopping festival...

781
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,380
After all, she's an actress.

782
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,770
We've discussed it.

783
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,510
Her acting should take priority.

784
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,700
Can we have a chat?

785
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,000
Sure.

786
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,860
Xingyue, we'd like to know

787
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,520
if you're unsatisfied

788
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,410
with any aspects

789
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,700
or the effectiveness.

790
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,640
If so, feel free to let us know.

791
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,810
We can make immediate adjustments.

792
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,160
Mr. Jiang, that's not the case.

793
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,700
We have no complaints.

794
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,080
The changes

795
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,680
in product selection

796
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,530
have visibly improved the popularity

797
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,950
of the live streams and Nina.

798
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,010
But as I mentioned earlier,

799
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,470
she is still an actress.

800
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,930
This upcoming movie

801
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,630
will require a lot of her energy.

802
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,430
How long will this movie take?

803
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,600
Now, the schedule is

804
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,490
120 days.

805
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,510
That's quite a long time.

806
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,650
Yes.

807
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,990
It's a big production.

808
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:15,950
Can you disclose

809
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,470
which director it is?

810
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,370
We've signed
a confidentiality agreement.

811
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,700
Mr. Jiang, wait for the news.

812
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,210
Alright.

813
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:25,810
Then

814
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,340
I'll discuss it with Mr. Feng

815
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,180
and get back to you.

816
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,510
Okay, I'll go now.

817
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,680
She's clearly trying to back out,

818
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,030
not willing to continue.

819
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,640
You call and ask

820
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,850
your entertainment chief.

821
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:46,690
Get her opinion.

822
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,960
Right.

823
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:52,860
Hello, dear.

824
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,120
I might be home a bit late tonight.

825
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,110
Let me ask you.

826
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,210
(Tang Yang)
Overtime.

827
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,520
Let's have a meeting.

828
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,550
Mr. Feng, what happened to Mr. Jiang?

829
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,730
Don't ask.

830
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,880
Tang Yang.

831
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,720
Senior, what are you doing here?

832
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,550
I'm here to handle the joint loan.

833
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:22,770
What about you?

834
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,860
I'm going downstairs to mail something.

835
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,700
What's the plan later?

836
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:28,950
How about dinner?

837
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,450
Today is great.

838
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,990
I wanted to celebrate your return.

839
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,860
I had something planned,

840
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,740
but it's fine.

841
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,820
It's a rare chance.

842
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,970
Let me treat you to dinner.

843
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,160
Should've done it a year ago.

844
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,820
It's dragged on to today.

845
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,640
How about tonight?

846
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,480
I'll treat you.

847
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,400
Sure.

848
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,720
I'm going to the top floor

849
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,600
to meet someone.

850
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,450
Send me the address.

851
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,290
See you later.

852
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,470
Alright, no problem.

853
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,010
I'll head down now.

854
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,850
Okay.

855
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,120
We've captured and analyzed

856
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,330
the high-frequency comments

857
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,380
about Sheng Nina

858
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,120
and the key terms

859
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,550
about online public opinion.

860
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,600
Sheng Nina's image

861
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,680
isn't right

862
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,520
for live streams.

863
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,680
Live streams are lively,

864
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,660
but she's reserved.

865
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,340
(From Tang Yang)
It's about rhythms.

866
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,200
(Tang)
Not expressions.

867
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,970
I'll treat a friend to dinner.
You coming?

868
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,990
These don't matter.

869
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,010
If she stops for 120 days,

870
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,120
it'll mean

871
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,470
all our investments are wasted,

872
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,530
like marketing,

873
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,370
promotions,

874
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,520
and the entire service team

875
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,820
we've set up for her.

876
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,470
Which friend?

877
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,600
Can I tag along?

878
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,680
Regarding the resumption

879
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,080
after the film wraps,

880
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,990
that's still uncertain.

881
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,300
(Tang Yang: Xiaobei Soup)

882
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,510
They want to back out.

883
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,550
You finally wake up, bro.

884
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,180
My wife just said

885
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,200
that Sheng Nina does not

886
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,290
lead in the movie.

887
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,220
It's just a cameo.

888
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,730
- What schedule?
- If I can't,

889
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,070
we can meet next time.

890
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,980
Don't worry about me.

891
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,220
We wanted this to work,

892
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,870
so the terms are generous.

893
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,290
(Tang Yang)
If she continues

894
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,520
- I sent it.
- to find excuses

895
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,430
- Come.
- to dawdle,

896
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,550
- Thank you for the gift.
- we can...

897
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,850
Perfect plan.

898
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,720
I'm so clever.

899
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,070
Then the collaboration

900
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,780
is basically over.

901
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,740
(Tang Yang)

902
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,340
Why are you laughing?

903
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,680
Cooperation should be

904
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,910
based on mutual benefit.

905
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,560
If there are issues,

906
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,220
it's clearly a conflict of interest.

907
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,080
We just need to resolve that conflict.

908
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,110
It will be settled.

909
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,110
I've thought about this.

910
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,640
I'll need some data.

911
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,480
I'll send it.

912
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,820
Meeting next Monday.

913
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,080
Aren't you working overtime?

914
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,970
Overtime is canceled.

915
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,820
Meeting next Monday.

916
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,970
I ordered Mr. Jiang and Mr. Feng's

917
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,380
favorite eel rice.

918
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,300
I won't eat it. I'll go home.

919
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,520
What about the extra two portions?

920
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,510
That's such a waste.

921
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,720
The joint loan took

922
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,910
over three months,

923
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,820
but we had to force it through.

924
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,550
Because of the quota?

925
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,070
Let me show you something.

926
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,130
Look at this.

927
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,300
I'll come over here.

928
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,250
Okay.

929
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,690
See this?

930
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,550
I was working on this recently.

931
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,290
And these below as well.

932
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,130
Do you see it?

933
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,700
Jiang Shiyan.

934
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,970
Who is this?

935
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,070
Isn't that my Yang?

936
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,660
How did you get hurt so badly?

937
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,380
It's just a small injury.

938
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,150
Nothing serious.

939
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,530
Are you crazy?

940
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,030
Wait a minute, be careful.

941
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,120
I can give you money if you need it.

942
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,040
I can cover all that.

943
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,070
Why did you go working?

944
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,950
You're hurt so bad.

945
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,450
What will you do

946
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,450
if you get a scar?

947
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,080
Will I get a scar?

948
