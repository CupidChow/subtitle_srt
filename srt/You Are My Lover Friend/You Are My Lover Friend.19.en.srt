27
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,280
Qinglai's loan this time

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,230
is to help the company

29
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,330
enter the national market.

30
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,400
Their next plan is to first establish

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,360
three stores

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,690
and five franchise stores.

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Director Qin,

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
I heard you speak

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,000
at the meeting.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,660
Seems like you're familiar with Qinglai.

37
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,780
I wouldn't say familiar.

38
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,550
Back when Qinglai first applied

39
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,310
for a loan with CBBC,

40
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,300
I was in charge of it.

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,750
But it wasn't approved

42
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,300
during the review meeting.

43
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,400
Later, Qinglai became

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,000
a leading brand in the industry,

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,590
so this issue has been something

46
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,340
of a sore spot for President Gao.

47
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,710
Qinglai's development

48
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,250
has been evident to everyone.

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,530
In terms of market share,

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,040
they're far ahead

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,690
of their competitors.

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,400
So, this loan expansion

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,780
isn't just a single case.

54
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,290
It's also an opportunity for us

55
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,520
to reestablish a long-term

56
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,250
strategic partnership.

57
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,900
Do you get it, Ms. Tang?

58
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,270
It seems I forgot to bring

59
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,870
the credit report and bank statements.

60
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,900
I'll go get them.

61
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,060
Qinglai's founder, Liu Qingqing,

62
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,730
knows Vice President Gao.

63
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,940
Though the loan didn't go through,

64
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,320
now they've got

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,530
a real brand

66
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,100
and performance.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,730
The government has tightened

68
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,970
regulations on educational training,

69
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,080
and they have

70
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,620
legitimate credentials.

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
So, they've chosen

72
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,150
the right time

73
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,660
to expand.

74
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,680
Do you think Vice President Gao

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,380
will want us to speed up the process?

76
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,710
This case

77
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,710
should've gone

78
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,010
to Gan Yiming,

79
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,180
but since he's in the hospital,

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,900
it ended up on your plate.

81
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,900
Hello, Chang Xinyi.

82
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,670
Xinyi.

83
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,950
Tang Yang.

84
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,640
Please have a seat.

85
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,460
Hello, what would you like to drink?

86
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,180
Soda water is fine.

87
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,530
- Okay.
- Thank you.

88
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,100
Why did you suddenly contact me?

89
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,900
I need your help with something.

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,160
What is it?

91
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,730
It's about Jiang Shiyan.

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
Let's go.

93
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,630
Qi.

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,870
Do you know what to say

95
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,410
when you see your mom later?

96
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,170
No.

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,470
It's been days since you met her.

98
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,490
Don't you miss her?

99
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,700
Do you want to go home?

100
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,290
Not really.

101
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,850
Why not?

102
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,790
Because Mom only lets me watch

103
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,710
half an hour of cartoons a day.

104
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,580
But Grandma lets me watch all day long.

105
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,000
But don't you love it

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,600
when Mom reads picture books to you

107
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,730
and stays at bedtime?

108
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,610
Don't you like it when she does that?

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,030
I do.

110
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,470
Mom video calls me

111
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,230
every night

112
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,470
and reads a picture book.

113
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,900
I fall asleep after that.

114
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,850
That's different.

115
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,960
You should have her come home

116
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,910
and read you the books.

117
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,170
The home feels so warm and cozy.

118
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,710
I think it's you

119
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,900
who wants my mom to come home.

120
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,580
I get it now.

121
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,260
You must have been sent by my dad.

122
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,140
- Shiyan, Qi.
- Mom.

123
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,260
Baby.

124
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,590
Why haven't you come home yet?

125
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,140
I want you to stay with me at night.

126
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,820
- Right.
- Okay.

127
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,790
I'll come home tonight
and sleep with you,

128
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,630
alright?

129
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,780
I'm off. Bye-bye.

130
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,610
Did you miss me?

131
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,750
Hello, Feng Weiran.

132
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,320
You really owe me

133
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,610
a big thank you today.

134
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,400
Today?

135
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,460
So, Jiang Shiyan turned you down,

136
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,530
or rather,

137
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,520
he's currently not

138
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,510
considering working

139
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,410
with your law firm?

140
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,470
I think he just hasn't

141
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,170
thought it through carefully yet.

142
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,520
He probably doesn't fully understand

143
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,200
the value that working with us could

144
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,440
bring to his future financing,

145
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,350
including the final stage

146
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,850
of going public.

147
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,000
We can assist Yixiu

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,850
in terms of compliance,

149
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,270
and we have

150
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,710
immense power

151
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,680
and resources in areas

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,700
like company structure

153
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,590
and selecting

154
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,730
underwriters.

155
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,900
But this sounds more like

156
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,100
Feng Weiran's area of expertise.

157
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,410
Ultimately, the decision

158
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,820
is Jiang Shiyan's.

159
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,050
I don't think
Feng couldn't convince him.

160
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,390
I just gave him a brief introduction,

161
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,640
and he said that there are
no plans for an IPO,

162
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,900
so he wouldn't consider it for now.

163
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,850
I understand.

164
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,910
But I'm not a partner

165
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,150
at Yixiu.

166
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,460
I can't help you.

167
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,490
Given your professional background,

168
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,600
you should understand

169
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,730
our value better,

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,170
so you can help explain it
to Jiang Shiyan.

171
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,170
Second,

172
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,580
he seems to listen to you more.

173
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,610
It's true that I'm his friend,

174
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,080
but his company has gotten this far

175
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
thanks to his team,

176
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,170
partners,

177
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,390
his decision-making,

178
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,930
and his understanding of the market.

179
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,780
You're overestimating my influence.

180
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,460
Everyone thinks

181
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,660
I've dated Jiang Shiyan,

182
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,260
but that's not the case.

183
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,920
At that time,

184
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,660
I was planning to study abroad.

185
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,350
One day, I bumped into Jiang

186
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,680
when I was going out.

187
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,970
We had a meal together,

188
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,230
and I dragged him to watch a movie,

189
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,820
where we ran into Zhang Tong.

190
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,290
They misunderstood us.

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,930
During that time,

192
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,930
you weren't in Rongcheng.

193
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,100
I was

194
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,170
feeling sentimental about the city

195
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,470
because I was

196
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,560
about to leave.

197
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,940
So, I kept asking Jiang Shiyan

198
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,490
to hang out with me.

199
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,610
But I noticed,

200
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,420
when he ate something tasty,

201
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,180
he wanted to bring you to try it first.

202
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,010
When he watched a good movie,

203
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,730
he wanted to show it to you first.

204
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,400
When the two of us went out,

205
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,940
it always felt like you were there.

206
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,340
It wasn't fun for me at all.

207
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,370
When I left,

208
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,180
I didn't tell him,

209
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,870
and he didn't offer

210
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,890
to see me off.

211
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,180
In the end,

212
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,420
we just drifted apart.

213
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,060
You might not realize

214
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,010
how important you are

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,130
to him.

216
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,250
I've been close to Jiang Shiyan

217
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,940
for so many years.

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,800
But we've never interfered

219
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,730
with each other's decisions.

220
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,890
I fully support

221
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,580
whatever he wants to do,

222
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,010
and I would never force him

223
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,700
to do things he doesn't like.

224
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,750
If he sees value

225
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,200
in working with your law firm,

226
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,370
he'll choose to collaborate.

227
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,240
But if he says

228
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,650
he's not considering it now,

229
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,610
then he genuinely isn't.

230
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
If you think

231
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
he rejected you because

232
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,650
he didn't see the value in your firm,

233
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,060
it just means you don't understand him.

234
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,060
Or perhaps

235
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,010
you're not suited to be his partner.

236
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,610
Let me give you an example.

237
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,420
Maybe two years ago.

238
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,200
Yixiu's food video team

239
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,700
once produced a video

240
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,460
that had two parts.

241
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,320
The first part was

242
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,510
about a well-known restaurant

243
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,490
being reported
for using bad ingredients.

244
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,800
The second part,

245
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,250
after their investigation,

246
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,220
revealed that place

247
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,770
wasn't using bad ingredients.

248
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,340
The video team thought

249
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,510
of airing the first part

250
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,320
to grab attention

251
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,970
and the second part for the twist.

252
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,970
But Jiang Shiyan was furious.

253
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,460
He said, "Have you thought"

254
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,700
"about how the restaurant's owner"

255
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,490
"would suffer"

256
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,370
"after just the first part airs?"

257
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,720
"By the time"

258
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,670
"the second part airs,"

259
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,420
"the restaurant might already
be destroyed."

260
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,240
So, he demanded that the team

261
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,420
re-edit it,

262
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,460
and they had to reveal the truth first.

263
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,960
If you've carefully studied Yixiu,

264
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,130
you'll notice

265
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,870
that in Yixiu's food reviews,

266
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,680
it's not only the popular influencers

267
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,940
who get recommended.

268
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,440
Lots of common people's videos

269
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,940
also get recommended.

270
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,590
That's because they're never

271
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,300
in a rush to chase after capital.

272
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,240
Their financing

273
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,710
and business expansion

274
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,600
all follow

275
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,460
Jiang's own plan and pace.

276
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,250
In short,

277
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,890
I really can't help you

278
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,100
with this.

279
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,750
I once told Jiang Shiyan

280
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,730
that I envied you.

281
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,370
But now,

282
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,490
I envy him.

283
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,110
Back in high school,

284
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,160
why didn't we become

285
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,180
good friends?

286
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,080
We can still become

287
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,220
good friends now.

288
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,560
I didn't manage to secure

289
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,220
my most promising client,

290
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,060
but I made a good friend.

291
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,920
Not bad.

292
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,580
I think so too.

293
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,700
(Chang Xinyi)

294
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,180
Chang Xinyi.

295
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,520
Hello?

296
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,700
Jiang Shiyan.

297
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,460
I'm leaving tomorrow.

298
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,770
I hope when you plan to go public,

299
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,420
you'll consider us first.

300
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,320
Alright, if that day ever comes,

301
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,220
I'll definitely give it

302
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,970
serious consideration.

303
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,650
There's something I've been wanting

304
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,650
to tell you for a long time.

305
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,940
I've always thought

306
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,850
first love is like boiling water.

307
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,370
It boils after the person leaves.

308
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,800
Do you have to wait until

309
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,790
Tang Yang falls out

310
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,610
with you to realize that you like her?

311
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,220
Or are you

312
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,340
just a stubborn fool who doesn't know

313
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,250
how to add more wood to the fire?

314
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,440
You just wait for the water to boil.

315
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,100
What if it never boils?

316
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,640
Thanks.

317
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,770
I've already been adding

318
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,580
more wood to the fire.

319
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,580
I knew you were smart.

320
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,640
Bye.

321
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,770
Bye-bye.

322
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,770
Feng Weiran is really awful.

323
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,220
Just when things were heating up,

324
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,540
he sent me on a business trip,

325
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,850
forcing me to pause it.

326
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,870
I should've never

327
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,610
helped you with Jiang Yanan.

328
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,180
(Phone call from Jiang Shiyan)

329
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,400
Yan...

330
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,590
Jiang Shiyan.

331
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,370
I was just about to come find you.

332
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Feng Weiran told me

333
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,240
that Dingshen

334
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,280
is willing to lead the investment,

335
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,850
but their boss, Mr. Qiu, wants to meet

336
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,770
with me in Meizhou to discuss it.

337
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,540
Meizhou? Why suddenly there?

338
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,750
Apparently, he invested

339
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,960
in a resort hotel there

340
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,800
in its soft opening.

341
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,100
How many days will it need?

342
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,230
He wants me

343
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,280
to go on a vacation so we can

344
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,460
have an in-depth talk.

345
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,250
Maybe two or three days.

346
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,760
Yang.

347
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,890
Tang Yang.

348
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,080
Meizhou is quite beautiful.

349
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,770
It's a really nice time of year there.

350
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,580
If you're free this weekend,

351
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,420
why not come too?

352
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,400
I can stay a couple more days,

353
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,420
and we can hang out.

354
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,820
I'll think about it.

355
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,180
Yeah.

356
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,460
I should be free this weekend.

357
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,340
How about this?

358
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,010
I'll head to the train station

359
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,940
after work on Friday.

360
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,820
I can arrive by Friday night.

361
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,420
Alright, I'll have someone

362
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,730
pick you up then.

363
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,120
See you then.

364
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,400
See you on Friday.

365
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,760
Okay.

366
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,650
See you Friday night.

367
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,350
Bye-bye.

368
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,240
Bye-bye.

369
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,490
Mr. Jiang, please rest here for a bit.

370
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
Mr. Qiu got up very early this morning

371
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,610
and is now taking a nap.

372
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,230
He has arranged to have dinner

373
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,820
with you around six o'clock.

374
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,180
Alright, no problem.

375
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,220
- This way.
- Thank you.

376
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,860
(Jiang Shiyan)

377
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,460
(Tang Yang)

378
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,890
I truly envy you.

379
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,690
(Jiang Shiyan)
You can have it this Friday.

380
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,000
Come in.

381
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,910
Yang.

382
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
It's the approval letter

383
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,400
for the loan application

384
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,100
from Qinglai's board.

385
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,630
Yang.

386
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,270
I have two tickets for a play

387
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,160
on Friday night.

388
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,300
Do you want to come with me?

389
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,140
Friday night doesn't work for me.

390
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,610
I plan to take a little vacation.

391
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,600
Alright, I'll ask someone else.

392
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,440
Okay.

393
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,300
(Founder of Dingshen Capital, Qiu Tao)

394
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,150
Jiang,

395
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,440
do you want to drink?

396
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,980
I can have a little.

397
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,280
Okay, thanks.

398
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,020
I heard our investment manager, Dong,

399
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,610
talking about Yixiu for a long time.

400
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,790
Since I'm here,

401
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,060
I thought it'd be good

402
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,230
to invite you, a food blogger,

403
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,510
to have a try

404
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,350
at our dishes.

405
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,500
No, no, no.

406
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,650
I just simply love to eat,

407
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,790
and what I used to eat

408
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,690
mainly comes from roadside eateries.

409
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,310
This dish

410
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,100
is made with wild mushrooms

411
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,370
and air-freighted stonefish

412
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,500
and simmered for eight hours.

413
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,270
Once the stonefish are tender,

414
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,850
they filter out the clear broth

415
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,450
and add in the pre-soaked conch slices.

416
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,110
This dish

417
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,820
needs to be reserved in advance.

418
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,270
If you order it on the same day,

419
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,370
you won't be able to get it.

420
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,310
Give it a try.

421
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,280
Alright.

422
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,720
How is it?

423
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,300
Very fresh and delicious.

424
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,830
By the way,

425
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,740
try this dish as well.

426
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,020
This is our

427
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,540
spicy pepper beef.

428
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,260
Thank you.

429
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,200
It's quite special.

430
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,350
What's special?

431
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,650
The beef?

432
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,910
No, no, no.

433
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,370
It's the peppercorn.

434
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,650
Maybe two types of peppercorns.

435
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,610
One is the green one from Sichuan,

436
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,930
which is more numbing,

437
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,640
and the other

438
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,060
is the red one from Shaanxi.

439
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,370
I didn't expect that.

440
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,350
Mr. Jiang,

441
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,980
you're a peppercorn expert.

442
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,370
We highlighted these

443
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,100
when we were doing

444
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,650
the flavor food before.

445
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,410
Have some water.

446
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,020
When did Cheng Hui say he'd come?

447
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,480
Eight o'clock.

448
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,980
Eight o'clock?

449
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,890
It's two minutes to eight.

450
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,620
Did he say why?

451
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,380
(Astronomy Enthusiasts)

452
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,340
I didn't ask.

453
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,650
He just sent me a message asking

454
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,710
- if I was home.
- I said yes,

455
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,260
so he said he'd come over at eight.

456
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,740
No context at all.

457
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,100
You're right to call me here.

458
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,790
He is

459
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,370
a bit odd.

460
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,470
It's so late,

461
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,340
but he's showing up
at a single woman's home.

462
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,820
It's a bit scary.

463
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,110
Nina,

464
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,450
I had Master Chen wait downstairs.

465
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
In case anything happens,

466
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,210
I'll call him to come up right away.

467
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,020
You're being too dramatic.

468
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,680
Nina.

469
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,850
He's here.

470
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,760
Sit down.

471
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,350
I'll go.

472
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,200
Wait, wait.

473
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,540
Wait, wait, wait.

474
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,870
Mr. Cheng Hui.

475
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,890
What do you need?

476
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,450
I'm here for your telescope.

477
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,030
I brought the parts.

478
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,170
Once it's set up, it'll work.

479
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,590
Need to change shoes?

480
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,680
No, no need.

481
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,650
Just come in.

482
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,980
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

483
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,710
So, he just had dinner with you

484
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,750
and didn't mention investment, right?

485
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,750
Yeah. He only asked me
if I could wake up early.

486
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,590
I said that's fine.

487
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,210
He mentioned going hiking at 7:30 a.m.

488
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,600
He's leaving soon.

489
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,650
Hiking?

490
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,850
What's that about?

491
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,790
Think carefully.

492
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,360
During your meal,

493
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,740
was there anything strange?

494
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,580
It's very high-end.

495
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,690
Every dish was extremely complicated.

496
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,870
Well, that's it then.

497
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,820
I don't think it'll work out.

498
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,840
They probably think

499
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,200
our tricks are not

500
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,130
up to their standards,

501
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,020
so there's no need
to listen to our plan.

502
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,580
I can't pretend either.

503
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,350
You know my favorite thing is

504
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,400
to go for hotpot

505
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,370
and ribs and chicken.

506
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,640
I don't understand

507
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,540
his ways.

508
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,210
What about you?

509
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,260
Is Jiang Yanan still mad at you?

510
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,210
Don't mention it.

511
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,340
Yanan is in a very strange

512
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,170
state right now.

513
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,210
Strange?

514
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,790
I call her and text her.

515
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,500
Nothing's wrong,

516
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,130
but I just feel something's off.

517
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,820
Based on what I know of her,

518
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
she's definitely

519
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,300
holding back a big move.

520
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,850
You have to go back, right?

521
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
It's a business trip.

522
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,410
It has to end.

523
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,060
Forget about that now.

524
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,820
By the way, when are you going back?

525
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,280
Me?

526
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,440
Not in a hurry.

527
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,640
I think here is nice.

528
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,480
I want to stay

529
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,260
a couple more days to relax.

530
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,850
Maybe Sunday night.

531
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,450
If that's the case,

532
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,960
I'll come find you.

533
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,100
I'll join you.

534
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,850
We can go back together.

535
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,470
Mainly,

536
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,920
if Yanan blows up,

537
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,170
you can intervene.

538
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,890
Forget it. Don't come.

539
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,200
I'm not sure.

540
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,610
Maybe I'll go back tomorrow night.

541
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,960
Alright, alright. I'm sleepy.

542
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,800
I'm going to sleep.

543
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,550
Okay, go to bed early.

544
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,390
Bye-bye.

545
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,110
Hello.

546
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,710
I'd like to reserve a private room

547
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,980
for two on Friday night.

548
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,850
Two people. Yes.

549
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,740
May I ask

550
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,880
if the wild mushroom stonefish

551
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,020
needs to be reserved?

552
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,260
Yes, please reserve it.

553
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,340
Alright, thank you.

554
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,680
Look.

555
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,980
This is Saturn.

556
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,200
So beautiful.

557
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,690
You hold it.

558
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,130
The rings are so beautiful.

559
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,300
What are those rings?

560
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,210
They're made of crushed ice

561
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,540
and rock.

562
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,370
- Look.
- Ice and rock.

563
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,690
So beautiful.

564
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,000
Thank you.

565
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,130
Those parts must be hard to buy.

566
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,450
I have a friend

567
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,130
who has one just like yours.

568
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,540
I took his apart.

569
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,610
You took his apart?

570
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,760
Well.

571
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,170
What will he use?

572
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,260
He's a gear enthusiast,

573
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,130
bought a bunch, and leaves them

574
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,150
unused.

575
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,200
What a waste.

576
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,850
That sounds reasonable.

577
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,130
Anyway,

578
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,930
thank you.

579
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,820
How about this?

580
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,740
How about dinner on me?

581
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,760
Alright.

582
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,240
Mr. Jiang,

583
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,780
you have good stamina.

584
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,930
You must exercise regularly.

585
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,070
I play badminton and swim

586
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,300
from time to time.

587
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,150
By the way,

588
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,820
tell me more

589
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,980
about your Yixiu.

590
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,120
Yixiu Found of Food?

591
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,020
Yes.

592
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,070
You should have seen

593
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,060
the data and materials.

594
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,340
Yixiu mainly

595
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,170
connects user needs and products

596
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,990
through food as a link

597
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,830
and then uses

598
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,170
a vertical food community

599
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,270
to help users

600
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,360
retain their

601
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,260
culinary experiences.

602
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,020
In this round of financing,

603
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,310
we want to establish

604
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,200
Yixiu's online brand

605
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,040
and complete

606
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,650
a closed loop.

607
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,990
Did you look at the business plan?

608
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,830
I did.

609
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,210
To be honest,

610
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,170
I started

611
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,650
in manufacturing.

612
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,980
You might know it as hardware.

613
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,990
So, Dingshen's previous

614
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,400
investment range

615
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,690
has always been in manufacturing.

616
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,540
But in the past two years,

617
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,820
new internet companies

618
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,400
have been thriving

619
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,780
in the capital market.

620
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,750
My investment managers

621
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,780
are strongly urging me

622
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,580
to fully transition Dingshen

623
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,820
to invest in new media products.

624
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,760
Mr. Jiang,

625
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,610
I don't know

626
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,680
what your views are

627
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,020
on the current hardware industry.

628
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,880
I studied media.

629
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,980
To be honest,

630
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,300
I don't know traditional manufacturing.

631
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,410
However, I firmly believe

632
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,370
that hardware constitutes this world

633
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,890
and everything we use.

634
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,890
It sounds like

635
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,510
you're urging me

636
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,130
to continue investing in manufacturing.

637
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,740
To put it bluntly,

638
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,740
no matter how thriving

639
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,000
the internet

640
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,650
and software industries are,

641
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,680
you can't imagine a world

642
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,020
without hardware.

643
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,550
This place is really spacious.

644
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,390
Yeah.

645
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,630
How does it look?

646
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,850
Looks comfortable, right?

647
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,960
Very nice.

648
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,440
Mr. Jiang.

649
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,480
From last night's dinner

650
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,320
until now,

651
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,640
you've repeatedly exceeded

652
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,820
my expectations.

653
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,750
I've had dinner with quite a few

654
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,100
new internet elites,

655
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,070
and they always

656
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,910
go on and on

657
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,780
about which bottle of red wine

658
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,840
comes from which top winery

659
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,020
in the Loire Valley

660
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,480
or how much

661
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,370
they spent

662
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,880
on the ingredients

663
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,020
for a certain dish.

664
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,550
So, while I'm eating,

665
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,470
I often wonder

666
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,060
if they're using my investments

667
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,340
to improve

668
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,170
their products

669
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,270
or just to lead

670
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,890
a more luxurious life.

671
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,370
I've read the business plan,

672
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,040
and Yixiu is the one

673
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,780
I'm most optimistic about.

674
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,030
That's why I wanted to come

675
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,820
and see what kind of person you are.

676
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,060
Thank you, Mr. Qiu.

677
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,130
I'm actually just

678
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,210
an ordinary person.

679
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,650
I'll have Dong contact you.

680
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,300
Hope we'll work well.

681
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,340
Hope we'll work well.

682
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,580
(Credit Audit Division)

683
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,180
(Tang Yang, Deputy Director)

684
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,060
(Tang Yang)

685
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,710
I took two hours off today

686
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,030
to catch the 4:30 train,

687
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,410
so I should arrive by six.

688
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,780
(Jiang)
Text me then.

689
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,170
I'll pick you up.

690
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,440
(Tang Yang)
Okay.

691
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:42,300
(Tang Yang)

692
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,260
(Jiang Shiyan)
On the train yet?

693
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,800
(Jiang Shiyan)
Are you on your way?

694
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,780
Hey, Yanan.

695
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,340
Has Yang contacted you?

696
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,270
No, after I got home that day,

697
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,260
I haven't seen her again.

698
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,160
No, I can't find her.

699
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,060
I... I just...

700
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,510
I just spoke with her.

701
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,360
She didn't reply.

702
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,300
I'm a bit worried.

703
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,060
Her phone might be dead.

704
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,070
Okay, okay, I'll reach out again.

705
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,930
Okay, bye-bye.

706
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,350
Yang.

707
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,070
How are you doing now?

708
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,910
Where are you?

709
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,450
Why not reply to me?

710
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,130
Mr. Liu.

711
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,410
Bring that car to the front desk.

712
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,980
I'm leaving right away.

713
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,410
Okay, okay.

714
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,500
See you in a bit.

715
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,550
See you in a bit.

716
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,890
Mr. Jiang, what's up?

717
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,960
Mr. Ying.

718
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,350
May I ask if you've seen

719
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,190
Tang Yang today?

720
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,550
I ran into her when I went downstairs

721
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,540
for my takeout at noon.

722
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,120
I asked about her weekend plan.

723
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,580
She said she wanted to go out.

724
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,260
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

725
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,150
Did you suddenly have any

726
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,330
important meetings today?

727
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,730
There is one.

728
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,360
The credit card center

729
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,550
is meeting with our division.

730
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,390
It just finished,

731
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,170
but Tang Yang doesn't need to attend.

732
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,060
Okay, okay.

733
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,510
Do you have Qin Yue's

734
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,690
phone number?

735
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,430
I'll send it to you.

736
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,610
Alright, thanks.

737
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,130
It's normal for her phone to be off.

738
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,860
Maybe it's out of battery.

739
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,110
Isn't your mom always

740
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,170
turning her phone off?

741
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,350
But

742
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,070
she's been off for several hours.

743
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,500
Her colleagues can't find her either.

744
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,470
She was working in the morning.

745
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,310
Don't worry.

746
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,840
Jiang, have some water first.

747
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,680
Thank you, Uncle.

748
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,960
She might not

749
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,610
have a power bank outside.

750
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,330
I had that happen once too.

751
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,420
How can you mention it now?

752
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,170
Ms. Zhou, Ms. Zhou.

753
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,990
I didn't mean

754
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,360
to reply to you

755
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,200
so late that time.

756
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,590
My phone was dead

757
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,840
and I didn't have a power bank.

758
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,710
Isn't that

759
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,690
the same thing?

760
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,900
Don't be angry.

761
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,240
Jiang.

762
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,210
If her phone's charged,

763
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,380
she'll contact you.

764
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,430
Don't worry.

765
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,870
Alright.

766
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,940
I'll try to find her.

767
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,610
- Easy.
- I left my cup here.

768
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,720
Take it easy.

769
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Jiang, don't rush.

770
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,720
Okay.

771
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,280
What's this kid in a hurry for?

772
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,810
- Just a phone being off.
- Right.

773
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,460
- Thanks.
- Mo.

774
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,460
I asked President Zhou.

775
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,460
Something's wrong with a leader

776
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,440
she worked with
before being reassigned back.

777
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,130
She's with the police to cooperate.

778
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,030
Relieved now?

779
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,680
Thank you.

780
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,510
Thank you.

781
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,100
(Economic Crime Investigation Unit)

782
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,280
Director Tang.

783
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,220
(Captain of ECIU)

784
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,420
(Sun Lin)
Zheng told me

785
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,430
you had new clues.

786
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,150
The bank,

787
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,190
through contracts,

788
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,110
sets financial indicator restrictions

789
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,380
on borrowers.

790
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,470
For example,

791
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,810
it can limit non-operational
transfer amounts.

792
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,720
It's like setting a warning line

793
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,170
for the loan.

794
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,860
I was thinking

795
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,030
President Gu was in business.

796
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,100
He's very professional.

797
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,810
If he has the intent,

798
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,130
he might erase

799
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,590
these warning lines

800
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,430
before others notice.

801
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,730
Do you mean

802
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,960
the places that should have

803
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,980
warning lines but don't

804
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,730
might have problems?

805
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,460
I think it would be a good entry point.

806
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,600
Alright.

807
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,060
We'll give it a try.

808
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,140
(Rongcheng First People's Hospital)

809
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,120
Director Gan.

810
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,500
Your procedures are done.

811
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,070
(Discharge Certificate)
Good.

812
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,580
I'll go home directly.

813
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,680
Okay.

814
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,060
By the way, Mr. Gan.

815
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,540
The matter

816
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,440
with Gu Zhishou has spread

817
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,380
throughout the bank.

818
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,030
But I think,

819
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,460
given Tang Yang's character,

820
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,110
she shouldn't be

821
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,250
too deeply involved, right?

822
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,730
Nothing will happen to her.

823
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,210
But in situations like this,

824
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,460
honestly,

825
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,990
she's called to ECIU.

826
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,840
Even if it's nothing,

827
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,130
rumors can still say there is.

828
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,240
Once the word gets around,

829
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,330
the leaders will think.

830
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,460
They might think:

831
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,020
If it's nothing,

832
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,360
why are there so many rumors about you?

833
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,200
Right?

834
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,080
Yes.

835
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,280
Those of us in banking

836
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,380
are most afraid of this.

837
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,800
By the way, Mr. Gan.

838
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,760
Are you all set

839
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,900
to go back to work?

840
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,500
I'm not in a rush.

841
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,580
Let's wait another two days.

842
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,210
Tell the office

843
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,590
I've been discharged,

844
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,510
but the doctor

845
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,900
wants me to recover.

846
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,100
Once the Qinglai matter is settled,

847
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,540
I'll return to work.

848
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,460
Got it.

849
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,330
- Mr. Feng.
- Mr. Feng.

850
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
You got off the plane.

851
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,640
Didn't go home?

852
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,690
Mr. Jiang.

853
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,810
Mr. Feng, we'll leave.

854
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,950
Let's go.

855
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,210
Close the door.

856
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,020
My wife kicked me out.

857
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,680
Look.

858
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,250
She even threw my painting out.

859
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,980
Isn't that a nice painting?

860
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,730
It's not about whether it's nice or not.

861
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,240
A few days ago,

862
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,510
we argued about selling the house

863
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,500
in Rongcheng Duhui.

864
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,580
We didn't end it
before my business trip.

865
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,690
For two weeks,

866
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,590
I called her, texted her,
and did video calls.

867
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,990
No signs of any issues.

868
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,900
I just knew

869
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,500
this couldn't be that simple.

870
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,610
I just got off the plane today,

871
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,130
and when I got to my door,

872
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,100
I wasn't allowed in.

873
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,670
She said all my luggage

874
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,720
was thrown into the house

875
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,920
in Rongcheng Duhui,

876
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,900
and I should live there.

877
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,580
That's a harsh move.

878
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,770
Aren't you selling it?

879
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,110
After you sell it,

880
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,110
go live on the street.

881
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,920
Bro, why are you laughing?

882
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,780
Look at the situation.

883
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,130
Think of a solution for me.

884
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,840
What can I think of?

885
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,020
Just don't sell it.

886
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,100
No way.

887
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,060
I have my eye on a place in No. 1 Bay

888
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,170
for the internal price.

889
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,720
I've paid the deposit.

890
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,550
If I don't sell that house,

891
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,730
I can't buy this one.

892
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,060
Why did you tell her about this?

893
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,380
How could I dare tell her?

894
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,500
Let me explain the situation.

895
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,840
I was accompanying my college classmate

896
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,690
to see a house.

897
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,550
The sales director recognized him.

898
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,390
I saw the place

899
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,020
and thought it was great.

900
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,280
A lake in front.

901
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,150
Surrounded by trees.

902
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,130
It's less than ten minutes

903
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,500
from a shopping district,

904
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,800
with top-tier hospitals

905
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,840
and elementary, middle,

906
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,720
and high schools.

907
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,670
All key institutions.

908
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,580
I got carried away

909
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,980
and paid the deposit,

910
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,550
only to realize afterward

911
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,250
that I hadn't discussed it
with my wife.

912
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,230
If I tell her,

913
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,020
she'd skin me alive.

914
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,130
Originally, I thought

915
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,550
I'd sell the Duhui house first

916
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,670
and have my college classmate

917
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,470
pretend to persuade me to buy this place

918
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,500
to smooth things over,

919
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,640
and it'd work out.

920
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,690
Who would have thought

921
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
she just won't agree

922
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,860
to sell this house?

923
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,940
I think you can only
go back and confess.

924
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,280
But our family has always been strict

925
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,290
with confessions.

926
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,470
Hello, Tang Yang.

927
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,730
Alright, alright.

928
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,330
I'll be at your place.

929
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,650
Okay, okay.

930
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,190
Yang is back?

931
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,060
Is she okay?

932
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,650
It's nothing.

933
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,210
Then I'll go with you.

934
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,400
You don't need to go.

935
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,730
Sort out your own problems first.

936
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,550
She threw out my painting.

937
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,060
She must be angry.

938
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:51,950
Stop here.

939
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,420
Thank you for these days.

940
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,900
The least I can do.

941
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,190
I hope this information

942
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,060
is useful to you.

943
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,670
It's hard to find

944
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,610
such internal training

945
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,330
case analyses outside.

946
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,500
Thanks for lending it.

947
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,670
I'll read it quickly

948
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,690
and return it to you.

949
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,210
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks.

950
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,470
Tang Yang.

951
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,800
Jiang Shiyan.

952
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,560
Are you okay?

953
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,950
Let me take a look.

954
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,030
Something's wrong.

955
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,120
What's up?

956
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,030
See you tomorrow.

957
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,280
Yang.

958
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,760
Why did the teacher keep you again?

959
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,210
- Why?
- It's because of you.

960
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,250
You scored 95 in physics.

961
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,250
Isn't that great?

962
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,720
But only you and I solved

963
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,690
the last big problem,

964
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,730
so the teacher suspected
I helped you cheat.

965
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,460
I did it myself, clearly.

966
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,670
You reviewed it

967
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,800
with me days ago.

968
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,640
It was the same.

969
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,560
Right.

970
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,000
So, I showed that book

971
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,060
to the teacher.

972
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,810
He didn't say anything.

973
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,110
He told me

974
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,150
not to bring that book

975
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,810
to school again.

976
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,200
Got it.

977
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,190
So, the teacher's questions

978
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,040
are mostly likely

979
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,250
from that reference book.
