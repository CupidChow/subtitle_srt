27
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,030
Mr. Cheng.

28
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,750
What's wrong?

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
I'm fine.

30
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,330
You never drink oat milk lattes.

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,140
I just wanted to try a different flavor.

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,720
That's not right.

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,300
Something's wrong with you.

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,050
You don't like changes.

35
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,460
You didn't go home these days.

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,500
Are you messing around?

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,010
What am I messing around with?

38
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,810
Am I that kind of person?

39
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,850
Shut up if you can't talk properly.

40
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,500
My wife said it.

41
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,500
She said she thought our lifestyle

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,500
needed a bit of a change.

43
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,570
Will you get a divorce?

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,100
Nonsense.

45
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,810
Who said she wanted to divorce me?

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,590
A bit of a change.

47
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,760
Isn't going from married

48
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,290
to divorced a change?

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,290
I've noticed you have

50
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,010
quite an ominous mouth.

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,730
What my wife means is that

52
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,850
everyone's life shouldn't just

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,340
revolve around family.

54
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,410
There should also be other focuses.

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,360
For example,

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,970
things like

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,150
work,

58
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,990
or hobbies.

59
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,270
The last time we argued,

60
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,380
it was because she felt

61
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,960
I had excluded her

62
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,110
from being a part

63
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,950
of my life.

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,730
She didn't know a lot of things.

65
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,280
Like your plan to buy

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,340
and sell the house.

67
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,410
Right.

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,830
But honestly,

69
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,960
I didn't mean to not tell her

70
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,130
about that.

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
I just naturally felt that there was

72
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,850
no need to tell her,

73
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,290
or she'd start worrying again.

74
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,040
Do you remember

75
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,560
when we had a major issue

76
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,590
with the funding chain

77
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,430
during our Series A?

78
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,970
I didn't tell her about it either.

79
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,460
I was afraid she'd be worried

80
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,130
and upset if she knew.

81
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,340
Now that I think about it,

82
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,560
that was indeed

83
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,730
a bit disrespectful to her.

84
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
I remember that too.

85
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,460
You didn't tell Yanan,

86
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,060
but you told Yang.

87
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,710
Right?

88
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,530
Yang is different.

89
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,940
She's my buddy.

90
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,270
After I told her,

91
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,290
she'd find a way out.

92
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,710
If I told my wife,

93
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,430
she'd just worry and get upset.

94
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,940
I care about her feelings.

95
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,010
Forget it. I won't talk to you.

96
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,460
You don't have a wife.

97
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,830
You wouldn't understand

98
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,670
that friends and wives are

99
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,290
completely different.

100
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,900
By the way, I remember

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,940
Jiang Shiyan didn't tell Yang,

102
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,920
and after you told Yang,

103
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,100
Jiang Shiyan got angry.

104
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,710
He was angry

105
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,850
because...

106
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,130
Because of what?

107
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,220
He was angry because...

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,600
Wait, I find whenever I chat with you,

109
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,930
you change the subject.

110
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,530
I'm talking about my wife.

111
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,610
Anyway, I've decided

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,970
that from now on,
no matter what happens at work,

113
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,170
I'll tell my wife.

114
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,340
So, she can feel at ease

115
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,470
and also develop

116
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,580
her interests and hobbies,

117
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,580
so her life can have more focuses.

118
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,100
I get it.

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,170
In the end,

120
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,590
your wife doesn't want

121
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,850
to revolve around you

122
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,260
and is focusing on her things.

123
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,370
Director Tang.

124
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,220
(Credit Audit Division)
Mr. Gan needs you.

125
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,220
Okay.

126
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,060
Mr. Gan, you needed me?

127
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,620
Deputy Director Tang,

128
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,900
no matter what matters you have at home,

129
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,140
you shouldn't delay your work.

130
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,700
Vice President Gao has

131
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,820
looked for me
about Qinglai two or three times.

132
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,900
Are you

133
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,940
deliberately delaying?

134
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,460
Yes.

135
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,900
I am deliberately delaying.

136
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,020
You...

137
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,180
Because this case
has unpredictable risks.

138
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,540
During our site visit,

139
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,140
we discovered many issues.

140
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,780
I've already reported it.

141
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,700
Based on Mr. Zhou's wish,

142
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,620
we should pause it.

143
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,500
Alright.

144
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,380
Since it's President Zhou's wishes,

145
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
then I understand.

146
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,260
Get back to work.

147
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,420
Is Vice President Gao there?

148
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,300
He's in a meeting?

149
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,500
Okay.

150
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,500
(Yixiu Found of Food)

151
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,060
Congrats, Mr. Jiang, on your recovery

152
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,220
and healthy return.

153
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,060
Thanks, everyone.

154
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,580
However, my body still can't

155
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,380
handle the cake very well.

156
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,220
Why don't you

157
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,220
take it back and share it?

158
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,940
Thanks, Mr. Jiang.

159
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Go eat the cake.

160
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,020
Go back, go back.

161
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,140
By the way,

162
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,020
we're drafting

163
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,460
the investment letter of intent

164
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,660
for Dingshen Capital.

165
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,260
You're back to work

166
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,180
just in time.

167
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,580
This afternoon,

168
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,420
I'll sort out the valuation terms

169
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,300
and some

170
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,340
exclusivity periods

171
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,540
for the letter of intent.

172
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,860
Think about the past.

173
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,220
When we were in Series B,

174
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
you'd like to stuff me in a suitcase.

175
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,660
Countless negotiations,
business dinners,

176
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,060
early morning flights,

177
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,100
and red-eye flights.

178
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,100
I really don't want to repeat it.

179
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,500
Especially those guys

180
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,940
in dark gray suits.

181
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,140
They practically lived in our office.

182
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,740
I came in at 7 am,

183
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,900
and they were there.

184
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,340
I left at 2 am.

185
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,220
They were still there.

186
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,660
They're scarier than I am.

187
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,740
You finally know

188
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,980
how scary you are.

189
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,460
The problem is

190
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,940
they ordered the same food

191
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,060
every day,

192
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,500
and they all

193
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,820
looked the same.

194
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,260
Have you seen a horror comic?

195
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,540
Don't talk nonsense.

196
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,940
They're accountants

197
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,740
and lawyers who conducted

198
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,740
due diligence here.

199
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,660
They're all excellent professionals.

200
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,660
Just like you?

201
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,620
- Bye.
- Annoying.

202
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,500
(CBBC)
His method

203
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,860
is going to cause problems.

204
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,380
I think we could

205
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,620
expect this result, right?

206
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
Did you guys hear

207
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,540
about Qinglai Art Training?

208
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,740
Come here, come here.

209
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,700
I was just talking
to Linlang about this.

210
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,780
I heard their founder,

211
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,740
Liu Qingqing,

212
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,980
was taken away while trying

213
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,820
to leave the country.

214
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,940
Now, they've taken

215
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,060
compulsory measures.

216
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,580
I just hope the parents' losses

217
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,780
can be minimized.

218
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,620
Luckily, we didn't

219
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,900
approve the loan this time.

220
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,140
I heard she was

221
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,020
already starting

222
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,860
to transfer assets.

223
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,620
If we had granted that loan,

224
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,060
it would have been a sure loss.

225
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,540
We avoided such a huge loss.

226
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,740
Shouldn't CBBC reward us?

227
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,420
You wish.

228
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,580
This blush is our

229
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,540
main recommended color.

230
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Let me try it for you.

231
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,580
Okay.

232
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,900
You see, just lightly tap it.

233
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,420
Doesn't it improve your complexion?

234
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,580
But why do I feel like

235
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,020
this color makes my face look older?

236
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,900
Older?

237
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,740
I don't think so.

238
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
How about I change it

239
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,100
to a lighter color for you?

240
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,100
Okay.

241
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,300
Wait.

242
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,660
If you apply blush here,

243
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,420
it'll make your cheek look like

244
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,260
it's sagging,

245
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,420
which can age her.

246
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,980
Then how should it be applied?

247
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,180
How about I help her?

248
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,380
Okay.

249
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,460
You need to use this kind of brush.

250
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,540
It actually looks pretty good.

251
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,780
Thanks, Miss.

252
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,780
No problem.

253
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,220
Miss.

254
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,860
Are you a beauty blogger?

255
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,580
I'm not.

256
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,340
You could start your video channel.

257
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,860
Look, your makeup looks great.

258
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,100
I just do it casually.

259
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,060
I think it looks pretty good.

260
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,220
Is that so?

261
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,180
Then I'll take this blush.

262
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,020
And that concealer.

263
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,140
I'll take it too.

264
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,620
Sure. I'll get you a new one.

265
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,500
Miss, if you

266
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,060
start a video channel,

267
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,420
I'll definitely watch it.

268
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,580
Okay, thanks.

269
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,180
Thanks for today. I'll head out first.

270
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,380
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

271
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,940
Director Tang.

272
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,300
Haven't you eaten yet?

273
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,020
No, I haven't. I was just thinking

274
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,380
about going downstairs for a bite.

275
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,020
No one is sending lunch today?

276
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,380
Yeah.

277
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,940
The person who cooks lunch

278
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,380
is on leave today.

279
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,580
He can't make it.

280
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,540
I'll go downstairs with you.

281
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,580
Sure, no problem.

282
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,140
Deputy Director Tang,

283
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,700
just got notified
that the meeting at 1:30 pm

284
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,780
has been changed to 2:30 pm.

285
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,900
Okay, thanks.

286
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,810
Alright.

287
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,580
2:30 pm.

288
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,460
It's 12:00 pm now.

289
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,420
More than two hours.

290
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,260
Linlang,

291
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,020
I just remembered
I have something to do.

292
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,060
Let's take a rain check.

293
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,380
Okay, you go ahead.

294
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,420
Bye-bye.

295
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,540
Don't let there be any big changes.

296
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,700
Peng Si, hurry up.

297
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,020
- Is the food ordered?
- Yes.

298
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,020
- It's in Mr. Jiang's office.
- Okay.

299
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,140
I've heated your fish soup.

300
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,540
- Okay.
- I'll head up first.

301
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,460
Yang.

302
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,020
What brings you here?

303
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,820
I'm having my lunch break.

304
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,980
I was thinking maybe I could

305
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
have lunch here.

306
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,420
Aren't you acting like an outsider?

307
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,180
We only have good food here,

308
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,540
nothing else.

309
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,580
During the live-streaming today,

310
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,980
they promoted something called

311
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,220
a clay pot rice set.

312
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,060
I'll grab two sets for you to try later.

313
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,900
Sounds good.

314
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,180
Isn't this what you guys
in the industry call

315
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,020
"eating props"?

316
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,020
I'll kick you.

317
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,340
Don't get physical.

318
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,300
Wait for us in Jiang Shiyan's office.

319
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,140
I'll get something.

320
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,060
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

321
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,420
I'll go to the café to get coffee.

322
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,260
Do you want anything?

323
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,820
A Latte, thanks.

324
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,820
An Americano.

325
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,740
Okay.

326
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,340
I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.

327
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,700
I was working overtime yesterday.

328
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,020
The day before yesterday,

329
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,340
my mom called me over,

330
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,940
so I stayed at her place.

331
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,580
So, it's been two days
since we last met.

332
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,300
One day apart is three years.

333
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,580
So, it's been six years

334
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,220
since we last met.

335
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,340
You're so good at math.

336
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,340
I didn't expect you to come to see me.

337
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,580
I was thinking of stopping by

338
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,100
to see you after work.

339
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,700
I suddenly missed you a lot.

340
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,460
Yang.

341
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,420
Here.

342
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,860
Your latte.

343
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,740
- Thanks.
- Americano.

344
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,700
Is coffee this fast nowadays?

345
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,100
Coffee has always been this fast.

346
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,860
Do you want me to slow down?

347
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,500
No, the timing for the coffee...

348
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,340
Just perfect.

349
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,420
Perfect.

350
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,620
The report on Qinglai's matter

351
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,980
is very well-written.

352
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,420
Gan.

353
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,820
Your business skills

354
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,980
and thoroughness in your work

355
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,580
are top-notch.

356
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,660
Thanks to you for the opportunity.

357
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,820
For trivial matters,

358
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,740
leave them to me. Don't worry.

359
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,460
When you were on sick leave,

360
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,140
your division was ineffective

361
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,180
and disorganized.

362
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,460
You still need to take

363
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,380
on this responsibility.

364
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,260
Some young people seem to have ideas,

365
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,340
but often their work lacks

366
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,180
thorough consideration.

367
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,620
I've told President Zhou.

368
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,900
What's the use

369
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,340
of a good resume? Right?

370
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,820
What we need are

371
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,380
people who can get things done

372
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,260
and solve problems.

373
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,340
Understood.

374
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,180
Yang.

375
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,740
No words are needed.

376
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,180
Try this sausage.

377
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,300
So tasty.

378
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,860
Yang, this clay pot rice

379
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,140
actually relies entirely on this sauce.

380
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,940
Alright, that's enough.

381
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,060
No. The rarest part is

382
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,420
the burnt rice at the bottom,

383
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,900
paired with pickled cabbage.

384
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,100
So refreshing.

385
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,740
Let me try it.

386
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,740
It's amazing.

387
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,860
Let me mix it well.

388
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,700
Come on.

389
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,620
What are you doing?

390
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,660
I'm just trying it.

391
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,020
Why? If you want it, go get it.

392
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,580
What are you doing?

393
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,900
Don't grab my meat.

394
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,820
- I want a piece.
- I saved it for Yang.

395
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,180
Stop messing around.

396
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,940
Yang still has to work.

397
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,180
Stop acting like a child,

398
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,460
fighting over food.

399
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,900
Annoying.

400
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,740
Is it delicious, right?

401
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,260
When are you leaving?

402
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,020
I have a meeting at 2:30.

403
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,260
I need to leave by 1:45.

404
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,300
There are over 10 minutes left.

405
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,140
You have time.

406
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,990
Eat slowly.

407
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,100
Only over 10 minutes?

408
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,940
It's fine.

409
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,900
I eat slowly.

410
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,740
Don't worry about me.

411
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,780
Go to work. I'll eat slowly here.

412
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,420
It's fine. We're not busy either.

413
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,620
It's lunchtime.

414
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,220
People have to eat, right?

415
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,100
Finished my morning meetings,

416
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,780
but I have a meeting in the afternoon.

417
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,220
I've scheduled a conference call

418
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,260
with the finance and legal teams

419
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,300
and the Dingshen team.

420
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,660
This conference call

421
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,580
will last until after ten.

422
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,820
Another tough battle.

423
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,180
Do you need me there?

424
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,780
No need.

425
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,740
Aunt said

426
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,700
no overtime for you.

427
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,100
Don't just sit around at home.

428
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,740
No meeting doesn't mean you're done.

429
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,020
I'll promptly ask Peng Si

430
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,140
to sync those controversial

431
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,060
clauses to you.

432
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,100
Keep an eye on them.

433
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,540
When the time comes, you need

434
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,460
to be on that call.

435
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,460
Got it.

436
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,180
I'll join the first part

437
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,460
and head back in the evening.

438
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,700
You, you...

439
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,220
If you want to go home,

440
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
let him start earlier.

441
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,500
(Tang Yang)
No overtime today.

442
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,620
I can accompany you.

443
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,300
What are you doing?

444
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,420
- I want a piece.
- No way.

445
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,380
You're just eyeing my sausage.

446
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,220
Yours is so precious?

447
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,780
Yang, hurry up and eat.

448
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,980
I'll take you down.

449
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,540
Okay.

450
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,220
Let's start the meeting earlier.

451
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,020
After it ends, I'll go accompany my mom.

452
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,860
I also want to start earlier.

453
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,780
It also depends

454
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,900
on their timing over there.

455
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,380
Did you drive today?

456
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,500
No.

457
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,460
I'll pick you up after work.

458
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,260
Alright.

459
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,060
Feng and Cheng are annoying,

460
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,700
occupying you while eating.

461
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,180
Have you thought about

462
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,900
why we don't make it public?

463
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,740
Why must it be

464
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,700
so sneaky?

465
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,580
I have thought about this.

466
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,580
Why don't we just make it public?

467
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,220
Let's not act impulsively.

468
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,660
Let's go back and write down

469
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,820
all the pros and cons

470
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
for consideration.

471
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,820
That makes sense.

472
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
What are you two doing?

473
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,340
Waiting for the elevator.

474
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,220
Without pressing the button?

475
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,180
I thought Tang did.

476
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,500
I thought Jiang Shiyan did.

477
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,460
The elevator.

478
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,700
Where are you going?

479
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,420
I'm going down.

480
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,580
Let's go.

481
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,060
Then I'm leaving now.

482
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,340
Bye-bye.

483
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,780
It rubbed your feet?

484
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,140
It's this spot. These shoes

485
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,260
always rub a bit.

486
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,940
Alright, I'm leaving.

487
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,300
Bye-bye.

488
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,980
- Tang Yang, you're back.
- Yeah.

489
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,820
We have a meeting.

490
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,820
I'm going back to get my notebook.

491
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,660
Wait for me a moment.

492
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,660
A takeout was delivered.

493
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,300
I put it on your desk.

494
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,100
Takeout?

495
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,700
Okay.

496
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,180
I didn't order takeout.

497
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,380
Why are you grinning over there?

498
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,420
Time for the meeting.

499
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,740
Go ahead for the elevator.

500
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,980
Just one minute.

501
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,500
(Qinglai Art Training Project
Review Meeting)

502
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,180
The Qinglai's loan expansion project

503
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,980
is very misleading.

504
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,700
It failed our trust

505
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,140
and almost caused

506
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,220
a huge amount of bad debt.

507
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,340
But at the same time,

508
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,740
we're also fortunate.

509
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,380
Under Mr. Gao's wise leadership,

510
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,460
thanks to the efficient execution

511
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,700
and responsible attitude

512
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,900
of our credit audit colleagues,

513
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,700
we discovered the problem in time

514
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,580
during the final stage

515
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,140
of the project and contained

516
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,180
the issue,

517
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,300
successfully avoiding bad debt.

518
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,060
During this period,

519
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,220
Vice President Gao

520
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,540
keenly identified the problem

521
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,260
and decisively took action,

522
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,500
quickly notifying

523
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,940
the police and regulatory departments

524
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,940
to prevent the Qinglai Art Training

525
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,820
from causing adverse social impact.

526
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,340
He's made a huge contribution

527
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,660
and set an excellent example

528
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,440
for our colleagues at CBBC.

529
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,060
How did this become Mr. Gao's credit?

530
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,820
I heard the report was written
by Mr. Gan.

531
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,940
No way.

532
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,740
Six months is too long.

533
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,820
Right.

534
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,180
On my side,

535
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,500
it can't exceed three months.

536
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
(Plan)
Is that all?

537
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,580
Is there anything to add?

538
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,900
That would be all.

539
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,780
Then I'll read it out.

540
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,940
The benefits of making it public:

541
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,020
No need to hide from everyone.

542
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,060
We can date openly.

543
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,460
The downsides of making it public:

544
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,060
First, we'll constantly be teased

545
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,020
by our friends,

546
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,940
just like we used

547
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,460
to tease them back then.

548
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,140
Second, we won't have time to be alone.

549
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,860
They'll cling to us.

550
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,500
This is very important.

551
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
Feng looks for us every day
for no reason.

552
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,020
If we go public,

553
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,060
he won't let us go.

554
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,900
Whenever we want a private date,

555
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,220
he'll accuse us of choosing

556
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,620
love over friendship.

557
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,660
He'll definitely say that.

558
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,020
We have too many

559
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,860
mutual friends.

560
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,020
It's been so many years.

561
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,540
Once they know we're together,

562
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,980
they'll keep digging

563
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,100
into our gossip.

564
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,940
It'll be like we have

565
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,420
24-hour surveillance around us.

566
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,300
Every move will be like
in a live broadcast.

567
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,020
No, that's too scary.

568
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
So...

569
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,940
We absolutely cannot make it public.

570
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,900
Alright, the meeting is over.

571
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,740
Done.

572
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,380
Come on.

573
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,580
But

574
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,060
how did we find out

575
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,940
about Feng Weiran

576
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,300
and Jiang Yanan dating?

577
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,700
They were hiding it well,

578
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,140
always pretending with us.

579
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,380
Who knew he'd target his friend?

580
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,260
But you, you...

581
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,460
Didn't you also target your friend?

582
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,300
What's wrong?

583
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,260
Is your wound hurting again?

584
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,700
I didn't touch it at all.

585
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,580
Is it Aunt Yi?

586
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,500
Didn't you buy her and my parents

587
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,580
movie tickets?

588
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,380
It shouldn't be.

589
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,380
I bought the 9:30 ones.

590
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,580
Then it shouldn't be.

591
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,900
No, I'll confirm.

592
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,860
Mom?

593
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,100
I'm back.

594
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,420
Aunt Yi.

595
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,900
Tang is here too.

596
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,980
- Right.
- Right, she's helping me look over

597
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,900
the financial files.

598
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,740
Jiang Shiyan.

599
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,380
Do you know what this is called?

600
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,580
What?

601
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,500
This is taking advantage of Tang.

602
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,860
No, it's not.

603
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,380
For financial consultants like her,

604
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,780
they charge by the hour,

605
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,180
like outside lawyers.

606
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,420
Very expensive.

607
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,860
Aunt, you're just joking.

608
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,300
We're old friends.

609
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
No need for a fee.

610
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,700
Don't mention money.

611
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,540
Alright then.

612
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,700
Have him give you

613
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,180
a portion of the shares.

614
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,740
Mom,

615
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,980
weren't you going to the movies?

616
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,860
Right.

617
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,740
Don't mention it.

618
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,540
I asked him to buy movie tickets.

619
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,420
Your parents and I

620
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,300
all went.

621
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,940
But he bought the tickets

622
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,220
for 4D movies, right?

623
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,100
The movie just started.

624
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,700
The chair was either

625
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
shaking like this

626
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,700
or shaking like that.

627
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,660
Wind blowing here,

628
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,540
and air leaking there.

629
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,060
How was that watching a movie?

630
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,940
We couldn't stand it.

631
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,780
We left halfway through.

632
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,940
Jiang Shiyan,

633
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,220
can you please let us

634
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,100
watch some normal movies in the future?

635
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,740
My fault, my fault.

636
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,180
It's his fault, his fault.

637
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,220
Have you guys eaten?

638
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,060
Yes, yes.

639
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,180
Fish soup with dumplings.

640
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,900
Smart.

641
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,060
Tang,

642
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,860
you've been working all day too.

643
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,700
Finish up early and go home

644
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,660
to rest.

645
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,940
Right, I'll finish these documents,

646
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,180
- and I'll head back.
- Right.

647
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,340
Alright. Jiang Shiyan needs
to rest early too.

648
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,180
- Right.
- Okay?

649
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,860
- Okay.
- Okay, get to work.

650
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,380
Mom, you go ahead.

651
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,220
Okay.

652
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,580
Wait a minute.

653
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,300
So...

654
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,860
Are we continuing?

655
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,500
Tang, Tang.

656
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,100
You have a white hair.

657
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,660
I have some ginseng tea here.

658
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,500
Good for your energy.

659
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,980
Jiang Shiyan, brew her a cup.

660
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,580
Sure thing, I'll do it.

661
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,340
Mom, you hurry and rest.

662
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
Okay, okay.

663
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,540
- What to do?
- I'll confirm again.

664
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,180
Let me check.

665
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,860
Mom, you scared me.

666
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,700
Why are you sneaking around?

667
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,980
I'm checking if you have any fruit.

668
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,540
- Take some for Tang.
- Of course.

669
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,340
It's on the table. Go ahead.

670
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,660
Alright, I'll go get it.

671
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,620
My old colleague

672
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,220
grows them in their estate.

673
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,380
Very environmental.

674
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,660
Apples and pears. Come on.

675
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,220
Alright, I've got it all.

676
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,260
Mom, everything's fine. Just go rest.

677
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,100
Okay, okay, you get to work.

678
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,900
Oh, my.

679
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,180
Aunt Yi scared my heart condition

680
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,100
out of me.

681
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,100
What should we do?

682
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,660
How about my place tomorrow night?

683
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,500
What are you watching?

684
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,900
Today, I want to share

685
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,620
a little trick

686
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,100
for concealing dark circles.

687
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,220
Why does it get darker
the more you do it?

688
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,740
What are you doing?

689
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,420
I'm just recording for fun.

690
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,620
Honey,

691
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,780
I went shopping

692
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,820
at Joy City with Aunt.

693
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,380
I bought some cosmetics

694
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,460
and met a little girl.

695
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,900
She asked me,

696
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,780
"Miss,"

697
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,220
"are you a beauty blogger?"

698
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,580
Then I thought

699
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,220
I could be a beauty blogger.

700
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,500
Right?

701
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,100
So, I recorded one tonight,

702
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,860
but I feel it's not interesting.

703
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Take a look for me.

704
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,900
Let me.

705
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,220
Go ahead.

706
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,860
Today, I want to share

707
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,780
a little trick

708
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,580
for concealing dark circles.

709
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,660
Why does it get darker
the more you do it?

710
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,300
First, let me

711
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,140
show you.

712
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,700
Didn't you say before

713
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,500
you wanted to be a designer again?

714
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,660
Why a beauty blogger now?

715
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,300
Didn't I tell you I wanted

716
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,060
to change my lifestyle?

717
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,220
I also want

718
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,860
to try something new.

719
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,460
Trying new things is fine,

720
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,580
but your video content

721
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,020
might be a bit too monotonous.

722
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,660
It's just a makeup tutorial.

723
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,380
There's nothing

724
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,100
special and memorable.

725
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,780
But makeup is done

726
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,940
step by step.

727
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,300
What's special about it?

728
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,580
No rush.

729
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,460
Tomorrow, I'll ask the company's

730
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,500
promotion and planning team

731
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,260
to think of something for you.

732
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,220
Alright.

733
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,820
But you're special about one thing.

734
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,780
What?

735
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,860
You're especially pretty.

736
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,380
Don't get too close.

737
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,660
Stop here.

738
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,100
I'll walk over.

739
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,580
What's wrong?

740
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,740
Am I not decent enough?

741
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,740
No.

742
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,700
I... I...

743
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,740
Didn't we agree not to go public?

744
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,980
Just teasing you.

745
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,660
But

746
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,820
before we're dating,

747
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,620
didn't I often drive you to work?

748
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,500
Right.

749
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,900
Is this feeling guilty
about being a thief?

750
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,100
What do you mean?

751
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,420
Are you the thief, or am I?

752
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,700
Can't we be a pair of thieves?

753
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,380
That sounds better.

754
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,740
Then I'll leave.

755
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,740
Wait a minute.

756
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,100
No.

757
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,260
I thought about it.

758
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,700
I think we can't keep doing this.

759
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,100
About what?

760
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,100
We can't keep living

761
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,140
under Aunt Yi's shadow.

762
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,700
Didn't we agree to go to my place?

763
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,660
It's not good either.

764
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,740
Ms. Zhou comes over

765
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,060
to cook and clean without notice

766
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,140
every few days.

767
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,980
It's not safe.

768
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,020
That's true.

769
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,580
So, what do you want?

770
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,300
How about this?

771
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,820
I happen to be busy

772
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,380
with work lately,

773
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,940
so I want to rent a short-term

774
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,580
apartment near Yixiu.

775
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,300
Oh, right.

776
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,820
It'll be easier for me to visit you.

777
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,900
Mainly, it'll be easier for you

778
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,180
to commute to work.

779
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,900
Right.

780
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,860
There won't be Aunt Yi

781
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,180
pressuring me to sleep early.

782
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,620
Yes, exactly.

783
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,820
That's right.

784
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,300
So,

785
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,740
since

786
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,260
it's so convenient,

787
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,580
you should just rent it.

788
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,820
Right?

789
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,940
I'll send you the pictures later.

790
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,820
I've picked some out.

791
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,980
No, I meant

792
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,900
I'd pick a few more

793
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,220
and send you the photos.

794
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,620
Okay.

795
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,460
Send me the ones you pick later.

796
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,300
Okay.

797
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,380
I'm off now.

798
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,820
May you work well.

799
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,300
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

800
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:09,460
(Jiang Shiyan)

801
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,340
(I Consider You a Friend)

802
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,260
Okay, cut.

803
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,620
Nina, very good.

804
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,260
Take a break. We'll change the position.

805
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,100
Alright.

806
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,540
Thanks, director.

807
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,090
Nina,

808
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,820
the coordinator told me
about the schedule.

809
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,980
There are two more days.

810
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,140
By Friday, your scenes
will be wrapped up.

811
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,820
Xingyue said she would book your flight.

812
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,700
Do you want to return
to Beijing or Rongcheng?

813
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,500
There's an event
in Beijing next Monday.

814
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,660
If you fly to Beijing,

815
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,700
it'll be easier.

816
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,500
(When to have dinner?)

817
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,940
(Cheng Hui)

818
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,860
(Sheng Nina)
I'm helping out with a scene.

819
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,620
Two days to finish shooting.

820
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,140
(Cheng Hui)
Can we have dinner this weekend?

821
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,100
Sure.

822
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,780
I'll book a place and tell you.

823
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,780
Book my flight back to Rongcheng.

824
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,780
Check it. If there are
no night scenes on Friday,

825
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,460
we can finish shooting
and leave at night.

826
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,500
- Alright.
- Also,

827
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,140
can you ask Xingyue to help me book

828
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,620
that private restaurant of her friend?

829
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,260
For two on Saturday night.

830
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,380
I'll treat someone.

831
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,340
Alright.

832
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,060
Over here, over here.

833
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,940
The driver could pick you up,

834
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,780
but you refused.

835
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,340
I'm afraid of traffic.
The subway is convenient.

836
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,540
Let's go up and take a look.

837
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,860
I checked it out.

838
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,220
Everything is the latest.

839
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,500
Refrigerator, microwave,

840
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,460
washing machine,

841
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,300
and even a dryer,

842
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,300
plus a dishwasher.

843
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,700
You didn't already rent it, did you?

844
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,940
No, I was going to surprise you,

845
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,540
but you might not like it.

846
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,700
We can decide later.

847
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,420
I have something to tell you too,

848
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,860
but it's not a surprise.

849
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,460
You could say it's

850
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,660
a shock.

851
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,500
I'm sorry.

852
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,820
I didn't know.

853
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,980
President Zhou called me over,

854
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,140
and he just said at once,

855
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,060
"Go to this year's New Bud training."

856
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,820
He just notified me,

857
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,820
not for discussion,

858
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,020
so I didn't have a chance to refuse.

859
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,540
What's this training

860
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,780
about?

861
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,980
It's held every two years.

862
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,420
They invite some bank, investment,

863
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,580
and market experts to come

864
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,620
and give lectures.

865
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,260
Gan Yiming used to do it,

866
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,660
but this year, it's my turn.

867
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,100
Where is it?

868
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,700
How long will it take?

869
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,740
This year, it's in Pujiang.

870
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,620
I'll be going

871
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,580
for three weeks.

872
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,220
I know.

873
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,580
I don't want to be gone for that long.

874
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,980
But...

875
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,260
But President Zhou

876
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,220
said right away

877
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,420
that this New Bud training

878
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,740
is beneficial for future

879
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,220
transfers and promotions.

880
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,620
He means he decided on this.

881
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,020
He didn't even give me

882
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,100
a chance to speak.

883
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,900
Three weeks, 21 days.

884
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,340
I know.

885
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,460
A day apart feels like three years.

886
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,180
So, it'll be 63 years

887
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,420
before we see each other.

888
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,780
I don't want to be away

889
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,820
from you for that long.

890
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,100
I swear.

891
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,180
If I have a day off,

892
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,540
I'll run back to see you, okay?

893
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,780
Let me come to see you.

894
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,020
Such training usually has tours

895
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,540
and visits on weekends.

896
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,980
It'd be troublesome for you.

897
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,900
I'll go see you.

898
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,300
But will you be very busy?

899
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,340
That won't stop me from seeing you.

900
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,620
When I was sick and resting,

901
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,220
it didn't affect my work at all.

902
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,460
Would you be angry?

903
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,620
Not at all?

904
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,180
There might be a little

905
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,660
disappointment and sadness,

906
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,460
but not a bit of anger.

907
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,860
Alright.

908
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,620
It's work; it's understandable.

909
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,100
When do you go?

910
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,460
Classes start on Monday.

911
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,020
I'll be there by Sunday.

912
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,500
But I promise I won't

913
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,300
work overtime this weekend.

914
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,660
I'll spend all my time with you.

915
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,100
Then let's go eat something now.

916
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,420
Sure.

917
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,700
What do you want?

918
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,820
At this hour, nothing will be

919
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,740
left at Zhilan Snacks, right?

920
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,620
If we could have some snacks

921
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,340
and a bowl of noodles,

922
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,580
that would be so wonderful.

923
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,700
Why are you laughing?

924
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,020
Laughing at your hair.

925
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,980
Let's go.

926
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:29,540
(Zhilan Snacks)

927
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,380
You bought it in advance?

928
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,740
How did you know I wanted to eat this?

929
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,580
I also got you

930
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,980
your favorite honey cake.

931
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,500
I thought after renting the apartment,

932
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,900
no one would bother us today,

933
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
so we could enjoy this.

934
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,940
So, should we

935
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,700
go to my place?

936
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,340
I confirmed with Ms. Zhou.

937
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,580
She has something to do

938
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,220
and won't come to my house.

939
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,700
Let's go.

940
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,260
What's wrong?

941
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,820
What's wrong?

942
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,500
Cheng Hui.

943
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,620
Cheng Hui?

944
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,400
How did he end up here?

945
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,250
No, no.

946
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,220
If Cheng Hui finds out,

947
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,340
he'll definitely follow us.

948
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,820
Right.

949
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,060
Why does our date feel like

950
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,300
being thieves?

951
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,060
So secretive and guilty.

952
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,140
Has the enemy left?

953
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,020
I don't know.

954
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,420
What are you two doing?

955
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,580
Did you find your stuff?

956
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,220
No, have you found it?

957
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,660
Not yet.

958
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,660
Forget it. It's not important.

959
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,420
- Forget it?
- It's lost anyway.

960
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,460
What are you two doing here?

961
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,660
I...

962
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,220
I've been busy with work lately,

963
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,020
so I wanted to rent a serviced apartment

964
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,500
closer to the company.

965
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,780
Tang is helping me.

966
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,300
Right, I'm helping him.

967
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,580
Have you rented it?

968
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,780
No, no, no.

969
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,660
- Too pricey.
- Right, too pricey.

970
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,620
Not worth it.

971
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,340
What are you doing here?

972
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,180
Yeah.

973
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,660
I live here.

974
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,620
For Yang.

975
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,580
For Yang.

976
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,140
For Yang.

977
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,060
Yang, see you
at the old place after school.

978
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,260
I'll wait for you.

979
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,060
Hurry up.

980
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,500
Why so late?

981
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,180
I've been waiting for ages.

982
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Feng Weiran,
why are you acting all sneaky?

983
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,180
The teacher mentioned you.

984
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,380
Didn't submit your corrections.

985
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,300
I went to get cake and milk tea.

986
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,380
Are you treating today?

987
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,460
So filial.

988
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,940
No, are you two

989
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,100
out of your minds?

990
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,660
It's your cousin's birthday.

991
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,580
Don't you know?

992
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,820
- Who?
- My cousin?

993
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,340
Jiang Yanan.

994
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,980
It's her birthday?

995
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,300
How did you find out?

996
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,260
Right.

997
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,620
I ran into Jiang Yanan

998
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,620
during the big break

999
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,660
at noon today.

1000
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,740
She said it.

1001
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,860
She said her parents

1002
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,740
were not in Rongcheng,

1003
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,620
and her grandparents were too old

1004
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,460
to know this.

1005
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,780
There's only one birthday a year,

1006
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,180
so it has to be done well.

1007
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,020
She loves drinking this milk tea,

1008
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,020
so I prepared it for her.

1009
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,580
Good choice.

1010
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,460
It takes over an hour

1011
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,660
to queue for this milk tea.

1012
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,700
Usually, you can't get it.

1013
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,660
How did you buy it?

1014
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,900
I'm so clever.

1015
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,180
I found someone yesterday

1016
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,380
to help me buy it.

1017
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,620
I spent 50 yuan.

1018
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,100
If I queued after class,

1019
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,780
I wouldn't get it

1020
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,820
until tomorrow.

1021
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,020
Wait a minute.

1022
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,140
No, no.

1023
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,940
Didn't you say you found out

1024
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,380
about her birthday at noon today?

1025
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,260
Why did you find help yesterday?

1026
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,380
Well.

1027
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,100
What's going on with you?

1028
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,220
- What's going on?
- I...

1029
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,700
Nothing's going on.

1030
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,900
Do you have a crush on her?

1031
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,780
I... I don't.

1032
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,180
I don't.

1033
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,500
What crush?

1034
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,780
I'm just celebrating her birthday.

1035
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,780
What does her birthday matter to you?

1036
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,100
She...

1037
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,620
Isn't Jiang Yanan your cousin?

1038
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,380
Aren't you my bro?

1039
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,580
Then isn't your sister

1040
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,580
my sister?

1041
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,060
During holidays, we always play
and do homework

1042
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,900
together.

1043
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,100
What's wrong with this?

1044
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,020
That's true.

1045
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,180
It does sound a bit forced.

1046
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,020
Yeah, right.

1047
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,540
But it also seems reasonable.

1048
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,420
Just good friends. No problem.

1049
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
But I'm warning you.

1050
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,940
She's a freshman.

1051
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,420
Don't mess with her.

1052
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,100
I swear. I really didn't.

1053
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
Can you believe

1054
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,060
- your bro?
- Seriously.

1055
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,420
- He won't do it.
- So many years.

1056
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,180
Yanan!

1057
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,900
Ms. Hu?

1058
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,180
Did you pass the note to Jiang Yanan?

1059
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,660
Ms. Hu.

1060
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,740
My cousin's dad...

1061
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,500
My second uncle.

1062
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,140
He's often not in Rongcheng.

1063
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,340
He asked me to look after her.

1064
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,660
Today is her birthday.

1065
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,780
I thought about buying her

1066
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,340
a small cake

1067
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,900
and milk tea to celebrate,

1068
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,660
so I asked her classmates

1069
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,340
to pass her a note.

1070
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,580
Jiang Shiyan,

1071
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,740
it's good
that you're helping your sister,

1072
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,020
but you're all seniors now.

1073
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,700
You need to focus on your studies.

1074
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,060
Yes, yes, yes.

1075
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,980
Don't get distracted

1076
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,100
by other things.

1077
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,220
The college entrance exam is crucial.

1078
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,940
Okay.

1079
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,500
Hurry up and eat the cake,

1080
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,580
and get back to studying.

1081
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,020
Thanks, Ms. Hu.

1082
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,940
Thanks, Ms. Hu.

1083
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,260
