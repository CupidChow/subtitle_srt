Have some beer. Come on.

Okay. Thanks.

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,500
Cold Harbin Beer?

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,000
Of course.

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Come on.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,940
Jiang Shiyan.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,960
You're a big boss now.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,890
I wouldn't dare

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,750
drink the beer you serve.

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,780
Don't be ridiculous.

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,080
Ask Feng Weiran.

39
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,190
As co-founders,

40
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,440
we've never gotten

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,310
any dividends.

42
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,700
You work at a giant technology company,

43
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,000
so stop making fun of me.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,110
Your job is much better than mine.

45
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,950
Feng Weiran.

46
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,010
Come on.

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,270
Everyone else is here

48
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,730
except for you two.

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,920
What took you so long?

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,460
Did you make a deal to come together?

51
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,590
No. I saw Sun Xiao

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,800
- by chance
- Have a seat.

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,670
when I passed the subway station,

54
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,040
so I picked her up.

55
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,900
Come on. Have a seat.

56
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,430
Boss.

57
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,680
It seems no one

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,620
is going to give a speech
at the conference today.

59
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,550
My mute spell

60
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,500
has finally worked.

61
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,010
You should thank me for using magic.

62
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,000
Why are you two always talking about

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,120
some weird

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,410
secret codes?

65
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,780
Jiang Shiyan.

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,080
You're a super busy boss right now.

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,270
How can you have time to come?

68
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,320
Stop mocking me.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,290
Ask Yang about it.

70
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,990
I never missed any parties
or badminton games

71
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,870
on weekends.

72
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,780
That's true.

73
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,850
You only hang out with Yang.

74
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,670
You guys...

75
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,620
- Have some tea.
- Jiang Shiyan.

76
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,620
Stop talking.

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,920
Bring us some fruit.

78
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,760
Okay.

79
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,880
Yes,

80
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,880
my boss.

81
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,660
Boss, what about our salary?

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,870
Of course I'll pay your salary.

83
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,940
Don't you believe me?

84
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,430
Hello.

85
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,800
- It's been a long time.
- Have a seat.

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,290
Hello, hello. Have a seat.

87
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,190
Did you have a reunion

88
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,180
in Spring Festival?

89
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,520
I was traveling,

90
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,640
so I couldn't come.

91
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,670
Yes, we wanted

92
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,800
to have the reunion

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,960
on the monitor's birthday.

94
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,990
However, Cheng Xinyi suddenly came back,

95
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,040
and Feng Weiran said

96
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,060
she'd only stay for a few days.

97
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,760
She told him in advance

98
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,060
to gather everyone.

99
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,960
Wait. Why did Cheng Xinyi

100
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,180
call Feng Weiran?

101
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,270
She used to be

102
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,460
Jiang Shiyan's girlfriend,

103
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,620
right, Tang yang?

104
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,410
I didn't know that.

105
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,190
Aren't you best buddies

106
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,970
without any secrets?

107
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,340
Stop spoiling the fun.

108
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,710
When Chang Xinyi and Jiang Shiyan

109
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,780
were together,

110
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,320
Yang wasn't there.

111
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,290
She went to another city.

112
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,080
Besides, they were only together
for a short time.

113
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,200
A few months later,

114
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Cheng Xinyi decided

115
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,850
to study abroad.

116
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,900
When she left,

117
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,780
Yang wasn't in Rongcheng.

118
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,730
Well...

119
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,080
There was a time

120
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,800
when my mother went to Beijing

121
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,200
for training

122
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,360
and left me with my father.

123
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,870
He was in Gansu at that time,

124
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,870
so I stayed there

125
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,960
for a while,

126
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,640
and we traveled to Dunhuang

127
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,780
for a few days.

128
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,040
When I came back,

129
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,170
I found Chang Xinyi had left.

130
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,830
Well, Jiang Shiyan must've told you

131
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,340
they were together.

132
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,680
Oh, he did.

133
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,610
He did.

134
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,830
It's not like that. I...

135
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,040
It's been too long,

136
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,470
and I didn't pay attention
to these things,

137
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,220
so I forgot he told me.

138
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,900
Then do you think

139
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,000
his first kiss

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,440
was also with Chang Xinyi?

141
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,820
Absolutely.

142
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,700
Yes.

143
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,660
To be honest,

144
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,070
there was a rumor in the class

145
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,700
that you and Jiang Shiyan were together.

146
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,020
However, he started to call you bro,

147
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,160
so we realized

148
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,830
that you were

149
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,390
best buddies.

150
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,270
It's brotherhood.

151
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,530
You haven't changed at all

152
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,730
over the ten years.

153
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,000
- Yes.
- To be honest,

154
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,520
if I have such a good male friend,

155
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,560
it won't matter

156
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,880
whether I have a boyfriend or not.

157
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,720
After all,

158
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,470
this friend can help you
whenever you need him,

159
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,410
and you won't be alone
when you're old.

160
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,290
That's not necessarily true.

161
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,000
After all, friendship

162
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,120
and love

163
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,370
are two different things.

164
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,710
They're both busy with work

165
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,830
and don't have time for a relationship.

166
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,000
When one of them

167
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
finds the other half,

168
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,640
no one will know

169
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,030
if they can still be friends,

170
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,490
especially for Jiang Shiyan.

171
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,070
Ruili.

172
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,340
I just... I'll talk to him for a minute.

173
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,870
I didn't see you.

174
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,710
It's been a long time.

175
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,600
- I heard you've been
- Over the years...

176
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,720
working on

177
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,200
robotic software development, right?

178
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,050
Yes.

179
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,230
All my long-term partners

180
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,440
are big robotics developers

181
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,120
in the country.

182
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,070
- Really?
- Yes.

183
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,200
I was introducing

184
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,420
hardware and software integration.

185
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,160
Really?

186
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,600
That's great.

187
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,680
I heard it's a fast-growing

188
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,000
and profitable market.

189
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,880
Not at all.

190
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,790
Just make a living.

191
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,480
Congratulations. It's impressive.

192
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,410
What are you so happy about?

193
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,670
Here, have some fruit.

194
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,900
Thank you so much.

195
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,580
Give it to me.

196
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,560
- Okay.
- Go get the call.

197
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,460
I need to take this.

198
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,280
Hello?

199
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,530
Have some fruit.

200
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,150
- Thanks.
- I think it's close.

201
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,990
What's close?

202
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,120
Many girls will fall for

203
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,820
an outstanding rich bachelor

204
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,320
like Jiang Shiyan, right?

205
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,880
Feng Weiran, you're his best friend.

206
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,580
You know him well.
Tell us how many girls he has.

207
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Don't ask me.

208
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,350
I know nothing.

209
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,470
Why are you covering for him?

210
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,660
Feng Weiran,

211
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,390
did you also

212
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,530
like Chang Xinyi back then?

213
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,140
Everyone except me

214
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,390
pursued Chang Xinyi,

215
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,230
right?

216
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,170
You were the craziest pursuer.

217
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,600
However,

218
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,710
I think

219
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,240
Chang Xinyi and Jiang Shiyan

220
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,100
are a better match.

221
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,310
Feng Weiran,

222
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,030
Chang Xinyi called me

223
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,590
and said she went to the wrong door

224
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,430
and got lost.

225
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,600
Let's pick her up.

226
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,710
See?

227
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,150
That's what I'm talking about.

228
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,170
Chang Xinyi and Jiang Shiyan
are meant to be together.

229
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,680
She couldn't get through to Feng Weiran,

230
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,170
so she called me instead.

231
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,480
- Let's go.
- Stop making excuses.

232
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
I don't even have her WeChat.

233
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,290
You must've been
talking to each other a lot.

234
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,970
- Enough. No more gossip.
- We'll pick her up.

235
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,850
Something must be wrong.

236
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,160
Chang Xinyi is special.

237
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,610
They both went to pick her up.

238
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,190
They can't wait

239
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,640
to see their dream lover in high school.

240
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,850
I told her to wait by the lake.

241
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,490
She might fall into the water.

242
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,220
Hurry.

243
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,610
Maybe

244
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,760
- They have a thing.
- they're getting back together.

245
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,340
What did she tell you on the phone?

246
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,480
She said she came back

247
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,930
for her family this time.

248
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,820
She'll go back after meeting us.

249
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,070
Later this year,

250
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,370
she'll stay in the country for a while,

251
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,780
and we can hang out more often.

252
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,850
See? I told you

253
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,680
you're special

254
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,730
to her.

255
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,600
Stop talking nonsense.

256
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,050
If you say it again,
I'll tell Jiang Yanan.

257
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,390
What did I do?

258
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,930
You're acting like I made a mistake.

259
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,110
Chang Xinyi.

260
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,930
Good to see you.

261
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,600
Me too.

262
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,260
Come on, cheers.

263
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,850
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

264
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,930
Here's to you.

265
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,100
Take your time.

266
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,410
Guys, I want to say something.

267
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,930
Everyone is busy,

268
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,760
so it's hard to get together.

269
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,560
Enjoy yourselves today,

270
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,790
and I'll pay for everything.

271
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,790
Come on. Cheers!

272
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,830
- Okay.
- Cheers!

273
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,100
Thanks, Mr. Feng.

274
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,010
Cheers. Cheers.

275
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,770
- Come on.
- Cheers.

276
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,230
Tell me when you get home.

277
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,270
Goodbye. See you.

278
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,320
Be careful.

279
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,850
- Goodbye.
- Be safe.

280
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,180
- Watch out.
- Slow down.

281
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,920
Yang.

282
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,100
My driver is here. Let me send you home.

283
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,320
- It's okay.
- You can park your car here

284
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,360
and pick it up tomorrow morning.

285
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,380
I'll call a designated driver.

286
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,670
Shiyan.

287
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,670
Shiyan.

288
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,750
Send Xinyi back.

289
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,800
She lives in the InterContinental Hotel.

290
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,830
You can send her back
on your way home.

291
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,800
I'll send Yang after Xinyi gets off.

292
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,560
It's okay. I'll take a cab.

293
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,590
I'm going to work tomorrow,

294
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,440
so I need my car.

295
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,790
I'll call a designated driver.

296
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,630
Don't worry.

297
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,820
I can pick you up tomorrow morning.

298
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,830
Stop.

299
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,490
What are you doing?

300
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,200
Why are you making it a big deal?

301
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,420
Stop wasting our time.

302
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,650
Just tell Wang

303
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,560
to drive Yang's car and send her back.

304
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,580
That's it.

305
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,040
If you're worried,

306
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,110
I'll go with them

307
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,730
and send her home, okay?

308
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,220
- Well...
- Okay.

309
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,820
It's a deal.

310
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,150
Wang will drive my car

311
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,200
to send me and Feng Weiran.

312
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,700
You'll send Xinyi back. That's it.

313
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,610
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Come on.

314
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,440
Xinyi, see you next time.

315
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,280
Can you do that?

316
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,970
Send her back. Tell me when you arrive.

317
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,620
(Leisure House)

318
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,300
My driver

319
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,750
will come in a while.

320
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,590
Wait a minute.

321
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,320
I'll talk to Feng Weiran later

322
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,440
about the thing

323
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,280
you told me.

324
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,320
Okay, I'll send the information

325
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,540
to you later.

326
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,520
Okay.

327
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,890
Thank you for believing in our company.

328
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,920
Of course I do.

329
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,870
After all,

330
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,130
you're Jiang Shiyan.

331
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,220
Yang,

332
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,340
something's wrong with you.

333
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,460
What's wrong?

334
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,630
I knew it right away

335
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,610
that you wanted
Jiang Shiyan and Chang Xinyi

336
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,750
to get back

337
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,730
together.

338
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,820
How... How did you know?

339
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,970
Come on.

340
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,490
We're best friends,

341
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,010
and I'm smart.

342
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,280
I knew what you meant

343
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,650
once I heard it,

344
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,750
so I insisted on

345
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,590
sending you back.

346
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,800
You would never get in their car

347
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,650
and interrupt their romantic moments.

348
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,190
I...

349
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,220
I...

350
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,220
I'll tell you another top secret.

351
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,430
Say it.

352
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,010
Do you know

353
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,510
Jiang Shiyan was the first person

354
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,810
Chang Xinyi called when she came back?

355
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,230
No.

356
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,560
Do you know why Chang Xinyi

357
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,180
called Jiang Shiyan.

358
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,300
No, I don't.

359
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,060
Listen,

360
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,220
Chang Xinyi

361
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,890
has been working on

362
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,770
overseas listing of domestic companies

363
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,870
all these years,

364
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,400
so she contacted Jiang Shiyan

365
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,230
to ask him if Yixiu needs

366
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,460
to list overseas.

367
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,460
To be honest,

368
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,560
I don't think

369
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,710
Yixiu is ready

370
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,180
for going listed.

371
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,820
However, Jiang Xinyi said

372
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,080
many of her clients

373
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,370
are quite interested in

374
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,770
investing us.

375
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,010
She can help us
with the C round of financing.

376
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,220
Do you know

377
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,590
what it means

378
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,230
if Chang Xinyi takes over

379
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,460
Yixiu's case?

380
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,040
- No.
- It means

381
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,240
she'll spend a lot of time

382
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,420
staying here.

383
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,400
She'll go on business trips

384
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,230
have meetings, and visit clients

385
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,610
with Jiang Shiyan.

386
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,820
They'll spend a lot of time together.

387
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,510
It'll be perfect for them

388
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,460
to get back together.

389
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,490
What a wonderful love story.

390
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,100
It's amazing.

391
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,370
It's not amazing at all.

392
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,420
What did you say?

393
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,850
I said you're smart.

394
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,250
I'm so happy.

395
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,420
This is great.

396
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,060
Not great at all.

397
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,860
(Leisure House)

398
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,100
Is Tang Yang

399
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,100
still your friend and bro?

400
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,180
Okay.

401
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,890
She's my bro.

402
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,420
I didn't know she could drink so much.

403
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,510
I heard

404
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,180
she's doing credit work in a bank.

405
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
It's said that credit officers

406
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,130
have to drink a lot every day.

407
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,460
It seems

408
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,820
she's made a lot of progress.

409
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,100
Can she drink a lot?

410
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,490
Normal, she can only drink
two cans of beer.

411
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,110
But she drank a lot today,

412
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,940
at least five for six cans.

413
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,010
Really?

414
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,120
Get in.

415
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,240
Mr. Liu,

416
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,160
please send Ms. Chang

417
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,590
to the InterContinental Hotel.

418
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,430
Okay.

419
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,180
Sorry, I just remembered

420
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,060
I have something important to do.

421
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,180
I can't send you.

422
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,540
You're going to see Tang Yang, right?

423
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,310
Yes.

424
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,480
We've been talking about

425
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,510
my company,

426
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,060
so I didn't notice she drank so much.

427
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,650
I'm a little worried.

428
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,850
I need to check her out.

429
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,580
I really envy Tang Yang.

430
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,460
I used to,

431
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,820
and I still do.

432
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,400
Rest early.

433
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,760
Good night.

434
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,950
Bye.

435
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,350
Bye.

436
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,160
(Hello. The door is unlocked.)

437
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,370
(The door is locked.)

438
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,010
Why are you here?

439
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,650
Since we're all here.

440
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,060
Let's keep drinking.

441
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,160
Come on.

442
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,730
Here's to you.

443
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,640
You...

444
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,920
Why are you

445
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,940
so upset?

446
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,030
If you're sad, just tell us,

447
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,220
understand?

448
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,630
What's the point of

449
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,650
sulking here?

450
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,550
You're not candid

451
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,890
or cute at all.

452
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,770
You're on your own.

453
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,370
No one cares about you.

454
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,460
Here's to you.

455
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,650
What are waiting for?

456
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,010
You didn't drink with me all night.

457
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,820
You only wanted to talk to her, right?

458
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,520
Drink...

459
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,540
Forget it. You can't drink.

460
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,250
You need to send her back.

461
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,010
I'll drink alone.

462
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:12,300
(Calling Tang Yang)

463
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:22,660
(Tang Yang, Awaiting response...)

464
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,980
(Calling Feng Weiran)
(Sorry,)

465
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,230
The subscriber you dialed

466
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,740
cannot be connected for the moment...

467
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,310
Yang.

468
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,300
You're here.

469
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,690
We've been waiting for you.

470
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,100
Hurry. Come in.

471
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,760
Yes.

472
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,650
We need a fourth player.

473
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,440
Yang, are you okay?

474
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,400
I'm fine.

475
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,440
I'm drinking with my bros.

476
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,580
You're right on time.

477
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,780
After all, we're best buddies.

478
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,630
How about this?

479
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,520
I'll finish

480
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,020
this one first.

481
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,270
- Stop drinking. Stop.
- I'll finish it.

482
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,110
I'll finish it.

483
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,130
So cool.

484
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,630
Tang Yang.

485
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,640
You're drunk.

486
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,830
I'll get you some honey water.

487
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,500
- Wait a minute.
- Who's drunk?

488
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,170
Who?

489
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,450
No one is drunk.

490
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,750
You're not drunk.

491
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,270
Well, did you finish it?

492
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,310
How dare you judge me?

493
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,300
Did you drink it?

494
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,450
I'll drink. Come on.

495
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,780
Who told you to drink?

496
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,550
That's the only thing
that can make me happy.

497
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,060
Do you have to steal it from me?

498
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,150
Big bad bear!

499
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,590
I'll hit you. I'll hit you.

500
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,640
- Don't hit it. Stop.
- Tonight...

501
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
- I'm Mr. Bad Bear.
- Let me hit it.

502
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,130
Hit me. Your hand will get hurt.

503
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,200
Tang Yang!

504
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,410
Your hand is swollen.

505
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,760
How about this?

506
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,510
Let's have some honey water together,

507
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,370
okay?

508
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,160
Okay, I'll get you up.

509
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,170
Don't touch me.

510
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,930
I'll stop.

511
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,930
Let's hold hands

512
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,070
and have some honey water together,

513
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,910
okay?

514
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,980
Let's go.

515
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,520
Be careful.

516
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,690
The kitchen is over there.

517
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,070
Do you think I don't know

518
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,450
where the kitchen is?

519
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,450
Thank you, sir.

520
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,890
You're so kind.

521
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,780
It's cold outside. Let's get in.

522
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,200
Look.

523
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,310
What's this?

524
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,020
Look.

525
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,720
What?

526
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,550
Look at your Moonlight.
[*Moonlight: Crush hidden in your heart]

527
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,100
I don't have a Moonlight.

528
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,580
You do.

529
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,880
I don't.

530
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,510
- You do.
- I don't.

531
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,350
You do.

532
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,190
I really don't.

533
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,920
You do! Chang Xinyi is your Moonlight.

534
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,100
I really don't.

535
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,720
You do.

536
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,820
Okay.

537
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,210
I... I do.

538
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
If you say so.

539
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,510
Okay? It's up to you

540
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,600
whether I have a Moonlight or not,

541
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,440
okay?

542
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,060
I know you have a Moonlight.

543
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,920
Why didn't you admit it?

544
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,130
You have a Moonlight.

545
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,300
I really don't,

546
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,210
but you said I had one.

547
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,740
If she's your Moonlight,

548
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,060
what am I?

549
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,170
She's not my Moonlight,

550
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,650
but you're my Little Sunshine.

551
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,980
Little Sunshine?

552
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,870
Little Sunshine.

553
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,850
Come with me.

554
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,000
Be careful.

555
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,200
Come on.

556
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,780
Yang, what...?

557
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,150
Little Sunshine!

558
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,110
Technically speaking,

559
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,930
it's an overhead light.

560
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,310
Little Sunshine is the bathroom heater

561
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,780
we used to put in our bathroom.

562
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,160
It's a big lightbulb.

563
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,170
It's bright and warm.

564
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,060
So, you're calling me overhead light.

565
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,750
That's not what I mean.

566
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,150
- You're a bathroom heater.
- Bathroom heater?

567
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,440
No, you're Little Sunshine.

568
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,300
- You...
- I...

569
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,200
Shiyan,

570
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,370
why are you here?

571
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,890
Aren't you supposed to be
sending Xinyi back?

572
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,550
Be careful.

573
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,300
Tang Yang, are you mad at me

574
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,980
because you heard

575
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,210
I was going to

576
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,280
send Xinyi back?

577
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,020
But it was you who told me to do it.

578
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,240
She asked you to pick her up,

579
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,270
so you should

580
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,370
send her back.

581
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,170
Are you jealous?

582
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,310
Shut up. I'm not.

583
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,260
I'm not.

584
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,850
Then why are you mad?

585
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,740
I'm not mad. I...

586
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,980
I'm so happy right now.

587
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,220
(Mute Spell)

588
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,550
Okay.

589
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,540
Stop talking.

590
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,180
(Mute Spell)

591
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,960
I think

592
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,210
you look like

593
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,210
that ungrateful Jiang Shiyan.

594
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,260
Look, look at this.

595
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,310
The eyes,

596
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,610
the nose, and the mouth...

597
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,620
(Mute Spell)
It's yellow.

598
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,130
It's red again.

599
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,370
So, you got angry

600
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,500
when you heard I was going to

601
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,500
pick Chang Xinyi up.

602
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,780
I was angry.

603
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,510
Do you hate

604
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,890
that ungrateful Jiang Shiyan?

605
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,450
I do.

606
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,370
You don't want him

607
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,240
to talk to any other girls,

608
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,370
do you?

609
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,160
I can't answer.

610
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,130
The spell is broken.

611
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,500
Actually, I...

612
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,780
Your lips

613
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,470
are pink and soft.

614
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,300
It must feel nice when kissing.

615
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,270
Did you kiss Chang Xinyi?

616
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,410
How many times?

617
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,610
- I...
- Stop.

618
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,260
I can't accept it.

619
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,580
No.

620
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,680
A real hero

621
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,450
has the guts to face the cruel reality.

622
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,340
It's okay. Just tell me.
I can handle it.

623
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,360
Actually, I can't!

624
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm a coward!

625
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,600
I can't accept it.

626
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,580
I don't want to know the answer.

627
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,020
I didn't kiss her.

628
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,340
We only had a meal once.

629
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,450
And I went shopping with her once

630
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,690
for the stuff
she needed for going abroad.

631
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,610
I really didn't kiss her.

632
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,340
I didn't even hold her hands.

633
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,410
You didn't?

634
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,060
Then let's kiss.

635
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,060
Just one kiss,

636
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,450
but you can't tell anyone.

637
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,440
Shiyan, how dare you?

638
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,480
I treat you like my bro.

639
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,850
How dare you try to kiss me?

640
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,830

You're awake.

659
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,060
Have breakfast.

660
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,200
What time is it? Why did you come here

661
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,500
early in the morning to make breakfast?

662
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,540
What do you mean I came early?

663
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,540
I didn't leave.

664
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,850
What?

665
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,920
You blacked out.

666
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,760
I...

667
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,370
I wasn't that drunk, was I?

668
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,070
I remember we ate dinner

669
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,070
and drank a lot,

670
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,910
and...

671
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,930
Then...

672
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,790
Feng Weiran was going to send me home,

673
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,610
and you were going to
send Chang Xinyi home, right?

674
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,710
Yes. Then you came back,

675
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,260
and I came and drank with you.

676
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,210
Do you remember what you said to me?

677
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,710
I didn't go too far,

678
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,850
did I?

679
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,450
I'm always rational.

680
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,580
You were quite rational.

681
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,540
Drink the honey water.

682
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,130
Shiyan!

683
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,840
My elephant bush came back to life.

684
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,060
Did you do that?

685
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,550
I didn't.

686
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,260
It was water with some kind of elixir

687
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,580
and came back to life.

688
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,130
Elixir?

689
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,850
What a miracle.

690
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,500
It came back to life overnight.

691
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,930
Let me see what you're making.

692
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,820
I made brown rice porridge,

693
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,820
spring rolls, pumpkin cakes,

694
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,020
and steamed breads.

695
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,500
You know me best.

696
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,030
I dreamed about

697
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,890
having brown rice porridge,

698
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,850
and here it is.

699
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,930
You're magical.

700
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Go get cleaned up

701
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,280
I'll get the door.

702
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,300
Yang!

703
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,210
What are you doing here?

704
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,650
I... Where's Feng Weiran?

705
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,510
What happened?

706
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,510
Yang!

707
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,370
What's wrong?

708
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,690
It's okay. Don't cry.

709
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,810
What happened?

710
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,060
I don't know.

711
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,780
It's okay. It's okay.

712
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,340
Don't cry.

713
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,820
Don't cry.

714
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,510
It's still early.

715
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,610
You haven't had breakfast, right?

716
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,890
Have some porridge.

717
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,130
Did you put sugar in it?

718
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,030
I thought you didn't eat sugar.

719
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:46,870
Yes.

720
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,550
Thanks.

721
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,340
It's so early. What happened?

722
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,780
Did you have a fight with Feng Weiran?

723
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,170
How's that possible?

724
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,100
Feng Weiran wouldn't dare to talk back

725
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,610
when she scolds him.

726
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,930
Feng Weiran kicked me out.

727
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,990
How's that possible?

728
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,990
No way.

729
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,550
Yes. He'll go on a business trip, right?

730
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,510
He's going on a business trip!

731
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,020
How could he kick me out?

732
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,690
Calm down.

733
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,790
He's got appointments

734
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,760
with three investment organizations
in Shenzhen this week.

735
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,160
He's catching an early flight now.

736
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,130
Should I find him?

737
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,370
I'll walk you out.

738
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,230
I'll see him off.

739
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,370
Calm down.

740
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,470
I'll be right back.

741
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,890
Okay. Wait a minute.

742
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,980
Thank you

743
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,100
for last night.

744
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,240
Well,

745
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,930
what will you do to thank me?

746
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,170
What do you want?

747
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
How about the way

748
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,370
you did it last night?

749
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,580
What did I do last night?

750
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,590
You hair.

751
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,340
Goodbye. Talk to you later.

752
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,100
Then...

753
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,740
Be safe on the road.

754
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,300
You...

755
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,100
Be safe when you go back inside.

756
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,780
Press the button.

757
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,030
Well,

758
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,640
remember to eat the porridge, and...

759
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,170
Jiang Yanan will be fine.

760
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,390
I'm leaving.

761
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,130
I'm going in.

762
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,310
Goodbye.

763
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,210
You're at the airport?

764
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,890
What did you do early in the morning?

765
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,690
I was going to...

766
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,580
You ruined everything.

767
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,040
What?

768
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,850
Sell your house?

769
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,410
Call me when you finished
the security check.

770
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,120
Feng Weiran went out

771
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,680
to catch a flight this morning,

772
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,030
and the housing agency called.

773
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,440
That's when you realized

774
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,350
he was going to sell

775
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,160
the two-bedroom apartment

776
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,070
at Rongcheng City Town.

777
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,910
Yes.

778
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,790
So, the agency called

779
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,170
because they needed to take someone
to see the apartment,

780
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,310
but Feng Weiran wasn't home,

781
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,710
so they wanted you to open the door.

782
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,580
Yes.

783
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,880
You're angry

784
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,750
because he decided

785
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,270
to sell the apartment

786
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,170
without asking for your opinion first.

787
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,440
However,

788
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,880
he thinks it's a great deal

789
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,360
to sell it and buy another apartment

790
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,710
in downtown.

791
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,550
Wrong.

792
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,780
It's not about a great deal or not.

793
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,960
It's our first apartment

794
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,440
and first home

795
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,890
we bought it when we got married.

796
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,790
I told him it meant a lot to us,

797
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,840
but he said

798
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,580
it was not profitable

799
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,230
and could only waste
our housing purchase quota.

800
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,470
Yes, I understand

801
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,610
what he meant,

802
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,030
but he should've told me

803
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,020
when he decided to sell it, right?

804
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,060
It's definitely his fault.

805
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,920
How could he not tell me
about selling the apartment?

806
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,810
Wait. I'll take this.

807
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,670
Don't.

808
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,900
It's Feng Weiran.

809
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,550
(Call, Feng Weiran)
It's really him.

810
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,630
I don't want to hear his voice.

811
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,100
I hung up. I won't answer it.

812
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,640
But I...

813
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,900
Don't!

814
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,990
It's Jiang Shiyan.

815
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,730
Jiang Shi...

816
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,280
(Call, Jiang Shiyan)
It's really him.

817
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,210
He wants to persuade me!

818
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,170
Then...

819
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,070
Okay. I hung up.

820
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,940
I won't answer it either.

821
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,360
On my way here,

822
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,250
I was thinking...

823
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,470
I shouldn't have become

824
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,940
a housewife when I was so young, right?

825
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,650
I should've learned from you.

826
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,440
Look at you two.

827
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,960
If Jiang Shiyan is going to
sell his apartment,

828
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,060
he'll ask for your opinion, right?

829
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,510
And you'll do the same

830
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,670
when you want to sell your apartment.

831
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,720
Why didn't Feng Weiran

832
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,510
ask for my opinion?

833
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,510
We're a married couple.

834
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,550
Are you a couple?

835
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,390
No.

836
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,130
But you can't deny everything.

837
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,670
You've been good

838
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,670
so far, right?

839
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,330
You're sweet and cheesy.
You're the perfect couple.

840
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,280
You only had a fight once in a while.

841
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,120
No.

842
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,540
We never fight.

843
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,900
We don't have time.

844
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,940
He's been so busy.

845
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,420
He doesn't have a choice, does he?

846
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,230
As you know, their company

847
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,670
is preparing for the C Round...

848
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,510
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,120
C Round?

850
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,690
I never heard of it.

851
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,280
Okay.

852
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,460
As the CEO and CFO,

853
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,760
he'll be

854
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
the most stressed person

855
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,990
when preparing for

856
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,510
the financing.

857
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,510
You get it,

858
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,350
right?

859
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,880
Besides, Jiang Shiyan told me

860
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,920
he's going to meet

861
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,810
a couple of big investors this time.

862
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,170
It's very stressful

863
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,690
and important,

864
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,210
right?

865
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,600
Okay.

866
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,830
Yes.

867
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,230
He doesn't even tell me

868
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,540
about his work now.

869
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,720
No. Yanan, that's not

870
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,590
what I meant.

871
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,810
Yang, don't persuade me.

872
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,290
I've made up my mind.

873
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,290
I'm not coming back.

874
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,250
I'll live here for a few days.

875
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,080
Live...

876
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,980
Okay. No problem.

877
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,460
But what about Qi?

878
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,840
He happened to go

879
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,720
to his grandmother's house.

880
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,580
Any more porridge?

881
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,710
Yes. Over there.

882
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,060
- I'll have more.
- Okay.

883
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,270
You've finished eating, right?

884
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,290
I'll finish it.

885
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
Hello.

886
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,020
Is Jiang Yanan still there?

887
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,670
Yes.

888
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,540
Yang!

889
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,610
Look!

890
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,730
So happy.

891
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,170
Is she still angry?

892
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,100
I don't think

893
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,690
she's angry at all.

894
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,280
On the contrary, she looks

895
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,250
so happy right now.

896
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,170
She said she was happy
to be single again.

897
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,720
She doesn't need to pick up her son

898
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,510
and send him to remedial classes

899
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,360
or read three story books

900
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,840
every night

901
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,250
and go to bed at 9:00 p.m.

902
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,900
She can go to sleep whenever she wants

903
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,210
and eat as many snacks as she wants.

904
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,550
I'll ask Feng Weiran tomorrow

905
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,770
if he can come back.

906
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,760
Okay.

907
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,200
What's wrong?

908
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,690
Are we broke?

909
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,910
What?

910
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,030
Cheng Hui...

911
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,420
Do you know how to speak properly?

912
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,330
If not, just shut up.

913
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,360
I just talked to Yunhe and Dingshen

914
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,590
about two funds,

915
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,100
and they were very interested.

916
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,380
They're even talking about
who's going to lead the investment.

917
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,760
Oh, I see.

918
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,350
Okay.

919
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,000
We won't be broke,

920
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,130
but why are you still unhappy?

921
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,670
I made a deal with some friends

922
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,290
to drive to the Arctic Circle together.

923
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,330
If we're broke, I can start my journey.

924
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,160
Jiang Shiyan,

925
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,690
I strongly suggest

926
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,610
you kick Cheng Hui out of the board.

927
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,560
I agree.

928
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,910
By the way,

929
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,470
I've set up the framework

930
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,730
for the cooperation platform

931
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,940
you talked about.

932
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,240
Check this out.

933
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,470
For real?

934
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,770
When will you release it?

935
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,110
Send me the timetable

936
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,280
and the introduction.

937
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,250
I'll add them to the file
for the meeting this afternoon.

938
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,380
You're quite efficient.

939
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,920
It's a direct
resource placement platform

940
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,760
for enterprises

941
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,460
and brands.

942
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,210
With this platform,

943
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,110
they can directly contact

944
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,250
influencers

945
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,200
and channels.

946
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,840
By the way, you can invite us

947
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,080
to a video conference in the afternoon,

948
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,190
and Cheng Hui

949
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,150
will introduce the features

950
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,470
and the framework.

951
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,770
I think the investors

952
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,240
will see the platform's potential

953
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,130
in business cooperation in the future.

954
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,910
Got it.

955
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,880
So, why are you staring at each other?

956
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,770
What happened?

957
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,330
My wife is angry at me.

958
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,980
She won't come home.

959
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,130
She's living with Yang.

960
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,440
I'm in another city

961
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,280
and can't come back.

962
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,650
I can't persuade her.

963
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,920
She's been sticking with Yang

964
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,280
like an octopus.

965
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,360
I haven't even gotten a chance

966
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,200
to have a meal with her.

967
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,480
Why don't you

968
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,460
bring Mrs. Feng too?

969
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,320
Or do you want to spend time

970
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,180
with Yang alone?

971
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,150
She's the one who wants

972
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,060
to occupy Yang

973
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,380
and exclude me.

974
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,150
Shiyan.

975
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,280
Shiyan!

976
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,760
Have a seat.

977
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,250
I'll serve the dishes.

978
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,000
Let me help you.

979
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,130
- Stop singing.
- Why did you kick me?

980
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,380
Watermelon juice.

981
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,290
It's hot. Do you want some?

982
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,060
I can't. I can't drink it today.

983
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,580
- I'll get a warm drink.
- Okay.

984
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,500
So cool.

985
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,200
Food is here.

986
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:23,990
It's too hot,

987
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,020
so I didn't use fire.

988
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,130
I only made some cold dishes.

989
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,320
Why did you suddenly

990
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,610
invite us to a meal?

991
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
The magazine paid me

992
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,560
this month.

993
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,420
Really? How much?

994
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,990
(Eight) hundred yuan.

995
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,500
That's a lot.

996
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:39,960
I heard

997
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,690
you were learning bartending in a bar.

998
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,630
I was working on

999
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,960
a special column of Bars in Rongcheng

1000
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,860
at City Magazine,

1001
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,770
so I went to a few bars with them

1002
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,280
and learn some skills

1003
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,170
from the bartenders.

1004
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,280
I made Watermelon Mojito today.

1005
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,120
Let's try it.

1006
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,900
Only this little?

1007
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,130
- I...
- Is this alcohol?

1008
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,610
I made a whole bottle.

1009
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,730
It's going to be

1010
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,540
the most important year of your life.

1011
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,990
The college entrance examination

1012
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,280
was three years ago.

1013
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,500
Get sober, okay?

1014
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,980
What should we do?

1015
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,240
What can I do?

1016
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,360
She's drunk. I...

1017
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,510
I can't persuade

1018
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,900
or hit her.

1019
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,600
Yang.

1020
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,940
I'm begging you.

1021
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,110
After the exam,

1022
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,710
I returned all the physics I learned

1023
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,550
to my teacher.

1024
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,030
All my knowledge

1025
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,330
is gone.

1026
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,560
Yang,

1027
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,060
I'm an art student.

1028
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,580
I don't study physics.

1029
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,580
Why are you laughing?

1030
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,190
It's all because of your Mojito.

1031
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,130
What should we do?

1032
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,960
By the way, why would she bring

1033
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,580
a physics paper?

1034
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,320
She tutors in summer vacations.

1035
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,170
Well...

1036
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,980
She's got math, physics,

1037
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,100
and chemistry papers.

1038
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,960
Hurry up.

1039
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,800
Okay.

1040
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,840
One mistake, ten push-ups.

1041
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,250
Okay. No problem.

1042
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,590
You win.

1043
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,690
I'll do push-ups right now, okay?

1044
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,640
Come on.

1045
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,210
Look. I'm doing it.

1046
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,690
Keep an eye on him. Hurry.

1047
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,400
Watch him.

1048
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,240
Come on.

1049
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,850
One.

1050
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,860
Two.

1051
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,560
Three.

1052
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,510
Four.

1053
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,210
She's like Ms. Zhou, isn't she?

1054
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,680
Great!

1055
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,470
- I really...
- Wait. Wait a minute.

1056
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,760
Get Yang on the couch.

1057
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,030
- Let's go.
- Is she okay?

1058
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,210
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1059
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,990
She's heavy.

1060
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,650
