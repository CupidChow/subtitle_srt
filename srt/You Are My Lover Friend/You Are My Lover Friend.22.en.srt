=Hello, Dear Girlfriend=

27
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,060
Yang, you're here.

28
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,860
Mr. Zhou.

29
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,580
Mr. Zhou heard I was sick,

30
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,560
so he came to visit me.

31
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,660
Mr. Zhou, you're a busy man.

32
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,560
Thank you

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,400
for visiting him.

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,120
It's not a big deal.

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,220
Mr. Jiang and I are good friends now.

36
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,960
Now he's ill. Of course I'd come.

37
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,780
Besides, I called you many times,

38
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,620
but you didn't answer.

39
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,980
I assumed that you were busy
taking care of Mr. Jiang

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,220
and didn't have time,

41
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,880
so I decided to come.

42
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,460
What's so important

43
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,160
that you have to come here to tell me?

44
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,760
It's an emergency.

45
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,840
However, Mr. Jiang
just finished his surgery.

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,280
We'd better let him rest well.

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,560
Shall we find a place

48
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,540
to talk?

49
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,780
Sorry,

50
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,040
I'm here to take care of the patient.

51
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,760
It's time for dinner.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,560
I need to get him some food.

53
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,080
Yang, you're so thoughtful.

54
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,780
It's okay.

55
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,040
The hospital's dinner is early.

56
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,100
I can wait.

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,340
When you finish taking care of him,

58
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,800
we can find a place to talk.

59
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,640
Let me see what I can do

60
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,760
for you.

61
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,800
I'll wash some fruit.

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,840
I'll warm up the egg custard.

63
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,800
It's okay. Well...

64
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,300
The nurse will send dinner over later.

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,560
I'll let her do it.

66
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,360
Don't worry about me.

67
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,680
Find out what he's going to say.

68
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,420
Mr. Zhou.

69
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,620
Let's find a place nearby

70
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,460
and have a quick talk.

71
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,080
Okay, nearby.

72
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,120
Call me if you need anything.

73
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,160
Remember to eat the egg custard.

74
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,580
Let's go.

75
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,760
Mr. Jiang, rest well.

76
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,880
Goodbye.

(Loan Application)

78
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,900
Come in.

79
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,200
Ms. Qin.

80
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,360
What's wrong? Have a seat.

81
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,480
Ms. Tang didn't answer my calls

82
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,960
or reply to my messages.

83
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,700
Mr. Gan wants

84
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,840
that report right now.

85
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,100
So, do you know

86
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,060
which hospital

87
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,120
is Ms. Tang's family in?

88
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,360
Is she taking care of the patient?

89
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,680
Maybe I should go there.

90
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,440
Linlang.

91
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,180
Ms. Tang has worked here

92
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,040
for half a year.

93
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,720
Let me ask you,

94
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
what kind of person

95
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,660
do you think

96
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,120
Ms. Tang is at work?

97
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,360
She's hard-working

98
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,920
and professional.

99
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,320
She doesn't avoid responsibilities.

100
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,500
Then do you think it's impossible

101
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,710
that such a person would take a day off

102
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,040
without leaving any messages?

103
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,520
I get it.

104
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,120
Thanks, Ms. Qin.

105
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,760
I know what to do.

106
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,100
Linlang.

107
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,600
Did you find many problems

108
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,280
during the parallel session of the case?

109
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,940
Yes.

110
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,360
I think the risk of loan repayment
is very high.

111
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,820
(Credit Audit Division)
I sent messages on WeChat

112
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,180
and emails

113
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,400
and called her,

114
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,320
but she didn't reply.

115
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,800
Maybe she's busy
taking care of the patient.

116
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,640
How can she be so irresponsible

117
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,960
with work?

118
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,780
Mr. Gan, if Ms. Tang doesn't sign,

119
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,160
we can't hand in
the loan review report today.

120
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,720
Give it to me. I'll sign it.

121
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,300
Mr. Gan,

122
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,300
whoever signs it

123
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,040
will be responsible for it
for the rest of their life.

124
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,280
Are you sure you'll sign it?

125
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,220
She didn't answer.

126
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,560
Mr. Gan. How about this?

127
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,700
I'll visit Ms. Tang

128
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,480
at her home tomorrow.

129
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,680
Got it. Go on with your work.

Linlang.

132
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,640
Mr. Zhou, I can't believe
you came to the hospital.

133
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,360
You're so determined.

134
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,560
I was afraid that you wouldn't see me.

135
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,820
I can't tell

136
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,780
whether you're honest

137
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,800
or not.

138
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,880
I'm honest.

139
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,760
I'm here

140
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,060
to tell you

141
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,280
my most sincere thoughts

142
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,560
and proposals.

143
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,140
I thought you knew

144
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,640
what kind of person I am.

145
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,080
I get it.

146
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,740
Look,

147
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,800
I work at Jiujiang Investment,

148
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,880
but the core business of the group

149
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,200
is Jiujiang Property.

150
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,620
Linjiang's business circle

151
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,600
has started.

152
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,920
In that case,

153
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,180
it will

154
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,660
lead the development
of surrounding areas.

155
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,900
The barren land

156
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,740
will turn into

157
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,300
a brand new

158
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,640
city central business district.

159
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,360
Development loans are very common.

160
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,760
It'll only benefit

161
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,400
the bank and the developer.

162
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,560
The developer needs funds,

163
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,960
and the bank needs good results.

164
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,180
Mo, you don't have to

165
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,520
talk to me in private again and again.

166
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,100
But there are many restrictions

167
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,440
on pure development loans,

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,260
so I want to divide it
into several aspects

169
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,680
and get

170
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
the government-favored loan

171
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,520
via other channels.

172
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,400
So, Ms. Tang,

173
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,380
please help the private enterprise.

174
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,200
The amount of loan we want to apply

175
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,380
is 70 percent of Linjiang's valuation.

176
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,320
It's around 2 to 2.5 billion yuan.

177
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,040
Once we get the loan,

178
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,280
we'll do anything we need to do

179
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,420
and guarantee your safety.

180
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,280
If it meets the requirements,
you'll get the loan.

181
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,720
If not, you have to make adjustments.

182
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,740
If you're still hoping

183
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,860
that I can do something like this,

184
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,540
I don't think I'll see you again.

185
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,680
Okay, Yang.

186
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,060
Don't be angry.

187
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,320
I'll stop talking.

188
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,140
Have some coffee.

189
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,840
In the past,

190
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,760
many guests would visit us

191
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,630
in the Spring Festival

192
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,860
with plenty of valuable gifts,

193
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,060
and they'd call my mother Teacher Zhou

194
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,320
and my father Director Tang.

195
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,800
That was the first time
I saw foreign cherries.

196
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,840
They're much bigger than
the ones I used to eat.

197
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,120
I knew they'd be so sweet.

198
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,650
I was curious and hungry,

199
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,840
so I tasted some cherries.

200
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,960
However, my mom

201
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,060
insisted on giving them

202
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,160
100 yuan.

203
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,520
When the guests left,

204
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,040
she hit me hard with a feather duster.

205
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,920
She said, "Today, we receive cherries.

206
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,000
Tomorrow, we'll receive gold,

207
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,400
and maybe a house later."

208
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,040
That was the first time she hit me.

209
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,280
Since that day,

210
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,660
we've tried to avoid

211
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,100
spending the Spring Festival
in Rongcheng.

212
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,560
We'd go to the construction site.

213
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,040
Yang,

214
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,800
I know your family
has strict discipline,

215
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,320
but I believe

216
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,180
Ms. Zhou wants you

217
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,200
to have a good life.

218
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,480
As for that,

219
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,800
anything else is useless

220
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,720
except for money.

221
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,100
Mr. Zhou,

222
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,400
how much money does one need
to have a good life?

223
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,800
But at least we should be
innocent and candid.

224
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,120
Innocent and candid.

225
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,120
I know you believe in that.

226
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,720
That's why I envy you.

227
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,720
You're so lucky.

228
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,480
Let me tell you something.

229
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,560
Maybe you never

230
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,080
heard of it.

231
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,040
Do you remember how you got into CBBC?

232
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,500
The whole group

233
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,960
only needed ten management trainees,

234
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,720
and it's the direct recruitment
of the head office.

235
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,120
You can imagine the pressure
of the competitors.

236
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,150
Outstanding graduates
all over the country

237
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,800
sent more than 3000 resumes.

238
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,160
Only 60 survived the first round,

239
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,360
30 for the next round.

240
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,960
The third round is the interview.

241
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,000
I ranked 5th in the interview.

242
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,680
But they only wanted men.

243
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,440
Management trainees are special.

244
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,500
After a series of training sessions,

245
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,350
most of them

246
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,380
will go to the head office
or become the leaders of branches.

247
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,400
They needed people

248
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,040
with excellent ability,
physical strength,

249
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,400
and stability.

250
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,400
You were

251
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,760
single and unmarried.

252
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,360
You never had a boyfriend.

253
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,360
They thought you were not stable.

254
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,840
When I heard about it,

255
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,320
I talked to my uncle,

256
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,770
and President Zhou

257
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,560
persuaded the leaders

258
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,920
to keep you.

259
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,200
Ms. Tang, I wonder if you've noticed

260
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,560
you're not only the youngest trainee

261
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,400
but the only female trainee

262
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,600
in CBBC.

263
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,560
Because they never wanted
a female trainee.

264
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,580
Yang,

265
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,520
do you think you're still
innocent and candid?

266
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,840
(But they only wanted men.)

267
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,360
(They needed people)

268
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,240
(with excellent ability,
physical strength,)

269
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,560
(and stability.)

270
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,240
(They thought you were not stable.)

271
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,760
(When I heard about it,)

272
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,440
(I talked to my uncle.)

273
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,200
(Ms. Tang, I wonder if you've noticed)

274
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,480
(you're not only the youngest trainee)

275
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,520
(but the only female trainee)

276
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,720
(in CBBC.)

277
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,140
(Because they never wanted)

278
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,560
(a female trainee.)

279
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,500
(Yang,)

280
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,600
(do you think you're still
innocent and candid?)

281
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,840
Why are you out?

282
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,720
I was going to see you.

283
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,400
I waited for a long time,
but you didn't come back.

284
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,340
The nurse happened to ask me

285
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,180
to walk around,

286
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,200
so I got out to wait for you.

287
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,400
What about your wound?

288
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,880
Don't worry, I'm fine.

289
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,840
Don't be sad.

290
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,260
Zhou Mo made all this up

291
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,100
to crash your confidence.

292
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,440
The leaders are not that biased.

293
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,100
It's okay.

294
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,040
Listen to me,

295
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,580
Zhou Zixing does not own CBBC,

296
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,800
let alone Zhou Mo.

297
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,220
Rather than saying

298
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,640
their recommendations worked,

299
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,180
I believe

300
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,600
the leaders expected you

301
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,220
to create more value for CBBC

302
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,150
regardless of your gender

303
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,840
based on their thorough consideration.

304
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,400
Think about it,

305
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,560
CBBC wasn't the only one

306
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,320
who offered you a job.

307
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,340
How many big companies

308
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,720
wanted to hire you?

309
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,080
Four or five?

310
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,320
Only two?

311
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,440
Eleven.

312
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,420
See?

313
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,540
Therefore, it was you who chose CBBC,

314
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,560
not the other way around.

315
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,600
If you were not capable,

316
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,000
why would they have promoted you
again and again?

317
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,800
If it weren't for your ability,

318
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,740
why would they have

319
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,020
put Zhang Zhilan's micro business case

320
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,440
on the home page of the system?

321
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
CBBC made the right decision

322
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,480
to have chosen you.

323
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,580
Any educated person

324
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,440
will admire you

325
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,290
and think you're excellent.

326
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,200
Don't listen to Zhou Mo.

327
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,120
He was pissed off

328
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,500
by your harsh words,

329
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,460
so he made this up

330
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,760
to crash your confidence.

331
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
An evil man

332
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,880
can only see an evil world.

333
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,920
Don't listen to him, okay?

334
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,620
You're the most powerful
and adorable Yang

335
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,280
of the entire universe.

336
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,580
Forget about his nonsense.

337
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,420
If he can piss you off,
I'll lose the bet, okay?

338
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,020
Didn't he piss you off once before?

339
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,860
I...

340
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,520
How did you know?

341
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,400
What else could it be?

342
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,720
You always say

343
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,880
"Saturday and Sunday"

344
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,740
instead of "Weekend",
[*Weekend: Homophone of Zhou Mo]

345
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,760
and you don't allow me to say it.

346
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,280
And you once said,

347
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,040
"No weekends."

348
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,000
You win, okay?

349
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,040
It's okay.

350
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,960
Don't be mad.

351
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,860
Hello.

352
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,840
Tang has accepted the card and the key.

353
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,640
Everything is going well.

354
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,460
(Inpatient Building)

355
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,800
How old are you?

356
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,920
Is it okay for your wound?

357
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,440
It's okay.

358
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,840
The doctor said some walk

359
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,400
can help me recover.

360
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,420
He must've asked you

361
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,020
to walk around the room

362
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,200
instead of going out.

363
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,280
To be honest,

364
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,080
I just estimated the probability

365
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,520
of defeating him

366
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,220
if I fight with him

367
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,140
when I'm not recovered.

368
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,040
No.

369
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,500
Listen, Jiang Shiyan,

370
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,880
you can't hurt yourself like that.

371
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,440
Don't worry. I'm not stupid.

372
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,600
Really?

373
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,920
Maybe a little when I'm with you.

374
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,960
Do you want to sit in the garden?

375
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,540
Okay.

376
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,640
The smell of the room is so bad.

377
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,480
I could use some fresh air.

378
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,340
Well...

379
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,900
Can you let go of my hand

380
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,960
so that I can get my phone?

381
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,100
I can finally

382
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,560
hold your hand in public.

383
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,540
I won't let it go easily.

384
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,720
No one can stop me.

385
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,240
Wait. When did I say yes?

386
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,560
Just now.

387
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,240
When?

388
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,700
You were like,

389
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,760
"Tang Yang,
do you want to be my girlfriend?"

390
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,140
"Okay, okay.

391
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,760
I do. You're so kind."

392
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,150
I've never seen someone
talking to themselves like that.

393
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,920
You're so shameless.

394
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,620
Your hair is a mess.

395
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,360
I'm shameless?

396
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,160
If I were that shameless,

397
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,280
maybe...

398
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,040
What?

399
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,260
...Feng Yuanqi would've had

400
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,400
a brother with a different surname.

401
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,860
You...

402
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,700
Come on.

403
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,160
Put it on.

404
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,160
I'm not cold.

405
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,140
I just had a little tickle in my throat.

406
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,960
Fine. You're always worried.

407
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,320
That's nice.

408
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,480
If I can grow old with you

409
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,140
and push your wheelchair like this,

410
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,000
it'll be so nice.

411
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,050
If I do more good things
when I'm still young,

412
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,360
will it be too much

413
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,960
to wish

414
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,720
that I can walk when I'm old?

415
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,080
Not too much. It's acceptable.

416
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,840
Walking with you

417
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,840
like this forever

418
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,000
is the most beautiful thing
I can imagine.

419
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,720
Shall we sit for a while?

420
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,300
Okay.

421
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,800
Jiang Shiyan.

422
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,160
I've known you for almost 15 years.

423
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,640
I've always believed

424
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,460
that we know each other the best

425
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,720
in the world,

426
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,740
and we're each other's

427
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,200
most important friend.

428
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,960
Back then,

429
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,060
I didn't want anything

430
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,760
to affect our friendship.

431
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,960
I hoped that no matter
how the world changed,

432
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,040
we'd still be the same.

433
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,200
However, now I feel

434
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,720
this change

435
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,240
is nice.

436
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,360
I once asked them

437
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,760
about the difference
between friendship and love.

438
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,760
They said in love,

439
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,380
people

440
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,840
will struggle to receive or let go.

441
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,700
They'll get paranoid,

442
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,660
hesitant,

443
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,160
and scared.

444
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,120
but they can't bear to let go.

445
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,800
I always think I'm a brave man,

446
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,520
but only when I'm with you do I realize

447
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,320
love is not blind courage

448
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,360
but full of hard choices.

449
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,920
I've been afraid of

450
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,120
doing you any harm,

451
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,480
so I've never

452
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,200
told you my true feelings.

453
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,760
However, one day,

454
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,960
Feng Weiran told me

455
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,580
that you'd get married and have children

456
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,720
with someone else.

457
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,080
At that moment...

458
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,240
I was suddenly overwhelmed by fear.

459
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,080
I feared...

460
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,520
I was so scared that one day...

461
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,880
we'd lose each other forever

462
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,360
because of

463
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,440
someone else.

464
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,660
Just thinking about it

465
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,080
makes me suffer.

466
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,760
There, it was at that moment
that I suddenly realized

467
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,340
I want much more than

468
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,180
just being your friend.

469
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,320
I don't want you to just be Yang.

470
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,720
I want us to stay together,

471
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,960
and no one can separate us.

472
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,280
To be honest,

473
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,480
I wouldn't dare to imagine

474
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,120
that one day,

475
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,580
we might drift apart

476
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,200
in each other's world.

477
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,920
Therefore, I really...

478
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,060
really want to stay with you

479
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,160
forever.

480
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,040
Wait a minute.

481
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,600
Did I just press on your appendix?

482
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,020
Oh no. You don't have it anymore.

483
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,860
Sorry.

484
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,400
Are you okay? You...

485
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,360
I knew I must've touched...

486
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,340
No, my appendix doesn't hurt,
but I'm laughing my appendix off.

487
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,920
You don't have it. How can you lose it?

488
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,680
Tang Yang, stop!

489
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,400
Stop it.

490
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,360
Can we just

491
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,880
express our feelings and...

492
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,680
stare at each other's eyes and...

493
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,320
And go back to get some rest.

494
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,880
You're not fully recovered.

495
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,940
You can't stay outside

496
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,780
for long.

497
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,280
You're in a special situation today,

498
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,880
so I owe you one, okay?

499
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,600
I'm a man. What special situation?

500
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,400
Wait. I...

501
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,640
No. You already owed me one.

502
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,000
No way. During the Spring Festival...

503
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,940
I saw someone out there,

504
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,100
so I pushed you away that time.

505
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,840
Where was the person?

506
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,460
There was.

507
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,580
A black shadow

508
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,860
passed by quickly,

509
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,820
and I got nervous

510
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,360
and pushed you away.

511
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,320
Then call me.

512
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,040
Shiyan.

513
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,920
Jiang Shiyan. Fine.

514
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,920
Yan... Yan...

515
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,080
What is that?

516
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,220
You...

517
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,880
What do you want to hear?

518
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,760
You know it.

519
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,920
You go first.

520
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,240
Girlfriend.

521
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,400
Boy...

522
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,280
Let's go.

523
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,780
You didn't finish it.

524
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,880
Say it. Hurry.

525
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,900
Didn't you just say it?

526
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,380
Why do I have to repeat it?
It's the same thing.

527
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,220
I want to hear it, please.

528
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,520
Say it. I want to hear it.

529
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,660
Boyfriend.

530
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,220
Come on.

531
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,660
Mom, you don't need to hold me.

532
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,500
I can walk.

533
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,040
Be careful.

534
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,820
No, you can't.

535
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,420
You just had a surgery.

536
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,840
If you fall, your wound will hurt.

537
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,520
- Be careful.
- Okay.

538
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,180
- Slowly.
- Okay.

539
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,020
Be careful.

540
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,800
Slowly, slowly.

541
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,700
Don't move!

542
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,400
You can't take anything heavy.

543
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,640
Tissue?

544
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,040
You just had a surgery.

545
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,520
You must be

546
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,960
gentle and slow.

547
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,360
Are you tired?

548
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,220
Thirsty?

549
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,580
Hungry? Do you want...?

550
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,420
No noodles.

551
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,900
I'm not tired, thirsty, or hungry.

552
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,220
Mom, I'm fine,

553
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,420
but you're

554
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,520
freaking me out.

555
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,980
I don't care.

556
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm following the doctor's instructions.

557
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,140
Feng.

558
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,880
Stay for lunch.

559
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,200
I prepared spicy pork ribs,

560
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,520
boiled fish with pickled cabbage,

561
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,080
and kung pao shrimps.

562
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,140
The doctor said

563
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:53,980
I can't eat oily food.

564
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,400
Of course you can't

565
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,780
It's not for you.

566
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,840
You can only have porridge.

567
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,340
I prepared them

568
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,260
for Feng and Tang.

569
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,080
Aunt, thank you so much.

570
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,920
Okay, I'll get them for you.

571
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,220
This is nice.

572
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,060
Did you find a spot?

573
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes, a car

574
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,180
happened to come out,

575
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,180
so I parked there.

576
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,180
See? This is the problem

577
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,020
of an old neighborhood.

578
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,680
It's inconvenient to park,

579
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,220
and there's no surveillance.

580
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,300
Jiang Shiyan parked his car

581
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,300
on the street last time,

582
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,260
and someone scratched it.

583
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,580
We haven't found the person so far.

584
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,560
I told him

585
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,940
to buy a new house,

586
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,790
but he wouldn't.

587
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,980
He said he must keep the quota

588
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,080
for his marital home.

589
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,280
You...

590
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,640
You're already thinking about that?

591
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,680
Right?

592
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,520
I'm also wondering
why he's thinking about that.

593
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,300
We don't know who that person is

594
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,720
and where she is?

595
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,220
Maybe he'll

596
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,540
stay single forever

597
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,860
like Cheng Hui,

598
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,760
right?

599
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,400
- How can you...?
- How can you judge Jiang Shiyan?

600
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,760
Have you solved your own problem?

601
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,100
You're always judging others.

602
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,720
- Exactly.
- I think Yanan was right.

603
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,260
He's different now.

604
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,100
He's more annoying.

605
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,140
More annoying than ever.

606
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,500
What did I say?

607
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,280
It was just a daily joke.

608
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,120
Why do you have to joke about him?

609
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,660
Why can't you be sincere

610
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,320
with Yanan?

611
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,780
Bro,

612
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,640
I'm not sincere?

613
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,380
I've sent flowers
and texted and called her

614
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,860
every day to apologize,

615
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,860
but she wouldn't accept it.

616
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,000
There's nothing I can do.

617
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,220
Look, he still thinks

618
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,060
- he has the moral high ground.
- Yes.

619
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,420
He thinks as long as

620
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,900
he tries to apologize,

621
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,460
she'll have to forgive him.

622
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,700
However, you don't even know

623
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,660
your mistakes,

624
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,700
nor do you want to know

625
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,700
what caused the problem.

626
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,120
You only want her to stop being angry.

627
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,820
If I were Jiang Yanan,
I'd be mad as well

628
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,660
because you've never

629
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,960
really wanted to solve the problem.

630
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,340
You only want her to calm down.

631
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,680
- Exactly.
- Wait a minute.

632
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,600
What's wrong with you two?

633
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,620
You've both stayed single forever.

634
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,600
What are you doing here?

635
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,860
How could you suddenly become
relationship experts

636
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,360
and keep scolding me?

637
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,520
- We...
- We...

638
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,660
We're worried about

639
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,820
you and Yanan.

640
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,560
We want to help you
to solve the problem.

641
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,500
You're her husband

642
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,380
and know her well,

643
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,460
- but you've neglected many problems.
- Yes.

644
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,860
You thought you knew her,

645
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,900
but she has changed

646
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,240
over the past few years,

647
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,840
and you've neglected the changes.

648
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,660
For example,
you'd order milk tea for her

649
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,560
every time we hang out,

650
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,500
but actually, she's always been

651
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,740
a fan of sugar-free americano.

652
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,540
For example,
she used to like spicy food,

653
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,460
and her favorite food

654
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,580
was spicy frogs and fish.

655
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,420
However, she likes
Chaoshan beef hotpot now

656
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,900
because she won't feel uncomfortable

657
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,750
or get acne the next day.

658
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,000
Therefore, she never eats spicy food

659
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,120
when she's with us.

660
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,760
You're wrong about that.

661
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,780
Last month, we had spicy frogs and fish

662
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,460
late at night.

663
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,920
She was very happy.

664
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,200
- Because you like it!
- Because you like it!

665
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,700
(Honey)

666
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,200
My wife is calling me.

667
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,780
- Pick it up.
- Pick it up.

668
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,800
Hurry up.

669
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,680
Hello, honey.

670
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,740
Okay.

671
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,720
No problem.

672
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,400
Okay, okay.

673
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,680
Then see you later.

674
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,960
She wants to talk to me in person.

675
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,200
Why am I feeling so nervous?

676
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,400
Actually, Yanan told me

677
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,940
she wasn't just angry at the fact

678
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,420
that you wanted to sell the apartment

679
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,040
without asking her.

680
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,080
What's the real problem?

681
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,100
You need to think about it

682
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,960
carefully.

683
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,080
I get it.

684
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,180
Then...

685
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,860
I'm going to talk to her.

686
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,980
- Go.
- Well, tell Aunt Yi

687
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,860
that I won't

688
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,720
have lunch here.

689
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,560
- Okay. Go.
- Hurry up.

690
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,300
I think

691
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,880
they'll be fine.

692
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,560
But I suddenly realized

693
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,720
that no matter how long

694
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,120
you've known each other

695
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,680
and how close you are,

696
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,640
you'll still have different opinions.

697
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,360
How can you say that?

698
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,300
We've known each other for a long time,

699
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,420
but we've been together

700
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,840
for only a few days,

701
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,620
right?

702
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,480
Besides, I don't think we'll face
the same problem

703
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,160
until we're in our 40s or 50s.

704
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,040
How can Feng Weiran compare to me?

705
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,780
I'm not

706
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,460
as stupid as him.

707
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,480
He's only got a tiny brain.

708
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,300
But I think he's

709
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,440
such a weird person.

710
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,900
He's very sober and clear

711
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,220
when he's talking about

712
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,780
some professional stuff

713
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,780
like economy

714
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,720
and law.

715
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,600
How can he be so stupid

716
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,700
when it comes to daily life?

717
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,540
Yes.

718
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,100
Do you remember the time

719
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,260
when they were about to be together?

720
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,100
If Yanan

721
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,500
hadn't been so anxious

722
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,700
and asked him directly

723
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,400
whether he liked her or not,

724
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,280
he would still be like

725
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,300
"Can we have dinner and watch a film?"

726
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,280
"Oh, you've got an appointment.
Maybe next time."

727
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,120
If I were Jiang Yanan, I'd beat him too.

728
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,900
The other two co-founders
of our company

729
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,740
are the same.

730
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,960
I'm the only normal guy here.

731
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,080
What a miracle.

732
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,040
Then...

733
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,800
Do you think

734
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,760
we should

735
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,640
tell them about us?

736
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,240
About what?

737
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,220
Tell me.

738
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,160
It's...

739
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,860
Tang.

740
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,040
- Feng.
- Aunt Yi.

741
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,940
Where's he?

742
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,980
Oh, Feng Weiran had an emergency.

743
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,760
He'll come here for free food next time.

744
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,240
I prepared two bowls of soup.

745
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,220
Well...

746
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,780
How about this?

747
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,880
One for you, and one for me.

748
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,480
- Okay.
- We've been

749
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,060
taking care of him in the hospital.

750
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,520
We've both lost weight, right?

751
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,960
Aunt Yi, I'm not...

752
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,100
Actually, you sent three meals a day

753
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,720
to the hospital.

754
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,460
I ate braised pork and fried fish

755
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,700
while Jiang Shiyan could only

756
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,540
have porridge.

757
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,600
I think he should get some nutrition.

758
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,800
If you don't mind,

759
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,380
you can come here and have free food

760
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,720
every day. I'll be so glad.

761
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,740
Yes.

762
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,000
My mom has said

763
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,700
she won't go out to dance

764
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,540
when I'm resting at home.

765
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,540
She'll cook every day,

766
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,440
and you can come for the food.

767
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,500
I'll come

768
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,040
whenever I have time.

769
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,590
Great. Let's have some soup.

770
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,720
- Okay.
- Let's go.

771
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,380
What are you doing?

772
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,880
Just wait for the porridge.

773
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,520
Be careful

774
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,700
when you sit down.

775
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,240
Come on. Let's go.

776
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,600
Have some soup.

777
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,060
It's okay. See you later.

778
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,900
Okay.

779
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,820
You're here. Well, Aunt,

780
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,660
let me introduce him.

781
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,560
This is my husband Feng Weiran.

782
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,080
Feng?

783
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,880
- Hello, Feng.
- This is Aunt Chen,

784
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,820
- Lin's mother.
- Yes.

785
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,500
Lin showed me

786
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,420
your picture

787
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,000
when you got married. It's nice.

788
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,560
Go on with your business.

789
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,680
I'm leaving.

790
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,660
It's okay.

791
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,580
Go ahead.

792
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,580
I'm leaving.

793
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,620
Okay. Aunt,

794
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,140
call me if you need anything.

795
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,780
- No problem.
- Okay.

796
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,980
I'll ask you later.

797
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,940
No problem.

798
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,780
Then I'm leaving.

799
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,630
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

800
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,550
- Goodbye, Aunt.
- Goodbye, Aunt.

801
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,360
Bye.

802
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,220
What do you want to drink?

803
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,700
I'm...

804
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,080
I'm fine with everything.

805
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,500
Hello,

806
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,540
can you please get me
a glass of warm water?

807
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,380
Okay.

808
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,940
Thanks.

809
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,200
Honey, I've realized...

810
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,740
Honey,

811
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,760
I've realized my mistakes.

812
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,660
Since I left home,

813
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,520
I've been reflecting on

814
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,520
my mistakes.

815
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,500
I wrote down a few points

816
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,400
of my mistakes.

817
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,300
But you've been good enough.

818
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,180
I'm not.

819
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,820
Honey, please don't abandon me!

820
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,620
How can I abandon you, honey?

821
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,820
I'm so scared that you might divorce me!

822
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,740
How's that possible?

823
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,080
What are you talking about?

824
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,940
I...

825
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,680
I just think

826
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,620
I should change

827
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,920
my lifestyle.

828
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,880
(Jiang Shiyan)
(Your boyfriend is going to sleep.)

829
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,400
(Dear girlfriend, go to sleep early.)

830
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,400
(Good night.)

831
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,520
(Your girlfriend
is also going to sleep.)

832
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,640
(Have a good dream,)

833
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,120
(dear boyfriend.)

834
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,420
(Tang Yang)

835
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,180
Jiang Shiyan, I'm going in.

836
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,020
Come in.

837
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,540
What's wrong?

838
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,380
Didn't the doctor tell you

839
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,280
not to stay up?

840
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,040
Look what time it is.

841
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,240
It's 10:00 p.m., and you're
still playing with your phone.

842
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,240
No wonder Tang asked me

843
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,000
to take your phone away.

844
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,780
She said you won't sleep

845
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,920
unless I take it away.

846
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,100
Wait a minute.

847
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,380
Did Tang Yang ask you to do so?

848
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,560
Yes, she said it before she left.

849
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,700
She said you'd have video conferences

850
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,580
on the phone at night

851
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,640
and told me to keep an eye on you.

852
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,400
See? She was right.

853
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,940
Mom, give me the phone.

854
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm not having a meeting.

855
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,460
You won't get it until tomorrow.

856
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,300
Give it back...

857
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,340
Mom!

858
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,540
(Zhou Zixing)

859
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,980
(President Zhou...)

860
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,820
Mr. Gan,

861
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,420
Didn't she finish her leave

862
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,760
and come back to work today?

863
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,080
Where is she?

864
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,360
Pei Siqie told me

865
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,800
she came early in the morning.

866
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,620
She went to the top floor

867
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,150
after dropping her bag
and changing clothes.

868
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,660
Did Vice President Gao

869
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,920
ask about me today?

870
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,860
No.

871
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,920
I asked Secretary Lin.

872
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,000
He said Mr. Gao and Mr. Zhou

873
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,080
were having a meeting.

874
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,120
Having a meeting?

875
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,960
Jiang Shiyan.

876
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,640
I've bought some groceries.

877
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,220
Mom.

878
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,380
What took you so long

879
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,400
to buy groceries?

880
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,760
Please make lunch. It's late.

881
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,740
Well...

882
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,020
Feng Weiran and Tang Yang

883
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,060
will come for dinner.

884
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,100
It's not even noon yet.

885
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,940
What's the rush?

886
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,760
Didn't you say

887
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,740
Tang shouldn't have takeouts

888
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,980
for lunch every day?

889
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,200
You need to make lunch for her.

890
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,150
I'm going to order a flash delivery
to send the lunch to her.

891
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,800
Did I say that?

892
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,080
Yes, you did.

893
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,900
Hello, flash delivery?

894
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,220
Yes. I need a code.

895
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,200
5395.

896
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,020
- 5395, right?
- Yes.

897
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,160
- Okay. Thanks.
- Okay.

898
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,540
Ms. Tang,

899
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,520
did you bring lunch?

900
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,800
It looks so good.

901
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,320
Kind of.

902
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,300
Ms. Tang, enjoy your lunch.

903
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,240
I'm leaving.

904
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,000
(Jiang Shiyan)
(Thanks, dear boyfriend.)

905
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,040
(The lunch is so good.)

906
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,380
(Tang Yang)

907
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,780
(Tang Yang)

908
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,060
(Dear girlfriend, I'm glad you like it.)

909
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,100
(Jiang Shiyan)

910
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,020
This couple's handrope

911
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,380
is so uncomfortable.

912
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,560
I can't stand it.

913
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,520
Then take it off.

914
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,980
She said if I did,

915
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,320
she wouldn't be my girlfriend anymore.

916
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,240
You've got a cold. Stay away from us.

917
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,040
Speaking of which,

918
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,100
she cares about me too much.

919
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,420
I caught a cold,

920
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,400
and she bought me so many pills.

921
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,460
My girlfriend bought this.

922
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,640
She bought this.

923
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,960
And this one.

924
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,780
I told her

925
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,320
it was just a cold

926
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,520
and I'd recover soon,

927
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,540
but she said as her boyfriend,

928
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,620
I have to take care of myself

929
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,520
and eat all the pills.

930
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,480
Which one should I have?

931
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,020
Look,

932
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,680
my girlfriend sent me a message.

933
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,060
She said she bought too many pills,

934
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,420
and I might be confused,

935
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,380
so she'll come here

936
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,460
to instruct me

937
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,200
and have lunch with us.

938
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,920
Can't you call her Yanan?

939
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,420
Why do you have to say girlfriend
over and over again?

940
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,480
Isn't it weird?

941
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,180
Remember to call me brother

942
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,640
instead of my name.

943
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,160
Stop talking.

944
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,780
I just got a girlfriend

945
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,080
and haven't gotten used to it.

946
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,960
My girlfriend is here.

947
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,860
I'll pick her up.

948
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,400
Just go.

949
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,320
She's at the door. I'll pick her up.

950
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,960
I just don't understand.

951
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,580
Shiyan,

952
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,160
if you have a girlfriend someday,

953
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,060
will you call her girlfriend
over and over again like this?

954
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:42,700
No.

955
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,200
I just don't understand.

956
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,780
There are so many couples.

957
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,740
They're everywhere.

958
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,640
What's so special about that?

959
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,080
Exactly.

960
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,800
That's my bro.
