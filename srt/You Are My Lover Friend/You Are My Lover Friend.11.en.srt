How's everything on Ms. Sheng's side?

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,650
Good.

29
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,170
That's great.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,560
I'll be back in a bit.

31
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,290
That's it.

32
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,560
Thank goodness

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,920
you came so promptly.

34
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,080
I just got off the plane.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,330
When I got your call,

36
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,760
I drove over from the airport.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,360
You got here fast.

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,410
Is your leg hurt?

39
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,890
There's blood.

40
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,640
When did this happen?

41
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,680
I didn't even notice.

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,760
No worries. Let me take care of it.

43
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,130
All done.

44
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,010
Thanks.

45
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,010
You even have a first aid kit.

46
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,800
Do you have something

47
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,850
to attend to later?

48
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,130
Yes.

49
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,130
I'll go back to work.

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
Oh, it's fine.

51
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,760
Alright, let's go.

52
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,450
The seatbelt.

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,320
Right, the seatbelt.

54
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,650
Does anyone know

55
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,210
what comforted Su Shi

56
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,320
during his most

57
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,730
disheartened times?

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,280
Anyone?

59
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
Right.

60
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,730
It was the lychee from Lingnan.

61
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,810
Actually, he mentioned it in a poem

62
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,660
about Huizhou.

63
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,520
"I eat three hundred lychees daily,"

64
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,410
"willing to be a Lingnan man for long."

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,530
From this line,

66
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,450
we can see...

67
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,460
(A has-been actress, so fake and ugly)

68
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,850
What's going on here?

69
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,400
I don't know.

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Mr. Cheng.

71
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,740
(Can't act, can't get roles,
just a pretty face)

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,840
What's going on?

73
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
Mr. Cheng.

74
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,440
This is an internet attack.

75
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,060
(Look at her, so phony)

76
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,170
Check what's going on.

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,610
Alright, over here.

78
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,850
It's okay. We have protection protocols.

79
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,540
Tell Ms. Sheng to continue

80
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,380
without interruption.

81
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,180
(Can't land a role, disgusting)

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,210
I apologize, everyone.

83
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,170
There was a small issue
with the live stream.

84
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,370
Let's continue.

85
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,850
So, when Su Shi

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,320
was exiled to Lingnan,

87
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,530
it was the lowest point

88
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,800
of his life.

89
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,050
He faced many attacks from the court

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,880
and even from those

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,730
he thought were friends.

92
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,530
But what

93
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,450
surprised me?

94
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,610
Su Shi maintained

95
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,220
such a generous mindset.

96
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,280
He expressed

97
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,000
that for these delicious lychees,

98
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,530
he would gladly stay in Lingnan.

99
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,360
It's as if he didn't

100
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,120
care about his exile.

101
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
So, we can definitely say

102
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,050
that eating these lychees reflects

103
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,210
Su Shi's openness

104
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,560
and transparency in life.

105
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,380
(Liked this streamer, must buy this)

106
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,730
When I was young,

107
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
I really liked a line
from Su Shi's poetry:

108
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,240
"Life is like a reverse journey;"

109
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,050
"I am but a traveler."

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,720
What to sign?

111
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,120
To Hui.

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
This is my cousin's

113
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,610
friend's name.

114
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,870
She's a huge fan.

115
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,360
(That's why you stared at me?)

116
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,480
How about

117
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,800
"Best wishes"

118
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:16,970
and "Always happy"?

119
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,570
Great.

120
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,140
(To Hui: Best wishes; Na)

121
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,890
Done.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,570
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

123
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
Hello.

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
I know.

125
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,410
Just send me the data.

126
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,160
Alright?

127
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,480
A friend's cousin?

128
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,880
Mr. Cheng's full name

129
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,320
is Cheng Hui.

130
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
To Hui.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
Doesn't that mean it's for himself?

132
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,560
And he said she was a fan of yours.

133
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,650
Doesn't that mean he likes you?

134
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,290
Maybe it's a coincidence.

135
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,170
Hui doesn't

136
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,360
necessarily mean his name.

137
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,840
It could be another character

138
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,390
or another

139
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,280
girl's name.

140
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,150
It could be anything.

141
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,810
Let's go.

142
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,120
I don't believe it's that coincidental.

143
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,450
Wait for me a moment.

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,650
Wait for me here.

145
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,410
I'll get something for you.

146
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,410
Sure.

147
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,440
Thanks for sending me home, Mr. Jiang.

148
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,090
No problem.

149
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,200
But picking a flower for me seems...

150
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,090
What's wrong?

151
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,840
It makes me look coy.

152
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,250
Isn't that true?

153
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,350
Then I'll head back.

154
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,890
Take a hot shower at home.

155
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,800
Goodnight.

156
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,160
Goodnight.

157
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,970
- What's wrong?
- Well.

158
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,720
You and Zhou Mo today...

159
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,080
I always feel

160
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,490
that in any relationship,

161
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,840
there is a proper limit.

162
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,920
Friendship should be a genuine exchange,

163
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,920
not a bargaining chip for coercion.

164
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,680
Sometimes,

165
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,250
if one of them

166
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,560
has ulterior motives

167
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,890
and steps a little further,

168
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,560
it'll be hard for them to be friends.

169
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,890
Many things, from the very first moment,

170
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,770
head toward their end.

171
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
Anyway, you know

172
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,170
our relationship

173
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,370
isn't one-sided.

174
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,130
If you want, I'll follow you wherever.

175
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,170
If not, I...

176
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,170
You know that.

177
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,770
So do I.

178
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,050
Because I'm the same.

179
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,840
What's up with you?

180
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,770
Why so formal all of a sudden?

181
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,720
Am I formal? I don't think so.

182
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,560
You are.

183
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,290
I'll head back now.

184
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,800
Goodnight.

185
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,170
You just said that.

186
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,800
Goodnight.

187
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,390
(Yixiu Found of Food Tasting Event)

188
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,080
Thank you so much for today.

189
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,250
I saw those trolls

190
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,200
and almost thought
we wouldn't finish it.

191
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,640
Before Mr. Jiang left,

192
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,490
he asked Mr. Cheng
to supervise personally,

193
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,680
in case of any accidents.

194
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,250
Thank you, thank you.

195
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,410
We have to go. See you next time.

196
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,650
- Okay.
- Thanks.

197
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,890
Take care.

198
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,370
Mr. Cheng is too polite.

199
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,560
You can stop here.

200
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,920
No need to go downstairs.

201
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,640
I'm heading home.

202
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,810
Nina,

203
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,890
does he want to hitch a ride with us

204
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,200
to spend some time

205
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,440
with you on the way?

206
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,160
What do you think

207
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,050
is going on?

208
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,160
What car is this?

209
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,920
That's a dedicated driver's bike.

210
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,890
With an order,

211
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,560
they'll put it in the owner's trunk.

212
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,560
After driving the owner
to their destination,

213
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,800
they can ride it back.

214
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,490
This bike can go as fast
as an electric bike.

215
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,680
No way.

216
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,320
Doing part-time driving this late?

217
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,680
Let's go.

218
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,320
Is there anything else to add?

219
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,540
No.

220
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,050
(Converge Business Bank of China)

221
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,200
Everyone, what do you think?

222
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,530
The headquarters have been emphasizing

223
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,840
controlling the bad debt rate.

224
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,890
So, I'm holding a reserved opinion.

225
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,400
How about the others?

226
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,490
Ms. Tang?

227
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,290
The risks of medical beauty incidents

228
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,290
and public opinion

229
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,920
are also factors we need to consider.

230
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,010
In a group, the negative info travels

231
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,410
faster than the positive one.

232
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,250
Once the reputation collapses,

233
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,370
it could lead to some

234
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,680
unpredictable overall risks.

235
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,650
So my opinion is also

236
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,920
that I have reservations.

237
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,370
That's basically the point.

238
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,490
After all, we are for credit audit,

239
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
not for investment.

240
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,490
Compared to achieving high returns

241
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,130
with efficiency metrics,

242
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,370
risk is the top priority.

243
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,490
So, the aesthetic medicine loan

244
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,370
is temporarily not approved.

245
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,890
But you were very well prepared,

246
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,740
which is commendable.

247
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,440
But there are many areas

248
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,560
to learn from Ms. Tang.

249
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,680
Learning is mutual.

250
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,280
Alright.

251
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,250
Next.

252
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,410
I'll put it on your desk later.

253
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,080
Linlang, what's for lunch?

254
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,050
Let's grab a meal?

255
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,130
I've made plans.

256
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,440
Tang Yang.

257
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,720
I was wondering why Xia Chuan

258
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,800
introduced her case first.

259
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,130
Turns out he's turning Linlang

260
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,170
against you.

261
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,010
Yeah.

262
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,920
If I don't give her this case,

263
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,200
she'll think I'm hogging it.

264
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,200
If I give it to her...

265
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,440
That's what they want.

266
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,720
But I also told her that the chance

267
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,490
of this project

268
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,800
going through is slim.

269
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,890
Maybe she's too eager

270
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,050
to take it on independently.

271
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,890
I'm just worried

272
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,320
she wants more than just that.

273
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,490
I'll put it away. Wait for me.

274
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,250
Here, look at this.

275
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,520
Alright.

276
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,490
Wow.

277
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,680
Mr. Jiang.

278
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,960
Director Tang.

279
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,170
- Qi.
- I thought

280
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,010
you guys couldn't make it.

281
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,010
Really.

282
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,680
- You finally came.
- We...

283
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,200
We're not like you.

284
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,170
We're working people,

285
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,410
hustling and putting on a show,

286
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,650
with no choice in the matter.

287
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,050
You really have no conscience.

288
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,040
If it weren't for me,

289
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,680
it would've been Feng on a trip instead.

290
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,290
Should I be thanking you?

291
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,160
Son.

292
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,320
Say hi, son.

293
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,200
Qi, who am I?

294
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,370
- What am I?
- Who is she?

295
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,320
Godmother.

296
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,370
- Right.
- Then who am I?

297
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,400
Who is he?

298
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,280
Godfather.

299
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,560
Uncle.

300
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Right.

301
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,010
Here, have a little cookie.

302
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,410
Call me Godfather.

303
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,770
I'll buy you a toy car.

304
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,280
And what about me?

305
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,250
What to address me?

306
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,210
Cheng.

307
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,400
Cheng?

308
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,850
What's going on?

309
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,170
Wait, Qi.

310
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,770
Why are you calling him by his name?

311
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,250
You should call him Uncle Cheng.

312
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,840
Because he plays games with me.

313
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,370
In the game,

314
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,440
he's called Cheng.

315
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,040
- You...
- You little rascal.

316
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,200
That's how it is.

317
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,840
You're playing games with my son?

318
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,760
Pretending, huh?

319
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,610
Come on.

320
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,560
No games today.

321
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,560
Let's play this.

322
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,050
I bought some persimmons.

323
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:30,970
They're delicious.

324
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,200
I don't want a toy car.

325
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,490
I want Ultraman.

326
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,330
Want Ultraman?

327
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,170
Then I'll take you to buy it.

328
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,400
Let's go.

329
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,440
Let's go.

330
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,920
I want to go with Godmother.

331
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,170
He wants Godmother.

332
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,330
Me too?

333
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,530
You want both of us?

334
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,760
Let's go, Godmother.

335
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,800
You two, be careful.

336
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,080
This little rascal
is setting a trap for you.

337
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,130
He's doing it because he likes us.

338
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,250
He doesn't want you.

339
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,160
Makes sense.

340
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,280
He likes me.

341
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,560
I'll buy it for you.

342
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,720
Don't buy too much.

343
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,640
That's my son. What are you two up to?

344
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,520
Let's go.

345
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,400
Happened to you too.

346
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Buying toys now.

347
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,550
It's all your fault.

348
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,880
I'll press it.

349
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,500
It's your turn. Hurry.

350
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,220
The last two. What should we do?

351
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,740
Let's have one more.

352
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,920
No way.

353
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,490
You go first.

354
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,030
What do you want to play?

355
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,390
I want to play everything.

356
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,170
Alright, we'll all play a round.

357
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,010
Okay.

358
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,500
Godfather, I want
to ride in the palanquin too.

359
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,630
You want it too?

360
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,980
- Qi.
- Sure.

361
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,840
Why do you call him Godfather

362
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,900
and not Uncle?

363
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,940
Because Uncle is Godfather.

364
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,260
Right, Uncle is Godfather.

365
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,070
Isn't that a bit strange?

366
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,730
He calls me Godmother,

367
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,600
and he calls you Godfather.

368
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,690
Don't you think

369
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,760
it's a bit odd?

370
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,420
I don't think it's strange at all.

371
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,590
Let's go. Godfather will take you
to ride in the palanquin.

372
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,940
Like this, like this.

373
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,090
Like this?

374
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,690
You're so silly.

375
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,360
Like this, like this.

376
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,360
Right?

377
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,200
Come on.

378
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,120
Qi.

379
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000
- It's like this.
- Right.

380
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,200
You can sit here.

381
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,740
Okay, that side.

382
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,600
Alright.

383
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,440
We're going up.

384
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,640
Let's go.

385
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,600
Are you scared?

386
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,090
- Scared?
- Afraid of heights?

387
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,530
Are you afraid?

388
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,400
No.

389
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,360
Is it fun?

390
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,420
Watch your step.

391
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,630
So dangerous.

392
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,440
My goodness.

393
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,100
- Qi.
- Are you okay?

394
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,250
Qi, are you okay?

395
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,090
I'm fine.

396
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,940
Didn't hurt, right?

397
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,570
That's good.

398
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,660
I'll call them.

399
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,070
Jiang Shiyan.

400
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,360
Stop playing.

401
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,470
Come back for dinner.

402
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,320
He's still smiling.

403
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,160
He should be fine.

404
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,680
Are you okay?

405
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,630
I'm fine.

406
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,460
Are you okay?

407
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,890
What's wrong? You're pretending.

408
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,740
Absolutely pretending. I can tell.

409
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,260
Can you be a little grateful?

410
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,720
I'm your cushion.

411
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,700
- I think I twisted my waist.
- What? Let me see.

412
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,790
Jiang Shiyan.

413
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,310
- You are such a rascal.
- I was wrong.

414
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,390
I'll let you pretend.

415
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,090
No, my waist really hurts.

416
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,440
Where? Where does it hurt?

417
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,350
Did you have fun playing today?

418
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,870
Let me wipe your sweat.

419
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,330
Is it cool now?

420
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,010
Is it cool now?

421
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,850
Feels good.

422
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,550
Do you like the Ultraman?

423
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,310
Godfather bought it for you.

424
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,730
Thirsty, right?

425
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,730
Go get drinks.

426
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,900
- Let me help you.
- Sure.

427
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,800
These two pieces are almost done.

428
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,640
Good.

429
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,360
Any goodies?

430
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,590
Why aren't you helping?

431
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,500
You didn't carry Qi.

432
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,660
If I had, would you help me roast?

433
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,090
No.

434
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,800
- Feng Weiran.
- I'm really speechless.

435
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,640
What to drink?

436
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,850
I'm drinking...

437
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,630
Drinking beer. What do you think?

438
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,040
What are you doing over there?

439
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,210
Stop roasting. Hurry.

440
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,210
It's been so long,
and we haven't had a drink.

441
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,390
- Hurry, hurry.
- Come.

442
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,730
Drink beer.

443
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,800
Let's have more fun.

444
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,640
Come on.

Save some for my husband.

459
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,080
I'll just eat one.

460
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,030
Just one, just one.

461
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,810
Really.

462
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,560
Oh, my. He's asleep.

463
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,160
- So lovey-dovey.
- Honey.

464
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,010
Do you think

465
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,120
this might be

466
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,460
out last gathering of the year?

467
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,790
What are you saying?

468
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,310
Didn't we all agree before?

469
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,500
We'll spend New Year's Eve together.

470
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,700
New Year's Eve?

471
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,660
Aren't you all working overtime?

472
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,550
There's a live stream.

473
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,690
A New Year's Eve live stream from 9 am

474
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,830
to midnight.

475
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,180
We won't be too busy.

476
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,690
The team is mature.

477
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,570
It's about procedure.

478
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,940
I told Feng Weiran

479
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,500
that after the live stream,

480
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,770
we'd have a party.

481
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,900
You all should come over,

482
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,800
so we can keep our tradition

483
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,070
of celebrating New Year.

484
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,530
We can still gather now

485
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,590
from time to time.

486
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,550
But when Tang Yang

487
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,980
falls in love,

488
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,730
when Jiang Shiyan falls in love,

489
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,210
when Tang Yang has kids,

490
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,760
and when Jiang Shiyan has kids,

491
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,110
we'll hardly gather anymore.

492
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,010
Why does it feel like

493
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,740
our future looks bleak?

494
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,970
Her worries

495
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,180
aren't without reason.

496
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,320
When Yanan and I are together,

497
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,310
it's an internal affair.

498
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,350
This sunset is beautiful.

499
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,940
Honey, quick.

500
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,940
Take a picture for me.

501
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,260
Come on, take a picture.

502
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,500
One, two, three.

503
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,050
♪I'll give it all to roam by your side♪

504
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:05,200

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,740

♪To be your guiding light♪

507
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,120
Alright, alright.

508
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,490
- It's okay.
- Don't cry.

509
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,310
- No more crying.
- Finished? I'll tidy up.

510
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,040
Honey, hurry up.

511
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,900
Go comfort the child.

512
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,400
How about this?

513
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,050
Let's go to the parent-child

514
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,890
playground later.

515
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,970
- Or he won't stop.
- OK.

516
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,360
The playground? What about me?

517
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,600
Alright, hurry up.

518
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,440
Need this.

519
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,400
You stand up.

520
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,740
See Jiang Shiyan?

521
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,980
You should go home
and play games with him.

522
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,490
Let's go.

523
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,700
We're standing in the way.

524
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,940
(Jiang Shiyan: Are you home?
Tang Yang: I'm home, and you?)

525
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,380
(Jiang Shiyan: Me too. Rest early.
Tang Yang: Yeah, you too.)

526
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,070
Director Gan.

527
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,980
Send out the New Year goods.

528
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,330
Okay.

529
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,680
By the way,

530
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,150
on the afternoon of the 31st,

531
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,450
there's an event hosted by Boxing Group

532
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,320
at Biyuntian.

533
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,080
Social in the afternoon
and dine at night

534
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,920
to thank clients.

535
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,280
Mr. Zhou wants

536
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,800
two people from our division.

537
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,830
Who's available?

538
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,900
I don't have time.

539
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,360
My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law

540
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,560
are coming to my house.

541
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,740
I have to leave early.

542
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,040
Same here. I can't go either.

543
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,170
I have a family too.

544
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,010
Please understand.

545
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,030
Gotta prioritize family.

546
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,630
- How about Tang?
- I...

547
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,260
Take on the responsibility.

548
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,800
Boxing Group

549
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,280
is one of our high-quality clients.

550
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,170
They account for a lot

551
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,260
of our business every year.

552
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,400
And you're new to the division.

553
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,360
It's a good opportunity

554
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,460
to get to know them.

555
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,830
We don't have many single people.

556
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,920
Linlang.

557
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,980
Ms. Tang, why don't you go?

558
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,980
Okay, Mr. Gan.

559
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,360
Alright, alright.

560
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,200
Continue, continue.

561
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,070
- Goodbye, Mr. Gan.
- Goodbye, Mr. Gan.

562
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,260
This social gathering
happens every year.

563
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,600
Usually, invitations are sent out

564
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,940
a month in advance,

565
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,390
but we never go.

566
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,730
Now it's last minute.

567
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,070
He suddenly forces you to go.

568
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,870
It's intentional.

569
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,010
He can't find a way to trouble me

570
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,590
with other matters,

571
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,550
so he thinks sending me

572
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,840
to the outskirts

573
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,420
will please him.

574
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,170
Consider it as him wishing me

575
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,110
a Happy New Year.

576
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,870
You really have a good temper.

577
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,970
(Special for Veiled Lady)
Show me

578
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,410
the product's connection form.

579
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,260
Is it here?

580
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,440
Take this.

581
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,410
- Alright.
- Yeah.

582
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,450
That's the wording on the screen

583
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,930
for the live stream.

584
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,530
Okay, hurry up. We're waiting for you.

585
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,930
Manage the details carefully.

586
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,520
Don't let anything go wrong.

587
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,770
Yang said she could only

588
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,040
leave there past 8 pm.

589
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,690
It'll take 1.5 hours for her to arrive.

590
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,630
But it should be fine.

591
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,850
It should be fine.

592
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,730
Mr. Jiang, the live stream is ready.

593
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,570
Okay.

594
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,870
Hello, Xingyue?

595
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,880
Go back to your work.

596
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,120
Mr. Jiang,

597
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,980
Ms. Sheng wants
to change the product order.

598
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,080
(Food Special with Ni)
Let me tell you.

599
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,920
For the live stream,

600
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,170
fix her hairstyle.

601
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,010
- Make it a little longer.
- Alright.

602
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,120
The current product order

603
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,630
is optimal based on the algorithm.

604
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,040
This is the estimated model

605
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,940
of the audience.

606
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,040
We expect that by the fifth product,

607
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,930
the audience

608
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,170
will exceed 100,000.

609
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,500
Perfect for our major products.

610
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,600
Mr. Cheng,

611
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,220
you're talking about the data model,

612
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,700
but I want to talk
about the female mindset.

613
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,650
Most girls,

614
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,110
after buying something,

615
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,150
will feel a sense of guilt.

616
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,170
They'll want

617
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,760
to buy something for their boyfriend

618
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,870
or husband.

619
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,310
So, after the bird's nest,

620
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,160
I think

621
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,520
we can introduce

622
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,660
alcoholic products,

623
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,500
like pre-mixed cocktails.

624
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,170
These festive products

625
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,180
are for males.

626
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,020
Of course.

627
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,220
That's Nina's suggestion.

628
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,740
I think it's fine.

629
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,180
What do you think?

630
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,920
Ms. Sheng.

631
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,050
Of course.

632
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,980
- If you don't like it...
- Those factors

633
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,220
will be added to the data model.

634
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,290
Come on.

635
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,660
Let's change it.

636
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,590
Swap the order of these two.

637
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,310
Okay, copy that.

638
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,980
(Happy New Year)

639
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,850
Drink some water.

640
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,150
- Thank you.
- No problem.

641
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,530
Ms. Tang.

642
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,560
You always have
a clear and logical approach

643
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,500
to your work,

644
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,390
and you're particularly calm.

645
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,630
I heard the president say

646
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,260
you have a big-picture view.

647
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,630
Back in school,

648
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,290
my mom insisted

649
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,110
I join the school volleyball team,

650
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,970
but personally,

651
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,980
I preferred playing badminton.

652
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,740
My mom told me,

653
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,830
"You have to remember,"

654
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,520
"there are many things in life"

655
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,310
"that require a team effort."

656
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,170
"No matter how capable you are,"

657
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,030
"you can't win alone."

658
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,220
Your mom's words make a lot of sense.

659
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,930
I may not have been

660
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,500
that outstanding since I was little,

661
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,390
often getting overshadowed in the group,

662
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,650
so sometimes I really

663
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,260
want to be seen.

664
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,740
Competing with yourself is a good thing

665
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,740
because sometimes,

666
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,260
the process has a greater impact

667
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,070
on the future than the result.

668
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,410
Though the loan didn't

669
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,390
go through this time,

670
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,650
I looked at your preliminary plan.

671
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,660
It's very well done.

672
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,290
The data is solid,

673
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,490
the model is good,

674
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,490
and those reference cases

675
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,700
are particularly persuasive.

676
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,560
If I have any related cases

677
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,010
to prepare for later,

678
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,420
I'll feel at ease leaving it to you.

679
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,350
- Ms. Tang.
- By the way, Linlang.

680
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,320
Could you help me bring my bag over?

681
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,260
I need to get something.

682
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,680
Here you go.

683
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,700
Right, this one.

684
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,040
Right, this one.

685
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,880
The USB drive.

686
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,410
It contains all the public cases

687
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,980
I've accumulated over the years.

688
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,520
If you're interested,

689
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,460
you can take a look.

690
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,420
Thank you, Ms. Tang.

691
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,570
No problem.

692
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,340
("Food Special with Ni"

693
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,740

Drink some water.

701
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,260
You're amazing.

702
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,830
If you gave me a hundred heads,

703
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,760
I never have imagined

704
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,160
that her slow-paced live stream

705
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,700
could be this successful.

706
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,830
She incorporates her expertise.

707
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,930
She prepares well

708
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,110
before each live stream.

709
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,940
Her success is well-deserved.

710
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,930
(New Year's Day)
It was a success.

711
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,790

Cheers.

712
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,200
Ms. Sheng,

713
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,760
we've exceeded our target by two times.

714
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,600
You're amazing.

715
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,070
No, it's thanks
to your overall cooperation.

716
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,590
You're being too humble.

717
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,660
Now, I should raise a toast to everyone.

718
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,690
I've gained a lot

719
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,980
from working with you this year.

720
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,900
Thank you, Mr. Jiang, Mr. Feng,

721
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,630
and Mr. Cheng Hui.

722
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,220
Thank you, thank you.

723
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,250
Thank you, everyone.

724
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,090
Thank you.

725
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,660
Here's a bouquet for you.

726
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,410
I hope our future collaborations

727
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,250
will be even better.

728
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,440
Thank you.

729
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,890
Let's take a group photo.

730
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,250
- Let's leave a memory.
- Come on.

731
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,790
- Come closer.
- Together.

732
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,800
Everyone, get closer.

733
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,690
Come on, all of you.

734
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,630
Closer.

735
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,870
One, two, three.

736
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,400
Okay.

737
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,600
- Great.
- Thank you.

738
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,250
By the way, the weather forecast says

739
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,730
it'll snow for the first time tonight.

740
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,870
I wonder if it will snow.

741
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,120
It says so every year,

742
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,590
but I've never seen it once.

743
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,260
Rongcheng has a subtropical climate.

744
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,410
If we get to see

745
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,650
the first snow in our lifetime,

746
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,490
that would be great.

747
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,110
These things are all predestined.

748
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,010
(Yang, Yanan, Hui)
But we have

749
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,630
- seen it.
- When will you come?

750
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,860
(Jiang Shiyan)
How do we look?

751
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,300
(Good governance lasts long;
Virtuous actions spread far)

752
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,360
(Tang Yang)
I went to drop off a colleague.

753
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,590
(Shiyan)
It took some time.

754
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,760
I'm setting off now.

755
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,450
I'll arrive by eleven at the latest.

756
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,290
I'll be there.

757
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,660
(Weiran)
When will you arrive?

758
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,030
Is the red envelope ready?

759
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,180
I'm there right away.

760
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,100
(Tang Yang)

761
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,170
I'm about to start the last live stream.

762
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,070
I need to get ready.

763
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,930
When you arrive, come up yourself,

764
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,030
and wait for us.

765
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,420

and Sheng Nina.

770
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,690
Look at how they

771
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,110
are holding flowers.

772
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,600
Who would believe that nothing

773
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,150
is going on?

Jiang Shiyan: Where are you?)

778
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,860
(December 31, Saturday)

779
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,480
Alright.

780
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,450
Choose what you want to eat.

781
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,640
Ask Mom if we can have

782
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,700
a bottle of Coke today.

783
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,330
- Yang?
- Less.

784
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,450
Yang said

785
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,290
she had to stay,

786
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,220
so she won't come.

787
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,690
Had to say?

788
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,650
Right.

789
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,890
I'm curious too.

790
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,510
Yang never changes her mind.

791
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,720
(Yang: I have to stay.)

792
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,370
Look at Jiang Shiyan

793
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,470
and Sheng Nina.

794
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,720
Look at how they are

795
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,150
holding the flowers.

796
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,640
Who would believe that nothing

797
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,180
is going on?

798
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,990
- Drink.
- Let's drink.

799
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,290
Just a little.

800
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:01,850

(2023, Happy New Year)

802
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,470
Why do you think I left?

803
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,510
Could it be that I'm feeling jealous?

804
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,780
But does jealousy exist in friendships?

805
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,990
Maybe, right?

806
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,780
You wouldn't understand.

807
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,380
So, what now?

808
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,030
Ms. Zhou isn't home,

809
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,030
and neither is Mr. Tang.

810
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,640
You're a lonely cat.

811
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,820
I'm a lonely person.

812
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,260
How about we celebrate together?

813
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,410
Hello, Jiang Shiyan?

814
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,260
How's it going on your end?

815
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,070
It was going smoothly,

816
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,220
but now I'm not sure.

817
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,040
How can you not be sure?

818
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,160
Aren't you there

819
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,000
in person?

820
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,590
I just don't know.

821
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,250
Alright.

822
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,610
What about you?

823
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,970
I sent you a message,

824
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:47,810
but you didn't reply.

825
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,150
It's packed here.

826
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,990
I couldn't keep up with the messages.

827
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,560
I'm new here,

828
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,120
so my schedule is inevitably tight.

829
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,490
I need to talk

830
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,850
to everyone here.

831
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,160
I need to bond with them,

832
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,590
so I'm too busy to see it.

833
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
You're feeding a cat

834
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,150
near Xinguang Square.

835
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,820
What Xinguang Square?

836
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

837
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,410
We're about to go to the second event,

838
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,590
heading to the karaoke bar.

839
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,700
You used to really like that road.

840
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:23,910
It looks very old,

841
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,510
but you said it was pretty.

842
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,300
There's a store nearby.

843
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,340
You can buy food to feed kittens.

844
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,180
It's really quite beautiful here.

845
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,630
After so many years,

846
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,380
it feels like nothing has changed.

847
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,740
But you're wrong about one thing.

848
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,550
It's not a kitten.

849
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,780
It's a car-like cat.

850
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,990
It's just parked here.

851
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,820
Why are you laughing?

852
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,400
Nothing.

853
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,510
Did you buy fireworks?

854
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,780
I'm alone here.

855
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,340
What would I do with that?

856
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,470
But it seems like we've

857
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,780
always celebrated New Year together.

858
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,600
Since the first grade,

859
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,950
we've never missed a year.

860
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,890
I think there was one year

861
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,950
when we were both out of town.

862
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,990
We thought we wouldn't make it back.

863
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,890
But in the end,

864
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,820
we rushed back

865
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,950
and celebrated the New Year together.

866
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,130
By the way,

867
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,890
after you celebrate New Year,

868
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,050
are you planning to stay

869
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,550
at Yixiu before heading home,

870
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,510
or go straight home?

871
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,240
If you plan to stay

872
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,990
at Yixiu for a while,

873
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,550
then I'll come.

874
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,330
But if you're going straight home,

875
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,170
then never mind.

876
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,920
It's snowing.

877
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,220
It's really snowing.

878
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,660
I can't believe it's actually snowing.

879
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,070
Why do you say "I can't believe"?

880
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,480
Close your eyes.

881
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,880
I won't.

882
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,820
I just don't believe

883
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,080
you can appear in front of me

884
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,380

Let's get the food ready.

893

some Qianye tofu.

It's my favorite.

896
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,910
- Got it on sale?
- No.

897
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,560
During the New Year,

898
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,220
why would we eat discounted food?

899
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,360
Alright.

900
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,930
Honey, give me some paper.

901
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:36,770
I'll get it for you.

902
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,380
Right here, look.

903
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,930
I've bought the ready-made cakes.

904
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,770
Aren't they pricey?

905
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,220
- No.
- Happy New Year.

906
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,510
Shiyan.

907
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,610
Wait.

908
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,850
Didn't you say
you couldn't get a ticket?

909
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,370
I got a standby ticket.

910
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,600
Otherwise, I would have spent

911
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,780
the New Year all alone.

912
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,470
What about the others?

913
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,010
I let the others go back.

914
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,510
- They're on holiday.
- That's good.

915
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,630
Who's this?

916
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,160
Surprise.

Yang.

919
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

920
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,200
What's going on with you two?

921
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,640
Didn't you agree not to come back?

922
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,010
Why are you both here?

923
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,850
Exactly.

924
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,120
We'll give you money if we don't.

925
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,200
The office rent was just paid.
How could I afford it?

926
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,160
Right. I'm a student.

927
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,010
I'm still in school,

928
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,330
so I can't afford it.

929
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,490
- No need for that.
- Come.

930
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,780
Come on, you two.

931
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,600
I thought you came back

932
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,440
as you missed me.

933
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,820
Turns out it was to save money.

934
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,550
Ouch, that hurts.

935
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,660
Shiyan, how can you be so shameless?

936
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,640
What's shame in front of money?

937
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,520
Is that right?

938
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,450
Stop chatting.

939
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,850
Come to eat. I'm starving.

940
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:37,690
- Let's eat.
- Go.

941
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,220
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

942
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,690
What do you want?

943
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,330
- That one.
- I'm telling you two.

944
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,930
You can't keep doing these surprises.

945
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,260
There isn't enough food.

946
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,370
It surely is enough.

947
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,300
We won't eat a lot.

948
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,410
By the way, how is

949
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,470
the financing going?

950
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,600
Did Shiyan not tell you?

951
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,440
What?

952
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,560
We've already drafted

953
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,660
the framework agreement

954
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,340
for 13 million.

955
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,290
This agreement will likely be signed

956
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,820
before the Spring Festival.

957
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,150
The subsequent funds will be

958
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,220
distributed in 3 batches
after the New Year.

959
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,810
Oh, my gosh, Shiyan.

960
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,240
Come on.

961
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,120
Why didn't you tell me

962
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,510
such good news?

963
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,970
I haven't signed it yet.

964
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,630
I didn't want to get your hopes up.

965
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,590
Wait, wait. Stop.

966
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,660
I have to toast to the bosses.

967
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,970
From today on,

968
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,220
you're worth millions.

969
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,600
Cheers.

970
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,300
- May it goes smoothly.
- Worth millions.

971
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,850
Even though it's 10 million,

972
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,110
it spends quickly.

973
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,210
This year,

974
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,490
our user count has exceeded

975
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,380
one and a half million.

976
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,160
And the future growth curve is

977
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,150
shooting up really high.

978
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,330
Cheng has calculated

979
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,120
that our servers

980
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,850
will soon face

981
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,780
a huge challenge.

982
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,550
At that time,

983
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,200
the costs will multiply several times

984
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,040
compared to now.

985
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,780
So, we still need funds.

986
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,120
Otherwise, our servers won't

987
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,470
keep up with user growth.

988
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,440
Right, Cheng Hui?

989
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,220
Not just the servers.

990
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,860
I've adjusted the algorithm,

991
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,600
changing from manual operation

992
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,110
to automated distribution by machines.

993
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,890
So, we can save a significant amount

994
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:09,860
on labor costs.

995
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,720
Cheng Hui, the four of us have a group.

996
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,560
Let's add you in.

997
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:14,730
What group?

998
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,260
The having-fun group.

999
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,770
Sure.

1000
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,680
If Cheng Hui joins,

1001
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,530
let's not call it

1002
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,410
the "First Foodies".

1003
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,250
Let's rename it.

1004
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,080
"A Loving Family".

1005
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,600
No, I have several groups

1006
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,910
with the same name.

1007
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,260
No. Think of another one.

1008
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,280
Cheng Hui, don't add any more.

1009
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,820
It'll be too much to cook. Hurry.

1010
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,960
Wait.

1011
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,380
What did you just say?

1012
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,760
Don't add any more?

1013
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,810
No, no. The one after that.

1014
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:39,650
It'll be too much

1015
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,660
to cook!

1016
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,240
It'll work. It's great.

1017
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,970
- Change it to this.
- This one.

1018
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:47,830
- That's it.
- Good.

1019
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:48,700
Why?

1020
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:49,890
Cheng Hui, let me explain.

1021
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:50,730
You don't know.

1022
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,160
Back in high school...

1023
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,530
The air conditioning is a bit hot.

1024
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,970
- Don't talk.
- Back in high school,

1025
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:55,930
we once played a game

1026
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,110
called "Pass the Flower".

1027
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,600
At that time, it was

1028
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,520
Shiyan's turn,

1029
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,530
and Shiyan recited a poem.

1030
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,510
How did he recite it?

1031
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,560
"In the North Sea, there's a fish."

1032
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,200
"Its name is Kun."

1033
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,600
"Kun is so big..."

1034
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,440
Then what?

1035
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,590
"It's too much to cook."

1036
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,780
"It turns into a bird."

1037
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,510
"Its name is Peng."

1038
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,120
"Peng is so big"

1039
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,530
"that it needs two barbecue grills."

1040
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,120
- And then?
- One with a secret recipe.

1041
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,860
- And one...
- Cooked with spice.

1042
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:26,260
