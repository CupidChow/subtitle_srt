These dishes, right?

33

to serve the dishes.

I'm going to tell Aunt Yi...

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,300
Great. Ms. Tang, you took the bribe,

38
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,350
so you cannot turn me in.

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,840
Look at you, why are you

40

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,860
Good!

46
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,020
Then I'll be brief.

47
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,970
Okay!

48
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,670
Thanks, everyone.

49
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,880
I'm so glad that Tang and her family

50
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,290
can celebrate Chinese New Year with us.

51
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,180
I thought

52
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,850
I would spoil the fun.

53
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,830
However,

54
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,950
look,

55
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,670
it's even better than previous years.

56
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,250
- Yes.
- After having

57
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,430
the reunion dinner,

58
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,270
we'll become

59
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,010
a family.

60
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,150
- Yes.
- We should visit and communicate with

61
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,670
each other more often.

62
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,110

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,850

74
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,670

75
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,670
No. It's Chinese New Year.
We should be happy.

76
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,780
Yes, we're so happy.

Sister Tang and you

79
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,370
have grown up

80
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,250
got a job.

81
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,460
Why are you still sitting with the kids?

82
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,160
I...

83
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,510
No matter how old you are,

84
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,760

85
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,300
you're always children

86
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,390
in this village.

87
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,180
Yes, that's right.

88
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,370
Our family has the same rule.

89
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,460
As long as you're not married,

90
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,670
you can still get red envelopes.

91
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,060
Fine. We'll work harder this year

92
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,740
so that maybe we can

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,460
sit with the adults next year, okay?

94
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,110
Are you silly?

95
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,040
Didn't you hear it?

96
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,020
If you're not married,
you can still get red envelopes

97
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,670
every year.

98
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,850
That's right.

99
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,720
- Yes.
- Maybe I shouldn't grow up.

100
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,370
Besides, isn't it nice to sit with kids?

101
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,710
Those seniors always ask too much.

102
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,460
- Come on.
- Come on.

103
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,970

104
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,950
I want to make a toast

105
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,970
to you and Mr. Tang.

106
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,950
Why?

107
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,200
Because Jiang Shiyan is so lucky

108
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,510
to have met Tang.

109
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,150
In high school,

110
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,720
Tang

111
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,620
helped Jiang Shiyan
to improve his grades

112
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,320
from around 400 points

113
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,270
to over 600 points!

114
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,020
Fangping said this before.

115
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,050
She said

116
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,760
Jiang Shiyan might not

117
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,810
get into a college.

118
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,270
If it really had happened,

119
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,950
he could only help her sell seafood.

120
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,050
- But I didn't expect...
- You never thought

121
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,580
I'd sell seafood now,

122
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,960
but on online platforms.

123
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,850
Apart from seafood,

124
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,170
I also sell tofu, sausages, chili sauce,

125
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,190
and stinky rice noodles.

126
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,930

to learn from Sister Tang.

she ranked first in every academic year.

140
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,770

141
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,810
Sister Tang's textbooks.

142
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,950

143
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,640
only to find it

144
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,050
full of orderly notes and remarks.

145
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,530
- It's not like that.
- Exactly.

146
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,850
Back then,

147
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,690

148
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,960
for her notes.

149
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,170
Everyone would borrow them

150
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,900
to study and copy before exams.

152
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,080

154
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,370
and an exercise book in her right hand,

155
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,280
Tang looked like

156
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,100

and wrote down every step

only to figure out

163
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,660
that there were

164
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,780
one point three old ladies on the bus.

165
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,920
How did you get the zero point three?

166
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,510
You borrowed half an old lady from me.

167
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,570
Yes.

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,530
the Spring Festival Gala

376
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,410
and eats some snacks

377
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,920
on Chinese New Year's Eve,

378
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,970
and people will come here

379
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,820
and chat with him.

380
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,510
When I was young,

381
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,560
I liked to come here

382
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,510
to buy a pack of Ta Ta candy

383
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,800
and a pack of plum candy

384
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,900
after having the reunion dinner.

385
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,850
I was so happy.

386
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,690
That's all.

387
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,900
How much?

388
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,560
68 yuan.

389
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,640
68 yuan, right?

390
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,480
Okay.

391
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,800
(You've received 68 yuan.)

392
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,640
Take care.

393
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,870
I'll buy something.

394
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,990
What is it?

395
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,420
Something.

396
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,570
Okay.

397
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,300
(You've received 12.9 yuan.)

398
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,640
Uncle Yan, goodbye.

399
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,480
Bye.

400
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,400
Goodbye, Uncle Yan.

401
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,940
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

402
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,590
What did you buy?

403
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,060
Tell me what it is.

404
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,300
Nothing.

405
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,940
Isn't this firework nice?

406
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,300
Yes.

407
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,010
Did you take cherry bombs?

408
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,900
Yes.

409
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,350
Be careful.

410
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,360
Hurry.

411
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,110
I used to like...

412
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,520
Well,

413
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,760
I'd throw cheery bombs to the ground

414
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,250
when girls passed by

415
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,110
to freak them out.

416
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,010
When I was a kid,

417
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,010
I hate those boys

418
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,850
who threw cheery bombs

419
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,490
at my feet.

420
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,420
So annoying.

421
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,970
Speaking of which,

422
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,470
did I do that to you when we were kids?

423
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,480
No,

424
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,280
because I'd go to my father's place

425
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,940
to spend the holiday

426
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,600
and wouldn't come back
until school started.

427
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,660
So, this is the first time we've spent

428
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,060
the Chinese New Year's Eve together.

429
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,060
Happy Chinese New Year.

430
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,420
Little boy Jiang Shiyan.

431
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,600
Is bubble gum

432
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,690
12.9 yuan now?

433
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,110
Yes, exactly.

434
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,600
I haven't seen this stuff

435
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,460
for many years.

436
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,600
Let's battle.

437
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,640
How old are you?

438
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,390
Why do you want a bubble gum battle?

439
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,090
It's grape flavor.

440
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,200
You go first.

441
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,690
Not bad, Jiang Shiyan.

442
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,790
You've got something.

443
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,390
Let me try again.

444
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,120
You won.

445
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,790
It's all over my face.

446
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,870
Here. Spit it out.

447
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,150
Let's go.

448
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,400
Happy Chinese New Year.

449
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,740
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

450
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,080
Ms. Chen,
with the Spring Festival couplets,

451
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,540
I can feel the vibe of Chinese New Year.

452
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,830
- Yes.
- It's neat and elegant.

453
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,550
You'll have a good start this year.

454
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,450
Your friend Ms. Tang

455
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,640
wrote this,

456
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,800
and you painted

457
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,740
the lucky character of Fu.

458
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,210
It was folded,

459
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,660
so I didn't recognize it.

460
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,730
The handwriting is good,

461
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,360
- Yes.
- so is the painting.

462
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,310
Excellent.

463
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,700
They're elites.

464
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,040
Good handwriting

465
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,170
and a pretty face.

466
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,010
Yes.

467
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,850
They're right

468
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,400
- You're prettier.
- about that.

469
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,110
Look, they're hanging up

470
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,740
the spring couplets we wrote.

471
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,220
It really gives me
a sense of achievement.

472
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,360
Your couplets
and the lucky character of Fu

473
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,390
and my painting

474
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,660
are the perfect match.

475
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,660
My handwriting is better.

476
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,410
- Let's go.
- Okay.

477
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,260
Goodbye.

478
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,160
Happy Chinese New Year.

479
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,550
Happy Chinese New Year.

480
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,830
They're also hanging up the couplets.

481
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,250
Uncle Shui,

482
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,210
Happy Chinese New Year.

483
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,820
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

484
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,760
Happy Chinese New Year.

485
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,040
Have you finished the reunion dinner?

486
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,870
Yes.

487
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,400
Why are you only
hanging up the couplets?

488
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,700
Where's the painting?

489
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,940
My grandson likes it.

490
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,420
It's on his room door.

491
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,120
Then I'll bring
another one here tomorrow.

492
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,040
You can hang it up.

493
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,230
Okay, thanks.

494
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,080
You're welcome.

495
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,920
Thank you.

496
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,790
- We're leaving.
- Okay. Goodbye.

497
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,290
Well,

498
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,110
do you have to match them up?

499
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,550
Of course.

500
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,350
They're a match.

501
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,420
They're setting off fireworks.

502
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,570
What about ours?

503
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,080
Happy Chinese New Year!

504
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,760
- Be Careful.
- Red envelopes!

505
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,370
- Red envelopes?
- Yes.

506
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,390
Grab them.

507
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,010
Let's greet your grandfather.

508
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,640
I'll put the fireworks aside for now.

509
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,650
Grandpa.

510
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,250
Come and get your red envelopes.

511
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,970
Grandpa, Happy Chinese New Year.

512
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,970
Wish you good health

513
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,930
and longevity.

514
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,770
Wonderful.

515
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,120
Grandpa, Happy Chinese New Year.

516
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,600
- Wish you good health
- Happy Chinese New Year.

517
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,460
and longevity.

518
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,550
Jiang Shiyan.

519
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,410
- Mom.
- Why are you repeating

520
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,250
Tang's words?

521
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,660
Yes, even the greetings.

522
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Come on. You're not married.

523
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,760
You can have red envelopes.

524
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,840
You too.

525
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,400
Thanks, Ms. Zhou.
Happy Chinese New Year.

526
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,240
Okay.

527
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,930
Take Tang upstairs

528
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,080
to bring my gifts

529
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,630
in the red bag.

530
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,800
Aunt Yi, you've prepared gifts
this year?

531
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,650
Of course.

532
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,490
Every year.

533
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,800
- Well,
- Then...

534
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Mom, help me to give out

535
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,160
the red envelopes

536
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,340
- I prepared.
- When you come back,

537
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,400
remember to eat the rice cakes.

538
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,940
- Your aunt made them.
- Okay, we'll eat them later.

539
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,810
We'll go get the...

540
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,970
Give out the red envelopes.

541
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,400
- Okay. I got it.
- Okay. Let's go.

542
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,800
Come on.

543
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,170
Kids, more red envelopes.

544
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,660
- What do you mean?
- Keep it for me.

545
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,090
Why?

546
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,730
We're playing cards tomorrow.

547
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,180
Let's make a team.

548
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,490
I bet that you can

549
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,330
make it double.

550
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,030
Oh, I see.

551
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,940
Fine, little boy.

552
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,490
I'll keep it

553
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,870
and give it back when you grow up.

554
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,900
It's a little bit narrow.

555
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,150
I'm fine.

556
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,830
What are these?

557
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,010
These are

558
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,550
the toys I used to play with.

559
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,690
Slingshots,

560
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,110
arrows, cars, something like that.

561
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,550
My grandfather made them by hand.

562
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,420
All of them?

563
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,850
This one too?

564
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,770
Yes.

565
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,740
He used to be a carpenter.

566
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,870
Oh my god, this is so cool.

567
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,930
My mother never gave me

568
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,830
a New Year's gift,

569
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,170
but she never forgot

570
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,070
your gifts.

571
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,120
Because I'm a thoughtful girl

572
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,180
while you're a naughty boy.

573
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,360
Can I subscribe

574
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,970
to a nice-talk service?

575
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,030
Maybe a monthly subscription?

576
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,530
It's a low-margin deal.

577
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,180
I might consider an annual subscription.

578
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,630
Pearls.

579
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,250
Honestly, Ms. Yi has got a good taste.

580
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,180
It's so pretty.

581
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,310
Let me put it on you.

582
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,070
Okay. Help me.

583
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,460
It's good.

584
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,590
Yes.

585
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,170
Then... take it off for me.

586
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,740
I don't need it now.

587
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,250
Okay.

588
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,110
This is

589
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,500
Aunt Yi when she was young, right?

590
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,660
So gorgeous.

591
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,870
Her younger cousin

592
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,250
is next to her.

593
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,770
They grew up together

594
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,700
in the village.

595
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,830
Is that you?

596
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,690
How old were you?

597
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,740
Three or four years old?

598
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,920
Yes.

599
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,930
I was grinning
when they took the picture,

600
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,550
and I fell into a hole one second later.

601
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,900
Where's the hole?

602
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,030
Right there.

603
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,260
So clumsy.

604
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,830
And this.

605
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,680
Look,

606
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,150
I got rice all over my face.

607
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,890
Any normal mother would definitely

608
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,220
wipe them off,

609
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,120
but my mother

610
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,360
immediately took a picture of me

611
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,590
with my uncle's new camera.

612
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,260
Is that an excavator?

613
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,800
It's so weird

614
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,760
that every boy seems

615
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,420
to like excavators when they were kids.

616
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,390
That's true.

617
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,600
I would stare at an excavator
for a long time

618
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,460
like there was some kind of magic.

619
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,250
Then...

620
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,600
Who is this?

621
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,970
I remember
you only have a little brother

622
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,150
instead of a sister.

623
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,700
This must be

624
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,800
my relative's child.

625
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,550
It's okay to hug.

626
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,170
Jiang Shiyan,

627
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,500
isn't that you?

628
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,690
Your outfit was unique.

629
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,970
A small hat with a yellow bow

630
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,040
and

631
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,070
a pink lace dress.

632
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,170
My mother liked girls.

633
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,600
Every boy was dressed up

634
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,890
like girls in their childhood.

635
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,290
It's so special. I must take a photo.

636
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,160
What are you doing? Please don't.

637
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,000
Just one photo.

638
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,390
I must do this.

639
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,150
- Why do you have to take a photo?
- I must remember this.

640
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm going to send it to the group chat.

641
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,120
Don't send it!

642
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,710
- I'll send you a red packet, okay?
- They must see this.

643
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,300
A red packet doesn't work. No bribe.

644
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
- I...
- Give it to me! Don't!

645
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,680
- Don't hide it!
- You...

I'll go downstairs.

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,170

00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,280

00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,120

678
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,170

685
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,870
We haven't gathered together like this
for a long time.

686
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,410
Good.

687
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,240
Everyone gets together
on Chinese New Year's Eve.

688

727
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,760

00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,900

are still at home,

00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,890
so we need to go back

754
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,150
and pick them up.

755
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,560
I was thinking about playing mahjong
with you in the afternoon.

756
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,320
We can play mahjong whenever we want.

757
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,080
Call me when you come back, okay?

758
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,180
- Okay, no problem.
- See you soon.

759
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,890
- Come on.
- Get in the car.

760
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,590
Put your stuff in the trunk.

761
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,700
- Tang.
- Be careful.

762
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,120
Come on.

763
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,490
Jiang Shiyan is still sleeping.

764
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,040
He always oversleeps when he's at home.

765
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,460
He won't get up till noon.

766
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,360
It's okay. I'll talk to him on WeChat.

767
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,410
- Let him sleep.
- Okay. Okay.

768
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,500
- Get in.
- Okay.

769
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,650
Aunt, just go back.

770
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,490
It's cold.

771
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,930
Be careful when you're driving.

772
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,970
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

773
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,560
Goodbye. Happy Chinese New Year.

774
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Happy Chinese New Year.

775
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,790
Call me when you're back.

776
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:10,770
Okay.

777
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,220
Goodbye.

778
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,030
(Tang Yang)
(I need to go back for an emergency.)

779
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,030
(Goodbye.)

780
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,310
(Happy Chinese New Year.)

781
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,120
Mom.

782
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,360
Mom, are they gone?

783
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,320
You're up.

784
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,500
They've left.

785
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,830
Oh, no.

786
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,160
What's wrong?

787
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,840
They forgot to take

788
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,770
the jujube paste cakes
and rice dumplings

789
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,740
your grandfather prepared.

790
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:50,900
Perfect.

791
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,390
I'll send them over now.

792
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,360
How are you going to send them?

793
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,390
I... I'll ride a bike.

794
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,960
Be careful.

795
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,160
Hello, Yang,

796
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,070
you haven't gone far, right?

797
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,690
You missed something.

798
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,700
I'll send them over now.

799
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,630
Wait for me.

800
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,440
Goodbye.

801
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,610
What's wrong?

802
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,300
You forgot

803
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,680
the jujube paste cakes
and rice dumplings

804
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,930
my grandfather prepared.

805
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:32,770
Oh, yes.

806
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,450
- That's right.
- More snacks.

807
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,290
We were in a rush

808
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,630
and left the stuff on the table.

809
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,240
Put them in the trunk.

810
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,080
The trunk.

811
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,600
Thank you for coming over.

812
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,550
No problem.

813
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,220
Tang Yang.

814
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,220
Last night, I...

815
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,520
What?

816
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,040
It's okay.

817
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,210
You...

818
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,410
You...

819
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,380
Don't overthink it.

820
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,220
Okay. I'm leaving.

821
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,330
Goodbye.

822
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,660
- Be careful on the way home.
- Goodbye.

823
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,070
Be safe.

824
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,550
Tell me when you get home.

(Shiyan, I've thought about it...)

830
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,860

It's been a long time.

838

- Glad to see you, big boss.
- Hurry.

839
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,120
You're waiting at the door.
That's my bro.

Stop talking nonsense. Listen,

841
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,970
you're both late.

842
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,040
Mr. Chen has arrived.

843
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,070
How many classmates are there?

844
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,040
About ten classmates.

845
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,910
Not many.

846
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,200
Some went to travel,

847
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,300
and some are busy at home.

848
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,080
Guys,

849
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,070
look who's here.

850
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,330
It's been a long time.

851
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,520
- So glad to see you.
- Mr. Chen.

852
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,660
It's been a while.

853
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,450
You used to be late all the time.
You haven't changed at all.

854
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,850
Can we forget about that,

855
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,910
Mr. Chen?

856
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,240
Come on. Have a seat.

857
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,300
Where's Jiang Shiyan?

858
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,930
He said he'd come in the morning

859
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,520
and asked me if you'd come.

860
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,360
I said yes,

861
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,520
and he called me

862
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,720
a while later

863
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,700
and said

864
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,370
his mother asked him

865
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,280
to pick up

866
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,410
a remote relative's son.

867
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,300
It's his elder cousin.

868
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,560
He needs to send him to the countryside

869
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,200
and won't come back until the afternoon.

870
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,220
I don't think he can make it.

871
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:15,950
Really?

(This is the place. We've arrived.)

874
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,860
(What about the other two cars?)

875
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,410

00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,510

(Are you trying to cheat with the help)

(of Tang Yang who got 148 points in math
in the college entrance examination?)

879
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,430

Jiang Shiyan.

882
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,000
Why are you here?

883
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,590
They were talking about

884
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,350
going to play murder mystery games
in the group chat.

885
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,180
Didn't you go?

886
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,300
Then why didn't you go to the party?

887
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,630
Feng Weiran said

888
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,010
you needed

889
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,700
to pick up

890
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,550
a distant cousin.

891
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,630
I knew you were lying.

892
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,150
I wasn't.

893
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,860
My aunt heard my grandfather fell
and was very worried,

894
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,340
so she asked my cousin to visit him.

895
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,180
The airport is far
from my grandfather's house,

896
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,070
so my mother asked me to pick him up.

897
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,520
Okay.

898
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,530
I thought

899
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,820
you were hiding from me.

900
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,650
I...

901
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,990
Why would I do that?

902
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,700
So, nothing has changed between us,

903
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,180
right?

904
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,550
Do you want us

905
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,070
to stay the same as before?

906
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,440
Yes.

907
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,300
We've known each other
for so many years

908
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,820
and gone through a lot.

909
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,680
I've always believed

910
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,970
that the most important thing

911
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,030
is to be friends forever.

912
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,380
I don't want anything

913
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,030
to affect

914
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,950
our friendship.

915
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,970
So, those accidents

916
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,860
and mistakes

917
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,550
will not affect us, right?

918
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,910
So,

919
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,070
the most important thing to you

920
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,700
is that we can be friends forever.

921
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,630
We're just good buddies.

922
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,740
Didn't you want to be my bro?

923
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,080
You insisted on calling me bro,

924
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
but I never

925
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,920
asked you to.

926
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,470
But you're my bro, Yang.

927
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,410
If not bro, should I call you sis,

928
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,860
or... or maybe aunt?

929
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,200
Jiang Shiyan, do you want
to get beaten up?

930
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,040
Tang Yang.

931
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,630
I'll call you Tang Yang more often.

932
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,550
Less bro.

933
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,430
Aren't they the same?

934
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,520
You always switched

935
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
from one to another.

936
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,700
What's the difference?

937
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,910
My attitude has changed.

938
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,700
