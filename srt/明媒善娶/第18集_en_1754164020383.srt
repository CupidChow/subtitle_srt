Translated byMaybei, timing, bi Modeling,

2
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,940
Missing is just an perfume

3
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,340
Young master is feeling fine

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,340
Who is the one who is shy to express

5
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,340
The blush of the blushed face

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,340
The confused heart

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,340
Who is willing to?

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,340
It's better to be honest than to be a clown

9
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,340
Falling is better

10
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,340
See the flowers in the branches

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,340
Strange years

12
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,340
I don't know if you have a care

13
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,340
Some love if you want to repay

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,340
But there is no way

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,340
A lifetime of love is the best way

16
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,340
The Long Ballad

17
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,340
Episode 16

18
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,340
My Lord, Cheng Ruoning is really not a good actor.

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,340
He doesn't deserve you.

20
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,340
How about I help you to solve him?

21
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,340
Stupid, stupid donkey

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,340
Cheng Ruoning is really despicable

23
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,340
The most despicable is Shi Fak

24
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,340
Yes, yes, yes

25
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,340
A little official

26
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,340
In the face of all the people

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,340
Let me lose face

28
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,340
Threaten me to say that I can't take revenge

29
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,340
It's despicable

30
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,340
Damn, damn

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,340
I ask you

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,340
If Cheng Ruoning has a problem now

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,340
Who doesn't know it's me?

34
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,340
You can think of this bad idea

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,340
I kill you

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,340
My Lord, please spare me

37
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
My Lord, please spare me

38
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,340
Help

39
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,340
My Lord

40
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,340
Get out

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,340
Fang Yue

42
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,340
I asked you to come to the capital

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,340
I asked you to hold on to Shi Fak

44
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
Help me

45
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,340
But it's been so long

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,340
No progress

47
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,340
It's too disappointing

48
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Shi Fak is indeed a great official

49
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,340
What did you say?

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,340
He is simple-minded

51
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,340
He only wants to be a good girl

52
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,340
The simpler the person, the more successful the big thing

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,340
I can't compare

54
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,340
I am full of selfishness and thoughts

55
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,340
All right

56
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Don't say these words

57
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,340
As Cheng Ruoning

58
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,340
It's okay not to enter my Wu'an Marquis' Mansion

59
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,340
You go first

60
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,340
What? Anything else?

61
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,340
My Lord

62
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,340
Marriage is a destiny

63
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,340
A forced marriage will not have good results

64
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,340
You must use marriage

65
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,340
To exchange for what you want

66
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,340
I beg your leave

67
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,340
I beg your leave

68
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,340
My Lady, Shi Meiguan is here

69
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
Shi Meiguan, Mr. Lu, please sit

70
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,340
I am here to see you

71
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
I have chosen the date

72
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
What's wrong?

73
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,340
You quarreled?

74
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
Let me guess

75
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
You are so worried

76
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,340
It's about Wu'an Marquis

77
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,340
Wu'an Marquis?

78
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,340
What did he do to you?

79
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,340
I guess it's not Wu'an Marquis

80
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,340
He did something else

81
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,340
I don't know

82
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,340
But I know

83
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,340
He is a good man

84
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,340
I guess it's not Wu'an Marquis

85
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,340
He did something else

86
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,340
It's Mr. Qiu Jiang and Mrs. Cheng

87
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,340
Worrying about what he did

88
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,340
And they had a fight

89
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,340
Mr. Lu is right

90
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,340
I rejected Wu'an Marquis' marriage

91
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,340
And I embarrassed him at the Zhaoxing Conference

92
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,340
I'm afraid he won't give up

93
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,340
As long as we are in the capital

94
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,340
He can make troubles to me and Qiu Jiang at any time

95
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,340
I'm afraid he will hurt Qiu Jiang

96
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
Hardly next time

97
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,340
So I want to leave the capital

98
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,340
It's not okay

99
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,340
No

100
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,340
Ruoning

101
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,340
You never leave the capital since you were a kid

102
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,340
And your family is here

103
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,340
Do you know what it means to leave the capital?

104
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,340
It means we should leave the hometown from the beginning

105
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,340
I don't care

106
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,340
But I can't bear to let you live such a hard life

107
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,340
As long as I can be with you

108
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,340
I want to live that kind of life

109
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
If I have no you

110
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,340
It's the real torture for me

111
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,340
Ruoning

112
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
Don't be stubborn

113
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,340
These things happened recently

114
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,340
Wu'an Marquis is cruel

115
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,340
Especially after the Zhaoxing Conference

116
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
He has become very unreasonable

117
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,340
Is there really no way to get rid of him?

118
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,340
All these things started because of Wu'an Marquis

119
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,340
Can no one stop him?

120
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,340
There is really such a person

121
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
Who is it?

122
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,340
Tianji is not to be revealed

123
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
I can't tell you

124
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
But I can promise you

125
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,340
I will do my best to coordinate

126
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,340
Before this

127
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,340
I will arrange Lu Yi to protect Mr. Qiu Jiang and Mrs. Cheng

128
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,340
Don't worry

129
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,340
I know

130
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,340
Thank you, Brother Lu

131
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,340
So you are going to leave the capital

132
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,340
And you are going to live in the capital

133
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
I don't know

134
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,340
So thank you, Brother Lu

135
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
Brother Lu

136
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,340
Brother Lu

137
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,340
Is it good to wash clothes?

138
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
What are you waiting for?

139
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
I was just about to tell you

140
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,340
How to get rid of Wu'an

141
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Yes, yes

142
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,340
This method is

143
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,340
The legend in my mind

144
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,340
Is this method okay?

145
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,340
I don't know if Mrs. Cheng will agree

146
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,340
Then try it with Mrs. Cheng

147
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
I will try

148
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,340
Brother Lu

149
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,340
What if Mrs. Cheng doesn't agree?

150
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
Skin is not guilty

151
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
Skin is not guilty

152
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
As long as there is no such thing

153
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,340
Wu'an Hou will not think about the Cheng family anymore

154
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,340
But this decision

155
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,340
Only Mrs. Cheng can do it herself

156
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
If she refuses

157
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
Ake doesn't have to blame herself

158
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,340
You are right

159
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
Rather than worrying here

160
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,340
It's better to cut the horse

161
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
Then let's go in

162
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
I can't do this

163
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,340
Mrs. Cheng

164
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,340
I know you can't make a choice at the moment

165
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,340
But this is the only way

166
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,340
If the Cheng family is still rich

167
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,340
Wu'an Hou will definitely think of ways

168
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,340
Take your wealth as the only thing

169
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,340
If you and Mr. Qiu Jiang are protected

170
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,340
He will definitely take the opportunity to take revenge

171
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,340
I know

172
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,340
But these are all my father's

173
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,340
Family business that he worked hard for his whole life

174
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,340
I

175
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,340
I really can't decide on this

176
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Can I consider it?

177
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
I understand Mrs. Cheng's feelings

178
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
This is also the suggestion given by Ake and me

179
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
But how to decide in the end

180
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,340
It still needs Mrs. Cheng to make her own decisions

181
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
No matter what decision you make

182
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
We will support you

183
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Marquis, bad news

184
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,340
Why are you so panic?

185
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
The Cheng family

186
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,340
Today all the shops and door faces

187
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Have been changed

188
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,340
The Cheng family

189
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
All the property

190
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
Have been taken over

191
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,340
Now

192
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,340
It has become a royal business

193
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,340
Royal business

194
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
The Cheng family's property

195
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Has been changed

196
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,340
The Cheng family's property

197
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Has become a royal business

198
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,340
I heard that

199
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Cheng Ruoning has donated all the property

200
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,340
Out

201
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,340
It's said that for

202
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,340
For the sake of the good

203
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,340
To enrich the military budget

204
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,340
Bastard

205
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,340
You mean

206
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,340
The money didn't go to my hand

207
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,340
Instead, it went to that person's hand

208
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,340
Cheng Ruoning is a woman

209
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,340
How could she think of this idea?

210
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,340
It must be Lu Chi and Shifa Kakao's ghost

211
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,340
If I don't kill Cheng Ruoning

212
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,340
I will be so heartbroken

213
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
No

214
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,340
Marquis, think twice

215
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,340
Now we can't kill Cheng Ruoning

216
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,340
She has been recognized

217
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,340
As the sister of the emperor

218
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,340
What?

219
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,340
It's said that

220
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,340
Cheng Ruoning, the only daughter of the Cheng family

221
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,340
Is smart and clever

222
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,340
She is good at everything

223
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,340
She is a good person

224
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,340
She is kind and kind

225
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
For the sake of the people

226
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,340
She donated all the property

227
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,340
She is a royal sister

228
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,340
She is the princess of Jiangning

229
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,340
Great

230
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
The money is gone

231
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,340
And this woman played tricks on me

232
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
Do all the people in the world

233
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Want to oppose me?

234
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
Great

235
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,340
Since you want to oppose me

236
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,340
I will show you

237
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,340
Who is the famous person in the world

238
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Marquis, calm down

239
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
It's all Lu Chi and Shifa Kakao

240
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,340
We should

241
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,340
Put the ghost in the room as soon as possible

242
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
Yes

243
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,340
Yes

244
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,340
We should

245
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Get rid of them as soon as possible

246
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
I have my own plan

247
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
Whether it's the Cheng family

248
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,340
Or Lu Chi and Shifa Kakao

249
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,340
No matter how they torture

250
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,340
They are all in the way

251
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,340
When I accomplish my great cause

252
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,340
They will bow to me

253
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,340
Marquis, you are wise

254
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,340
Since these people are not good

255
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,340
I will find someone with a good eye

256
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,340
To make a great deal with me

257
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,340
Only the one who laughs until the end

258
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,340
Is the winner

259
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,340
By the way

260
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,340
The king of Gaoyou

261
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,340
Will marry his pearl to the emperor

262
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,340
But the princess of Gaoyou

263
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,340
Has gone to the capital

264
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,340
Now the whereabouts are unknown

265
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,340
Now

266
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,340
We should find the princess of Gaoyou as soon as possible

267
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,340
Yes

268
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,340
When the Cheng family

269
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,340
Put the property on the court

270
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,340
I left the Baihua Yiguan for you

271
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,340
You can change the Baihua Yiguan

272
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,340
To the Xiyuan

273
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,340
The business is still managed by Boss Cheng

274
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,340
And Mr. Qiu Jiang

275
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,340
No need to choose another place to be on stage

276
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,340
How about it

277
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,340
It's best if it can be done

278
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
Thank you, Mr. Lu

279
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,340
For considering us thoroughly

280
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
When the Xiyuan opens

281
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,340
You must come to the city

282
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,340
Of course

283
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
I am Mr. Qiu Jiang's fan

284
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,340
We will go

285
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
Great

286
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
Mr. Qiu Jiang

287
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,340
Look

288
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,340
Great

289
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,340
Great

290
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,340
Great

291
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
Great

292
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,340
Welcome

293
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Please

294
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,340
Come in

295
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,340
The Fengguan family is so talented

296
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,340
Yes

297
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,340
The little girl of the Cheng family

298
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,340
Was the capital's guard a few days ago

299
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,340
Now

300
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,340
Only the Xiyuan is left

301
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,340
Look at the current arrangement

302
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,340
Mr. Qiu Jiang will not feel anymore

303
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,340
He doesn't deserve Sister Ruonin

304
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
And

305
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,340
No one dares to

306
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,340
Be a little bit of the emperor's sister

307
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
The two of them

308
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,340
Are working hard

309
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,340
I heard

310
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,340
Mr. Qiu Jiang wrote a lot of new things

311
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,340
To Sister Ruonin

312
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,340
It seems that love

313
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,340
Can really stimulate creative inspiration

314
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,340
Who said no

315
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,340
Brother Lu

316
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,340
Let's go in

317
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,340
Go

318
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
Brother Lu

319
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,340
Ke

320
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
You are so great

321
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,340
You are the first one

322
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,340
To decide what opera the theater will sing

323
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
But the other theaters

324
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
Don't have it

325
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,340
You can satisfy the needs of the customers

326
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,340
And you can increase the income for the theater

327
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
One or two

328
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,340
It's really great

329
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
Ordinary operation

330
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,340
Ordinary operation

331
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
I am not always smart

332
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,340
Yes

333
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,340
You are the most powerful

334
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,340
We finally heard Jiang Ning's dream

335
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,340
But these days

336
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,340
I feel like a dream

337
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,340
A dream

338
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,340
A dream

339
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,340
A dream

340
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,340
Why are you so emotional every day

341
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
I just miss Yan Yan

342
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,340
Last time I came to the theater

343
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,340
It was the three of us

344
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,340
Now Yan Yan is gone

345
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,340
You are busy too

346
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,340
I don't know when we will be able to

347
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
Raise our hands again

348
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
Yes

349
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,340
It would be great if Yan Yan was here

350
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,340
We are still like before

351
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,340
Watching the play together

352
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,340
Playing with medicine together

353
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
Together

354
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,340
Look at handsome young man

355
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,340
And beautiful young lady

356
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,340
Please come in

357
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,340
Please stay in the corner

358
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,340
Great

359
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
Great

360
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,340
Great

361
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
Wu An Hou is a man

362
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
He is self-confident

363
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,340
He may also play tricks

364
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,340
A few days ago

365
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,340
A few days ago

366
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,340
He made Wu An Hou's thing

367
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,340
He made Wu An Hou's thing

368
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,340
He will not let him go

369
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,340
Lu Yi

370
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
You must protect him

371
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,340
You must protect him

372
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Yes

373
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
Yes

374
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,340
Yes

375
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,340
Yes

376
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,340
Yes

377
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,340
Yes

378
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,340
Yes

379
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,340
Yes

380
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
Yes

381
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,340
Come back

382
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,340
No

383
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,340
I still can't rest assured

384
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,340
I want to see A Ke in person

385
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,340
A Ke

386
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,340
Let's go

387
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,340
I need to see the shop

388
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,340
Ding Ding

389
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,340
I have things to do

390
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
You go first

391
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
You are a good match

392
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,340
You are a good match

393
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Ding Ding

394
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
I have things to do

395
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
You go first

396
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,340
I have things to do

397
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
You are a good match

398
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
Let's go

399
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,340
A Ke

400
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,340
Let's go

401
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
Let's go

402
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,340
Ding Ding

403
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,340
There is a meeting

404
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,340
Let's go

405
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,340
Ding Ding

406
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Go

407
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,340
I'm not.

408
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,340
This is a good one.

409
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,340
I understand.

410
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,340
You are so handsome.

411
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,340
You are a good match.

412
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,340
I'm leaving.

413
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,340
Good luck.

414
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,340
Go.

415
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,340
If you can't decide which play to watch,

416
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,340
I can recommend one for you.

417
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,340
I'll ask my lady to recommend one.

418
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,340
I guess you'll like these two plays.

419
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
Thank you, my lady.

420
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,340
My lord, you look familiar.

421
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
You look like a man.

422
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,340
How old are you?

423
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
Do you have a match?

424
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,340
I'm a matchmaker.

425
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,340
If you have a wedding plan,

426
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,340
you can ask me.

427
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,340
This young man looks familiar.

428
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,340
He looks like a man.

429
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,340
How old are you?

430
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
How old are you?

431
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,340
Do you have a match?

432
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
This again?

433
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
You work in the hall?

434
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
Yes.

435
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,340
You're a real man.

436
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,340
I'm Shi Fak.

437
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,340
I'm the matchmaker in the hall.

438
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,340
My mother was the matchmaker in the hall.

439
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
I'm sorry.

440
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,340
But I won't bother you today.

441
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,340
After all, it's our first meeting.

442
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
It's too early to talk about marriage.

443
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,340
If I want to get married,

444
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,340
I won't be late to the hall.

445
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,340
My lord,

446
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
you have an interesting plan.

447
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
Don't you want to get married?

448
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,340
I see you are popular in the hall.

449
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
You're a fan of peach blossoms.

450
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,340
I'm sure you'll have a guest today.

451
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
I see you are popular in the hall.

452
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,340
You're a fan of peach blossoms.

453
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,340
I'm sure you'll have a guest today.

454
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,340
It's a good chance to meet you.

455
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
How about I take you to taste the food in the capital?

456
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,340
Let's have a chat.

457
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,340
Thank you for your kind intention.

458
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,340
But...

459
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,340
But it's unnecessary.

460
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,340
I...

461
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,340
You're welcome.

462
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,340
You're so generous to eat with me.

463
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,340
Maybe I can help you find someone.

464
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
How do you know I'm going to find someone?

465
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
We matchmakers

466
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,340
are very good at observing.

467
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
It's our first meeting.

468
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,340
It's a surprise to know I'm from the hall.

469
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,340
You're not in a hurry to go to the hall.

470
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,340
But you said you would go in the future.

471
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,340
You're not in a hurry to talk to me.

472
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
But you're good to me.

473
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
I'm sure someone didn't choose to get married in a hurry.

474
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,340
But you're going to find someone to get married.

475
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,340
Sister,

476
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,340
are you a genius?

477
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,340
No, no.

478
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,340
I'm just a little clever.

479
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,340
There are many famous men in the hall.

480
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,340
Those who are not married are married.

481
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,340
Childe,

482
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,340
you're not going to lose anything by eating with me.

483
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,340
Really?

484
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,340
Of course.

485
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,340
Ke.

486
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,340
Brother Lu,

487
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,340
you're here.

488
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,340
This is your friend.

489
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,340
This is a friend I just met.

490
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
Childe,

491
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
you know my name.

492
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,340
I don't know your name.

493
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
My name is Yan Qi Yue.

494
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Which Yan?

495
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,340
Yan Dong's Yan.

496
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,340
Yan Yan's summer's Qi Yue.

497
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,340
Mr. Yan's name is so interesting.

498
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
Brother Lu,

499
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,340
since you're here,

500
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,340
why don't we go to the West Treasure Pavilion

501
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
to have a meal together?

502
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
What is West Treasure Pavilion?

503
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,340
West Treasure Pavilion

504
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,340
is the most famous shop in the capital.

505
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,340
You must go to West Treasure Pavilion

506
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,340
when you come out.

507
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,340
There are many treasures in West Treasure Pavilion.

508
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,340
Food is good and it's hard to find.

509
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,340
Oh, right.

510
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,340
Brother Lu is the owner of West Treasure Pavilion.

511
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
So great.

512
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,340
Thank you for taking me to the shop.

513
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,340
But I'm the host today.

514
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
Please.

515
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
It's really not a coincidence.

516
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,340
Today is the end of the month.

517
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,340
West Treasure Pavilion is closed.

518
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,340
I should go back early.

519
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,340
Let's go, Brother.

520
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,340
It's late.

521
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,340
Let's go back.

522
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,340
It's not a coincidence.

523
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,340
It's okay.

524
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,340
It's okay.

525
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,340
We'll go to West Treasure Pavilion another day.

526
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,340
Today,

527
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,340
I'll take you to eat special snacks.

528
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
Brother Lu,

529
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,340
don't you have something to do?

530
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,340
I...

531
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,340
Go ahead.

532
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,340
Let's go.

533
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,340
Go.

534
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,340
It's here.

535
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,340
Do you often come to West Treasure Pavilion?

536
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,340
This is my favorite powder shop

537
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,340
of Brother Lu and me.

538
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
Their beef noodles are very tasty.

539
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,340
Others can't eat it.

540
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,340
So I need to experience

541
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,340
the taste of beef noodles

542
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,340
that West Treasure Pavilion praised.

543
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,340
Boss,

544
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
three bowls of beef noodles.

545
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,340
Okay.

546
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
Here, sir.

547
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,340
Here's your noodles.

548
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,340
Sorry, sir.

549
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Let me wipe it for you.

550
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
Thank you.

551
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
Thank you.

552
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
Thank you.

553
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,340
Thank you.

554
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,340
Thank you.

555
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,340
Ke, chopsticks.

556
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
Sir, yours.

557
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,340
Since you've spilled the powder,

558
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
have mine.

559
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
Sir,

560
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,340
have mine.

561
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
I have more beef.

562
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
Thank you.

563
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,340
Sir,

564
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,340
do you have a match?

565
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,340
I have a match, too.

566
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
But I

567
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,340
have a new one.

568
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,340
Then tell me in detail.

569
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,340
If you two are in love,

570
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,340
I will help you make a good relationship.

571
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,340
Actually,

572
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,340
I came to the capital this time

573
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,340
to find her.

574
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,340
I've been in love with her for many years.

575
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,340
She has always been my soul mate.

576
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,340
Although I don't know

577
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,340
what her name is,

578
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,340
I don't know where she is,

579
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,340
and I don't know

580
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,340
how to find her.

581
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,340
I've been in love with her for many years.

582
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,340
I don't know her name,

583
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,340
and I don't know where she is,

584
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,340
but I've always been her soul mate.

585
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,340
She is a person who wants to find her.

586
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,340
How can she be so similar to me?

587
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,340
In this aspect,

588
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,340
I have the most experience.

589
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,340
I can definitely help you find her.

590
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,340
Really?

591
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,340
But before that,

592
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,340
I have to get to know Mr. Yan

593
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,340
so that I can question him.

594
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,340
I wonder what Mr. Yan

595
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,340
likes to do.

596
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,340
I have only one hobby.

597
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,340
I like Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings.

598
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,340
You like Mr. Lin Yuan too?

599
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
Then we are really of the same interest.

600
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,340
Junior Sister Guan,

601
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
you like Mr. Lin Yuan too?

602
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,340
Do you like his

603
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,340
Yutang Fugui Chun?

604
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,340
That painting is simply magical.

605
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
It has a vivid meaning.

606
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,340
We don't have Yutang Fugui Chun.

607
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,340
But on my birthday,

608
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,340
my good sister

609
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,340
gave me a painting of Qu'an Qi Mei.

610
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,340
Is Mr. Yan interested in going to see it?

611
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,340
My house is nearby.

612
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,340
Okay, then we will...

613
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,340
We won't go.

614
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,340
I'm sorry to have disturbed you today.

615
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Thank you, Junior Sister Guan

616
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,340
and Chief Lu, for your kindness.

617
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,340
I'll visit you again some other day.

618
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,340
Mr. Yan,

619
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
where do you live now?

620
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,340
Qingfeng Inn.

621
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,340
You are new to the road

622
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,340
when you first came to the capital.

623
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,340
Why don't we take you back together?

624
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,340
Brother Lu, you...

625
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
I have nothing to do either.

626
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
Let's go together.

627
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,340
Boss.

628
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,340
Please take care.

629
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,340
Mr. Lin Yuan's painting

630
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,340
is more delicate and touching.

631
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,340
It seems to have many feelings.

632
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,340
It feels like

633
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,340
there are thousands of words to convey.

634
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,340
It feels like his painting is more vivid.

635
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,340
Everything in the world

636
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,340
belongs to his Majesty.

637
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,340
Junior Sister Guan is right.

638
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,340
He is a very good painter.

639
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,340
He is a very good painter.

640
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,340
Junior Sister Guan is right.

641
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
I always feel that

642
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
Mr. Lin Yuan's painting

643
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,340
is different from others.

644
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
Others say

645
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,340
that the art of painting is different.

646
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,340
But I think that

647
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,340
Mr. Lin Yuan's painting

648
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,340
is clearly more vivid

649
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
than the painting.

650
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,340
It's really a wonderful painting.

651
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,340
This is the painting

652
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,340
of the fallen ink and the painting of the ship.

653
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,340
Mr. Lin Yuan's memory

654
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
is not bad

655
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,340
to be called a painting of the painting.

656
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,340
It's wonderful.

657
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,340
What a good relationship.

658
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,340
Mr. Lin Yuan is so good at painting.

659
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,340
Thank you, Junior Sister Guan

660
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
and Mr. Lu

661
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,340
for playing with me in the capital.

662
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
Brother Lu,

663
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
I have something

664
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,340
to discuss with Mr. Yan.

665
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,340
Wait for me here.

666
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,340
I'll be back.

667
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Should I call you Mr. Yan

668
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,340
or Mrs. Yan?

669
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,340
Junior Sister Guan, I...

670
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,340
I guess

671
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
you don't want others

672
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,340
to know your identity.

673
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,340
I'll call you Mr. Yan.

674
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
You're dressed like this.

675
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
You must have some reasons.

676
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Yes.

677
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,340
Because my father

678
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
arranged a marriage

679
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,340
that I don't like.

680
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,340
So...

681
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Life is full of ups and downs.

682
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,340
There are always ups and downs.

683
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,340
But fortunately, you met me.

684
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,340
I'm here to tell people about it.

685
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,340
Maybe I can help you

686
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,340
with the things you like.

687
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Really?

688
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,340
You can really help me?

689
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,340
It's my duty

690
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,340
to help others to get married.

691
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,340
Besides,

692
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,340
we're so close.

693
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,340
I thought you were a man.

694
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,340
I was worried about you.

695
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,340
But now you're a woman.

696
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,340
I can take you to eat delicious food,

697
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,340
play with you

698
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,340
and travel around the capital.

699
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,340
Of course,

700
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,340
the most important thing

701
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
is to find the one you like.

702
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,340
Junior Sister Guan,

703
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
you're so nice.

704
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
I'm so lucky

705
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
to meet you

706
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,340
when I came to the capital.

707
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
But...

708
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,340
Can you promise me something?

709
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
What is it?

710
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
Just tell me.

711
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,340
As long as I can do it,

712
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,340
can you keep it a secret

713
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
that I'm a woman?

714
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Including...

715
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,340
the one outside?

716
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
Don't worry.

717
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,340
The first date is our quality.

718
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,340
It's late.

719
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
I'll come to you tomorrow.

720
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,340
Okay.

721
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,340
I'll wait for you.

722
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,340
Just call me Ake.

723
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,340
Ake.

724
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
Brother Lu.

725
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
Are you done?

726
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,340
Yes.

727
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,340
It's late. Let's go.

728
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,340
Let's go.

729
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,340
It's so dark tonight.

730
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
I'll sleep here.

731
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Mr. Lin Yuan,

732
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,340
where are you?

733
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
It's so dark.

734
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,340
Where should I start?

735
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,340
I'm so sorry

736
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,340
for our relationship.

737
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,340
And we're so distant.

738
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
I thought you were a man.

739
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,340
I was worried about you.

740
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,340
But now you're a woman.

741
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,340
I can take you to eat delicious food,

742
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
play with you,

743
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,340
and travel around the capital.

744
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,340
Of course,

745
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,340
the most important thing

746
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,340
is to find the one you love.

747
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,340
Junior Sister Guan

748
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,340
is very warm and interesting.

749
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
But I haven't been in touch with her for long.

750
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
I'm afraid I'll have to

751
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,340
know more about her.

752
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,340
But if she's really reliable,

753
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,340
that's good.

754
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
She has a friend

755
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
and can find Mr. Lin Yuan.

756
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
Mr. Lin Yuan,

757
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,340
I can find you.

758
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,340
Brother,

759
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,340
does Ake have many unsecured cases recently?

760
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,340
I didn't hear

761
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,340
about any unsecured cases.

762
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
No unsecured cases?

763
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Why do you keep coming out of the house?

764
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
Do we

765
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,340
care about Ake too much recently?

766
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
You care about Ake?

767
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
Nonsense!

768
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,340
You keep coming out of the house every day.

769
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,340
I'm not interested in Ake.

770
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,340
I'm not interested in Ake.

771
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,340
You're so annoying.

772
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
You're so annoying.

773
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
Nonsense!

774
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,340
You keep coming out of the house every day.

775
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,340
I don't know why you're so eager to sell the bottle.

776
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,340
I think Xibao Pavilion

777
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,340
is going to be my new home.

778
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,340
How can you talk to your brother?

779
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,340
Ake,

780
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,340
are you going out?

781
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,340
Yes.

782
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
Brother, I have something to do.

783
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,340
I'll go first.

784
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Okay, you're busy.

785
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,340
Mr. Yan.

786
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,340
Ake.

787
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Let's go.

788
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Today, I'll show you

789
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
the scenery of the capital.

790
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,340
Okay.

791
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
I like painting.

792
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,340
How about

793
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,340
we go to a flower shop first?

794
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
No problem.

795
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,340
I'm the best at shopping.

796
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,340
Let's go.

797
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,340
After the flower shop,

798
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,340
we'll go to the theater.

799
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,340
Brother,

800
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,340
that's not a good idea.

801
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
I'm not interested in it.

802
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
I'm not interested in it.

803
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,340
I'm not interested in it.

804
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,340
I'm not interested in it.

805
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,340
I'm not interested in it.

806
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,340
I'm not interested in it.

807
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
I'm not interested in it.

808
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Brother,

809
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,340
that man doesn't look like Lu Chi.

810
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
Who is this guy?

811
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,340
Why is he so close to Ake?

812
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,340
He doesn't look like Ake's guest.

813
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,340
Where is he going?

814
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Stop guessing.

815
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Let me see.

816
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
Is it because

817
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,340
he's a young man with a hidden heart?

818
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
This painting is good.

819
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,340
I like it too.

820
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,340
What kind of painting do you like?

821
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,340
I can introduce it to you.

822
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,340
Do you have Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings?

823
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
No.

824
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,340
The owner of this flower shop

825
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,340
is my old acquaintance.

826
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,340
The paintings they ordered

827
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,340
are all very good.

828
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,340
But Mr. Wang only likes to collect

829
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
small and heavy paintings.

830
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,340
There is no such famous

831
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,340
master like Mr. Lin Yuan.

832
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Mr. Yan,

833
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,340
you might as well take a look at the others.

834
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
By the way,

835
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,340
why didn't you see Mr. Wang today?

836
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
So the lady is

837
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,340
my old friend.

838
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,340
My wife is pregnant.

839
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,340
The owner is at home

840
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
taking care of her.

841
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,340
Mrs. Wang is pregnant?

842
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,340
Congratulations.

843
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,340
The owner of this flower shop

844
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
is really a person

845
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
who loves his wife.

846
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,340
They are together

847
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
because they are both

848
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,340
confident in their paintings.

849
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,340
How did you know about this, Ake?

850
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Because

851
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
I was the one who made them.

852
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,340
You are really amazing.

853
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,340
Since the owner and the lady

854
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,340
of this flower shop

855
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,340
are also a person who loves his wife,

856
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,340
and they are married by Ake,

857
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,340
then Mr. Lin Yuan and I

858
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,340
might really help us.

859
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,340
Ake, it's getting late.

860
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,340
Let's go eat something.

861
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,340
Okay.

862
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
What do you want to eat?

863
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,340
I'll be the host this time.

864
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,340
Let's go eat some special snacks.

865
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,340
Let's go.

866
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,340
Second,

867
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
do you think Ake

868
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,340
has a crush on someone?

869
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
That little white face?

870
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
Yes.

871
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,340
Look at them.

872
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,340
They are not shy at all.

873
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,340
They are talkative.

874
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,340
That guy is hitting me.

875
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
I'll hit him with my claws.

876
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Don't act rashly.

877
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
That guy Lu Chi

878
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
is in trouble now.

879
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,340
He is really a man

880
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
who loves his wife.

881
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,340
No, look.

882
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
Ake's taste

883
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,340
is getting more and more strange.

884
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
That guy is weak

885
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
and has no legs.

886
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
He looks worse than Lu Chi.

887
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
Yes.

888
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
He doesn't deserve Ake.

889
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,340
Brother,

890
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,340
are you still going to...

891
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,340
I'm not going to. Let's go.

892
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,340
Should we tell father?

893
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,340
Let's see first.

894
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,340
I have to report to the mountain chief

895
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,340
or something big will happen.

896
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,340
Mountain chief.

897
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,340
Mountain chief,

898
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,340
today Shi Mei Guan

899
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,340
went shopping with that Mr. Yan.

900
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,340
Ake is a good boy.

901
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,340
He has a friend who knows the way.

902
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
He doesn't need to be nervous.

903
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
But they don't look

904
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,340
like ordinary friends.

905
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
Today, Shi Mei Guan

906
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,340
went to the inn

907
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,340
to find that Mr. Yan.

908
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,340
They went to Yun Long Painting Shop together.

909
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,340
After they met,

910
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,340
they not only talked and laughed,

911
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,340
but also

912
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,340
hit Shi Mei Guan with their hands and feet.

913
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,340
The scene is really...

914
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,340
What did you say?

915
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,340
I said

916
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,340
two people are in the art gallery.

917
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,340
You are so good at it.

918
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,340
Why are you still talking?

919
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,340
Where are they now?

920
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,340
They should be in the snack street.

921
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,340
Mountain chief, wait.

922
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,340
Today when I was with Shi Mei Guan,

923
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,340
her two brothers were also with her.

924
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,340
But they are kind to Mr. Yan.

925
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,340
They also said

926
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,340
they are not as good as you.

927
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
What else did they say?

928
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,340
They also said

929
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,340
if Mr. Yan is not handsome,

930
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
he will not be able to be a good boy.

931
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
They also said

932
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
if Mr. Yan is not handsome,

933
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
he will not be able to be a good boy.

934
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
If Mr. Yan is not handsome,

935
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
he will not be able to be a good boy.

936
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,340
They also said

937
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,340
your rival is finally here.

938
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
My rival?

939
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,340
He is not worthy of me.

940
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
Let me do it.

941
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,340
Boss.

942
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,340
Okay.

943
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,340
A Ke, here.

944
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,340
You are always so polite.

945
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,340
You are always so polite.

946
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,340
You are always so polite.

947
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
You are always so polite.

948
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,340
A friend's heart is more precious than gold.

949
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,340
You don't have to take it to heart.

950
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,340
Mr. Yan is really a good person.

951
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,340
What is this?

952
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,340
It smells so good.

953
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,340
This is called a smile mark.

954
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,340
A smile mark.

955
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
Try it.

956
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,340
It's delicious.

957
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,340
Delicious.

958
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,340
There is something delicious over there.

959
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,340
Let's go and have a look.

960
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,340
Let's go.

961
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
No.

962
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,340
If I go after him,

963
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
how can I explain

964
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,340
why I am here?

965
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,340
A Ke,

966
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,340
will he think I am being too considerate?

967
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
Brother Lu.

968
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,340
Why are you here?

969
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
A Ke,

970
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,340
where have you been?

971
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
Why did you come back so late?

972
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,340
Did you go out with Mr. Yan again?

973
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,340
Brother Lu,

974
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,340
are you jealous?

975
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
But Mr. Yan is a lady.

976
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,340
Since I promised Mr. Yan to keep it a secret,

977
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
I can't tell Brother Lu about it.

978
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,340
What should I do?

979
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,340
Well,

980
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,340
Mr. Yan is new here.

981
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,340
He doesn't know much about the capital.

982
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,340
I saw a small landlady's house.

983
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
I took her to eat something

984
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,340
and just walked around.

985
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
I don't know much about the capital

986
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,340
even though I am new here.

987
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Why don't you take me...

988
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,340
Brother Lu,

989
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
it's getting late.

990
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,340
I'll take a rest.

991
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,340
You should go too.

992
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,340
You...

993
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,340
Lu Yi.

994
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,340
Yes.

995
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,340
Find out the origin of Yan Qiyue.

996
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,340
Don't worry, Mr. Yan.

997
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,340
I'll find out your love rival

998
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,340
for you.

999
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,340
You...

1000
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,340
Mr. Yan,

1001
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
wait for my message.

1002
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,340
Go.

1003
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,340
Qi Yue,

1004
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,340
I really admire you.

1005
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
You admire me?

1006
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,340
I admire people like you

1007
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
who pursue true love and dare to run away from marriage.

1008
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,340
I'm really impressed.

1009
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
Many people who are not in love

1010
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,340
are like you.

1011
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
You don't want to listen to your parents' arrangement.

1012
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,340
You just want to be with your beloved one.

1013
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,340
It takes a lot of courage.

1014
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,340
Brother,

1015
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,340
actually,

1016
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,340
I always think

1017
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,340
no one will support my idea.

1018
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,340
But after I met you,

1019
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,340
I found you are different from others.

1020
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,340
You are even different from other people.

1021
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,340
You really care about Xi Ke.

1022
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,340
You will work hard for the one you love.

1023
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,340
The biggest gain I made

1024
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,340
in the capital this time

1025
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,340
is that I met you.

1026
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,340
Actually,

1027
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,340
I just want to find someone who can be with me.

1028
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Like Mr. Lin Yuan.

1029
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,340
Mr. Lin Yuan?

1030
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,340
Have you seen him?

1031
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,340
No.

1032
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,340
Do you know him?

1033
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,340
No.

1034
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,340
Do you know his last name?

1035
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
I don't know all these.

1036
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,340
But I only know that I admire him.

1037
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
I know the happiness and sorrow in his paintings.

1038
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
He is the right person.

1039
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,340
Xi Yue,

1040
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,340
you don't know him.

1041
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,340
How do you know

1042
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
he is the right person?

1043
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,340
Actually,

1044
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
it's quite amazing.

1045
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,340
I accidentally

1046
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,340
got a painting of Mr. Lin Yuan.

1047
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,340
I was attracted by that painting at a glance.

1048
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,340
In that painting,

1049
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,340
I seem to

1050
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,340
see a lonely

1051
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,340
but interesting person.

1052
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,340
I have experienced

1053
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,340
that kind of loneliness.

1054
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,340
So I think I am like him.

1055
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,340
Xi Yue,

1056
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,340
I can understand

1057
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,340
all your heart and soul.

1058
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,340
But what if

1059
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,340
Mr. Lin Yuan has married his wife and has a child?

1060
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,340
What should I do?

1061
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,340
I will accept the fate

1062
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,340
and stop being obsessed with it.

1063
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
But A Ke,

1064
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
I have seen

1065
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
a few children's hearts

1066
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
in his paintings.

1067
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,340
He must be the same age as me.

1068
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,340
Xi Yue,

1069
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
these are all your guesses.

1070
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,340
No one knows

1071
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,340
what the real situation is.

1072
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,340
A Ke,

1073
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,340
I have studied

1074
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,340
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings carefully.

1075
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,340
I found that

1076
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,340
he has never painted a wife

1077
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,340
or a child.

1078
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
His character

1079
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,340
is so beautiful

1080
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
that I can't help but to think

1081
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,340
that the person

1082
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,340
in the painting

1083
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,340
is not from this dynasty.

1084
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,340
It must be from his imagination.

1085
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,340
Mr. Lin Yuan

1086
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,340
has never married his wife

1087
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,340
and has no children.

1088
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,340
So when he painted these,

1089
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,340
he was not willing to accept it.

1090
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,340
But

1091
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,340
let's not talk about

1092
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
where to find Mr. Lin Yuan.

1093
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,340
I think your idea

1094
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,340
is a little impulsive.

1095
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,340
A Ke,

1096
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,340
are you unwilling to help me?

1097
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
I'm not unwilling to help you.

1098
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,340
But

1099
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,340
we have to find Mr. Lin Yuan first

1100
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
and then talk about the future.

1101
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,340
This matter is a little complicated.

1102
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,340
You can't be too anxious.

1103
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,340
But I'm anxious.

1104
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,340
I want to know if that person

1105
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,340
is what I think.

1106
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,340
If I don't see him,

1107
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
I'll be sorry.

1108
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,340
Okay, okay, okay.

1109
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,340
I will definitely find a way

1110
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,340
to find this person for you.

1111
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,340
No matter what,

1112
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,340
let's find Mr. Lin Yuan first.

1113
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,340
After we find someone else,

1114
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,340
we'll talk about it.

1115
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,340
Okay.

1116
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,340
My Lord.

1117
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,340
How is it going

1118
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,340
with you guys

1119
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,340
to block the news

1120
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
about Princess Fan?

1121
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,340
My Lord.

1122
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,340
All the news

1123
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
have been erased.

1124
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,340
No one can find

1125
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,340
a single clue.

1126
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,340
As for the face

1127
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,340
of Princess Fan,

1128
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
I've sent someone

1129
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
to confuse the hall.

1130
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,340
Now,

1131
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,340
only you have

1132
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,340
the princess' portrait.

1133
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
Others can't find

1134
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,340
her news.

1135
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,340
What about you?

1136
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,340
Can't you find it either?

1137
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
I can't find it either.

1138
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,340
I can't find it either.

1139
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Then keep investigating.

1140
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,340
Yes.

1141
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,340
Tang Yuan.

1142
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,340
Princess Fan

1143
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,340
said before she left

1144
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
that she would never

1145
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,340
marry the emperor.

1146
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,340
She said she would come here

1147
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,340
to find a person

1148
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,340
named Mr. Lin Yuan.

1149
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,340
She said she would come here

1150
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,340
to find a person

1151
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
named Mr. Lin Yuan.

1152
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
The person named Mr. Lin Yuan?

1153
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
Since he's a fugitive

1154
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
and wants to marry someone,

1155
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,340
I think he will

1156
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
go to Guanmei Hall.

1157
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,340
Keep an eye on him.

1158
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,340
Yes.

1159
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,340
Fang Yuan.

1160
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,340
No matter what,

1161
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,340
you have to help me

1162
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,340
get Princess Fan

1163
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,340
and help me achieve my goal.

1164
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,340
Yes.

1165
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,340
Yes.

1166
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,340
Now

1167
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,340
I'm dressed as a man.

1168
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,340
What's there to be afraid of?

1169
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,340
Excuse me.

1170
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,340
Hello.

1171
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,340
Is there anything

1172
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,340
that needs help?

1173
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,340
Is there anything

1174
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,340
that's happened

1175
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,340
in Gaoyou State recently?

1176
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,340
The state is in peace these days.

1177
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,340
It's very fresh.

1178
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,340
That's good.

1179
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,340
That's good.

1180
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,340
It's strange.

1181
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,340
Why didn't Father

1182
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,340
send someone to find me?

1183
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,340
Did he give up

1184
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,340
the idea of having me marry him?

1185
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,340
Did he finally

1186
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,340
figure out my plan to leave?

1187
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,340
Then I'm much safer now.

1188
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,340
I don't have to pretend anymore.

1189
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,340
Brother Lu.

1190
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,340
Brother is here.

1191
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,340
Brother Lu.

1192
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Will you help me

1193
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,340
in everything?

1194
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,340
If you need me,

1195
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,340
I'll do anything.

1196
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,340
Then,

1197
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,340
can you help me find Mr. Lin Yuan?

1198
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,340
You...

1199
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,340
You want to find Mr. Lin Yuan?

1200
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,340
What?

1201
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,340
You don't want to help me anymore?

1202
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,340
Why do you want to find Mr. Lin Yuan?

1203
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,340
I want to show my true colors.

1204
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,340
Okay.

1205
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,340
I promise you.

1206
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,340
But you have to...

1207
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,340
I knew it.

1208
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,340
Brother Lu is the best.

1209
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,340
I know this encounter

1210
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,340
is the grace of fate

1211
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,340
Every time I see you

1212
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,340
I only have

1213
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,340
a cute stubbornness

1214
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,340
Although I can't remember

1215
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,340
the words

1216
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,340
I want to say

1217
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,340
I can't forget

1218
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,340
the love

1219
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,340
I want to give you

1220
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,340
I can't forget

1221
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,340
the love

1222
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,340
I want to give you

1223
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,340
I can't forget

1224
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,340
I can't remember

1225
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,340
every difficult day

1226
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,340
I can't forget

1227
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,340
the first time

1228
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,340
I saw you

1229
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,340
Even if this love is heartless

1230
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,340
and has no life

1231
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,340
no sun and no moon

1232
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,340
it doesn't matter if it's a storm

1233
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,340
As long as you are

1234
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,340
fearless and unwavering

1235
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,340
carefree and carefree

1236
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,340
and enjoy the relationship

1237
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,340
No matter the world or the world

1238
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,340
will there be any border

1239
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,340
I'm willing to

1240
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,340
protect you with my life

1241
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,340
Even if I can't

1242
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,340
love you as I love you

1243
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,340
I'm willing to

1244
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,340
love you with all my heart

1245
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,340
I'll only miss you

1246
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,340
all the time

1247
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,340
Even if the world or the world

1248
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:33,340
will be the same as before

1249
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,340
Please remember the time

1250
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:39,340
when we were young

1251
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,340
I don't want to

1252
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:48,340
part with you
