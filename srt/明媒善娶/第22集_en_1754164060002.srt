1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
bracelet

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The flowers are in the branches.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The strange years.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't know if you have a care.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Some people

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you want to repay

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But there is no way to do it.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A lifetime of love

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is the best way.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The End

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Zhu Xi, I'm now a new life.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Can be wrong

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Their skills

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
With my military secret scroll

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We want to fully play the ground floor of Qianya Mountain.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The eastern area is flat.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Not good for us

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Take a team of people to ambush this time.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Then attack

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Then attack

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Then the Yangzhuang defeated the enemy.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lead them to the west cliff.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Chase

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Go

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The rest of the people follow me out of the battle.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Set up a trap in the west.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Go

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Shoot

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Shoot

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Shoot

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Shoot

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Shoot

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Shoot

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Retreat

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Shoot

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Shoot

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Brother

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Shoot

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Shoot

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The mark was caught.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There is no law.

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll find them a theory.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Brother, don't be impulsive.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They are not afraid to catch people.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you think they will make sense?

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I have already passed this matter to the master.

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But the journey is long.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is the commander's office.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know if Ake can hold it.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to the commander's office now.

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If he dares to make Ake uncomfortable, I will be in a hurry.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't be impulsive.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There are two old and Qin.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You hurt yourself.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't you let everyone worry about you?

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Everyone, calm down.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The other party is obviously prepared.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And there are many people.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We can't be impulsive.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The commander's office is so strong.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But we can't just sit around and do nothing.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If we can give them some pressure.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Maybe there is a chance.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Even if we can't let Ake out.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But at least we can save them from danger.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How about this?

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll go to the government office and find Mr. Zheng.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Go to the government office and talk to him.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Good idea. Let's go.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Not enough. The deputy commander said he came here by order.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If someone really orders.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm afraid the government office can't interfere.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What should we do?

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If we can get Ake's previous guests.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And help him.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Maybe we can get Ake out of the prison.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We need someone to help us.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Boss Cheng.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Cheng Xiao Niangzi from Jiangning.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is the emperor's sister.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And...

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Xu Ao, the commander of the Jinqi department.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Is the emperor's subordinate.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
One of them is the emperor's son.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The other one is a high position.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If they come out.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We can save Ake from the prison.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay. I'll go to find Mr. Xu.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then I'll go to find Boss Cheng.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll go to get some money.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Lu Yi will protect the second son.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll tell you if anything happens.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, madam.

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There's one more thing I don't understand.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What did Ake do wrong?

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Ake is kind and innocent.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's a good guy.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
How could he do that?

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes. Ake is happy with the master.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He's sweet. How could he do that?

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's Wu An Hou.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What?

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He pretended to be Lin Yuan.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
To get close to me.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If Ake didn't expose him in time.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Anyway.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can think of the one who has a grudge with Ake.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's him.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He's from the headquarters.

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's possible that it's him.

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But we don't have any evidence.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ake once made Wu An Hou look bad

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
at Boss Cheng's invitation.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's possible that it's him.

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But Wu An Hou is a noble man.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He's good at military affairs.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If it's him. What should we do?

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Ake.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll find a way to protect you.

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wu An Hou took Ake away.

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What did you say?

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We don't know the reason.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's just a guess.

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We need your help.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mr. Xu.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
My sister offended Wu An Hou.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Wu An Hou was innocent.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He took my sister away.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Now I'm in a bad situation.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So I want to ask you for help.

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I have a clear picture.

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Please sign it.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Please sign it.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Help us.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What did Ake do?

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Is there any misunderstanding?

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Ake was caught by the Guards.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Please sign it

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
on the invitation.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll sign it.

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I believe Ake is innocent.

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Me too.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Me too.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Miss Yan and Ake are friends.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We should do our best.

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Not only the invitation.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If there's anything else

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
we can help.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We'll do our best.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Thank you.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Thank you.

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Go.

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Come.

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Help.

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm innocent.

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You can't judge me.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Guards are killing innocent people.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm innocent.

178
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I want to meet the judge three times.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I want to arrest Gao Yun Zhu.

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Come here.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Shi Fa Ke.

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Are you okay?

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You're a good man.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I knew it.

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm grateful to you.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Now your brother Lu

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
is in Qian Ya Mountain.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He saw Qian Ya Mountain

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
was destroyed.

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What can he do now?

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're a good man.

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You know it.

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Your Majesty.

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're so confident.

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I tell you.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
As long as you're against me

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you have to pay the price.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're so confident.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
God knows the fate.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Aren't you afraid of

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the future of the emperor?

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll let you stay.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll let you see

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
who's the real emperor.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Brother Lu left the capital at this time.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He must have done his duty.

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Your Majesty.

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You'd better think about

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
your way out.

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It depends on

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
whether your brother Lu

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
comes back to save you

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
or guard the last way out

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
of Qian Ya Mountain.

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
My Lord.

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Maybe brother Lu

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
will come to your room

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and talk to you.

220
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay.

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You just wait here

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
to reunite with your brother Lu.

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Go.

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't go.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Come back.

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If the emperor wants to

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
take the throne,

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
will brother Lu be in danger?

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Brother.

231
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Although we have

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
a lot of enemies,

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we have few people.

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If they don't retreat,

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
we have no chance.

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If we don't ask for reinforcements,

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm afraid we can't guard Qian Ya Mountain.

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No. If so,

239
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
it's a trap for Wu An Hou.

240
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If the emperor sends more troops,

241
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
the army in the palace will be empty.

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We can't give up now.

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
My Lord.

244
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The capital is worried.

245
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Wu An Hou

246
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
has caught the teacher and teacher.

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He's sent back to the capital to save the people.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Wu An Hou

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
is taking advantage of your absence

250
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
to help sister-in-law.

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Brother, what should we do?

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's go back and save sister-in-law.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No.

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can't go back now.

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Wu An Hou

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
caught A Ke as hostage.

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He wants to trap me.

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He wants to take advantage of Li Shen

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
to take Qian Ya Mountain's power.

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If I leave Qian Ya Mountain now,

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
A Ke will lose his value to Wu An Hou.

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He's the real danger.

263
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But brother, if you don't go back,

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
will sister-in-law misunderstand you?

265
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
She doesn't care about danger.

266
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I believe A Ke

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
will understand me.

268
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I wonder how brother is doing now.

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I am worried about him.

270
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No one can do anything.

271
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Brother.

272
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What should we do now?

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Brother.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Stay true to yourself.

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,000
From now on, I don't want to part with you.

276
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Qian Ya Mountain is not a good place.

277
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Li Yang will surely send someone to send a message to the Empress.

278
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Please send her to send a message.

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes.

280
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Chu Xin, send someone to send a message on the way back to the capital.

281
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Use the sword with the horse head to shoot them.

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Change the name of the letter secretly.

283
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Make sure that the Empress believes that Qian Ya Mountain has been taken.

284
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Qian Ya Mountain is not a good place.

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The food is ready to be loaded.

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Even if we have to contact with the outside world,

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
we can also use the resources on the mountain to do it ourselves.

288
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If we cut off the food supply of the Empress,

289
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
we can't fight anymore.

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
No.

291
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Please accept the trap of Qian Ya Mountain.

292
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
My Lord, do you have any good news?

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Qian Ya Mountain has been taken.

294
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's a pity that Mu Chi has escaped.

295
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But after he escapes,

296
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
he will definitely run to the Emperor's army.

297
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
As long as we follow him, we can know where the army is.

298
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Congratulations, My Lord, your great cause is about to be achieved.

299
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's go take a look.

300
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
See if that heart of yours can help us.

301
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's put it here.

302
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
My Lord, what tricks are you playing again?

303
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Now, Qian Ya Mountain has been taken by me.

304
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Your Brother Lu has also escaped.

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
As long as you are willing to take a letter

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and let him tell the Emperor where the army is,

307
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I will definitely help you.

308
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I will definitely help you.

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Let him tell the Emperor where the army is,

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I can spare the lives of you two.

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
My Lord, didn't you notice?

312
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
In Lu Chi's heart, it's not important at all.

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Look, it's been so many days.

314
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Have you seen a ghost shadow come to save me?

315
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Do you really think that I'm more important than the country's design?

316
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You don't eat, drink and get punished.

317
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Then you just wait to die.

318
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Let's go.

319
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Brother Lu.

320
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Second Brother, Tiantian.

321
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Brother, how is it?

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Great.

323
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Where are the others?

324
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Brother, don't worry.

325
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Lady Chen is willing to help. Everyone is willing to help.

326
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We're back.

327
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Xu Da'an is willing to help us.

328
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Great.

329
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
With His Majesty's sister,

330
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and so many people,

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
we can definitely save Ake.

332
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Then what are we waiting for? Let's go.

333
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Let's go.

334
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Open the door.

335
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Hurry and open the door.

336
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Open the door.

337
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Open the door.

338
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We have a request to appeal.

339
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We have a request to appeal.

340
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Open the door.

341
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
We have a request to appeal.

342
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Open the door.

343
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Open the door.

344
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Open the door.

345
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Open the door.

346
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Is this General's Office doing this on purpose?

347
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
If they don't open the door,

348
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
we can't do anything.

349
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Keep looking.

350
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't believe that no one will come out.

351
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Open the door.

352
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Open the door.

353
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
How dare you!

354
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
General's Office is heavily guarded. How can you do this?

355
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
We have a request to appeal.

356
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I am the commander of the Jinqin Bureau, Shen Xu.

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You have no evidence.

358
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You are now in the Guanmei Department of Justice.

359
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You must give us an explanation today.

360
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Otherwise, you will be released immediately.

361
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We still have the Chen Qingzhuang from the Guanmei Hall.

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Please release the innocent Guanmei Department of Justice immediately.

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Guanmei Department of Justice is innocent.

364
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Enough. Stop talking.

365
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Sir, you are the commander of the Jinqin Bureau.

366
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm afraid that you can't control our General's Office.

367
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Close the door.

368
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You guys...

369
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Close the door.

370
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I wonder what their obvious detestment

371
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
is for.

372
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The Jinqin Bureau and the General's Office are different.

373
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
They are both innocent.

374
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I have no relationship with Li Yang.

375
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm afraid that this time,

376
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
we can only wait for us to think of a solution.

377
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Anyway,

378
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
thank you, Sir Xu.

379
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Thank you for your help.

380
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It seems that we have to think of another way.

381
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You are welcome.

382
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
This is what I should do.

383
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The Shi Mei Pass is not only our friend,

384
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
but also the benefactor of my husband and wife.

385
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
How is Ake?

386
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Could it be that Marquis Wan...

387
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No.

388
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We shouldn't scare ourselves.

389
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The Chief hasn't sent us any news yet.

390
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I wonder how is the situation in Mount Qianya.

391
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Brother,

392
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
don't walk around.

393
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's annoying.

394
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm worried.

395
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I've been in a tight spot since I was a child.

396
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm so worried.

397
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
When did I suffer like this?

398
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm useless as a big brother.

399
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I should have stopped them

400
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and took Ake away.

401
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Brother.

402
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Brother.

403
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Brother, don't worry too much.

404
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
We have so many people to help us.

405
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Ake will be fine.

406
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Did Boss He think of a way?

407
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Not yet.

408
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I just think that

409
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
it's getting late.

410
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Everyone has worked hard.

411
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Go back and have a good rest.

412
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
We'll talk tomorrow.

413
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Boss He is right.

414
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We'll go back first.

415
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Let's go.

416
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Brother.

417
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Brother, please wait.

418
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Brother, what's the matter?

419
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Brother.

420
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll entrust you with everything.

421
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I hope you can take care of her for me.

422
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No.

423
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Why do you say that

424
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
so suddenly?

425
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
For me,

426
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Tiantian and Ake

427
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
are equally important.

428
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
To save Ake,

429
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll do my best

430
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
as long as there's a little hope.

431
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But I can't trust Tiantian.

432
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I will take good care of Tiantian.

433
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But what are you going to do?

434
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Don't worry, Brother.

435
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll take good care of Tiantian.

436
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And I'll help you

437
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
take care of Tiantian.

438
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

439
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I will.

440
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Thank you, Brother.

441
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Greetings, My Lord.

442
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Why do you want to see me?

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm not talented.

444
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But I want to help you.

445
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I hope I can help you.

446
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Help me?

447
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What do you want from me?

448
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The hundred-year-old symbol of Heji

449
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
is the lucky night left by my parents.

450
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
There are more than 30 branches in the capital.

451
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The whole year, the flow of water exceeds ten thousand liang.

452
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm here to congratulate you.

453
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I hope you can fulfill my wish.

454
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What do you mean?

455
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
My Lord,

456
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Ake and I have been childhood friends.

457
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I've always wanted to marry Ake.

458
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But Lu Zhi

459
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
took advantage of the good fortune

460
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and seduced Ake.

461
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
He not only took away Ake,

462
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
but also killed him.

463
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I don't want

464
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
a good result from him.

465
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So please give me

466
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
a chance

467
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
to help me take Ake back.

468
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It seems that you are

469
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
just trying to make a living.

470
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's rare that you are so kind and kind.

471
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Okay.

472
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Since you are so sincere,

473
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm most willing to

474
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
fulfill your wish.

475
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Thank you, My Lord.

476
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But I have a request.

477
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What else do you want?

478
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I hope you can

479
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
let me meet Ake.

480
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Ake has been spoiled since childhood.

481
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I wonder how he is doing in prison.

482
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
After I meet him,

483
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I will persuade him to give up Lu Zhi

484
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and let Shi family be the lord.

485
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You are really smart.

486
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay.

487
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I agree to your request.

488
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Arrange for them to meet.

489
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Thank you, My Lord.

490
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Mr. He, please.

491
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Mr. He, please.

492
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Brother Xian,

493
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
how did you get in?

494
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I was just passing by.

495
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I didn't see you.

496
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I saw you.

497
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I saw you.

498
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I saw you.

499
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I saw you.

500
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I saw you.

501
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I saw you.

502
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I saw you.

503
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I saw you.

504
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I saw you.

505
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I saw you.

506
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I saw you.

507
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I saw you.

508
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
How did you get in?

509
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Please let me talk to Ake alone.

510
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Of course.

511
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You are the lord's guest.

512
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You can't be late.

513
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Let's go.

514
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Ake, how are you?

515
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
How did you get in?

516
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
How did you become the lord's guest?

517
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Could it be

518
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
you got into Wu Anheng's trap?

519
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
My Lord is a wise man.

520
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
He knows the court well.

521
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
He treats the wrongdoers as his own.

522
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Why should I punish him?

523
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That wolf-like man, Wu Anheng,

524
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
is also a heartless man.

525
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
How could you curse him?

526
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Brother Xian,

527
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
you have disappointed me.

528
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Ake,

529
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
in my heart,

530
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
your safety is the most important thing.

531
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I have nothing to do with the country's affairs.

532
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I just need you to get out of there.

533
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
No need.

534
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I've been in prison for years.

535
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm used to it.

536
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I just didn't expect you

537
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
to have nothing to do with me from now on.

538
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Ake, listen to me.

539
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Go.

540
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Ake.

541
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Go.

542
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Ake, listen to me.

543
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Ake.

544
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm not a wolf-like man.

545
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I have something to ask you.

546
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Why do you have to answer me?

547
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I can only ask you this.

548
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's about Ake.

549
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What is it?

550
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I owe Ashan a favor.

551
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Ake has been targeted by Wu Anheng.

552
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
If he talks too much

553
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and doesn't know what to do,

554
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
please

555
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
take care of Ake for me.

556
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'll get him out.

557
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
No need to say.

558
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'll take care of him.

559
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'll take care of him.

560
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
At this critical moment,

561
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
you just need to say that I'll lead the troops

562
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
to attack Jingdu

563
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
and then protect Ake.

564
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Liu Zhishan and Liu Jingdu.

565
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
What should we do?

566
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
A big shot.

567
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
A big shot.

568
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You won't end well

569
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
if you follow Wu Anheng.

570
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Brother Lu will attack the army

571
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
soon.

572
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
At that time, Wu Anheng will be killed.

573
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You won't end well either.

574
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'll go.

575
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Ake,

576
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
don't be so stubborn.

577
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Lu Chi can't even protect himself now.

578
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Wu Anheng is the one who is destined to die.

579
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I think you are out of your mind.

580
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
This Shifake is really bad.

581
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I really can't figure out

582
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
what Lu Chi and He Kexian like about him.

583
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I don't want to hear it.

584
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Get out.

585
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I don't want to see you again.

586
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
As long as you listen to me,

587
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'll let you out.

588
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Don't think about it.

589
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Brother Lu will come to save me

590
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
soon.

591
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'll go.

592
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Greetings, My Lord.

593
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Mr. He,

594
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
you've met your beloved one.

595
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yes.

596
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Thank you for taking care of me.

597
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But Ake is still young.

598
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It will take some time

599
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
to accept this.

600
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But don't worry, My Lord.

601
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll try to persuade him.

602
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
By the way,

603
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Ake said Lu Chi will come soon.

604
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Please be prepared.

605
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Okay.

606
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I've received your kindness.

607
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Don't worry.

608
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
As long as Lu Chi dies,

609
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
you will definitely get the beauty back.

610
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Thank you for your compliment.

611
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Open the door.

612
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Open the door.

613
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Today is the day of the wedding.

614
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Please go back.

615
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We're here to take over

616
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He Ji's shop.

617
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Now this shop

618
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
belongs to His Lordship.

619
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
How...

620
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
How is that possible?

621
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Your contract is fake.

622
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
How dare you

623
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
slander His Lordship?

624
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
The contract is given by Mr. He

625
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
to show his loyalty to His Lordship.

626
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
How could you do this?

627
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
How could my brother

628
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
be the target of Marquis Wu'an?

629
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Believe it or not,

630
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
just go.

631
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What are you doing?

632
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Let go of me.

633
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Go.

634
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Go out of my shop.

635
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Go.

636
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Are you okay?

637
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Brother Chong Shan,

638
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
my brother said

639
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
he gave this shop to Marquis Wu'an.

640
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Don't be stubborn.

641
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Let's leave first.

642
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Go.

643
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Go.

644
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Go.

645
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Go.

646
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Go.

647
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Go.

648
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
No.

649
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I need to ask him.

650
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Tian Tian.

651
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Why did you stop me, Brother Chong Shan?

652
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You have to trust Brother Xian.

653
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
He will do this.

654
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
He must have his own reason.

655
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I trust my brother.

656
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Because I trust him,

657
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I know he will never

658
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
be the target of Marquis Wu'an.

659
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I need to ask him.

660
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
No.

661
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Tian Tian.

662
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Give Brother Xian some time.

663
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Trust me.

664
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You can't make up for it

665
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
if you go in now.

666
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Tian Tian.

667
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Move.

668
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Is he my father's man?

669
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm afraid.

670
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
No.

671
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
They are not my father's men.

672
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Get ready.

673
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Hurry.

674
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Hurry up.

675
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Young Master.

676
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Young Master.

677
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Young Master.

678
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Young Master.

679
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Young Master.

680
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Young Master.

681
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Young Master.

682
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Young Master.

683
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Hurry.

684
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Hurry.

685
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Thank you.

686
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Thank you, Young Master.

687
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Young Master.

688
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Marquis.

689
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Marquis.

690
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
A secret letter.

691
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Hurry.

692
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Marquis.

693
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And

694
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Lu Chi's personal belongings.

695
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm so lucky.

696
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm so lucky.

697
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Let me ask you.

698
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Is there any news

699
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
from the palace recently?

700
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Marquis.

701
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Recently,

702
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
that man didn't make any noise.

703
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I heard that

704
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
he often disappears

705
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
in the bedroom.

706
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm afraid

707
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
he knows

708
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
that his energy is running out.

709
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
He escaped

710
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
to save his life.

711
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
If so,

712
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
what are you waiting for?

713
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Pass my order.

714
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm afraid

715
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
he will be in danger

716
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
if he doesn't come out.

717
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Pass my order.

718
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Prepare to attack.

719
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Tonight,

720
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
we can only stay here for one night.

721
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Actually, I think

722
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
you are wronged.

723
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
How about I go around

724
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and see if there are any

725
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
farmhouses that can be built?

726
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
No need.

727
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I think

728
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
this place is good.

729
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
There are many fires.

730
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It can be used to warm up.

731
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And

732
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
you can talk to me.

733
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
By the way,

734
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
today,

735
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
it's Mr. Huang who saved me.

736
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Thank you.

737
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Miss Qi Yue,

738
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
you're welcome.

739
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
What are you thinking?

740
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm thinking

741
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that we are destined to meet.

742
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We meet each other

743
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and meet each other.

744
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I always think

745
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
that you

746
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
are always in my heart.

747
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I actually want to tell you...

748
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But

749
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
if one day

750
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
you find out that I'm not the real me

751
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
that you know,

752
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
but someone else,

753
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
what will you do?

754
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
If one day

755
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
you find out that I'm not the real me

756
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
that you know,

757
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
what will you do?

758
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I asked you first.

759
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Then I'll tell you.

760
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
No matter who I am,

761
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
you have to be careful.

762
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
No matter who I am,

763
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
to me,

764
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
you are Miss Qi Yue.

765
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's all my fault.

766
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I've got you in trouble.

767
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Otherwise,

768
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
you wouldn't have come to this place.

769
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But I'm willing to be in trouble for you.

770
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
What did you say?

771
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I said...

772
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Actually, I think this place

773
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
is pretty good.

774
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's light.

775
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It's good.

776
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
By the way,

777
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I forgot to ask you.

778
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Why do those criminals

779
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
keep chasing you?

780
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
To be honest,

781
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
actually,

782
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I escaped from home.

783
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You escaped?

784
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I didn't want to get married.

785
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So I escaped from home.

786
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Until I met A Ke.

787
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
He took me in.

788
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Will you...

789
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
No, no, Miss Qi Yue.

790
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I think we're more fated.

791
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I escaped too.

792
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Really?

793
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You escaped from marriage too?

794
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I...

795
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's not that simple.

796
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But A Ke once told me

797
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
that you won't be happy

798
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
if you don't marry the one you love.

799
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So,

800
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I think you're right.

801
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I once

802
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
read a painting of Mr. Lin Yue.

803
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
There's a sentence in it.

804
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
May I be like the stars and you like the moon.

805
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The night is shining and the fragrance is strong.

806
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Do you know what this painting means?

807
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I guess so.

808
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
The love grows stronger when you meet.

809
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The hate is gone when you don't meet.

810
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Let's go.

811
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I...

812
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'll go pick some firewood.

813
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'll go with you.

814
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
How are you, Junior Guards?

815
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm here to take good care of you.

816
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I wonder what's the matter with you today?

817
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm here to

818
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
take good care of you.

819
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm here to

820
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
take good care of you.

821
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm here to

822
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
take good care of you.

823
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm here today

824
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
to tell you something important.

825
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And it's a good thing.

826
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Good thing?

827
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Look carefully.

828
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
This is

829
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
the seal that Brother Lu carved for me.

830
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You recognize it?

831
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm here to tell you

832
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
that your Brother Lu Chi is dead.

833
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Isn't it a great thing?

834
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Don't lie to me.

835
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This seal

836
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
was found on Lu Chi's body.

837
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's not fake at all.

838
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So many things can prove the identity of the weapon.

839
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Brother Lu left this seal alone.

840
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Is he not here?

841
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Brother Lu must be safe now.

842
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Seal is a trick to deceive the Marquis.

843
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It can't be found by the Marquis.

844
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Junior Guards.

845
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Junior Guards.

846
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Please excuse me.

847
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I think Mr. He

848
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
loves you very much.

849
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You can think about it.

850
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
No?

851
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Get out.

852
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Get out.

853
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Believe it or not,

854
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'll send you and Lu Chi

855
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
to make a pair of dead enemies.

856
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You won't.

857
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You're really smart.

858
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You know I won't kill you.

859
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm still useful to you.

860
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So you should take care of yourself.

861
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Don't forget you still have

862
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
my father's seal.

863
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Qi Yuan.

864
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Wait for me.

865
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Go.

866
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Go.

867
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Go.

868
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Father.

869
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Did you see that?

870
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I can finally stand here

871
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
with a clear conscience.

872
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I can finally

873
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
have everything.

874
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Father.

875
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The world is still mine.

876
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yes.

877
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Long live the emperor.

878
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Long live the emperor.

879
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Marquis.

880
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Why are you here?

881
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Brother.

882
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You're really not sincere.

883
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Why am I here?

884
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
This is my bedroom.

885
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm not here.

886
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Where else should I be?

887
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You're the one

888
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
who led the army to attack

889
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and tried to rebel.

890
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
What's your crime?

891
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
What's my crime?

892
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What's my crime?

893
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
What crime do I have?

894
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Brother.

895
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Our victory and defeat are decided.

896
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Not to mention the palace.

897
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Even your throne is mine.

898
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It's not decided yet.

899
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I know this meeting

900
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
is the most beautiful thing

901
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
in the world.

902
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But I don't know

903
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
how to tell you.

904
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I don't know

905
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
how to tell you.

906
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I don't know

907
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
how to tell you.

908
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I don't know

909
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
how to tell you.

910
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I don't know

911
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
how to tell you.

912
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I don't know

913
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
how to tell you.

914
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I don't know

915
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I don't know

916
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I don't know

917
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I don't know

918
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
how to tell you

919
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I don't know

920
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I don't know

921
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I don't know

922
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I don't know

923
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't know

924
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
If you really like me

925
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm afraid I can't make you like the sky in the palm of my hand

926
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm afraid I can't make you like the sky in the palm of my hand

927
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I'm afraid I can't make you like the sky in the palm of my hand

928
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm afraid I can't make you like the sky in the palm of my hand

929
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I'm afraid I can't make you like the sky in the palm of my hand

930
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I'm afraid I can't make you like the sky in the palm of my hand

931
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm afraid I can't make you like the sky in the palm of my hand

932
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm afraid I can't make you like the sky in the palm of my hand

933
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm afraid I can't make you like the sky in the palm of my hand

934
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm afraid I can't make you like the sky in the palm of my hand

935
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I'm willing to part with you
