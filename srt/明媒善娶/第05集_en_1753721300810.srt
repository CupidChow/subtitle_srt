1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Go for it.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The flowers are in the branches.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The years are passing by.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't know why I'm missing you.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Some people want to repay you.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But they have no power.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A lifetime of love is the best way.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 18

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
After this event,

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I also know about Lun'er's identity.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Your marriage...

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Madam,

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I was so confused.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I pretended to be a robber.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just to get your approval.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But I don't know why.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I almost hurt Shao Heng and your life.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I know it's not sincere.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't dare to mention my marriage with Shao Heng.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I just hope you can forgive me.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Come.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't talk nonsense.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Those killers are so vicious.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They almost killed you.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How could they be the one you're looking for?

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The four who ran away,

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I hope they're the one he's looking for.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But it has nothing to do with him

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
who wants to kill us.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Madam.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Heng, you insisted on taking me to burn incense.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You've been acting strange all the way.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I guess you're involved in this.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Mother.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm not that stupid.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Lun'er is injured.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm afraid she can't drink water

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
or boil tea.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I think we should stop this tea house.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Mother.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How could you say that?

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I did it to save you.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm just trying to save myself.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't blame others.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't worry.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
My son is a little bit stupid.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He's a little bit naive.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But he's a little bit kind.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If he's not good to you in the future,

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll beat him for you.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mother.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You agreed?

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Go get the room ready.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Right.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Remember to go to the law firm.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You kids

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
discussed such a bad idea.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm not going to marry.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now everything is settled.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Get the wedding ready.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you, mother.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll go get ready.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's go.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let go.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're clumsy.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll take care of Lun'er.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You go do your business.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Brother Mu, I...

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I must have been too kind to you.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know how to repay you.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You know?

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll know if you tell me to.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If you don't want me to know, I'll pretend not to know.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But I'll keep

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
your kindness in my heart.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't want to be ungrateful.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's good that you forget.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Anyway, there's one more thing you have to promise me.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What?

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Can you two

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
stop playing tricks on me?

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
All of that is your life's gift.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Come on.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Qi Shaogeng, stop talking nonsense.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I didn't say anything nice.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm going to get married.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't you think it's like a dream?

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can give you a chance.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,680
Feel it.

106
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,360
No need.

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,880
It's a great honor

108
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,640
to have you and Sister Luan'er married.

109
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,160
What a pity!

110
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,400
But, Brother Lu,

111
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
you only acted in a few films.

112
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,800
Why did you do this to us?

113
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,760
Qi's family is a escort company.

114
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,440
They have some enemies.

115
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
It's not a rare event.

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,280
I guess so.

117
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,920
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
Anyway,

119
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,160
your marriage is done.

120
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,160
Mrs. Qi has been kind to us

121
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,120
and didn't blame us.

122
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,640
She even agreed to your marriage.

123
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Of course.

124
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Thanks to our daughter,

125
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,120
she risked her life to save my mother.

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,240
Of course.

127
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,720
The good plan of Shi Meiguan

128
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,040
is also a great achievement.

129
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,360
Don't mention it.

130
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,680
I don't dare to think

131
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,560
about my bad idea again.

132
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,080
Congratulations, Mr. Qi.

133
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,280
You're really

134
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,120
in good shape.

135
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,920
I think so, too.

136
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,240
You...

137
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,120
Thank you, Shi Meiguan.

138
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,560
Please help me with the wedding.

139
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,000
And give me a gift of three books and six films.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,600
Goodbye.

141
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Wait, Mr. Qi.

142
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,920
I have a favor to ask you.

143
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,520
Our Shi family

144
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,840
never stole your family's money.

145
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
My parents are still in prison.

146
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,720
I know you're the victim.

147
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,760
So are my parents.

148
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
So I beg you

149
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,080
to tell the truth in the General's Office

150
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,960
and release my parents as soon as possible.

151
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,240
I should.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm afraid

153
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,080
those bad guys are our real enemies.

154
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,720
Shi Meiguan is a kind and sincere person.

155
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,400
I've heard about Tao Meiguan.

156
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,680
I'll go to the General's Office now

157
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,560
and make sure your family is cleared.

158
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,280
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

159
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,560
I'll go get the wedding invitation and the wedding certificate now.

160
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,680
Lu Xiong.

161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,040
You...

162
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,040
You totally...

163
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,800
He's asking me to do these things.

164
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:26,760
Chu Dream.

165
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,760
My family is in prison.

166
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,240
How's about my family?

167
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,560
For lovers.

168
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,920
They keep the feeling of married life inside them

169
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,980
La pockets

170
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,460
any

171
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
Cross

172
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,300
What's wrong with you

173
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,360
Like you

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,240
What's wrong with you

175
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,100
Only you

176
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,340
can see

177
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,960
How

178
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,700
How

179
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
What do you think?

180
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,420
Aunt Deng,

181
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,060
you're so affectionate.

182
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,420
Don't call me Aunt Deng.

183
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,220
Call me Deng Shoumei.

184
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,860
Now I'm the Shoumei of Guanmei Hall.

185
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,100
I know.

186
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,300
If Guanmei Hall doesn't assign me a task,

187
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,540
I won't do it.

188
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,180
I can be the Chief of the Department of Justice.

189
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,580
Lady.

190
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,940
Lady.

191
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,140
I brought what you ordered

192
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,580
for Lady Shi.

193
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,420
Lady.

194
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,300
Good news and bad news.

195
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,260
Which one do you want to hear first?

196
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,340
Do you want to hear it now

197
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,540
or never?

198
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,460
Which one do you want to hear?

199
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,220
Good news is that

200
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,340
Tao and Shi's father

201
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,660
are about to be released from prison.

202
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,860
Bad news is that

203
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,660
the guard

204
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,460
has been forced to marry by courtiers

205
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,780
and has no time to do anything.

206
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,260
He ordered you to keep an eye on Marquis Wu'an.

207
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,100
Marquis Wu'an

208
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,260
will definitely tell the truth from Guanmei Hall.

209
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,980
Good news is good news.

210
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,540
But bad news is not bad news.

211
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,220
I'll definitely keep an eye on Guanmei Hall.

212
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Brother Lu.

213
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,380
Ke.

214
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,620
What did I buy for you?

215
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
Brother Lu.

216
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,060
You should have a good rest.

217
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,340
Did Ke meet any trouble?

218
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
Brother Lu.

219
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,220
I have good news

220
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,500
and bad news.

221
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,620
Which one do you want to hear first?

222
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,140
Which one do you want to hear first?

223
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,340
Of course I want to hear it first.

224
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,460
Brother Lu.

225
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,100
When my family was gone,

226
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,340
I met a good person

227
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,540
like you.

228
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,860
When my parents come back,

229
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,260
I'll tell them

230
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,540
to be your brother and sister.

231
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,060
I already have a brother and sister.

232
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,260
I don't want to have a sister anymore.

233
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
You don't want to?

234
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,180
That's true.

235
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,900
I'm a troublesome person.

236
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,300
I always cause trouble

237
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,540
and I always get people involved.

238
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,460
How about I remind you

239
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,460
my hobby?

240
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,700
I remember

241
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,740
helping people to have fun and having fun.

242
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,620
Brother Lu, look.

243
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,900
My good news is

244
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,180
that Deng Yi is on the post

245
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,620
without even looking at it.

246
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,460
The bad news is also

247
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,700
that Deng Yi is on the post

248
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,060
without even looking at it.

249
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
So,

250
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
what's the difference?

251
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,220
I just found out

252
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,660
that I always call him Deng Yi

253
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,980
but he never treats me as his niece.

254
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,500
I suspect that he has other motives

255
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,340
and has other intentions.

256
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,340
That's why he's so happy.

257
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,020
Do you trust me?

258
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,220
Of course I trust you.

259
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,620
Then don't worry about it.

260
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,260
I'll keep an eye on

261
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Deng Mei Guan's every move.

262
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
Really?

263
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,780
Won't it

264
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,740
delay Brother Lu's business?

265
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,940
Of course not.

266
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,300
Your business is my business.

267
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
Brother Lu.

268
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,540
What's your business?

269
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,940
Eating, drinking, having fun,

270
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
and helping people to have fun.

271
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,740
Forget it.

272
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,140
You can talk when you want to.

273
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
I'll go too.

274
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,540
Brother Lu.

275
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,460
You should have a good rest.

276
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,460
You don't have to accompany me.

277
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,340
That's another good thing about me.

278
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,940
Accompany me?

279
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Watch the fun.

280
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
Let's go.

281
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,340
What's wrong with me?

282
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,540
What am I thinking?

283
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,340
My face

284
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,140
must be red as a monkey's ass.

285
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,140
It's all Qi Shao He's fault.

286
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,340
He said he made me his wife.

287
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,540
I've made a promise.

288
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,140
Brother Lu and I are just good friends.

289
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,340
Don't think too much about it.

290
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
You can't talk like that.

291
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,740
I won't talk to you.

292
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,740
You'll be embarrassed.

293
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
You're a bad daughter.

294
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,940
You'll be embarrassed.

295
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,340
The only daughter of the Liu family

296
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,740
was born in Liu's Mansion in the west of the capital.

297
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,940
Her surname is Luan Er.

298
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,540
She's 18 years old.

299
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,740
Her mother is a noble.

300
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
All right.

301
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
Don't read it.

302
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Mrs. Qi.

303
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,740
Are you going to change your mind

304
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,140
or did I make a mistake?

305
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
Mother.

306
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,940
Why don't you read it?

307
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,740
to fulfill my wish.

308
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,980
Madam, just tell me.

309
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,500
As long as I can do it,

310
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,820
I'll do as you wish.

311
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,260
After the official marriage ceremony,

312
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,220
when will the wedding be held?

313
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,060
After the ceremony,

314
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,380
we'll exchange the marriage papers.

315
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,180
The marriage papers will be shared

316
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
and the wedding will be held

317
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,500
on the day of the selection.

318
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,340
Then the wedding will be held.

319
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,420
On the day of the selection?

320
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,740
Then tomorrow is the wedding.

321
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,940
The marriage papers

322
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,020
have been approved long ago.

323
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,380
You can take them today.

324
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,860
You can exchange them tomorrow at noon.

325
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,260
You can get married at night.

326
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,700
Tomorrow?

327
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,900
So soon?

328
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,460
Well,

329
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,940
isn't the official marriage ceremony allowed?

330
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Not really.

331
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,060
It's just a matter of

332
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,460
making some seal.

333
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,060
But the wedding preparations...

334
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,980
I've prepared

335
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,780
the wedding gifts for over ten years.

336
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,940
The wedding gifts are all ready.

337
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,180
The wedding gifts are also ready.

338
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,660
You can get married

339
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,220
only after you marry a woman.

340
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,100
I don't want to

341
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,900
delay it for a day.

342
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,340
Come on.

343
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,820
As long as you don't break the wedding ceremony,

344
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,980
you can get married with a decent manner.

345
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,700
I don't have any other requirements.

346
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,500
Please.

347
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,700
Mrs. Qi, I...

348
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,820
Ke.

349
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,340
Since Mrs. Qi has made up her mind,

350
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,180
why don't we go to the teahouse

351
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,700
and ask Mrs. Liu?

352
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,420
Let's go.

353
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,380
Let's go.

354
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,380
Go.

355
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
The wedding is arranged by both parties.

356
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,100
Everything is fine.

357
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,820
The only thing that's not right

358
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,380
is that the wedding will be done too soon.

359
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,700
Would you like to do it?

360
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,700
Mr. Luo and Mr. Qi are in love.

361
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm willing to do it.

362
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Then let's

363
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,500
check our dowry.

364
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,180
Wait a minute.

365
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,780
Rui Ling,

366
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,780
The keepers'

367
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,780
hand-held。」

368
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,340
Shiathy stationed here.

369
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,380
This is my dreaming city啊?

370
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,340
Is there any

371
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,360
real estate?

372
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,060
How could his reason

373
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,940
spare him money

374
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,340
to build a grand gate?

375
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,660
But, I have to give her all the money to help me.

376
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
I...

377
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
Father.

378
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
I'm useless.

379
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,700
I'm so rich.

380
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,300
I don't have the guts to let her be so generous.

381
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,500
Father, you're sick. You should try your best to cure yourself.

382
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
I only have gratitude towards you.

383
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Why should I feel that you're useless?

384
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,900
Then, what should I write in my letter?

385
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,300
This is a letter of etiquette.

386
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,900
Don't forget that the one that Madam Qi hates the most

387
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,700
is the one who made a fool of herself.

388
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,100
But Madam Qi doesn't like to lose her etiquette.

389
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,300
This is a letter to her.

390
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,100
I'm already satisfied with your approval.

391
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,900
I don't want to lie to deceive you.

392
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,300
I'll ask the guard to write a letter of etiquette.

393
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,300
My family background is like this. You don't need to change it.

394
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,100
You don't need to cover for me.

395
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,700
I didn't marry or beg for the marriage of the Qi family.

396
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,100
I only ask for the true heart of each other.

397
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,500
Brother Lu really helped me fix it.

398
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
My ancestors, I came in through the wall.

399
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I ask the ancestors to help me.

400
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
The Qi family is so rich.

401
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,900
They gave me a gift that is longer than me.

402
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,700
But in Sister Lun'er's house, there is only 7 taels of silver.

403
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,900
There is only 7 taels of silver.

404
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,700
Not to mention that the door is right.

405
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,300
Even the son of the Ban family can't stand on the edge.

406
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
But Sister Lun'er is a good girl.

407
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,500
When I was exchanging the gift, I said how to operate it.

408
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
It can either ruin the reputation of the Qi family

409
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,300
or make Sister Lun'er not lose face in the family of the woman.

410
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,900
It can make this marriage happen.

411
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,100
Ake.

412
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,100
Brother Lu, why are you here?

413
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,900
I brought food for you.

414
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
I'll leave with your family first.

415
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,700
Brother Lu, let me ask you.

416
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
If you also like a girl like Sister Lun'er,

417
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,100
a poor and unmarried girl, what would you do?

418
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,100
What I like is a person.

419
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,500
What does marriage have to do with her marriage?

420
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Also, if you like a person, but she can't get a dowry,

421
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,100
will you marry her?

422
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,900
Yes. I have promised my little brother.

423
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,700
As long as she appears and has no dowry,

424
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,500
I will follow the agreement.

425
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,900
I only ask for one person.

426
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,300
Whether she has a dowry or not, I will not leave her.

427
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,300
That's good.

428
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,100
That's what I think.

429
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,900
But a woman doesn't have a dowry.

430
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,500
Even if she is a thousand years old, she can still kill Sister Lun'er.

431
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,700
And Madam Qi has already let her in.

432
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,300
She only has one request. She wants a dowry.

433
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,500
Just like this cake.

434
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,900
We'll buy it for you.

435
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,700
When you eat it, I'll open it.

436
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,900
Do I still want your money?

437
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,700
You give me a cake. I'll open it for you.

438
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,300
I understand.

439
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,100
Sister Lun'er, don't be so modest.

440
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,100
And don't marry Qi Shaohe.

441
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,100
We can exchange our gifts for equal things.

442
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,300
The most equal and the most unmarried in the world is the one who is the most beautiful.

443
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,500
If a person's heart is sincere, and a person's heart is pure,

444
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,900
it is the best way to be together.

445
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
Ake is indeed smart.

446
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,100
He is very smart.

447
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Ake! Ake!

448
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Where are you?

449
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,500
My parents are back.

450
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Brother Lu, you go first. I'll go find you later.

451
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,900
I'll go find you later.

452
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,700
I'll go find you later.

453
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,500
I'll go find you later.

454
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,300
I'll go find you later.

455
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,300
I'll go find you later.

456
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,300
No, no.

457
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,300
Is Ake in there? Let's go take a look.

458
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,900
Ake! Ake!

459
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,300
Ake! Ake!

460
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,900
You're back!

461
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
My precious daughter.

462
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,100
Let me take a good look.

463
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,500
Daughter, I feel like you've lost weight or...

464
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,700
You've gotten taller.

465
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,700
Really?

466
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,500
Don't be so blind.

467
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,900
You're the one who's lying.

468
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,500
Ake isn't thin or tall.

469
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,700
He's just pretty.

470
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,100
Brother is right. Our Ake is even cuter.

471
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Mother.

472
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Mountain Master, I received news.

473
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,100
Marquis Wu An's steward just went to the General's Manor to meet Li Ang.

474
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,700
Then he went to Guanmei Hall.

475
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,500
It seems like he's trying to force Deng Weiguan to do something.

476
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
It's Li Ang again.

477
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,500
I think Marquis Wu An should stop chasing Qi Shaoheng.

478
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,300
And go find Li Ang to be the new head of the law.

479
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,900
It seems like he's going to do something new again.

480
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,700
Mountain Master, you know that too?

481
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,100
Continue to investigate the news.

482
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,900
Report to me as soon as you get any news.

483
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Yes.

484
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,300
I'll keep an eye on Guanmei Hall.

485
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,100
He's obviously trying to keep an eye on the missing girl.

486
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,500
What did you say?

487
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,300
Nothing.

488
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Mother, the General's Manor has released you.

489
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,100
Tomorrow, can you go back to Guanmei Hall?

490
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,900
This is a report for the future trial.

491
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,500
You don't need to report after the escape.

492
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,700
But before the case is solved,

493
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,500
you need to be confined to the capital. You can't escape.

494
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
If you have any clues,

495
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,100
you can come to the General's Manor to assist the investigation.

496
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
We were innocent.

497
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,300
Sir, you don't need to pay us back.

498
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,500
You even detained us in the capital.

499
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,100
How can you call my wife a rebel?

500
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Let me tell you, we can't sign this document.

501
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,300
Innocent?

502
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,700
You're only called innocent after you've investigated it.

503
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,900
As for when to investigate, I don't know.

504
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,300
You can sign it.

505
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Then send this to the bottom.

506
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
General, wait.

507
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
I'll sign it.

508
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,900
Madam, you can't be so muddled.

509
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,500
If you sign this document,

510
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,300
you're a suspect.

511
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,900
You're the one who's in charge.

512
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Husband,

513
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,300
all three of our children are waiting for us to go back.

514
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,500
Especially Ake.

515
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
He's a girl and he's out for so long.

516
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,900
I'm really worried.

517
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,500
Madam.

518
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Ake, I just got back.

519
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
I want to rest for a few more days.

520
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,300
I won't go to the hall for now.

521
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,700
But I really didn't expect

522
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,300
you would protect the ancestral hall so well.

523
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,100
Yes.

524
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,300
I'm really happy.

525
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,100
I thought the ancestral hall might be ruined by those people.

526
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,500
It's really good.

527
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,100
Mother, this is what I should do.

528
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,100
You said I'm the best heir.

529
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,700
By the way, mother, look.

530
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,700
When did you send the snacks?

531
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,300
We three have been bothering the He family for so long.

532
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,700
We should thank them.

533
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
No.

534
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Brother Lu has been with me.

535
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,300
But how can we say that?

536
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Forget it.

537
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,700
I'll find a chance to invite him to our home and tell him in person.

538
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,300
Qi Shao Heng?

539
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
Yes, mother.

540
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
I've made Qi Shao Heng's beauty.

541
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,900
I asked him to go to the General's mansion to talk to you.

542
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,900
Now it's time to say goodbye.

543
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,500
You did a good job.

544
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,700
I'm proud of you.

545
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,900
Mother, you should rest well.

546
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Before you go back to the temple, I'll do my best.

547
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
I won't let you down.

548
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,700
You guys can leave now.

549
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,700
I have something to talk to Ake alone.

550
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,900
No.

551
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,900
Okay.

552
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,100
Let's go.

553
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,900
Go.

554
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,100
You guys go too.

555
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,100
Brother, the snacks are not from He family.

556
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Not from He family?

557
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,700
So there are outsiders coming to our home recently.

558
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,500
Yes.

559
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Who could it be?

560
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,700
Who could it be?

561
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,100
Ake.

562
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,700
I won't go to Guanmei Hall anymore.

563
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,500
From now on, this ancestral hall

564
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,900
and the most beautiful name in the world

565
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,100
will be entrusted to you.

566
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,300
Mother, why is that?

567
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,900
I've already signed the contract.

568
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,900
I won't interfere in Guanmei Hall's affairs for now.

569
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,500
But don't worry.

570
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,300
No matter what you do, I will support you.

571
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,900
I will support you.

572
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,500
Mother.

573
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Come, open it.

574
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,700
Mother, this is...

575
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
This dress

576
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,900
was originally intended to be passed on to you when you are the best in the world.

577
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,500
Then maybe, it's that time now.

578
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
You wear this dress

579
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,100
and host the wedding for Qi Shao Heng.

580
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Mother, I will definitely not disappoint you.

581
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,100
I will definitely not disappoint you.

582
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,700
So beautiful.

583
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,900
So beautiful.

584
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
So beautiful.

585
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
So beautiful.

586
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
So beautiful.

587
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,900
So beautiful.

588
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
So beautiful.

589
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
So beautiful.

590
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
So beautiful, right?

591
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Give her a round of applause.

592
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,900
Brother Lu.

593
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Brother Lu.

594
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,500
Ake, you look really good today.

595
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,100
Really?

596
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,700
Thank you, Brother Lu. My mother is back.

597
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,900
I plan to invite you to my house to be a guest

598
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,500
and introduce you to my family.

599
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,900
Really?

600
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,300
You are my savior.

601
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,500
I plan to tell them about the matter of the General's Office.

602
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
I also plan to say...

603
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,700
So it's about this matter.

604
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,100
I know.

605
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,500
It's not good for too many people to know about the General's Office.

606
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Brother Lu, let me ask you again.

607
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,900
You really don't plan to be my sworn brother?

608
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,300
I don't want to.

609
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,700
I'll just pretend that you didn't say it. I'll pretend that I didn't hear it.

610
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,500
What did I say wrong?

611
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,900
What's wrong?

612
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,300
Your two brothers are here.

613
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,500
Oh no, my two brothers have a bad temper.

614
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,100
You are just thinking about my family's future. You won't listen to anything I say.

615
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,100
You are just going to fly away.

616
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,700
Who are you?

617
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,300
I am Lu Chi. I live next door.

618
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,700
Come and help me.

619
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,900
Helping by the wall?

620
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,900
That's not necessary.

621
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,300
Ake, how do you know such a little, little disciple?

622
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,700
Brother, you are fierce.

623
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,500
Ake, I am not fierce to you. I am fierce to him.

624
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,100
This kid is so sneaky. He's not a good person at first sight.

625
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,900
How do you know he's not a good person?

626
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,900
In the days when you were not here, he was the one who helped me fix the hall.

627
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,900
He was the one who got the marriage of Qi Shao Heng and saved me from the bad guys.

628
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,700
Look at his wound and you are talking.

629
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
You guys are still following the rules.

630
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,100
You can't help me with anything.

631
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,900
I am the only one who is handling the family affairs.

632
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,100
Ake, your two brothers are helpless.

633
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,900
They didn't mean to.

634
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,100
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

635
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,500
Brother Lu is still speaking for you.

636
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,700
It's all my fault.

637
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,500
It's all your second brother's fault.

638
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Your second brother's fault.

639
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
I will let you go today.

640
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,900
Brother Lu, I am going to the He family now.

641
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,100
Please go to the Xibao Pavilion and ask Manager Li to come.

642
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,300
We will meet at the door of Qi Shao Heng's house.

643
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Manager Li? I can also go?

644
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Brother, go to the He family and ask Tian Tian to come to help us.

645
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Okay, I will go to the He family now.

646
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,300
Let's go.

647
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,700
Brother Lu, I have a door.

648
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
I can go through the door.

649
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,100
Okay.

650
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
I can go through the door.

651
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
I can go through the door.

652
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,300
Seeing how my second brother is looking, I have already done half of it for you.

653
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,100
You are not going to embarrass Tao Yi.

654
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,900
Of course, I won't.

655
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,100
I know that our Tian Tian is the best. Thank you.

656
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,500
Dear fellow villagers,

657
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,700
Miss Lu Er has specially invited the He Ji Bings to distribute sweets and cakes.

658
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Everyone can also invite some friends and relatives to enjoy the family's happiness.

659
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,100
A'Kao, did you invite me here?

660
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,900
Why did you become Lady Liu Xia?

661
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,100
What do you want to do again?

662
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,700
This is a wedding. Even though it's a long distance,

663
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,900
Brother Xian, I invited you here on behalf of Sister Luan Er.

664
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,900
Your family's wedding sweets and cakes are the best in the capital.

665
00:30:49,900 --> 00:31:09,340
Anyone who marries can get your exclusive

666
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,100
I'll take 20 taels from him.

667
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,300
If this continues,

668
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,300
our He Ji will soon have a day to feed A'Kao.

669
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,500
Tian Tian, I gave my second brother to you.

670
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
What else do you want?

671
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,100
My second brother is willing to help me.

672
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,100
Tian Tian, money can't be given to A'Kao.

673
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,300
I'll do whatever A'Kao asks me to do.

674
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,900
He has his own reason.

675
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,100
Why do you ask so many questions?

676
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,300
Which ones do you want?

677
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,100
These ones, right?

678
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,900
The Jin family's daughter, Liu Luan Er,

679
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,100
invites everyone to eat cakes.

680
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,900
Come, come, come. We all have some.

681
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,500
Liu Luan Er, I know her.

682
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,100
She's a very gentle lady.

683
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,900
Please give her a few more beautiful words.

684
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,300
Of course.

685
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
Everyone, don't be shy.

686
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,900
Slowly, slowly. We all have some.

687
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,700
Brother Lu, Sister Pan Er, you're finally here.

688
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,500
I have one more favor to ask of you.

689
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
What is it?

690
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,700
When Mrs. Qi comes out later,

691
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,100
please help me praise Liu Luan Er and Mrs. Qi.

692
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,100
You must make Mrs. Qi happy

693
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,300
and make her feel proud.

694
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,100
I'm at your disposal.

695
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,900
I'll do my best.

696
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,900
Come, come, come.

697
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,700
Sister Pan Er, my parents are back.

698
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,100
If Brother Lu is in your Xibao Pavilion,

699
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,300
and he can't get any money,

700
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,700
don't make things difficult for him.

701
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,900
Come find me. I'll help him.

702
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,300
Little lady, when Brother Lu is free,

703
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,300
he often comes to Xibao Pavilion to help me.

704
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,700
I'm willing to help you.

705
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,700
There's no need for us to see each other.

706
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,700
Who's talking behind my back?

707
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
You're so annoying.

708
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,700
No, no, no.

709
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,300
Why is this?

710
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,100
Find an outsider to come here.

711
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Who's an outsider?

712
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,900
This...

713
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,300
What happened?

714
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,900
Why aren't you going to marry him?

715
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,300
Guan Mei Ting, Mei Guan Shi, and Fa Ke came to his house today.

716
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
They're going to send a message to the young lady.

717
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
They're going to return all the betrothal gifts.

718
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,500
He won't take any of them.

719
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,900
Return? Why?

720
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,700
But Luan Er thinks there's too little betrothal gifts.

721
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,700
If he has other demands, I'll just accept them.

722
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,900
Don't worry, Madam. Let me explain.

723
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Sister Luan Er said that as long as he wants the same betrothal gifts,

724
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,100
if he gets the same betrothal gifts, he won't take any of them.

725
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,100
Junior Mei Guan, what does Luan Er want?

726
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,500
I'll immediately send a message to him.

727
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,900
You want another one?

728
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,300
Could it be that Luan Er hates me for being a fool,

729
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,300
so he deliberately...

730
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,900
Sister Luan Er said that

731
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,900
as long as he truly loves you,

732
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,300
he'll accept any betrothal gifts.

733
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,300
I knew it.

734
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,700
Luan Er is a kind-hearted young lady.

735
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,100
How could she be so greedy?

736
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,500
So it's for your true feelings.

737
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,900
I've always had true feelings.

738
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,300
I've already written the betrothal gifts.

739
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,100
If you're willing to sincerely ask for the betrothal gifts,

740
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,300
just put the handprint on it and the betrothal gift will be done.

741
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,100
Okay.

742
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
Is Junior Mei Guan joking?

743
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,900
If you're willing to sincerely ask for the betrothal gifts, how can she be reasonable?

744
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,500
That's right. If a man is willing to sincerely ask for the betrothal gifts,

745
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,900
then a woman should be reasonable to be able to match him.

746
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,900
Sister Luan Er said that she's willing to sincerely ask for the betrothal gifts,

747
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,900
she's kind-hearted and loyal.

748
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,100
She's willing to entrust her whole life to you and Childe Qi.

749
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,100
We'll share our life and death together. We won't change.

750
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,300
Oh my god. Mrs. Qi is a kind-hearted and compassionate person.

751
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,900
She deserves such a kind-hearted daughter-in-law.

752
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,300
She doesn't look down on her family and her money.

753
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,300
This is a great fortune for the Qi family.

754
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
Am I right?

755
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,500
Yes.

756
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,100
Mrs. Qi is the kind-hearted and compassionate person.

757
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
She will be happy to have a father like her.

758
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,500
Congratulations, Mrs. Qi, you have a father like her.

759
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Congratulations, Mrs. Qi, you have a father like her.

760
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Congratulations, Mrs. Qi, you have a father like her.

761
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,500
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

762
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,100
As everyone said, my son and Luan Er are a perfect match.

763
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
Son, what are you waiting for?

764
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,700
Hurry and go get Luan Er back.

765
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,900
I'll wait for you to win back our new wife.

766
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,500
Great!

767
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,500
Congratulations.

768
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,900
You worked so hard!

769
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,300
We'll support sadness one day.

770
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:37,020
It must be a concert in A Year Green throat

771
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,580
akeeper

772
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,620
A closes

773
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,460

point

777
00:36:50,100 --> 00:37:01,140
So

778
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,500
The groom is Qi Shaoheng, the bride is Liu Guan'er.

779
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,340
Hurry and get married!

780
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,960
Luo'er, I'm here to pick you up.

781
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,280
Xiao Hoo, you say that I'm質ocratic?

782
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,620
We aren't.

783
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,200
You're just begrulous!

784
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,500
You're just begrulous!

785
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,940
Xiao Hoo,

786
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,420
I love you more than anything else in this world.

787
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,600
Open your eyes!

788
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,380
Open them!

789
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,640
What is it?

790
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:38,440
bright

791
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:38,680
right

792
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,960
right

793
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
let's do it

794
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,140
They definitely have a distance

795
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,300
I'll tell you

796
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,340
let's go

797
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,380
Light

798
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,840
So embarrassed

799
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,680
do it

800
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,680
Shimei Guan, now you can really take responsibility

801
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,120
for the reputation of the eight words of the word

802
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,280
to make a match and to make a match.

803
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,720
I can really take responsibility.

804
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,920
How can I complete it if I can't make it in several times?

805
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,360
How can I complete it if I don't believe in the conscience of the heaven and the earth?

806
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,160
Yes, although Shimei Guan is a wise person,

807
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,800
he has the style and ability to handle the match.

808
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,600
The world's number one match, even if you can't make it today,

809
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,600
you will definitely make it in the future.

810
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,320
Ok, ok, ok.

811
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,480
For getting back,

812
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,160
I

813
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,800
want to beALLkeeper

814
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,440
Way

815
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,160
What way

816
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,800
Brother He is drunk.

817
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,240
Send him back.

818
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,760
Yes.

819
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Brother He.

820
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,720
Let's go, Brother He.

821
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,840
Don't pull me.

822
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,640
Don't.

823
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,600
What?

824
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,880
Call Brother He here.

825
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,480
I'll wait for him over there.

826
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,640
Brother He.

827
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,840
Brother Lu, it's fun.

828
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,480
Brother Lu, it's fun.

829
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,720
Brother Lu, it's fun.

830
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,920
Brother Lu, it's fun.

831
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,280
Brother Lu, it's fun.

832
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,800
He's drinking here secretly.

833
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,680
Where's Brother Xian?

834
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,880
He asked me to come here.

835
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,040
Why is he gone?

836
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,200
Ke.

837
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,520
You're drunk, right?

838
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,520
Brother Lu.

839
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,360
Do you know?

840
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,720
Everyone praises me.

841
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,800
They say I'm the most beautiful girl in the world.

842
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,520
I'm not happy.

843
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,040
How can I be willing to give up?

844
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,960
Ke.

845
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,280
You look so beautiful tonight.

846
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,200
Really?

847
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,960
Yes.

848
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,720
No.

849
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,040
You don't have to help me.

850
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,000
I can stand.

851
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,880
Brother Lu.

852
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,160
Look.

853
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,200
My clothes look good, right?

854
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,920
My mom gave it to me.

855
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,280
From now on,

856
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,200
I'm the best of the family.

857
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,080
Are you happy now?

858
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
Of course I'm happy.

859
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,920
I've never been so happy.

860
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm happier than I am when I bought Mr. Lin Yuan's painting.

861
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,360
It's so happy to be a good matchmaker.

862
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,760
Why didn't I feel it before?

863
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,880
I wasted so much time.

864
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,600
I should have done so many makeups.

865
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,840
Brother Lu.

866
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,520
Cheers.

867
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
Come on.

868
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,040
Ke.

869
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,680
You...

870
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,520
I've decided.

871
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,080
From now on,

872
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,960
I'll be a good matchmaker.

873
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,560
I'll be the pillar of the Shi family.

874
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,240
I'll make all my friends

875
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,040
be loyal to me.

876
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,840
I'll find happiness.

877
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,920
Brother Lu.

878
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,720
Come on.

879
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,440
Drink it.

880
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,560
I've had it. Be good.

881
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,520
Ke.

882
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,920
Ke.

883
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
Brother Lu.

884
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,480
I have a question.

885
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,480
Does Ke like you

886
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,880
so much?

887
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,280
He won't.

888
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,360
Why?

889
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
Because

890
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,040
I'm his father.

891
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,800
You're the

892
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,720
distinguished person of Bai gaps.

893
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,160
I'm the owner of the house.

894
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,480
My neighbor is a rich man.

895
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,040
Brother Lu is so rich.

896
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,720
How can I repay you?

897
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,360
Brother, drink.

898
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,640
I never want to be a man.

899
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,720
You don't want to be a man.

900
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,600
I want to be a man.

901
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,400
Today, no one can stop me.

902
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,040
I want to be a rich man.

903
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:27,480
I don't want to part with you.
