00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I can't express my feelings.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My face is red, my heart is confused.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Who is willing to?

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's better to be honest than to be a coward.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't regret it.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
See the flowers in the branches.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The strange years.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't know if you have any worries.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Some people want to repay, but they have no money.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Life is the best way.

The Long Ballad

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ake, why aren't you wearing a handkerchief?

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The new beauty is already in the hospital. It's not me.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is that...

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's not closed.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Ake said that person.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's go, Ake. Let's eat something.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why aren't you eating?

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't have an appetite.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then why don't you try this wine?

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What kind of wine is this?

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is called Little Lan Gen. It's made from fruits.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The normal fruit wine has a slightly sour taste.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Only this one can be drunk in a secret jar for three years.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The honey is very tender and the taste is sweet.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Three years?

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
A bottle of wine is delicious and delicious. It needs to be sealed for three years.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Ake, you shouldn't be so angry.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's delicious.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Brother Lu, I can drink.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't worry, Ake. I will definitely bring you home safely.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Brother Lu, I can drink too.

36
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Brother Lu, I can drink too.

37
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I want to drink with you.

38
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay. I will definitely bring you home safely.

39
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I will definitely bring you home safely.

40
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I will definitely bring you home safely.

41
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I will definitely bring you home safely.

42
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I will definitely bring you home safely.

43
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I will definitely bring you home safely.

44
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I will definitely bring you home safely.

45
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I will definitely bring you home safely.

46
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:31,600
From today on, Guanmei Hall doesn't need to be a

47
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:41,600
I will definitely bring you home safely.

48
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:51,600
I will definitely bring you home safely.

49
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I will definitely bring you home safely.

50
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:11,600
I will definitely bring you home safely.

51
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:21,600
I will definitely bring you home safely.

52
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I will definitely bring you home safely.

53
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Zhou family?

54
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Their family never left Guanmei Hall.

55
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
It's the hardest to deal with.

56
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
There are records in Guanmei Hall every day.

57
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
It's impossible that Fang Shoumei doesn't know.

58
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Could it be that he left the difficult case to himself?

59
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
The door hasn't been closed yet.

60
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,600
It's still too late to change the day.

61
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Fang Shoumei actually has been cleaning up the case since this morning until now.

62
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Fang Shoumei, I want to change the day.

63
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Shimei Guan, hold this.

64
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Thank you, Fang Shoumei.

65
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Brother Lu.

66
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Let's go. I'll take you to watch a movie.

67
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang?

68
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Okay.

69
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Let's go.

70
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Did you see Mr. Qiu Jiang?

71
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
No way.

72
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Why is it so long?

73
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
He's here.

74
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
He's here.

75
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

76
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang is here.

77
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang is here.

78
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

79
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
You seem to be in a good mood.

80
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Me?

81
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Of course I'm in a good mood.

82
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Brother Lu.

83
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Actually, Fang Shoumei is a good person.

84
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
He treats his subordinates well and is diligent.

85
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
He's very serious.

86
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Are you angry?

87
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Of course I'm not angry.

88
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I've learned a lot from Fang Shoumei recently.

89
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I was just trying to protect Guan Meitian.

90
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Fang Shoumei is very good at it.

91
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,600
His friends have improved his motivation to be a matchmaker.

92
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm so happy that Guan Meitian is so good.

93
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I didn't expect Ake's brother to be so good.

94
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Very good.

95
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Brother Lu.

96
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Brother Lu, watch the play.

97
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Good.

98
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

99
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

100
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

101
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
What are you doing?

102
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang is my favorite character.

103
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Not only is he handsome, he is also good-looking.

104
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
He is also a good-looking man.

105
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Brother Lu.

106
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
What kind of girl would Mr. Qiu Jiang like?

107
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Ake.

108
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Ake, it's getting late.

109
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
We should go back.

110
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Or your brother will be worried.

111
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Let's take a look.

112
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Have some more tea.

113
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Here, let's have a drink.

114
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Here.

115
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Brother Lu.

116
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Why did you leave?

117
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Brother Lu.

118
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Why are you unhappy?

119
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I'm not.

120
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
You are.

121
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm not.

122
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
You dare not look me in the eye.

123
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
You still say you are not.

124
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Why are you unhappy?

125
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Is Mr. Qiu Jiang so perfect?

126
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Yes.

127
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,600
He is handsome, good-looking, and good-quality.

128
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
No matter how windy or rainy it is,

129
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
he will always be on stage when the tickets are sold out.

130
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Every time the ladies ask him to sing more, he always agrees.

131
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Enough.

132
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I think you can reach the next level.

133
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Brother Lu.

134
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Are you jealous?

135
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Yes.

136
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
I'm jealous.

137
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Brother Lu.

138
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,600
You are the most handsome and handsome man in my heart.

139
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
I just want to say hello to Mr. Qiu Jiang.

140
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Really?

141
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
You two are not closed. You heard me right.

142
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
I want to marry Mr. Qiu Jiang.

143
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
You are Shi Fa Ke, right?

144
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I heard you have been a beauty of many men.

145
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Please help me.

146
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
I want to marry him.

147
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Little lady.

148
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm a beauty.

149
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
I want to marry him.

150
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

151
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
I'm here.

152
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Please help me.

153
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
I'm here.

154
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Please help me.

155
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
I'm here.

156
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
I'm here.

157
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Little lady.

158
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Every beauty I make is in love with each other.

159
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,600
You need to know him first to get married.

160
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
For example, interest and hobby.

161
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Eating habits.

162
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Do you know?

163
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Well...

164
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Little lady.

165
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Judging from your clothes, you should be from a family of scholars.

166
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
I don't know if the family knows your thoughts.

167
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,600
If you tell them, will they worry about you?

168
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Yes.

169
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

170
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,600
What if he doesn't want to get married?

171
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
What's your plan?

172
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
It's not impossible to marry someone you admire.

173
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
But you need to know him first.

174
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Marriage is about love and harmony.

175
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang is a famous singer.

176
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
I wonder how is his love story.

177
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
If you two get married,

178
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
can you play him a song?

179
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
I'd better go.

180
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Well...

181
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
About the marriage proposal...

182
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Forget it for now.

183
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Fang Shoumei.

184
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Although we have different ideas about this,

185
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I think we have a good understanding.

186
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
By the way,

187
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,600
the story you told about the man who wants to marry a woman for the first time,

188
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,600
is it the same as the story of this little lady?

189
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I have a lot of things to do today.

190
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
I'll go first.

191
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
I...

192
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
My Lord.

193
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
It's urgent.

194
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
We can't delay it any longer.

195
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,600
One million taels.

196
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Tell me.

197
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Where can I get so much money?

198
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
My Lord.

199
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
I'll think of a way to share your worries.

200
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Think of a way?

201
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Think of a way?

202
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
What for?

203
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
To get some money and put it in your pocket?

204
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
No, no, no.

205
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Don't think I don't know what you did.

206
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
My Lord, please spare me.

207
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
I'll take it all out.

208
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
How much is it?

209
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
One thousand taels.

210
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
One thousand taels?

211
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
One thousand taels.

212
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Bastard.

213
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Bastard.

214
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Where did you get the money?

215
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
My Lord, please calm down.

216
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
My Lord, it's urgent.

217
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
I'll take the money to the officials.

218
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
How ridiculous.

219
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
If I don't have the money,

220
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
can't my business last?

221
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
No, no.

222
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Give me some more time.

223
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
I...

224
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
I'll get the money.

225
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
I can't wait.

226
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
My business can't wait any longer.

227
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
I want the money that's been sent from the start.

228
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Sent from the start?

229
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
This...

230
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
My Lord.

231
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
You're right.

232
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Only the Cheng family has this kind of money.

233
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Their family is the emperor of the state.

234
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
And there's only one daughter in the family.

235
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Cheng family?

236
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
The only daughter?

237
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Yes.

238
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
That's great.

239
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
My Lord.

240
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
My Lord.

241
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
My lady, you can't come in.

242
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
My Lord.

243
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Forget it.

244
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
It's not the right way.

245
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
But since you're here,

246
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
it's fine.

247
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Do you want to sign?

248
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
No, no, no.

249
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

250
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I do like your opera.

251
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
But I'm not here to sign.

252
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
My name is Fa Ke.

253
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm the rose of Guanmei Hall.

254
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
You're famous in the capital.

255
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Everyone praises you.

256
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I want to see you.

257
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I want to be your wife.

258
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
I want to break my own sword

259
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
and be your rose.

260
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I want to find a suitable bride for you.

261
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
I don't need anyone to be my wife.

262
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
I don't need to rush to get married.

263
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
My Lord.

264
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
I know the lady in the capital

265
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
is very fond of you.

266
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Are you afraid that

267
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
you'll lose the audience after marriage?

268
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
You're a good singer.

269
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Even if you get married,

270
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
your fame won't be affected.

271
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
And I've checked.

272
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
You're exactly at the age of marriage.

273
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Although you're so beautiful now,

274
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
you need a good match to spend the rest of your life.

275
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
My Lord.

276
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
You can tell me

277
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
if you have someone you like.

278
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
As long as you're in the same mind,

279
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
I'll help you get married.

280
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
What does this mean?

281
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
You can't say it out

282
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
if you have someone you like.

283
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
My Lord.

284
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
If you have someone in your heart

285
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
or something you can't say,

286
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
why don't you tell me?

287
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

288
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
This is the wedding hall for today.

289
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Mr. Shi.

290
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
This is Mr. Cheng from our clinic.

291
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Mr. Cheng.

292
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Nice to meet you.

293
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
I'm Shi Yi.

294
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Nice to meet you.

295
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
I'm Shi Yi.

296
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Mr. Cheng.

297
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Nice to meet you.

298
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Everyone in the capital knows

299
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
that you're a businesswoman.

300
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
You're smart and capable.

301
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
You're good at managing your family.

302
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
You're the most handsome woman in the capital.

303
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
You're the best.

304
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
You're too kind.

305
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I've been a maid for a long time.

306
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
I'm not good at it.

307
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
My future is not going to be limited.

308
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Thank you for your compliment.

309
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Road Solo

310
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Is Mr. Qiu Jiang

311
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Notre Dame strengths?

312
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
No.

313
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
He turned me down.

314
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Then why are you nervous?

315
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Because I know he said he has someone he likes.

316
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
but I can't confess to all kinds of reasons.

317
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,280
I need to know more

318
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,680
to prove it.

319
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,200
Ke is really thoughtful.

320
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,600
And

321
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,480
I have a new target.

322
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,520
Do you know the owner of the Baihua Yiguan,

323
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,440
Cheng Ruoning?

324
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,320
Cheng Ruoning?

325
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,080
It sounds familiar.

326
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,240
That's right.

327
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,880
Cheng Ruoning, the daughter of Cheng's father,

328
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,800
is the daughter of the capital's chief.

329
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,200
Her parents died long ago.

330
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,160
She is the only one who can run the family business.

331
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,320
She is old enough to get married.

332
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,920
She is so busy.

333
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,280
She must need a good partner.

334
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,960
I have to choose a good one for her.

335
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,600
Feng,

336
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,960
are you here to tell her the truth?

337
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,160
Yes.

338
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,440
We are so in sync.

339
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
We have the same idea.

340
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,520
But we are here together.

341
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,400
We can tell her the truth.

342
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,520
It's a good thing no matter who says it.

343
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,640
As long as she has a good marriage,

344
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,600
she will be happy.

345
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,280
Right?

346
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,840
Please come in.

347
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,360
Boss Cheng,

348
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,060
we are the plum

349
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,600
and this is our assistant.

350
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,840
My name is Shi Fake.

351
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,320
We both want to be your plum.

352
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,200
I don't know if you want to meet one by one

353
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,360
or together.

354
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,080
Let's meet together.

355
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,000
Thank you for your concern for my marriage.

356
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,920
But I don't plan to get married.

357
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,640
This is the tea.

358
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,720
Thank you for your hard work.

359
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,840
Please go back.

360
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,000
I can't accept the money.

361
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,200
Please go back.

362
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,520
Boss Cheng,

363
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,320
I'll go first.

364
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,520
I'll go first, too.

365
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,760
I'll go first.

366
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,360
I'll take this to the warehouse.

367
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,400
You can check it later.

368
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,280
Miss, please take care.

369
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,200
Don't wait for me.

370
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,840
When the goods arrive,

371
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,880
I'll send someone to the house.

372
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,440
Thank you.

373
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,000
Sister Pan'er.

374
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,920
Sister Pan'er.

375
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,880
You must be mistaken.

376
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,480
That is Cheng Ruoning.

377
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,520
She has her own shop.

378
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,880
Why does she come to Xibao Pavilion?

379
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,920
Ke, you don't know.

380
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,200
Miss Cheng

381
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,360
is here to order the first-class pear.

382
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,760
This kind of pear is to be transported from the Western Regions.

383
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,800
The journey is long and bumpy.

384
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,280
Only Xibao Pavilion can do it.

385
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
She said she would use this kind of pear

386
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,880
to make pear soup.

387
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,680
Make pear soup with thousands of gold?

388
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,320
I really don't understand

389
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,840
the mind of the rich.

390
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,880
But our master is different.

391
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,480
Except for the pleasure of begging you,

392
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,040
her daily food and clothing

393
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,960
are very safe and restrained.

394
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,000
She never talks so much.

395
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,320
The Cheng family is indeed rich.

396
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,800
Pear?

397
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,880
She even brought it from the Western Regions?

398
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,920
Pear soup?

399
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,440
This is today's pear soup.

400
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Come.

401
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,600
Why is Mr. Qiu Jiang sick?

402
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,440
I'm here.

403
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,600
I can't see Mr. Qiu Jiang.

404
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,240
Yes.

405
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,120
Why did I say that?

406
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,680
The tickets are sold out in three days.

407
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,680
When will Mr. Qiu Jiang open the store?

408
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,680
Shopkeeper.

409
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,720
When will Mr. Qiu Jiang open the store?

410
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,880
Don't worry.

411
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,240
The show is only delayed for a few days.

412
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,840
Mr. Qiu Jiang will open the store again.

413
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

414
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,320
Listen to me.

415
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,440
I'm the owner of the White Flower Art Museum.

416
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,440
Mr. Qiu Jiang is not feeling well.

417
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
From today on,

418
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,320
all performances of Mr. Qiu Jiang will be cancelled.

419
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,520
Canceled?

420
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,560
Until Mr. Qiu Jiang recovers

421
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,640
and the time to come back to the stage is set.

422
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,480
So beautiful.

423
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,840
So beautiful.

424
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,880
So beautiful.

425
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,480
We will return you double the money.

426
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,800
Double?

427
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,680
Double?

428
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,480
Boss Zhang.

429
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,400
Double the money?

430
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
That's too much.

431
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,280
Everything is more important to Mr. Qiu Jiang.

432
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,640
This time, all the losses are due to me alone.

433
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,840
Mr. Qiu Jiang has been working non-stop for years.

434
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,240
He often has to work overtime.

435
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,720
I hope you can understand and wait patiently for this time.

436
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,720
After Mr. Qiu Jiang recovers,

437
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,800
I will perform for you again.

438
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Don't go.

439
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,800
Please follow me.

440
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
No.

441
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,960
Something is wrong.

442
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Ke.

443
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,480
What's bothering you?

444
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,920
Can you tell me?

445
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,480
Cheng Ruoning

446
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,000
was hit by me when he was delivering the soup for Mr. Qiu Jiang.

447
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,200
He was so fat that he was so fat that he was so fat.

448
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,000
Didn't you say you could bleeding and spluly without aging?

449
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,920
Today,

450
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,120
Mr. Qiu Jiang was sick and couldn't perform.

451
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,200
He has been considering about everything for whereby he went.

452
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,240
He hates to have the tickets,

453
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,480
but he didn't ask for anything

454
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,120
and returned the ticket twice.

455
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,800
If you suspect that they are in love with each other,

456
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,360
you must get the evidence.

457
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,480
The boss also cares good about the artisans in the καιif.

458
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,960
You must say that they love each other.

459
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,560
Cheng Ruoning is a lady.

460
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,760
She cares about others very well.

461
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,200
That's very relationship-kinship.

462
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
But my intuition tells me

463
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,200
they are not just a normal boss and Jue.

464
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
No.

465
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I need to confirm it.

466
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Go ahead.

467
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Yes.

468
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
How is Boss Chen?

469
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Do you remember me?

470
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
I came to tell you about Mei.

471
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Fang Shen Mei.

472
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
I told you last time

473
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
I don't need to be Mei.

474
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Please go back.

475
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Boss Chen will be married eventually.

476
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
The existence of Guan Mei Hall

477
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
is to help everyone find a good source.

478
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Boss Chen, you can tell me the problem.

479
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Maybe I can solve your problem.

480
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
My problem?

481
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
The marriage is not a secret in the capital.

482
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
After your father passed away,

483
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
you started a family business alone.

484
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
The tiger wolf relatives are everywhere.

485
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
They come to make trouble at any time.

486
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
How you came here

487
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
is hard to imagine.

488
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
I think you must hope

489
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
someone can accompany you

490
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
and support you.

491
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
So you said you didn't want to get married.

492
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
I don't believe it.

493
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Fang Shen Mei, please sit.

494
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Fang Shen Mei, please sit.

495
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I came to your house at the age of sixteen

496
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
to talk business.

497
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,200
I can tell the truth from the scene.

498
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
You have seven true feelings.

499
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
But I'm curious.

500
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Why Fang Shen Mei is so persistent

501
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
and wants to make Mei for me?

502
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
I don't know.

503
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
She wants to introduce Mei to me.

504
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
I don't know.

505
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I don't know.

506
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
She wants to introduce Mei to me.

507
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
I want to ask Fang Shen Mei

508
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
who is the right candidate for me?

509
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Boss Cheng values his career.

510
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
In my opinion,

511
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,200
you need a powerful and responsible person

512
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
to help you take care of your family business

513
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
and the division of the world.

514
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,200
And to love and protect you

515
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
and share the blessings of your descendants.

516
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,200
So who is the candidate

517
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Fang Shen Mei prepared for me?

518
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Marquis Wu An.

519
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Marquis is a talented and capable person.

520
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
He is self-disciplined and polite.

521
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
He is a steady and kind person.

522
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
He is a good boy.

523
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Most young men in the family

524
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
like to play.

525
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
But he is not like that.

526
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
His noble status

527
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
can protect you

528
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
and the whole Cheng family.

529
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Marquis is noble.

530
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
I was born in a family of merchants.

531
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
How can I be of high status?

532
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
That's the reason.

533
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
If Boss Cheng marries into the Marquis's mansion,

534
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
the relatives of the Chai Lang Ban

535
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
will not dare to make trouble here.

536
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
The Cheng family's career

537
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
can be improved.

538
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Marquis will protect you

539
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
and live a good life.

540
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
I have never had any contact with him.

541
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Nor have I had any affection.

542
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Love can be cultivated.

543
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Marriage is a choice

544
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
of life.

545
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Since it is a choice,

546
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
we should be full of it.

547
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
You can give yourself a chance

548
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
to understand the Marquis.

549
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I don't want you

550
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
to marry someone you don't love.

551
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
I just want you to know

552
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
that the road is hard to walk.

553
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
The road is easy to walk.

554
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
If you choose the right person,

555
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
you can be a good person.

556
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
I think

557
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
you really appreciate

558
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Marquis.

559
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
You know what I think.

560
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I am not in a hurry to get married.

561
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
But if the other person

562
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
is not the person in my heart,

563
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I won't accept anyone else.

564
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
So,

565
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,200
please go back.

566
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Why doesn't the person

567
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,200
agree to be loved by Boss Cheng?

568
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
But there are many things

569
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
that can't be liked.

570
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Boss Cheng,

571
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
I will come again

572
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
if you bother me today.

573
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
See you.

574
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Miss Cheng.

575
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Fang Shoumei.

576
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
I mean...

577
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
You don't have to say more.

578
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
I don't plan to get married now.

579
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Please go back.

580
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Goodbye.

581
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Cheng...

582
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
I...

583
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Fang Shoumei.

584
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Wait.

585
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Can you tell me

586
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
what Miss Cheng said to you?

587
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
You were right.

588
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,200
She only wants to marry the person she wants to marry.

589
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
It seems that I was right.

590
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Now the most important thing

591
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
is to know

592
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,200
who is the person in Miss Cheng's heart.

593
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Miss Cheng,

594
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
let's go.

595
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Yes, I will go with you.

596
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
I will go with you.

597
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,200
I will go with you.

598
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
I will go with you.

599
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Miss.

600
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
This is medicine.

601
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
You...

602
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
I will take a look first.

603
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Okay, okay.

604
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Doctor,

605
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
no need to worry about the price of the medicine.

606
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Just take it when the medicine is in the patient.

607
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,160
It's just a normal disease.

608
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,760
But it still needs patients to come in

609
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,520
to give the medicine.

610
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,400
Okay.

611
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,280
Then I'll take these.

612
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,280
Okay?

613
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,000
Wait a moment.

614
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,440
Okay.

615
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,280
Boss Cheng.

616
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,400
Since

617
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,800
our hospital's chief, Hua Yue Rong, left,

618
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,280
only Mr. Qiu Jiang

619
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,480
can help us make the scene.

620
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,400
But now

621
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,960
the tickets are double paid.

622
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,160
Mr. Qiu Jiang is on stage again.

623
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,920
We've already given up.

624
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,200
Now we have to find a doctor for him

625
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,280
to make up for the medicine.

626
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,720
If this continues,

627
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,080
we have to close the door and shut it.

628
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,400
Shopkeeper.

629
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,840
I know you're worried.

630
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,440
But you don't have to say anything.

631
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,200
Before Mr. Qiu Jiang can get his voice back,

632
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,320
I won't let him be there.

633
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,200
No.

634
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,040
Boss Cheng.

635
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,480
Why are you so persistent?

636
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,400
If this continues,

637
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,400
are you really going to

638
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,640
abandon the business of the clinic?

639
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,960
He first came on stage

640
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,440
at the Flower House.

641
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,600
No matter who comes to dig his feet,

642
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,440
he won't leave.

643
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,680
These years,

644
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
he has contributed a lot to the Flower House.

645
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,760
This time, it's a small emergency.

646
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,240
It's normal to rest for a few days.

647
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,040
I've made up my mind

648
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,480
not to abandon him.

649
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,960
I will definitely cure his throat.

650
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,840
Madam Cheng.

651
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,120
You guys go ahead.

652
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:18,960
Come.

653
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,160
Why is the guard here again?

654
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
I said I didn't need to be a maid.

655
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,640
Madam Cheng.

656
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,520
Is the person in your heart

657
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,880
Mr. Qiu Jiang?

658
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,200
Yes.

659
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,920
Since you have someone in mind,

660
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,160
I can help you

661
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,600
to get Mr. Qiu Jiang's approval.

662
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,640
I know you have good intentions.

663
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,200
But it's just my wishful thinking.

664
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,920
I don't want to be with him for nothing.

665
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,160
It's just that

666
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,080
I keep confessing my feelings to him.

667
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,080
I only get rejected

668
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,760
from time to time.

669
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,320
I no longer have any hope.

670
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,080
I just hope

671
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,960
I can get along with him.

672
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,520
Rejected?

673
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,280
Which time?

674
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,040
You don't have to worry about it.

675
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:19,880
No, no.

676
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,760
Madam Cheng.

677
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,760
Don't be angry.

678
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,320
Let's wait until I've made sure

679
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,040
Mr. Qiu Jiang's feelings.

680
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,160
But

681
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,160
if he really doesn't like you,

682
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,600
what are your plans?

683
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,120
If he doesn't like me,

684
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,280
I'll stay single for life.

685
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,560
Brother Lu.

686
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,640
Did we find the wrong place?

687
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Is this really

688
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,400
Mr. Qiu Jiang's residence?

689
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,880
My information shouldn't be wrong.

690
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,920
This is indeed

691
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,080
Mr. Qiu Jiang's residence.

692
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,000
Let's go.

693
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,760
Mr. Qiu Jiang, you're doing well.

694
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:40,340
I'm officer of Son's

695
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,300
room.

696
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,080
Look forward to serving you.

697
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,080
He's the best in the whole capital.

698
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,560
He must have made a lot of money these years.

699
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,120
How could he stand up in such a cold and sour place?

700
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,280
Lady-in-waiting,

701
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,960
please sit.

702
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,920
These are all from Lady Cheng, right?

703
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,640
Boss Cheng is a good man.

704
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,080
He's very generous.

705
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,000
He sent these to me out of kindness.

706
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,640
As far as I know,

707
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,560
this is not kindness,

708
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,320
but sincerity.

709
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,440
You should know that

710
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
his kindness to you

711
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,160
is not just a simple thing.

712
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,920
I know what Lady Cheng is thinking.

713
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,760
I came here

714
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,680
to know your attitude.

715
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,320
Do you know that

716
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
before I came here,

717
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,880
I asked him a question.

718
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,280
What question?

719
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,040
I asked,

720
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,240
if you don't like him,

721
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,040
what would he do?

722
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,000
He said

723
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,080
he'd rather be alone for life.

724
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,800
Alone?

725
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,440
Lady Cheng is alone.

726
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,000
She can't get the one she loves.

727
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,080
Is this

728
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,040
the result

729
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,840
you want to see?

730
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,640
I don't believe you have no feelings for him.

731
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,600
Why would he do that?

732
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,320
I'm just a playboy.

733
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,920
How could I dare to ask him out?

734
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,680
Do you know that

735
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,320
if he's with me,

736
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,520
what would he bear?

737
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,400
I've thought about it.

738
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,760
I'd take him to another place

739
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,760
to live a life of fame and fame.

740
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,600
But he's Cheng Ruoning.

741
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,200
He's Boss Cheng.

742
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,240
He should

743
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,000
keep the Cheng family's family business

744
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,240
and find a husband.

745
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,800
Live a life of respect and respect.

746
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,920
Not follow me, a playboy,

747
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,600
and be held back by others every day.

748
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,320
Or live a life of ideals.

749
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,880
Mr. Qiu Jiang,

750
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,680
you're living a poor life.

751
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,000
You want to save the money

752
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,120
and take him away from the capital one day

753
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,320
to live a new life.

754
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,440
It shows that you haven't given up

755
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,720
your relationship.

756
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
How can I

757
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,720
compare my money with the Cheng family's family business?

758
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,200
Have you asked him?

759
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,520
What if he's willing to leave with you?

760
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,480
I don't care.

761
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,360
I've made up my mind.

762
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,160
You don't have to say anything.

763
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,960
Please.

764
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,400
Junior Sister, you tell me.

765
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,600
I've made preparations.

766
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Miss Cheng Qiao,

767
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,600
I've confirmed Mr. Qiu Jiang's feelings.

768
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,440
You and him are in love.

769
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
How is that possible?

770
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,200
Believe me.

771
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,520
He has you in his heart.

772
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,680
It's because he has you in his heart

773
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
that he won't respond to your feelings.

774
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,040
I'm not going to let him go.

775
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,680
I'm not going to let him go.

776
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,360
I'm not going to let him go.

777
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,080
I'm not going to let him go.

778
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,680
I'm not going to let him go.

779
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,400
That's why he won't respond to your feelings.

780
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,840
Because

781
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,280
he doesn't want you to face the rumors.

782
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,800
He doesn't want you

783
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,520
to live a hard life with him.

784
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,400
He...

785
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,720
How can he do that?

786
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,680
Don't worry.

787
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,600
If you're not in love,

788
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,480
you can beg me. I won't interfere.

789
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,680
It's because you two are in love.

790
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,520
So,

791
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,040
I've made up my mind.

792
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,920
I'll help you achieve your dream.

793
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,520
Friendship is a love-hate relationship.

794
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:15,280
The

795
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,440
Feng ShouMei.

796
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,920
Yes, Lord sé sinefa.

797
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,840
It's been a few days since we met.

798
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,640
What have you been doing lately?

799
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,240
I've been

800
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,880
working on Cheng Ruoning's project.

801
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,720
They are speaking highly of

802
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,440
Childe Qiu Jiang in my heart.

803
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Meng Yue, how is it going with Cheng Ruoning?

804
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,440
Cheng Ruoning already has someone he likes.

805
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,040
Judging from his attitude before,

806
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
he definitely won't accept anyone else.

807
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,640
Who is that person?

808
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,440
I don't know.

809
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,640
I just heard that Cheng Ruoning has a new lover.

810
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
And...

811
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
And what?

812
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,640
He has already arranged for the marriage

813
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,640
to be arranged by Cheng Ruoning.

814
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,240
Cheng Ruoning has already arranged for the marriage

815
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,240
to be arranged by Cheng Ruoning.

816
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
Fang Yue, Fang Yue.

817
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,640
I thought you were much smarter than that little girl.

818
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,440
I didn't expect you to be so stupid.

819
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,640
I don't care what method you use.

820
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,640
You must help me marry Cheng Ruoning.

821
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,440
My Lord.

822
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,440
Do you really want to marry Cheng Ruoning?

823
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,240
Yes.

824
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,440
I really want to marry him.

825
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,040
Do you know how many families are in the Cheng family?

826
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,640
Do you know how important this is to me?

827
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
I got it.

828
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,040
Tomorrow,

829
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,040
I will send your marriage invitation to Cheng's Mansion

830
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,840
to propose marriage for you.

831
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
Good.

832
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,840
Good.

833
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,640
I'll take my leave.

834
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
Fang Shoumei.

835
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
What a coincidence.

836
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
Shi Meiguan.

837
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,640
Please come in.

838
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,440
Fang Shoumei, please.

839
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,240
Shi Meiguan, please wait.

840
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,040
Fang Shoumei, please.

841
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,040
Please wait.

842
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,440
Fang Shoumei, please.

843
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,440
Shi Meiguan, please wait.

844
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,840
Fang Shoumei, please.

845
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,440
Shi Meiguan, please wait.

846
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
Boss Cheng.

847
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,440
Fang Shoumei is fine.

848
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,440
What brings you here?

849
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,240
Marquis Wu'an sincerely wanted to marry Boss Cheng.

850
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,040
I'm here to change the marriage.

851
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,440
I knew you were persistent

852
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,040
when I first met Fang Shoumei.

853
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,840
I didn't expect you to be so persistent.

854
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,640
I hope Boss Cheng can think it over.

855
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,040
Some people can't be rejected.

856
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:26,040
I know this meeting is the grace of fate

857
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,840
Every time I see you

858
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,040
I feel stubborn and lovely

859
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,640
Although I can't remember

860
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,040
every difficult day

861
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,040
I know this meeting is the grace of fate

862
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:51,040
I can't remember every difficult day

863
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:58,240
But I never forget the first time I saw you

864
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,640
Even if there's no star, no sky, no sun, no night

865
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,640
It doesn't matter if it's windy or cold

866
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,840
As long as you are fearless

867
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,440
You can enjoy the joy and sorrow

868
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,440
No matter the world or the fire

869
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,040
I'm willing to protect you

870
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:26,240
no matter the obstacles

871
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,040
Even if I can't see you

872
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,040
I'm willing to give my all

873
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,240
to love you

874
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,640
I'll only miss you

875
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,840
No matter the sea or the sky

876
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,240
I don't care about the past

877
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,440
Please remember the youth

878
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,840
that used to be so pure

879
00:45:54,040 --> 00:46:03,240
From now on, I don't want to part with you
