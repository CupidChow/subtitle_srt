1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Show the quavers of Guillian House with your making.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

30
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,140
What is this?

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,900
The commission from Chief Lu defines whoぶ

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,000
It goes to Shimei Guan-

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,900
He won.

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
Great !

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,240
Since the result is out,

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,040
please go back and prepare for it.

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,280
Don't let your boss down.

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,080
So Brother Lu did this for me.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,080
The End

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,440
Mother, I'm back.

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,040
How was it?

42
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,640
Ake,

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,640
you must be tired.

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm not.

45
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,480
Mother, I won.

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,680
Now we can continue to hold the flowers show.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,600
This year,

48
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,520
I'll help you.

49
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,360
Mother,

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,560
I did it.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
My good daughter,

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
thank you.

53
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,440
Thank you so much.

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
You're welcome.

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm glad you're happy.

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,080
I'm happy.

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,480
I'm very happy.

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,560
Tang Cui is great.

59
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
He's the best in the world.

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,880
He's the best.

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,680
He's the best.

62
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,880
You're the best.

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,080
Thank you.

64
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,200
I wonder if Brother Lu is home.

65
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,680
Whether he's home or not,

66
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
let's try.

67
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,800
Why isn't there any sound?

68
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Forget it.

69
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,600
It's good that he's not here.

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,320
I can't say it

71
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,640
in person.

72
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Brother Lu,

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,800
thank you.

74
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,080
I have no intention

75
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,600
to repay you for what you've done for me.

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,320
Say it.

77
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,360
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,160
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,920
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,760
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,640
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,360
Besides saying thank you,

85
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,320
I have to apologize to you.

86
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,120
You were helping me.

87
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,960
I didn't know what you meant.

88
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,760
Brother Lu,

89
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,800
we never met again.

90
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,040
That's not what I meant.

91
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,560
I just don't know how to face you.

92
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,640
I made this engagement

93
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
when I was young.

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,440
But that man

95
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,960
never came to the Lv Yue.

96
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,760
I don't know what to do either.

97
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,040
It seems that he's not He Kexian.

98
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,200
He hasn't appeared yet.

99
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,680
Tomorrow,

100
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,760
I'm going to start preparing for the flowers.

101
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm leaving.

102
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,160
Brother,

103
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,880
since I'm a good person in your heart,

104
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,960
can you give me a chance

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,400
to love you forever?

106
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Idiot!

107
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
The assassins who were sent there

108
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,560
were all killed by Lu Chi.

109
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,800
And the Flower Session

110
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,320
lost to Shi Fak.

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
I think my men are all like you.

112
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,120
They're all idiots.

113
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,960
My Lord,

114
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,880
it's all because of Deng Mei Guan.

115
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,960
The money of the Flower Session

116
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,400
was lost.

117
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,280
And the right to the main meal of the Flower Session was lost.

118
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,920
What should we do?

119
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,800
Since Shi Fak

120
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,840
likes to hold the Flower Session,

121
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,120
I'll make him hold it.

122
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,520
My Lord.

123
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,560
Deng Mei Guan,

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,040
you can lose the right to the main meal of the Flower Session.

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,160
My Lord, I'm sorry.

126
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,640
You can't even

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,120
handle a little Shi Fak.

128
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,280
I think

129
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,320
you should give up your position

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,600
as the leader.

131
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,160
Let the capable people know it.

132
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,400
My Lord.

133
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,720
My Lord, please don't.

134
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,520
You know that

135
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,400
I've only been able to be the leader

136
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,880
for my whole life.

137
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,120
My Lord, please don't.

138
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,880
Shut up.

139
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
My Lord.

140
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,280
Your Highness.

141
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,200
Your Highness.

142
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,200
Your Highness.

143
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,040
Your Highness.

144
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,080
Your Highness.

145
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,120
Your Highness.

146
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,200
Your Highness.

147
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,920
Sister Pan'er.

148
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,720
I'm here to deliver the VIP tickets.

149
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,480
By the way...

150
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,520
Lady Shi Fak.

151
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,880
The one in Xibao Pavilion

152
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,160
is the leader.

153
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,360
If you have something to say,

154
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,880
you can discuss it with him.

155
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,040
Brother Lu.

156
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,680
I'm here to deliver the VIP tickets.

157
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,400
There are too many people

158
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,320
who signed up for the ceremony.

159
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,800
Only when you get the tickets

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,400
can you discuss it with Lady Shi Fak.

161
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,400
Everyone can come to Xibao Pavilion to get the tickets.

162
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,680
It can also increase the popularity

163
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,240
of Xibao Pavilion.

164
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,840
Okay.

165
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,360
I'll tell Manager Li

166
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,760
to take good care of everyone.

167
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,080
I'll send someone

168
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,160
to send the money to your Guanmei Hall today.

169
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,800
So much money is put in Guanmei Hall.

170
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,480
It might cause trouble.

171
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,480
If there are goods in Xibao Pavilion,

172
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
we can go to sell them.

173
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
If there are none,

174
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
we can ask the official to buy them.

175
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,160
Then we can ask Brother Lu to sell them.

176
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,160
What do you think?

177
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,960
It's better to think about it in the Ake Temple.

178
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,080
Then Brother Lu,

179
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,120
please sit in Guanmei Hall for a few days.

180
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,600
It won't be a trouble.

181
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,280
Let's go.

182
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,160
Let's go.

183
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,200
What?

184
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,440
Although the Flower Session is run by Shi Fak,

185
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,840
I'm the handmaiden.

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
All the accounts

187
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,960
should be checked by me.

188
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,280
You don't have to

189
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,960
bother about the accounts.

190
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,720
This time, the news is true.

191
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,080
All the things I bought

192
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,880
are checked by Xibao Pavilion

193
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,000
and the number of tickets.

194
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,480
Then we can compare the balance and the price of the goods.

195
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
This can prevent corruption

196
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,320
and save people's lives.

197
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,760
Shi Fak, you...

198
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,680
Handmaiden,

199
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,800
you don't know

200
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,080
the accounts of the Flower Session.

201
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,360
You don't have to bother about it.

202
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,480
What did you say?

203
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
Colleagues,

204
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,920
if you buy the goods,

205
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,360
please take out the balance.

206
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,560
After we get together,

207
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,440
we can go to Xibao Pavilion to get the money.

208
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,680
Thank you for your efforts for the Flower Session.

209
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,800
I won't treat you badly.

210
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,000
Anyone who goes to Xibao Pavilion to get the money

211
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,640
will get free tea.

212
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,120
Thank you, Chief Lu.

213
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,720
Come on.

214
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,240
Wait a while.

215
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,160
Airy and not greasy.

216
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,640
Your good luck is unparalleled.

217
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,200
Good for you.

218
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,960
Just buy the 280 catties.

219
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,120
Tiantian,

220
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,640
my brother has covered the hard drive.

221
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,280
I'll just go to Xiebao Pavilion and get the money.

222
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
So much money?

223
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,280
This is what I deserve.

224
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
I can't let you spend money again and again.

225
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,880
You're so generous, Chief Lu.

226
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,080
Young Master, what book are you reading?

227
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,520
We have four books here.

228
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,480
All of them are from the ancient times.

229
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,120
Boss, which one of your books

230
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,520
is the best seller?

231
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,880
Speaking of books,

232
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,080
it should be the one next door.

233
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,840
But he hasn't released a new chapter

234
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,360
in the last month.

235
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,080
The reader is waiting for a hard time.

236
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,400
I'm also involved.

237
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,920
I've burned a lot of bricks.

238
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,520
It's hard indeed.

239
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,680
I'm suffering because of the important things.

240
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm suffering,

241
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,760
and so are the people.

242
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,760
You're a crazy person

243
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,240
waiting for the book of the next door.

244
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,560
Boss, are the new chapters here?

245
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,560
Little nun, why are you here in person?

246
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,760
Just write a list of books you like

247
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,800
and send it to me.

248
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,560
I can send it to my house.

249
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,400
Boss, I haven't read the book

250
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,120
of the next door for a long time.

251
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,640
I read some of the books

252
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,280
and I only think about the new chapters of the next door.

253
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,840
The next door

254
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,040
has to be published in a month.

255
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,760
How about this?

256
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,400
It's a book of the next door.

257
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,160
It's good.

258
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,320
No need.

259
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I only read the book of the next door.

260
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,320
Boss, if the new chapters are here,

261
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,960
send it to my house.

262
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,360
Don't worry.

263
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,400
As long as the new chapters are published,

264
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,080
I'll send it to the house of the next door.

265
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,360
Let's go.

266
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,400
Take care.

267
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,320
I didn't expect this little nun

268
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,520
to be so beautiful

269
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,520
and have such a good taste.

270
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,800
Look.

271
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
This is real.

272
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,120
Yes.

273
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,920
It's worth it.

274
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,040
Look, this color is so beautiful.

275
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,040
It's really good.

276
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,240
Go and ask around.

277
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,640
I haven't seen it.

278
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,720
This is really good.

279
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
It's really good.

280
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,880
It's also sold out.

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,920
I'm so relieved.

282
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,280
This is really good.

283
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,280
It's really good.

284
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Young Master,

285
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,440
would you like to see

286
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,000
the new products of our Xibao Pavilion

287
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,840
and send them to your family?

288
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,560
Pearl, jade, jade, and jade.

289
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,640
Send them to the young lady.

290
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,600
Earrings, necklace, hairpins.

291
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,560
We have everything we need.

292
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,880
Your Master...

293
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,040
That's not a coincidence.

294
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
Our Master is not here.

295
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,680
If you have something important,

296
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,440
you can keep your name.

297
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,440
It's good that he's not here.

298
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,840
Shopkeeper Li, go ahead.

299
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,360
Make me some good tea.

300
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,680
I want the

301
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,680
snow-covered cold drink.

302
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,200
You know who the Master is

303
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,600
and you're not afraid of him?

304
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,240
You know my surname is Shen Ming Shui.

305
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,800
But I'm not his face.

306
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,800
The snow-covered cold drink

307
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,720
was delivered three days ago.

308
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,400
In the capital,

309
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,480
other than me and the Master,

310
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,360
even Lu Yi might not know.

311
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,800
Who is this person

312
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,360
in front of me?

313
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,320
Who is this person?

314
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,400
Who is this person?

315
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,360
Oh no.

316
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,000
I saw the snow-covered cold drink

317
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,680
in the secret report.

318
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,200
I accidentally

319
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,640
lost my mouth.

320
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,240
So, the Xibao Pavilion

321
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,800
doesn't have such good tea.

322
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,160
It's said that

323
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,040
Xibao Pavilion has countless rare treasures.

324
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,000
It seems that

325
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,520
it's true.

326
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,440
That's not true.

327
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,640
But

328
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,360
even if the Master wants to drink it,

329
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,680
he has to be the Master.

330
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,760
What do you mean?

331
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,840
I have many people.

332
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,080
But I can't guess

333
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,120
the snow-covered cold drink.

334
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,360
After all, there are often

335
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,040
people from Xibao Pavilion

336
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,560
to make trouble.

337
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,080
But

338
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,280
the jade belt

339
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,560
is made by Xibao Pavilion.

340
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,480
There are two pairs in total.

341
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,640
One for the Master

342
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,080
and one for the Master.

343
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,480
Master,

344
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,840
you went down the mountain without permission.

345
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,160
Does the Master know?

346
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,720
Manager Li,

347
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,920
please don't say that.

348
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,120
Of course, my brother doesn't know.

349
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,560
I haven't figured out

350
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,720
how to tell him.

351
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,680
I came here

352
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,240
to find out the truth.

353
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,880
I don't know what happened.

354
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,080
Brother, how are you?

355
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,360
Tell me.

356
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,880
Why did you go down the mountain without permission?

357
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,200
I can't see you on the mountain.

358
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
I'm really worried about your safety.

359
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,200
So I went down the mountain to find you.

360
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,840
It's only a ten-day journey from Mount Qianya to the capital.

361
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,920
Why did you show up today?

362
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,840
Brother,

363
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,400
the capital is so prosperous

364
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,400
and fun.

365
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,960
It's beyond my expectation.

366
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,480
I was delayed for a few days.

367
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,280
Brother, I'm here.

368
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,240
I...

369
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
We don't have to separate anymore.

370
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,840
Master,

371
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,240
the jade light used by the Flower-picking Society

372
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,400
is a sample.

373
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,520
Lu Yi?

374
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,280
Long time no see.

375
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,560
It's from the Second Master.

376
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,480
Lu Yi, why are you hiding?

377
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,840
I finally escaped from

378
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,280
this evil hand of the Xiao Clan.

379
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,680
The Flower-picking Society?

380
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,040
What is the Flower-picking Society?

381
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,280
The Flower-picking Society

382
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,280
is a garden party held by the Guanmei Hall

383
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,520
for single men and women.

384
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,400
Manager Li,

385
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,360
say it again.

386
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,800
Xibao Pavilion

387
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,560
is going to inaugurate the Flower-picking Society this year.

388
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,480
By then,

389
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,360
the young ladies and gentlemen of the capital

390
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
will come to the garden to play

391
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,240
and hope to find someone in their dreams.

392
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,840
What is the jade light for?

393
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,400
The jade light is customized by the Shimei Pass

394
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,360
for the Flower-picking Society.

395
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
It's for the Flower-picking Society.

396
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,600
The Shimei Pass?

397
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,320
Who is the Shimei Pass?

398
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,040
The Shimei Pass is...

399
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,560
The Flower-picking Society

400
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,880
sounds like a fun place.

401
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,480
I want to go too.

402
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,800
Stay here and reflect on your mistakes.

403
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,480
You're not allowed to leave this place.

404
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,120
I don't want to.

405
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,720
Brother,

406
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,200
I want to go to the Flower-picking Society.

407
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,520
The jade light is sent to the garden.

408
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,600
It will be sent to the garden in a few days.

409
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,560
Shimei Pass,

410
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,920
this is our master.

411
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,560
He asked us to make it for you.

412
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,280
That's great.

413
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,680
This is exactly what I want.

414
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,800
Brother Lu,

415
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,360
you really did it.

416
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
It's good that A'he likes it.

417
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,960
Our master not only did it,

418
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,600
but also did it in such a short time.

419
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,360
I wonder if the intention behind it is...

420
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,560
Manager Li.

421
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,960
Brother Lu,

422
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,200
thank you so much.

423
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,920
I've already tried the jade light.

424
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,760
I'll have to trouble Sister Pan'er

425
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
to send it to the manor.

426
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,640
But the jade light is broken.

427
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,360
It's crowded and busy.

428
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
I have to find someone who is reliable and considerate

429
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,440
to help Sister Pan'er.

430
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,080
Who do you think is reliable and considerate?

431
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,320
Speaking of someone who is reliable and considerate,

432
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,680
it's my brother.

433
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
But the government is busy.

434
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,360
I wonder if he...

435
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,600
I think so too.

436
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,840
I think

437
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,640
Brother Lu will definitely help us.

438
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,880
After all, it's all for the flower show.

439
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,520
Then I'll ask my brother to help us.

440
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,760
Thank you, Sister.

441
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,240
I suddenly remembered

442
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,480
that there are other things in the room.

443
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,000
I'll get back to work.

444
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,680
Brother Lu.

445
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,400
Do you think Sister Pan'er...

446
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,160
Ke.

447
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,320
Actually, that day,

448
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,680
I...

449
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,280
Chief.

450
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,240
Chief, it's me.

451
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,160
The wedding cake at He Ji has been prepared.

452
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,560
That's great.

453
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,760
Brother Xian has helped me a lot.

454
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,200
And He Ji has prepared

455
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,840
so many wedding cakes in a few days.

456
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,400
Brother Lu.

457
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,760
This is the VIP ticket for the flower show.

458
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,680
I left it for you.

459
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,240
I'll go check the goods first.

460
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,000
Take it.

461
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,880
Really?

462
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,720
It's for me?

463
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,920
Thank you, Chief.

464
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,600
I can go to the flower show too.

465
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,200
Chief, this is mine.

466
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,080
Give it back to me.

467
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
You can take it if you want.

468
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,360
Give it back to me.

469
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,160
I won't.

470
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,280
Give it to me.

471
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,640
Brother.

472
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,240
Recently, the flower show has ordered a batch of jade.

473
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,320
It's easy to break.

474
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,320
I want to invite you to Xibao Pavilion tomorrow

475
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,600
to help Manager Li.

476
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,920
Are you free?

477
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
I... I'm free.

478
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,680
It's my sister's order.

479
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,400
I must do it well, right?

480
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Brother Xian is busy with the flower show recently.

481
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,320
I don't think he can make it.

482
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
I'll go help him tomorrow.

483
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,720
Brother, you're not right.

484
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,720
Mother usually tells you to work,

485
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,880
but you just run away.

486
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,320
Why are you so active today?

487
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,600
Why are you so active today?

488
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,160
Brother and Sister Tang.

489
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,960
Uncle and Aunt asked you why you're still awake.

490
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,720
Sleep.

491
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,600
Sleep.

492
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
I'll sleep now.

493
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,120
I'm going to Xibao Pavilion tomorrow morning

494
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,320
to help Manager Li move things.

495
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,720
You should rest early too.

496
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,920
Ke.

497
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,400
I'm going to sleep too.

498
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,280
Sister Tang, you should rest early too.

499
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,320
did not emoji

500
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,780
R riots, do검

501
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,760
Really?

502
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,520
Ever since I became the organizer for the flower show,

503
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,480
every moment

504
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,200
feels like a dream.

505
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,040
It's różnych that solely making troubles within life

506
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,000
and the world watching this one esaase the heart.

507
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,440
These are things that should not be knew.

508
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Why are you still awake?

509
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,920
Mother, I'm praying for the ancestors' blessings

510
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,480
to make the flowers come back to life.

511
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
Do you feel

512
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,640
uneasy now?

513
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,880
You're even in a daze.

514
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,440
You're like dreaming every day.

515
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,200
Mother, how do you know?

516
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,160
I'm also from the same family.

517
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,680
My daughter is the most obedient

518
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,400
and the most excellent rose.

519
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,000
You're very generous

520
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,520
and you know how to change.

521
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,200
I believe

522
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,600
you can make the flowers come back to life.

523
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,280
Mother, I understand.

524
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm the organizer of the flowers coming back to life.

525
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,560
I owe it to the people who helped me.

526
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,680
Brother Xian,

527
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,760
Tiantian,

528
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
Manager Li,

529
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,800
and...

530
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,840
Brother Lu.

531
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,760
You helped us before.

532
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,880
You should thank them.

533
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,120
You'll finish your work tomorrow

534
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,280
and come back early.

535
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,080
We'll hold a ceremony to thank them.

536
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,560
Then we'll invite Keqian, Ketian,

537
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,880
Chief Lu, and Manager Li

538
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,120
to come to our house.

539
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,040
After the ceremony, we'll have a meal.

540
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,760
I'll express my gratitude

541
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,120
on behalf of the Shi family.

542
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,080
Okay.

543
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,200
Miss Huarui,

544
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,680
here's a bouquet for you.

545
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,400
You are very beautiful.

546
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,280
I can smell the fragrance from your breath.

547
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,800
It's delicious.

548
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,880
And now I just need a little bit more.

549
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,600
And I'll check again.

550
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,520
No problem.

551
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,720
So easy.

552
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,520
I... I'm going to clean up now.

553
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,760
Thank you.

554
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
That's good.

555
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,080
Hey.

556
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,360
You have to take the drug.

557
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,240
What do you want me to do?

558
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,840
I need to clean up.

559
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,680
I'm sorry.

560
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,920
Brother Lu,

561
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,960
have you known

562
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,640
my brother and Sister Pan'er long ago?

563
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,080
I only got a few points

564
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,080
from Manager Li's expression.

565
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,760
So I asked Brother Shi to help me.

566
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,120
When Brother Shi came,

567
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
I only went to the others

568
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,760
to give them some opportunities.

569
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,960
But whether it can be done

570
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,760
depends on them.

571
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,800
Brother Lu,

572
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
you're really a good girl.

573
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,760
Sister Pan'er is pretty and capable.

574
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,240
She's a good match

575
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,240
with my silly brother.

576
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,280
If they're interested,

577
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,600
I'll definitely help them.

578
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,600
All these years,

579
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,120
Manager Li has been

580
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,080
managing the Xibao Pavilion alone.

581
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,400
I also hope

582
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,200
she can find a good family member.

583
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,120
Brother has found me.

584
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,480
Brother has been acting strange lately.

585
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,000
He's always been running to the He family.

586
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,600
Brother is smart and interesting.

587
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,680
He's a good man.

588
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,960
He's a good match

589
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,120
with Lady He.

590
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,240
No, no.

591
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,160
Brother Lu,

592
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,680
Tian Tian has a engagement.

593
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,600
Don't make any mistakes.

594
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,720
Have you asked Lady He

595
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,920
if she really likes him?

596
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,520
Does she have an engagement with him?

597
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,840
Does she know him?

598
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,400
Does she want to

599
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,040
marry Lady He?

600
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,320
It's an urgent agreement.

601
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,000
How can the engagement

602
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,440
be changed at will?

603
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,480
It's just that if they meet someone

604
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
who's more suitable, they'll break off the engagement.

605
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,240
Tian Tian can't do that.

606
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,440
What about the one who has an engagement with you?

607
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,800
Do you know each other?

608
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,200
Do you like each other?

609
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,640
I...

610
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,960
I'm going to get Tian Tian married

611
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,000
and then help two brothers

612
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,880
marry their sister-in-law.

613
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm not in a hurry.

614
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,360
I'll wait for that man to come to the engagement.

615
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,280
Brother Lu,

616
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,520
don't talk about me.

617
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,840
The Baihua Society is in a hurry.

618
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,720
The official business is important.

619
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,560
Today, our family worships our ancestors.

620
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,800
My mother was invited to a banquet

621
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,840
and asked me to

622
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,640
invite you and Manager Li to come.

623
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,760
I want to thank you.

624
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,440
I'll go prepare some gifts now.

625
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,600
I'll definitely visit you on time.

626
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,760
Okay.

627
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
Brother, do you like him?

628
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,040
Is it that obvious?

629
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,760
You almost got a red envelope

630
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,120
and everyone knew it.

631
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,480
But Ake didn't know.

632
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,160
Then you have to listen to

633
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,600
my good words.

634
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,640
As a woman,

635
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,240
you should first take the initiative

636
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,440
and be decisive.

637
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,040
Then,

638
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,480
you have to show yourself.

639
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,280
Thirdly,

640
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,560
you have to seek help from others.

641
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,000
What should I do?

642
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,400
You have to seize the opportunity

643
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,800
to go to dinner this time

644
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,840
and please your parents-in-law.

645
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,440
Let them care about you.

646
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,640
Besides,

647
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,960
talk about the official business more when you eat.

648
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,920
This way,

649
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,680
you'll be more stable

650
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,760
and reliable.

651
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,680
Really?

652
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,720
Yes.

653
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,160
Boss,

654
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,040
the Junshanji from the next mountain,

655
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,920
have you got the goods?

656
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
How's the sale?

657
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,440
The Junshanji is in stock.

658
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,760
The Book Service only sent the goods this morning.

659
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,600
How did you know?

660
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,360
Are you...

661
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,240
I'm...

662
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,280
A colleague.

663
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,760
I guessed right.

664
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,840
You're a colleague.

665
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,720
Listen,

666
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,680
colleagues are enemies.

667
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,440
Don't steal my business.

668
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,680
Boss, I'm here to get the books.

669
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,800
Don't steal my business.

670
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,880
Don't call me a double.

671
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,160
Come on.

672
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,960
Follow me.

673
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,400
I'm here to buy the books.

674
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,080
I heard that the Junshanji is in stock.

675
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,920
I don't know when I can buy it.

676
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,560
You like the people from the next mountain?

677
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,360
I like your books the most.

678
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,160
I'll read them all over again.

679
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,240
If the Junshanji arrives,

680
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,760
I'll buy a lot of books

681
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,360
and keep them at home.

682
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,440
Do you like the people from the next mountain?

683
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,640
I'm...

684
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,360
Miss,

685
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,680
we've paid the money.

686
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,560
Let's go back.

687
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,960
Uncle, auntie,

688
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm here to give you a gift.

689
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,440
Don't laugh.

690
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,440
Is this for me?

691
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,520
Uncle,

692
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,360
I...

693
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,320
I...

694
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,400
I'm Mengmeng.

695
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,800
Brother.

696
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,600
Thank you.

697
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,560
I have one, too.

698
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Happy now?

699
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,040
Take a breath.

700
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,120
Hi, Brother.

701
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,920
We've moved tickets.

702
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,320
How's the shooting?

703
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,200
Great.

704
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,280
You have a large allotment.

705
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,400
Do you want money now or later?

706
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,120
No.

707
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,440
I don't have money.

708
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,480
Please

709
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,200
Brother, sit here

710
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,120
Come, sit

711
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,720
I want to thank Master Lu and Shopkeeper Li

712
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,360
Xian and Tiantian

713
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,360
are all invited to the flowers show

714
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,840
Shopkeeper Li is working hard for the show

715
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,520
Xian and Tiantian are also doing their best

716
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,360
I'm so grateful for their support

717
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,880
We have nothing to repay them

718
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,760
Come, let's have a drink

719
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,760
I want to thank you too

720
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,840
Thank you, Xian and Tiantian

721
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
And Lu

722
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,200
Master Lu

723
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,480
You are so generous

724
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,840
You are the host of the flowers show

725
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,040
You have done so many glazes in a short time

726
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,920
Thank you, Xibao, Pan'er and Lu Yi

727
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,960
They are all helping me

728
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,920
Just for the show

729
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,520
Thank you

730
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,400
Thank you, Aunt Tao and Ake

731
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,640
Thank you

732
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,560
Ake is leading the show

733
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,640
He is the host

734
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,480
It's my pleasure to meet Ake

735
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,360
I'm so grateful for your appreciation

736
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,720
Xibao has to thank the guards

737
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,160
for promoting us

738
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,360
Ake is so smart and thoughtful

739
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,840
I'm afraid that the flowers show

740
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,560
will be too lively and exciting

741
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,440
Brother Lu, thank you again

742
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,160
I want to thank Brother Lu

743
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,000
for giving me the privilege

744
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,560
to be the host this time

745
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,000
Manager Li, you have worked hard this time

746
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,320
I heard from the boss

747
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,840
that you arranged the flowers show

748
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,120
I didn't expect that

749
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,880
you are not only beautiful

750
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,280
but also capable

751
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,880
Brother Shi is steady and capable

752
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,440
Thanks to him, Xibao

753
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,160
has helped me a lot

754
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,840
He did all the dirty and tiring work

755
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,320
I'm not tired

756
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,360
Brother Xian, Tiantian

757
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,160
I know

758
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,160
If it weren't for you

759
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,680
Ake couldn't have done

760
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,640
such a big thing

761
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,960
Come on, I thank you

762
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,120
Aunt Tao, you are too kind

763
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,800
Ake grew up with me

764
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,000
He is like a family

765
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,440
Ake's business is my business

766
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,040
The Shi family's business

767
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,720
is also the business of our He family

768
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,240
Okay, let's eat

769
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,600
Don't be polite

770
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,480
Yes

771
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,360
Ake, this is your favorite

772
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,440
I'll put it here

773
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,720
Thank you, Brother Xian

774
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,000
Brother Lu, try this

775
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,880
It's delicious

776
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,760
Thanks

777
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,440
Tiantian, try the fish

778
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,800
Brother Xian, don't you like fish?

779
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,880
Tiantian, eat more

780
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,520
Manager Li, this is very delicious

781
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,960
Try it

782
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,360
Thanks, Brother Shi

783
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,160
Manager Li, I'm sorry

784
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,120
You are young

785
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,400
and beautiful

786
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,480
Do you have a match?

787
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,640
Thank you for your concern

788
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,480
I...

789
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,920
To be honest

790
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,120
Xianfu has died for many years

791
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,480
He has never had a match

792
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,000
in these years

793
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,560
I'm a matchmaker

794
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,280
But I don't think

795
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,200
women are only meant to marry

796
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,720
As long as they don't indulge in old-fashioned business

797
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,880
No matter you marry or not

798
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,000
as long as you feel happy

799
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,120
Of course

800
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,040
Manager Li is kind and beautiful

801
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,880
He will be happy

802
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,280
Yes, Sister Pan'er

803
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Life is impermanent

804
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,920
If you meet someone you like

805
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,240
you will be happy

806
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
I'm not a woman

807
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
I'm a woman

808
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,920
I'm not a woman

809
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,520
If you meet someone you like

810
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,960
you will be happy

811
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,880
Thank you for your gift

812
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,600
I know the reason

813
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,840
But it's not easy

814
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,040
Manager Li

815
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,040
I think Ake is right

816
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,920
You are kind and beautiful

817
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,160
You will find your happiness

818
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,760
I...

819
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,840
Brother Xian

820
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,960
I also left you

821
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,400
the VIP tickets for the flowers show

822
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,360
You can check

823
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,800
if you have a woman you like

824
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,920
I...

825
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,960
Ake

826
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,640
I don't need the VIP tickets

827
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,920
because they are limited

828
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,280
You are old enough to get married

829
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,080
You should think about it

830
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,040
Ake

831
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,040
My brother won't

832
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,400
go to the flower show to find someone

833
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,240
He...

834
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,280
Since it's from Ake

835
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,560
I'll take it

836
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,560
Thank you, Ake

837
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,240
By the way

838
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,840
Brother

839
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,960
I'll give you a toast

840
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,120
Thank you for taking care of Sister Tianting

841
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,360
these days

842
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,520
Brother Xian, you're welcome

843
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,920
I should do this

844
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,520
I should give you a toast too

845
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,160
Thank you for your help

846
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,200
I know

847
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,240
You've always

848
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,040
treated me like your own sister

849
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,680
No

850
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,920
Yes

851
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Why is Brother Xian so weird?

852
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,000
Everyone

853
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,360
I believe Ake

854
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
can hold the flower show

855
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,840
successfully and successfully

856
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,360
Let's make a toast to him

857
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,600
Come on

858
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,600
Thank you

859
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,120
A toast to Ake

860
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,000
Okay

861
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,600
Don't just drink and talk

862
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,760
Eat more

863
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,640
Come on, eat

864
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,440
Thank you

865
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,000
Brother

866
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,600
Why are you still up so late?

867
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,040
Why are you still up so late?

868
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,840
Did I wake you up?

869
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,760
No

870
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,720
I couldn't sleep

871
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,160
It's probably because

872
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,040
the weather is too hot

873
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,400
You always say

874
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,760
you want to eat mung bean cake

875
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,880
Well

876
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,800
I'll make some

877
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,680
Then you can eat some

878
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,280
and send some to Aunt Tao

879
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,080
Okay

880
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,960
Thank you

881
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,880
Thank you

882
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,760
Thank you

883
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,520
Thank you

884
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,440
Thank you

885
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,320
Thank you

886
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,400
Send some to Aunt Tao

887
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,120
Okay?

888
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,160
Brother

889
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,080
Actually, we can see

890
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,400
what we've done today

891
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,480
Aunt Tao and Uncle

892
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,960
treat us like their own

893
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,400
Especially Uncle

894
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,200
Yes

895
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:58,880
Aunt Tao and our He family

896
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,160
have been friends for decades

897
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,160
It's not like Lu Chi

898
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,920
can win the country

899
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,040
with some money

900
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,080
It's just

901
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,120
Look at the situation

902
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,480
Ke seems quite close

903
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,720
with Lu Chi

904
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,240
Brother

905
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,720
You grew up with Ke

906
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,160
講婚價之事呢

907
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,280
It should be

908
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,720
taken from the elders

909
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,760
Of course they can choose

910
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,120
a perfectly man to be their wife

911
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,320
How about shameful parents?

912
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,480
In our times

913
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:29,960
even though

914
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,960
we had brothers from the Family Si

915
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,680
before the relationship

916
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,680
they still promised

917
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,640
to get married

918
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,160
under the terms of

919
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,640
a relationship

920
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,520
We all know

921
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
I just want to be a scholar

922
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,320
and hope that I can join the Shu Xiang family.

923
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,520
Even if I don't want to,

924
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,320
I still have to listen to my parents.

925
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,520
I know.

926
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,920
I know that Uncle and Aunt Tao are very protective.

927
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,520
The marriage arrangements arranged by my parents won't be wrong.

928
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,120
I also believe that Uncle and Aunt Tao

929
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,120
will choose a family that knows the roots and the roots.

930
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Okay, Tian Tian.

931
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,520
Hurry and rest. It's getting late.

932
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,320
When you wake up tomorrow morning, you'll have good food.

933
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,920
Okay.

934
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,120
Then you should rest early too.

935
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,520
Manager Li, I think what Aunt Tao said today is very true.

936
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,720
You've worked hard to get the Xibao Pavilion for so many years.

937
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,720
It's also good that I asked Ake to find you a loyal person.

938
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Thank you for your consideration.

939
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,520
It's just that I don't know if I can still meet someone who is loyal.

940
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,320
This loyal person, is he loyal to me?

941
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,320
If fate has brought us together, I will definitely go and disturb Junior Sister.

942
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
I believe that you will definitely meet her.

943
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,720
Why don't you look at the people around you?

944
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,320
Chief, I'll go back and rest first.

945
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,720
Luo Yi, you are crazy!

946
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,720
Brother.

947
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Luo Yi, you are not a maid. Why are you being so pushy?

948
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,520
Brother, how is the food?

949
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,520
It's not good enough that the He family is also going.

950
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,920
Oh.

951
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,120
So, you didn't see your father-in-law alone.

952
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,920
It seems that the Shi family is thankful to you,

953
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,520
but if they treat you as their son-in-law, I'm afraid that there is still a gap.

954
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,320
You are not the best candidate for being their only son-in-law.

955
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,720
Brother, you must work harder.

956
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,120
Do you have any method?

957
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,920
The best way is to just give it a try.

958
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,120
The Flower Session is the most important thing for Auntie Tao.

959
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,320
You must help Shi Mei Guan to hold the Flower Session well.

960
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,320
You must do it with a different mindset.

961
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,120
Naturally, you won't be able to get the love of your future mother-in-law.

962
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,120
And then?

963
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,520
You must be more proactive. You must be able to make a decision.

964
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Of course. If the Flower Session is held well,

965
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,520
and Auntie Tao still doesn't like you, then...

966
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,920
Then what?

967
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,720
Then... it's just that she simply doesn't like you.

968
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,520
What I mean is that a mother should look at her son-in-law more,

969
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,920
and compare him more, and make a more careful decision.

970
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,520
But what is done is done.

971
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,920
I believe that you will be able to successfully move your future mother-in-law's heart.

972
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,720
Really?

973
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,520
Don't worry, Brother. I will definitely help you marry Sister-in-law.

974
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,520
Come.

975
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,320
This is so beautiful.

976
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,920
It's so beautiful.

977
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,320
It's so beautiful.

978
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,920
This is so beautiful.

979
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,520
It's so beautiful.

980
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,520
It's so beautiful.

981
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,920
Come here.

982
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,120
Little Madam Wang, please come in.

983
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:22,720
Welcome.

984
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,120
Mr. Zhang, please come in.

985
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,920
Welcome.

986
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Please come in.

987
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,320
Thank you.

988
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,320
Thank you.

989
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,920
It's all in.

990
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,120
Please come in.

991
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,320
Little Ladies, you all dressed up today.

992
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,920
It's so beautiful.

993
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,520
Yes. Let's go. Let's go over and look for him.

994
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,520
Little Ladies, you're here.

995
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,920
Little Ladies, you're so beautiful today.

996
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,320
Little Ladies, you're also beautiful.

997
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,520
Come. Let's go.

998
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,320
I was a Taoist. Now, I'm a Shifang.

999
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,920
Can I never truly have Guan Mei Ting?

1000
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,920
I can never win her over.

1001
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,320
Thank you.

1002
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,920
Little Ladies, you're here.

1003
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,720
Please come in.

1004
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,320
Grandfather.

1005
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,320
Young Master, please come in.

1006
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,920
Please come in.

1007
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,520
Thank you for coming, Little Ladies.

1008
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,520
You're welcome.

1009
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,720
Ah Ke, your dress is so beautiful.

1010
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,720
And your hairstyle is very trendy.

1011
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,120
I feel like you're different from before.

1012
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,520
Am I?

1013
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,720
Grandfather, your dress is also very pretty.

1014
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,320
It's not because I listened to you.

1015
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,920
I was asked to go to Xibao Pavilion to customize it.

1016
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,320
Oh, right. After I mentioned your name,

1017
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,320
Head Li even gave me a discount.

1018
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,120
Speaking of this, I have to thank you.

1019
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,920
Where's Tiantian?

1020
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,720
Brother Lu.

1021
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,120
This is...

1022
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,520
This is my younger brother, Lu Zhu Xi.

1023
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,520
This is the organizer of the Flower Session, Shi Mei Guan.

1024
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,720
Oh? You're Shi Mei Guan?

1025
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:24,920
I know this encounter is the secret of fate

1026
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:31,720
Every time I see you, I only have a lovely stubbornness

1027
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:38,720
Although I can't remember every single word

1028
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,720
I can't remember every single word

1029
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,720
Although I can't remember every single word

1030
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:57,720
I never forget the first time I saw you

1031
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,320
Even if there's no star, no sky, no sun, no night

1032
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
It doesn't matter if it's windy or cold

1033
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,320
As long as you're never afraid, never shy, never worried

1034
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,600
Never worried about the

1035
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,600
No matter in this world or in the other

1036
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,120
Whether there will be any border

1037
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:25,320
I'm willing to protect you with my life

1038
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:29,920
Even if I can't remember every single word

1039
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,920
No matter in this world or in the other

1040
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,120
I'm willing to protect you with my life

1041
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,320
The sky is always looking at you

1042
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,720
Even if the sky is blue or blue

1043
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,120
It doesn't matter if it's the same as before

1044
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:52,720
Please remember the youth that was once so pure

1045
00:47:52,720 --> 00:48:02,120
From now on, I don't want to part with you
