[Episode 22]

3
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,000
Once the supplies arrive,

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,979
we'll have a long battle with them.

5
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,550
Even if we can't defeat them,

6
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,150
we'll have to wear them down.

7
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,070
But I'm worried that

8
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,220
if this lasts too long,

9
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,870
we might not be able to hang on.

10
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,820
Don't worry.

11
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,550
We certainly won't just sit there
waiting for death.

12
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,440
Zhuxi.

13
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,020
I've just thought of a plan

14
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,980
that can dampen their spirits.

15
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,460
Our army is greatly outnumbered.

16
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,470
We need to fully utilize

17
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,940
the terrain advantages of Mount Qianya.

18
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,110
The eastern terrain is flat,

19
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,790
which is unfavorable for us.

20
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,460
Hurry up!

21
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Take a team and set up an ambush here.

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,090
Shoot the arrows!

23
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,150
Pretend to attack.

24
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,380
Then just fake a retreat from a defeat

25
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,640
and lure them beneath the western cliff.

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,770
Retreat!

27
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,790
Chase them!

28
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,460
Yes!

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

30
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,500
The rest of you
should fight the enmey with me

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,230
and set up an ambush
at the western mountain pass.

32
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,690
Shoot!

33
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,910
Shoot the arrows!

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,510
Everyone,
aim carefully and shoot the arrows!

35
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,780
Retreat! Hurry up!

36
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,520
Chi.

37
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,920
Ke has been arrested.

38
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,240
Is there no justice in the capital now?

39
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm going to reason with them.

40
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,460
Let's go!

41
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,140
Kexian, calm down.

42
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,790
They arrested her without any evidence.

43
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,490
Do you think they'll listen to the reason?

44
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,620
I've sent a letter to Chief about this.

45
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,740
However,

46
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,180
the journey is long.

47
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,230
In the Military Headquarters Prison,

48
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,490
I don't know whether Ke can hang in there.

49
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm going to
the Military Headquarters now.

50
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,840
If they dare to give Ke a hard time,

51
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,890
I'll take her out of there forcibly.

52
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,050
-Calm down.
-Xianxian!

53
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,630
Your parents and Qin'er are still at home.

54
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,360
If you're so reckless,
not only will you be unable to save her,

55
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,080
but you'll also get yourself into trouble.

56
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,409
Won't that make everyone worry about you?

57
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,460
Everyone, please calm down.

58
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,790
Let's think clearly first.

59
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,220
They clearly came prepared,

60
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,480
and they outnumber us.

61
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,880
We can't use force.
We can only use our wits.

62
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,159
The Military Headquarters
is abusing its power like this.

63
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,710
But they still have to be reasonable.

64
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,820
If we can also put some pressure on them,

65
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,660
perhaps there's still hope.

66
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,370
Even if Ke can't be released,

67
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,710
we can at least ensure
that her life won't be in danger.

68
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,570
How about this?

69
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,140
I'll go to the magistrate's office
to see Lord Zheng

70
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,240
and ask him to smooth things out
at the Military Headquarters.

71
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,150
That's a good idea.

72
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,830
Let's go.

73
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,630
That's not enough.

74
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,880
That lieutenant said
he came here under the imperial decree.

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,490
If someone really gave the order,

76
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,840
I'm afraid even the magistrate's office
has no authority to intervene.

77
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,260
What should we do then?

78
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,870
If we can gather

79
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,470
all of Ke's former clients

80
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,030
and ask them
to intercede for her together,

81
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,960
Ke might be able to be released

82
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,240
from the Military Headquarters Prison.

83
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,280
We need someone with prestige

84
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,770
to help us now.

85
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,930
Miss Cheng.

86
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,860
Miss Cheng from Jiangning's Dream

87
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,430
is His Majesty's sworn sister.

88
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,310
In addition,

89
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,520
Xu Ao,
Commander of the Imperial Cavalry Bureau,

90
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,760
is His Majesty's internal official.

91
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,260
One of them
is a member of the imperial family,

92
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,450
while the other
is a high-ranking official.

93
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,510
If they intervene,

94
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,850
they can surely protect Ke
from suffering in prison.

95
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,630
Okay. I'll go find Lord Xu.

96
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,650
Then Chongshan and I will
go find Miss Cheng.

97
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,890
I'll go prepare some money.

98
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,390
Just let me handle the bribery matters.

99
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,030
Okay.

100
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,650
Lu Yi will protect Mr. and Mrs. Shi.

101
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,080
If there's any news from Chief,

102
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,450
I'll inform you all immediately.

103
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,280
There's no time to waste.

104
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,750
Let's go.

105
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,310
Wait!

106
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,600
There's something we still don't know yet.

107
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,790
Who on earth did Ke offend?

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,750
Ke has always been pure-hearted and kind
since childhood.

109
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,350
She has made friends everywhere.

110
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,500
How could she possibly offend anyone?

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,350
Indeed.

112
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,640
Ke is a helpful girl

113
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,800
and is quite honey-tongued.

114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
How would she offend anyone?

115
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,370
It's Marquis Wu'an.

116
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,260
What?

117
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,630
Previously,

118
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,050
Marquis Wu'an pretended to be Mr. Lin Yuan
to get close to me.

119
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,980
If Ke hadn't exposed him in time...

120
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,990
Anyway,
in terms of having a grudge against Ke,

121
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,450
he's the only person I can think of.

122
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,210
The Military Headquarters
sent people here.

123
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,950
It's probably him indeed.

124
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,330
But we have no evidence.

125
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,500
In that case,

126
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,930
Ke once embarrassed Marquis Wu'an

127
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,400
during Miss Cheng's matchmaking event.

128
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,880
Then it's probably him indeed.

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,740
But Marquis Wu'an has such a noble status

130
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,159
and holds military power.

131
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,409
If it's really him,

132
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,700
what should we do then?

133
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,820
Ke.

134
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,950
I'll definitely find a way to protect you.

135
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,630
Ke has been arrested by Marquis Wu'an.

136
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,780
What did you say?

137
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,980
Miss Cheng,

138
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,080
we're still not quite clear

139
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,590
about the reasons behind this.

140
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,980
It's just our speculation.

141
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,530
We need your help.

Lord Xu.

My sister
offended Marquis Wu'an previously.

146
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,180
A few days ago, Marquis Wu'an asked people

147
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,039
to arrest my sister for no reason.

148
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,870
Now our Shi family is at our wits' end,

149
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,510
so we would like to ask for your help.

150

What crimes did Ke commit?

Yeah. Why did they arrest her?

Is there any misunderstanding?

Yeah. There must be a mistake.

The Military Headquarters
arrested Ke for no reason.

Your dear Lu has fled after the defeat.

336
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,430
As long as you send him a letter,

337
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,790
asking him to reveal the location
of the Emperor's army,

338
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,240
I'll spare both your lives.

339
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,510
Lord Marquis, haven't you noticed?

340
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,330
I mean nothing to Lu Chi.

341
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,850
Look. It's been so many days.

342
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,980
Have you seen anyone coming to save me?

343
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,720
Do you really think that

344
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,340
I'm more important
than the fate of the nation?

345
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,770
You don't appreciate my kindness at all.

346

That's great.

What about the others?

Don't worry, Kexian.

Miss Cheng is willing to help.

355

why they're so brazenly

I'm afraid this time,

we can only find another solution.

When has she ever suffered
like this before?

It's all my fault
for being useless as her eldest brother.

Since you're so sincere,

502
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,460
I'm more than happy
to bring true lovers together.

503
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,650
Thank you, My Lord.

504
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,620
But I have one more request.

505
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,270
What else do you want?

506
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,610
I hope that you can allow me to see Ke.

507
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,180
As Ke has been pampered since childhood,

508
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,110
I wonder how she's doing in prison.

509
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,370
After meeting her,

510
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,770
I'll persuade her to give up Lu Chi

511
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,930
and let the Shi family work for you.

512
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,460
You are indeed a clever man, Mr. He.

513
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,270
Alright.

514
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,120
I'll grant your request.

515
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,750
Let them meet each other.

516
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,410
Thank you, My Lord.

517
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,230
Mr. He, please.

518
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,380
Mr. He, please.

519
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,730
Kexian, how did you get in here?

520
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,800
Please allow me to speak with Ke alone.

521
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,240
Of course.

522
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,590
You're Lord Marquis's honored guest.

523
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,450
We can't be disrespectful to you.

524
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,700
Let's go.

525
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,150
Ke, how are you?

526
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,760
How did you get in here?

527
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,200
How did you become
Lord Marquis's honored guest?

528
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,180
Have you...

529
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,680
become Marquis Wu'an's follower?

530
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,440
Lord Marquis is famous and powerful
in the imperial court.

531
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,040
A wise man submits to fate.

532
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,660
Why can't I be Lord Marquis's follower?

533
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,270
Marquis Wu'an is full of wild ambitions.

534
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,620
How could you help this villain?

535
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,570
Kexian.

536
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,170
I'm so disappointed in you.

537
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,220
Ke.

538
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,750
In my mind,

539
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,860
your safety is the most important.

540
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,280
I don't care about all the state affairs.

541
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,540
I just want to save you out of here.

542
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,130
That won't be necessary.

543
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,330
I've got used to staying in this prison.

544
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,720
I just didn't expect that you would...

545
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,220
From now on,

546
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,980
you and I are not friends anymore.

547
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,620
-Leave now! Leave!
-Ke.

548

549
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,500

-Let go of me!
-Ke!

552

Beware of eavesdroppers.

00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,330
Lu Chi.

555
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,460
I want you to do me a favor, Mr. He.

556
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,530
What makes you think I'll agree?

557
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,660
I can ask no one but you to do this favor.

558
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,080
It's about Ke.

559
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,620
What is it?

560
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,820
After I returned to Mount Qianya,

561
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,750
Ke has been targeted by Marquis Wu'an.

562
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,750
If he's in a desperate situation,

563
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,130
no one knows what he might do.

564
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,720
Please take care of Ke for me

565
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,170
and protect her.

566
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,990
You don't need to ask me to do that.

567
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,790
I'll certainly take care of her.

568
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,700
In times of danger,

569
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,200
just tell them
I'll lead troops to attack the capital

570
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,130
for the purpose of keeping Ke safe.

571
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,440
Lu Chi will bring troops
back to the capital.

572
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,520
Then what should we do now?

573

Lu will soon

578
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,690
lead his troops to attack the city.

579
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,410
Then Marquis Wu'an will be beheaded.

580
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,600
You won't end up well, either.

581
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,700
Ke, don't be so stubborn.

582
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,080
Lu Chi can barely protect himself now.

583
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,010
Marquis Wu'an is destined to be the ruler.

584
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,620
I think you've lost your mind.

585

Shi Fa'ke is indeed feisty.

586
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,340
I really don't understand

587
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,800
why Lu Chi and He Kexian like her so much.

588
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,030
I don't want to hear it.

589

590

I don't want to see you again.

As long as you do as I say,

592
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,190
I can let you out.

Yes, I have.

But Ke is still young.

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,070
It may take some time for her
to accept this matter.

603
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,590
But don't worry, My Lord.

604
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,720
I will certainly persuade her properly.

605
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,070
Oh, by the way, Ke has said that

606

Hurry up!

672
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,510
Mr. Huang!

673
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,200
Where is she?

674
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,900
Hurry!

675
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,750
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

676
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,720

677
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,630

678
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,550
A confidential letter.

679
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,110
Hurry!

[Chi is dead.]

681
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,510
Lord Marquis, there's more.

682
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,570
This is Lu Chi's personal belonging.

683
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,020
[Shi Fa'ke]

Heaven is helping me!

686
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,600
Let me ask you.

687
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,830
Is there any news from the palace lately?

688
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,720
My Lord,

689
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,240
there has been no movement
from that person lately.

690
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,370
I've heard he's often missing
from his bedchamber, too.

691
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,980
I think he probably knows that

692
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,240
his good fortune has run out,

693
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,280
so he has escaped first to survive.

694
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,030
In that case, what are we waiting for?

695
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,380
Pass my order.

696
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,510
Get ready to enter the palace.

697
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,180

[Marriage]

699
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,780
We'll have to make do with
staying here tonight.

700
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,070
Actually, I think

701
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,880
the condition here is too bad for you.

702
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,400
How about I walk around to see

703
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,190
if there's a farmhouse
where we could stay?

704
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,880
No need.

705
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,780
I think this place is fine.

706
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,610
There's fire to keep us warm.

707
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,960
Also,

708
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,120
you're here to talk with me.

709
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,490
By the way,

710
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,300
you saved me again today.

711
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,380
Thank you.

712
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,520
Miss Qiyue, no need to thank me.

[Marriage]

714

[Marriage]

715
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,139
What are you thinking about?

716
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
I'm thinking that

717
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,590
actually, we are destined
to meet each other often.

718
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,219
We met each other unexpectedly
again and again.

719
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,290
[Marriage]

720
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,840
And we managed to
escape danger every time.

721
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,600
Miss Qiyue, your every twinkle and smile

722
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,460
have always been in my mind.

723
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,360
Actually, I want to tell you that...

724
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,400
However, what if one day,

725
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,670
you discover that the person you know

726
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,080
isn't the real me,

727
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,190
but someone else?

728
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,370
What would you do?

729
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,580
What if one day,

730
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,320
you discover that the person you know

731
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,800
isn't the real me, either?

732
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,110
What would you do?

733
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,320
I asked you first.

734
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,510
[Marriage]

735
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,440
Then let me tell you.

736
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,720
No matter who I am and who you are,

737
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,060
to me,

738
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,900
you will always be Miss Qiyue.

739
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,010
It's all my fault for implicating you.

740
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,970
Otherwise,

741
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,110
you wouldn't need to
be in this awful place.

742
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,960
But I'm willing to be implicated by you.

743
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,000
What did you say?

744
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,760
I said...

745
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,900
Actually, I think this place

746
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,000
is quite nice.

747
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,150
It's quiet and relaxing.

748
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,250
Oh, by the way,

749
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,510
I forgot to ask you.

750
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,880
Why did those thugs

751
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,500
keep chasing you today?

752
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,760
To be honest with you,

753
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,710
I actually ran away from home.

754
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,960
You ran away?

755
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,800
I didn't want an arranged marriage,

756
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,330
so I ran away from home.

757
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,760
Then I met Ke,

758
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,780
and she took me in.

759
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,110
Do you think...

760
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,460
No, Miss Qiyue.

761
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,760
I think we have even more in common now.

762
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,430
I ran away from home, too.

763
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,730
Really? You also escaped marriage?

764
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,900
My situation is actually more complicated
than just escaping marriage.

765
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,800
However,

766
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,070
Ke once told me something.

767
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,710
Not marrying someone you love

768
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,280
will never bring happiness.

769
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,080
So,

770
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,920
I think you did the right thing.

771
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:35,080
I once saw a painting by Mr. Lin Yuan.

772
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,820
There are such words in it.

773
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,970
May I be like a star
and you be like the moon.

774
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,580
Then we can shine together every night.

775
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,670
Do you know what those words mean?

776
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
I think I do.

777
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,620
Meeting you deepens my feelings.

778
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,940
I only regret not meeting you sooner.

779
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,020
I'll go gather some more firewood.

780
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
I'll go with you.

I asked people to take good care of you.

784
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,850
May I ask what brings you here today?

785
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,630
I'm here today

786
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,630
to tell you something very important.

787
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,710
And it's good news.

788
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,920
Good news?

This...

792
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,560
is the seal Lu carved for me.

793
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,630
So you can recognize it?

794
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,960
I'm here to tell you that

795
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,110
your dear Lu Chi

796
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,680
is dead.

797
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,690
Don't you think

798
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,470
this is wonderful news?

799
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,940
That's impossible.

800
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,150
Stop lying to me!

801
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,430
This seal

802
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,220
was found on Lu Chi's corpse.

803
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,310
There's no falsehood at all.

804
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,570
Among all those items
that could prove his identity,

805
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,030
Lu only left this seal.

806
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,900
Could it be that he isn't...

807
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,150
Lu must be safe now.

808
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,450
The seal is just a strategy
to deceive Marquis Wu'an.

809
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,140
I can't let Marquis Wu'an find out.

join Lu Chi in the netherworld.

00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,580
Marquis Wu'an.

841
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,310
Why are you here?

842
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,440
Brother.

843
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,070
You truly want to rebel against me.

844
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,250
Why am I here?

845
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,230
This is my bedchamber.

846
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,560
If I'm not here,

847
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,170
where else should I be?

848
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,940
But look at you.

849
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,470
You brought troops into the palace
to seize power and rebel.

850
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,800
What punishment do you deserve?

851
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,460
What punishment do I deserve?

852
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,230
What punishment do I deserve?

853
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,830
Have I committed any crimes?

854
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,920
Brother.

855
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,510
The outcome of our battle
is already decided.

856
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,170
Not only this imperial palace

857
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,370
but also your throne belongs to me now.

858
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,490
Maybe I'll be the one to punish you!
