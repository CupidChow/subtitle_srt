00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,630
Yan Qiyue.

171
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,930
How did he know Qiyue?

172
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,880
Lu told him again?

173
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,350
This... this may not be appropriate.

174
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,370
What's inappropriate about it?

175
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,150
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

176
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,730
I can't act as your matchmaker.

177
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,850
Why not?

178
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,559
The creed
of the No.1 matchmaker in the world:

179
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,700
be an honest matchmaker
and achieve matchmaking with honesty.

180
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,280
Qiyue is in love with someone.

181
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,620
She has long wished to marry Mr. Lin Yuan.

182
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,090
She just doesn't know
how Mr. Lin Yuan feels.

183
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,770
I can't force her to accept someone else.

184
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,510
Besides, Qiyue recently met a gentleman

185
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,770
in the capital.

186
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,480
They're like-minded.

187
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,230
Now Qiyue likes Mr. Lin Yuan

188
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,400
and Mr. Huang.

189
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,220
Before she understands her own feelings,

190
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,890
it's not appropriate for her to marry you.

191
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,660
Your Majesty, please be clear.

192
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,690
Miss Shi, lift your head.

193
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,930
Mr... Mr. Huang?

194
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,810
So His Majesty is Mr. Huang.

195
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,990
Actually, regarding Mr. Lin Yuan's matter,

196
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,790
I have heard something about it.

197
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,620
But according to what you said,

198
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,840
Qiyue...

199
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,820
Yan Qiyue

200
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,440
is being unfaithful. Is that so?

201
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,020
No, Your Majesty. I just...

202
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,510
You don't need to explain.

203
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,570
Shi Fa'ke,

204
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,640
what nonsense did you just say?

205
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,520
Miss Shi,

206
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,550
I order you to test Yan Qiyue for me.

207
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,210
If she loves me,

208
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,320
I'll be willing to make her the empress.

209
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,730
If she doesn't love me,

210
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,980
I'll be willing to set her free.

211
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,470
You may leave.

212
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:03,750
I...

213
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,420
Yes.

214
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,840
[16 years old]

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,670
[16th birthday: a set of phoenix coronet
and vermilion hairpins,]

216
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,340
[with a verse
from the Book of Songs attached.]

217
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,230
Lu.

218
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,650
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

219
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,480
Come, sit down first.

220
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,040
Sit before we talk.

221
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,990
Tell you what?

222
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,460
His Majesty is Mr. Huang.

223
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,700
Mr. Huang that Qiyue met is His Majesty.

224
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,580
Now His Majesty wants to marry Qiyue,

225
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,200
and he asked me to be his matchmaker.

226
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,040
But Qiyue is still fixated
on Mr. Lin Yuan.

227
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,340
And Qiyue is...

228
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,980
She is...

229
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,490
Everything is a mess now.

230
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,700
What should I do?

231
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,230
No matter who Miss Yan is,

232
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,710
His Majesty can marry her.

233
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,450
Besides,

234
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,340
wouldn't it be good
if His Majesty marries Miss Yan?

235
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,400
Then Miss Yan wouldn't have to

236
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,820
worry about who to marry.

237
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,890
It's supposed to be a good thing,

238
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,330
but I didn't know anything

239
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,460
and talked nonsense
in front of His Majesty.

240
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,380
And now,

241
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,530
he ordered me to find out how Qiyue feels.

242
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,950
Lu, it's all your fault.

243
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,210
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

244
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:25,840
How...

245
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,160
How should I tell you?

246
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,100
Now look,

247
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,790
I'm completely out of ideas.

248
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,040
Ke, you're the clever one.

249
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,510
You'll think of a way.

250
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,560
I really don't know
how to solve this difficult problem.

251
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,340
If someone can help me solve this problem,

252
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,000
I'd agree to anything he asks.

253
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,650
Lu, you're willing to help me?

254
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,630
You still need to solve it yourself.

255
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,070
But I can tell you something

256
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,330
that might be helpful.

257
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,330
His Majesty is Mr. Lin Yuan.

258
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,260
I'm going to Qiyue now.

259
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,900
[Qiyue, you are a princess.
You should prioritize state affairs.]

260
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,570
Is this my destiny?

261
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,620
Fated to marry him.

262
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,370
Qiyue.

263
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,270
Qiyue, what's wrong?

264
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,680
Ke,

265
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,330
Father sent a letter to me, asking me

266
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,620
to make a sacrifice for Gaoyou's people.

267
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,720
Trade between the two states is urgent.

268
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,040
If my marriage

269
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,190
delays it,

270
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,110
Gaoyou will...

271
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,400
Father insists
I marry Liang State's emperor.

272
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,380
Marry the emperor?

273
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,460
Then...

274
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,300
Qiyue, don't be sad.

275
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,590
I have good news for you.

276
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,600
What good news could there be for me?

277
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,710
I found Mr. Huang.

278
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,330
He...

279
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,740
He said...

280
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,310
What did he say?

281
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,410
You found him?

282
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,900
He said he wants to marry you.

283
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,260
And,

284
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,050
I found Mr. Lin Yuan too.

285
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,460
Mr. Lin Yuan?

286
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,800
He also said he wants to marry you.

287
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,040
But what difference does it make?

288
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,340
I am a princess.

289
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,230
I grew up with fine clothes, nice food,

290
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,910
and the people's respect.

291
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,830
I should shoulder the responsibility
that comes with it.

292
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,480
I can't ignore my father's request

293
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,280
or abandon the people of Gaoyou.

294
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,760
Qiyue,

295
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,900
I understand all this.

296
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,410
But trade between the two states

297
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,170
doesn't have to come
at the cost of your marriage.

298
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,700
Listen to your heart.

299
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,100
If you weren't a princess,

300
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,360
what would you choose?

301
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,050
Father,

302
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,670
I beg you.

303
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,810
You love the people very much

304
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,020
and care deeply about the state.

305
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,050
I understand that.

306
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,720
May the heavens bless Gaoyou

307
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,640
with peace, prosperity,

308
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,900
and great fortune.

309
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,600
Everything is ready.

310
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,440
I just need to wait for Ke to come.

311
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,210
Lu.

312
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,200
Ke.

313
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,650
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

314
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,200
Wait.

315
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,970
I have something to tell you,

316
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,850
but only you can know this.

317
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,910
You can't tell anyone else,

318
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,240
especially His Majesty.

319
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,040
I swear I won't tell anyone else.

320
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,380
Qiyue is Gaoyou's princess.

321
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,390
Miss... Miss Yan is Gaoyou's princess?

322
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,830
But Ke,

323
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,600
isn't that a good thing?

324
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,330
Why can't I tell anyone else?

325
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,380
Well... Mr. Huang is the emperor.

326
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,010
Qiyue is Gaoyou's princess.

327
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,360
They're in love with each other.

328
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,730
It should have been a perfect union.

329
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,320
But now both of them are troubled.

330
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,390
Troubled?

331
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,290
Qiyue has feelings for Mr. Huang,

332
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,950
but...

333
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,610
she can't let go of Mr. Lin Yuan.

334
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,920
And she's torn between love and duty.

335
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,200
And His Majesty

336
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,950
doesn't know if Qiyue truly loves him.

337
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,950
