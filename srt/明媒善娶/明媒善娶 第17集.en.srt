[Information Card]

00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,780
Some people can't be refused.

5
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,380
Ms. Fang, I will never agree to this.

6
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,250
I'd rather die
than marry someone I don't love.

7
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,040
Please leave now.

8
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,770
Please leave.

9
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,190
Ms. Fang, wait.

10
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,490
You know very well that Miss Cheng
already has someone she loves,

11
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,400
so why are you still delivering
the Marquis Wu'an's Information Card?

12
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,470
The Marquis Wu'an
sincerely wishes to marry her.

13
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,190
I was hired as his marriage broker,

14
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,390
so it's my duty to secure
a satisfactory marriage for him.

15
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,450
Why are you doing this?

16
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,780
Is someone forcing you?

17
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,050
I've already told you.

18
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,590
Miss Cheng has someone she likes

19
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,270
and she has entrusted me
with her marriage arrangements.

20
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,150
Miss Shi,

21
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,670
there's no rule in the agency
about one matchmaker per person.

22
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,470
It would be wonderful if Cheng Ruoning
could marry the one she loves,

23
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,800
but if they're not meant to be,

24
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,190
why shouldn't I be involved
in this matchmaking case?

25
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,310
I believe that in our agency,

26
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,730
we should help each other
and let those who are capable take charge.

27
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,310
Arranging more successful matches
for our clients

28
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,580
is our true purpose.

29
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,540
Ms. Deng,

30
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,730
there's no rule saying one matchmaker
gets exclusive rights to a client.

31
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,180
Besides, our agency

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,550
should indeed help each other

33
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,090
and let those who are capable take charge.

34
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,720
Miss Shi, do you have
anything else to say?

35
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,860
Yes.

36
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,150
Why the Marquis Wu'an?

37
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,310
He's not a good match for Miss Cheng.

38
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,310
Do you know what kind of person he is?

39
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,150
As matchmakers,
we must treat everyone equally.

40
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,640
Whether they're nobles or commoners,

41
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,700
as long as they come
to us for matchmaking,

42
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,220
we should do our utmost to help them.

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,610
Moreover, the Marquis Wu'an's
talents and family background

44
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,810
are well matched with Cheng Ruoning's.

45
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,360
But doesn't Miss Cheng's
own wishes matter?

46
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,260
Ms. Fang,

47
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,420
I will definitely help Miss Cheng

48
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,020
be with the person she loves.

49
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,010
My Lord Marquis
has long admired your reputation, Miss,

50
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,230
and wishes to invite you
to his residence for a meeting.

51
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,470
That won't be necessary.

52
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,300
I have no prior connection
with the Lord Marquis.

53
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,610
Please leave.

54
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,709
The Lord Marquis
simply wishes to know you better.

55
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,570
If you're unwilling to come,

56
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,610
that's fine too.

57
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,990
Perhaps we could invite

58
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,840

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,000
Why are you here?

65

Take this money
and leave the capital immediately.

66

Don't let me see you again,

67
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,520
and stop performing in public.

68
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,730
In short,

69
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,840
I don't want to hear anything about you.

70
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,450
What did Miss Shi tell you?

71
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,500
I actually...

72
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,320
Didn't you understand what I just said?

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,120
Leave the capital immediately.

74
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,990
I no longer have feelings for you.

75
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,120
I'm getting married.

76
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,120
That man can help me
restore my family's fortune

77
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,520
and keep those wolf-like relatives at bay.

78
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,890
If you stay in the capital,

79
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,460
and if by chance

80
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,550
the foolish things
I confessed to you get out,

81
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,080
my marriage will be ruined.

82
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,980
I don't want your money.

83
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,860
Since you've made yourself clear,

84
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,100
I will leave.

85

is caring less and less
about good omens these days.

What do you think this painting means?

91
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,850
I can only see one big word: poverty.

92
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,040
That's right,

93

where are you going?

How could she bear to let you go?

You've waited for
each other for ten years.

why are you leaving now?

128

I'm leaving right away.

129

Give me a little more time.

Why does Young Master Qiujiang
intend to leave?

He said he's leaving because of you.

141
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,820
Are you in some kind of trouble?

142

Or is someone forcing you to do this?

No.

it will be too late.

Once he's gone, he'll be safe.

151

Is this person Marquis Wu'an?

152

Miss Cheng,

153
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,120
Marquis Wu'an is not a kind person.

154
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,550
Even if Young Master Qiujiang is gone,

155
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,690
he won't be safe.

156

170
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,540
Marquis Wu'an wanted to marry her

171
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,720
and pressured her to comply.

172
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,610
She had no choice
but to make you leave the capital.

173
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,890
She feared Marquis Wu'an
would discover her feelings

174
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,030
and you would be in danger.

175
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,290
Her feelings for you are truly profound.

176
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,120
So the person Ruoning mentioned

177
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
was actually him.

178
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,270
Young Master Qiujiang,

179
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,480
why not go to Mount Qianya
to lay low for a while?

180
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,580
Yes, Lu has friends there

181
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,010
who will take care of you.

182
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,100
I'm not leaving.

183
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,780
You're not leaving?

184
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,430
If I hadn't known about this,

185
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,920
I would never come back to the capital.

186
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,570
Now that I know,

187
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,890
even if it means death,

188
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,070
I will never leave Ruoning alone

189
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,080
in danger.

190
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,590
So I absolutely refuse to leave.

191
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,750
If that's the case,

192
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,440
Lu, let's quickly take him back.

193

However, Young Master Qiujiang's
previous lodging

194
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,530
is probably no longer safe.

195
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,920
Leave it to me.

196
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,940
I'll arrange a safe place
for Young Master Qiujiang

197
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,960
to stay for a few days

Marquis Wu'an is here.

505
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,100
So these two are my opponents today.

506
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,720
It seems my victory is assured today.

Please, everyone take a seat.

508

officially begins.

513
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,410
Today we have
four selected young gentlemen.

514
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,130
Why are there four?

515
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,270
What's going on?

516
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,750
Why are there four?

517
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,550
I have no idea.

518
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,020
Mr. Lu Chi,

519
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,350
the Marquis Wu'an,

520
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,870
Mr. He Kexian,

521

and

522
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,640
Young Master Qiujiang.

523
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,100
-Young Master Qiujiang?
-Young Master Qiujiang?

524
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,750
Young Master Qiujiang?

525
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,440
He's a famous performer
at the Flower House.

526
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,200
So many people would pay

527
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,680
a fortune just to hear him perform,
and he might still refuse.

528
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,480
Why is he here?

529
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,820
He wants to marry his own boss?

530
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,920
Is he trying to marry up

531
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,480
to save himself 20 years of hard work?

532
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,720
He wants to marry his own boss.

533
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,980
Marquis Wu'an has status

534
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,470
and an impressive background.

535
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,410
He has power and wealth.

536
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,610
How could a pretty face ever compare?

537
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,310
With everyone watching,

538
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,830
I doubt Marquis Wu'an would dare

539
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,700
to do anything inappropriate.

for each other all along?

542
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,690
Everyone, please quiet down.

543
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,350
Today's Spouse Selection Event

544
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,030
is to find a suitable match

545
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,430
for Miss Cheng Ruoning.

546
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,790
So what kind of man

547
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,750
do you think is worthy of Miss Cheng?

548
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,310
And what kind of husband

549
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,520
does Miss Cheng wish to choose?

550
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,310
A handsome one.

551
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,970
One with power and influence.

552
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,750
The Cheng family
is as wealthy as a nation.

553
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,370
For Miss Cheng,

554
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,020
money isn't the most important thing.

555
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,610
So what kind of man does Miss Cheng want?

556
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,830
Miss Cheng is well-educated,

557
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,000
so naturally she wants someone

558
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,530
she can have
meaningful conversations with.

559
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,060
Yes.

560
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,390
This is very important.

561
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,880
Miss Cheng has been all alone

562
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,510
managing such a vast family business.

563
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,750
She's successful in business,

564
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,440
but her home life is quite lonely,

565
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,300
so she needs the warmth of a family

566
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,630
and a partner's care.

567
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,480
Therefore, she needs
someone who's family-oriented

568
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,810
and can take care of her.

569
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,330
And this person can't be without talent.

570
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,110
Otherwise, they won't be
on the same wavelength as Miss Cheng

571
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,700
and they'll have nothing to talk about.

572
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,760
A poor couple faces endless sorrows.

573
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,910
Honestly,

574
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,480
only with money
can you have shared interests.

575
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
I really envy Miss Cheng.

576
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,550
I think Miss Shi makes perfect sense.

577
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,940
Too much gold and jewels
is meaningless,

578
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,750
you can't take it with you when you die.

579
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,880
It's better to have someone

580
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,220
who truly cares about you.

581
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,240
Indeed.

This competition
has three rounds in total,

with a point system.

586

The winner and runners-up of each round

Excellent.

Fair and just.

594

Oh, one more thing.

595
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,790
The most important part of loving someone

596
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,520
is to stay loyal
and see things through to the end.

their points will be reset to zero,

However, the text
that Lord Marquis has written

comes from Guanzi,
Chapter 48 on Governing the State.

00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,659
completely captivating Miss Cheng.

671
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,670
[Score List]

672
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
One point scored.

673
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Mr. He has lost the chess match.

674
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,520
Zero points.

675
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,810
To win Miss Cheng's heart,

676
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,670
you must first win her stomach.

677
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,139
If her future husband

678
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,699
can cook delicious food,

679
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,159
it would certainly be icing on the cake.

680
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,159
So for this round,
we'll compete in culinary skills.

681
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,449
Nonsense!

682
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,940
I am the current Lord Marquis,

683
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,110
how could I
engage in such crude activities?

684
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,570
I could easily find the finest chefs
in the land for Miss Cheng.

685
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,640
Besides,

686
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,930
what ambitious man

687
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,630
would want to spend
his days among pots and stoves?

688
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,910
That's right,

689
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,190
how could a man cook in the kitchen?

690
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,360
What's wrong with
cooking for someone you love?

691
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,150
"Once unversed in household chores,

692
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,150
I now cook for you with all my heart."

693
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,550
If pampered young ladies

694
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,000
can wash their hands
and cook for those they admire,

695
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,400
why can't men do the same?

696
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,500
Everyone has their own aspirations.

697
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,070
You're just a street vendor
selling pancakes,

698
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,470
of course you don't care.

699
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,880
I have never set foot in a kitchen.

700
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,320
The dishes don't need to be exquisite,

701
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,030
what matters most is the intention.

702
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,710
If the Lord Marquis finds this difficult,

703
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,640
you can forfeit.

704
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,680
Fine, I'll forfeit this round.

705
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,910
My Lord, are you sure about this?

706
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,670
Your score for this round will be zero.

707
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:43,570
You...

708
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,980
Gentlemen, please proceed.

709
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,890
They're really going to cook.

710
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,490
Even if I participated, I'd lose.

711
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,110
Why embarrass myself?

712
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,760
Lord Marquis, you're wise.

713
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,030
I always thought

714
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,920
Young Master Qiujiang's hands
never touched menial work,

715
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,540
I never expected he could cook so well.

716
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,920
This is hardly a man's job.

717
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,110
The Lord Marquis
is meant for greater things,

718
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,570
how could he do such tasks?

719
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:59,590
Surprisingly, all three of you
have impressive culinary skills.

720
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,210
Now I invite Miss Cheng
to taste and comment.

721
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,480
To ensure the fairness of the competition,

722
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,160
we will also select

723
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,450
three people from the audience to taste.

724
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:26,190
Young Master Qiujiang's
dishes taste wonderful.

725
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,740
They have a very

726
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,440
homey flavor.

727
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,320
Mr. Lu's cooking style is unique,

728
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,090
this egg white chicken is delicious,

729
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,130
but this tofu...

730
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,510
What's wrong with this tofu?

731
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,310
It's sweet and quite delicious.

732
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,660
It's made according to your taste.

733
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Mr. He truly lives up to his reputation
as the owner of He's Bakery.

734
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,630
These pastries
are not only exquisitely crafted,

735
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,290
but also have a unique flavor.

736
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,170
After Miss Cheng's final decision,

737
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,920
Mr. He's superior skills
have won by a narrow margin,

738
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,760
making him the winner.

739
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,550
Great!

740
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,550
Well-deserved indeed.

741
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,440
Young Master Qiujiang's
dishes have a homey flavor,

742
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,900
earning him second place.

743
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,540
Lu Chi, Mr. Lu, takes third place,

744
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,650
earning one point.

745
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,730
The Lord Marquis,
having failed to prepare any dishes,

Lord Marquis,
you'll need to step up your game.

753
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,740
Child's play.

754
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,960
Lord Marquis!

755
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,510
Lord Marquis, please don't be angry.

756
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,360
Shi Fa'ke

757
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,440
mentioned when
announcing the rules earlier

758
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,750
that if you forfeit or withdraw,

759
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,150
your points will be reset to zero.

760
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,950
Lord Marquis.

761
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,960
You'll never have
another chance to marry Miss Cheng,

762
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,710
please reconsider, My Lord!

763
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,330
Next is the final round
of this competition:

764
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,270
Mind Reading.

765
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,880
Mind Reading.

766
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,480
What does that mean?

767
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,230
What's that about?

768
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,230
What does it mean?

769
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,690
Women's thoughts are more delicate.

770
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,030
As they say, "May I win one true heart,
and never part till our hair turns white."

771
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,000
No matter how skilled you are in arts,

772
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,550
or how delicious your cooking is,

773
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,590
if you don't understand
Miss Cheng's feelings,

774
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,790
that won't do either.

775
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,850
Next, Miss Cheng will ask a question,

776
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,960
and the four Young Masters
please answer truthfully.

777
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,630
-I will win this round.
-Miss Cheng has written down the answer.

778
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,550
Whoever shares
the same thoughts with Miss Cheng

779
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,350
will be the winner of this round.

780
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,100
A husband chosen by this method

781
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,550
will be truly compatible.

782
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,870
That can't be wrong.

783
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,760
Yes, indeed.

784
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,670
This round tests

785
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,150
who shares
the same thoughts with Miss Cheng.

786
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,820
So,

787
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,940
what's Miss Cheng's favorite opera lyric

788
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,710
from all the verses?

789
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,140
That's too difficult!

790
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,960
Gentlemen, please write your answers.

791
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,810
[Though I can't bear...]

792
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,610
[Clouds rise in morning, curl by night...]

793
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,310
Lord Marquis finished first,

794
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,730
so let's start with him.

795
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,210
Though I can't bear to part,
I must let go;

796
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,900
Though our hearts are tied,
we still must go.

797
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,680
Great!

798
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,010
Next, Mr. He.

799
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,280
Soft threads of sunlight drift
through the quiet courtyard.

800
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,230
Spring sways gently,
like floating strands of silk.

801
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,320
Next, Mr. Lu.

802
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,030
From atop the wall and on horseback,

803
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,430
we looked toward each other from afar.

804
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,280
This is good! This is good!

805
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,610
Also excellent poetry.

806
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,300
Last one, Young Master Qiujiang.

807
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,910
Clouds rise in morning, curl by night,
like the heart's pool, beyond our might.

808
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,770
Its ripples tell the tale of love.

809
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,400
Now let's

810
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,360
announce Miss Cheng's answer.

811
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,370
She's going to announce the answer.

812
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,470
[Clouds rise in morning, curl by night,
like the heart's pool, beyond our might]

813
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,360
Miss Cheng's answer is

814
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,570
[Its ripples tell the tale of love]

815
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,230
"Clouds rise in morning, curl by night,
like the heart's pool, beyond our might."

816
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,480
"Its ripples tell the tale of love."

817
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,020
This...

818
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,400
It matches word for word!

819
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,500
Could they have colluded?

820
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,440
It's cheating!

821
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,230
That's definitely cheating!

822
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,360
How could such a coincidence be possible?

823
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,040
Cheating.

824
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,650
Miss Shi just explained everything to us,

825
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,880
and besides,
we all witnessed it with our own eyes,

826
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,000
how could it possibly be cheating?

827
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,520
Exactly!

828
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,230
They couldn't have colluded.

829
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,960
Exactly.

830
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,480
Young Master Qiujiang
scores 3 points in this round.

831
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,200
Good.

832
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,650
Mr. Lu and Mr. He answered well,

833
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,440
each earning 1 point.

834
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,130
Great!

835

Marquis Wu'an didn't score any points.

836
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,020
All three rounds
of the competition have concluded.

Therefore, the winner
of this competition is

843
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,070
Young Master Qiujiang.

844
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,900
Great!

845
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,190
Well done, Young Master Qiujiang.

846
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,390
Well, a well-deserved victory indeed.

847
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,500
Yes, I didn't expect it.

848
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,760
It would be settled so quickly. Look.

849
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,330
Young Master Qiujiang
has won the fair lady's hand.

850
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,880
According to the competition rules,

851
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,000
I shall write
a Wedding Letter for the couple.

852
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,150
From now on, their engagement is official,

853
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,240
and Young Master Qiujiang may
choose a date to wed Miss Cheng.

854
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:31,880
Wait.

855
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,270
Miss Cheng, let me ask you.

856
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,010
Are you really going to
marry Young Master Qiujiang?

857
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,800
Beware. You may fail to stay together,

858
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,530
and end up torn apart by life and death.

859
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,220
She not only will marry me,

860
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,010
but

861
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,360
I will certainly stay with her for life.

862
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,140
Guards!

863
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,460
This marriage
was completed with everyone's witness

864
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,510
and received everyone's blessings.

865
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,570
I hope that you candidates

866
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,240
will not seek revenge

867
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,320
just because you weren't chosen.

868
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:21,760
Yes.

869
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,330
Exactly.

870
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,710
As a man,

871
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,010
how could he do this?

872
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,030
If you lose, you lose.

873
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,030
How could anyone
resort to such petty revenge?

874
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,960
Exactly.

875
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,630
Great! Well said.

876
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,640
Shi Fa'ke, you'll see what's coming.

877
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:42,980
Let's go.

878
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:46,990
Move aside.

879
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,020
Step back.

880
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,840
Everyone, make way.

881
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,850
Look how embarrassed he is, slinking away.

882
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,260
Congratulations to both of you
on getting what you wanted.

883
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,240
I will remember

884
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,210
your great kindness forever.

885
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,330
Thank you all for your help.

886
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,770
No need to thank us.

887
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,490
If you must thank someone,

888
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
thank Ke instead.

889
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,500
[Flower House]

890
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,320
Thank you for your great help, Kexian.

891
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,450
Ke, there's no need
to be so formal with me.

892
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:29,550
I'm just glad I could help you.

893
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,770
Of course you did.

894
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,990
Kexian, you've been a tremendous help.

895
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:34,550
Today at the arena,

896
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,150
your performance was excellent.

897
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,690
You're talented and handsome,

898
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,530
and you can even make desserts.

899
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,010
Your virtues are simply countless.

900
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,920
You're truly the most eligible bachelor

901
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,120
for all the young ladies in the capital.

902
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,690
Ke, do you really think so?

903
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,620
Of course.

904
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,650
I bet

905
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,920
the threshold
of our Official Matchmaking Agency

906
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,320
will be worn down
by all those young ladies.

907
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:03,680
Ke.

908
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,550
I have something to do. I'll go first.

909
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,370
Alright, I'll come
thank you again tomorrow.

910
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,020
Fine.

911
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:19,670
Let's go.

912
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:20,070
Let's go.

913
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:20,530
Come on.

914
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,060
Today went exceptionally well.

915
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,220
Lu,

916
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,920
if it weren't for Young Master Qiujiang

917
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,070
who truly connects with Miss Cheng,

918
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,470
I think with your points,

919
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,610
you would have won.

920
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,230
No,

921
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,300
you're the only one
I want to marry in this lifetime.

922
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,080
Then you'll need to work harder, Lu.

923
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,870
I promise I won't
keep you waiting anxiously.

924
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,860
Who's waiting anxiously? Not me!

925
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,670
You're anxious, but I am.

926
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,010
I'm eager to put into action

927
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,830
everything that was said on stage.
