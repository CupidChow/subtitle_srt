00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,380
The cleanest girl Xiao Yu Tu

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The Love by Hypnotic

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 4

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Brother Lu.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is...

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is my brother, Lu Zhu Xi.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is the organizer of the White Flower Society,

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the Junior Officer.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You are the Junior Officer?

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is the daughter of the Prime Minister.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My good sister, Zhu Yan Yan.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Young Master Lu,

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
how old are you?

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you have a match? What kind of young lady do you like?

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This young lady,

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
we seem to have a good relationship.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Have we met before?

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
My sister loves to read.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She read the picture books on the market.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She hurt her eyes for this.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Young Master, don't blame her.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I wonder if this young lady

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
has read the military book of the next mountain.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's okay if you don't mention her.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm angry when you mention her.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I finally bought the military book.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's clearly old and new.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's been a month and half without writing.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't let me know who the next mountain is.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If I know,

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll arrest her and lock her up in my study.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then I'll take a small whip every day

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and beat her. I'll beat her like this.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll beat her like this.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
My sister likes to joke.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She's not usually so fierce.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Please.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ake.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I have something to do. I'll go first.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You...

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That way is fine.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Young lady,

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Zhu...

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They say that the Prime Minister's family is well-educated.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The Prime Minister's legitimate granddaughter is just like this.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They are all people who are high and low.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Young lady, actually,

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
that painting...

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yanyan.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yanyan.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Young master, this is my good friend.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yanyan,

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
where is your Zhu Yizhi?

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
She was just here.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yizhi.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This Zhu Yizhi,

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
she doesn't usually see people.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She's not here to buy flowers.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hi, Tiantian.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You guys talk first.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll go over there.

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Tiantian, how can Zhu Yizhi

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
leave you here alone?

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Forget it.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Tiantian.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We haven't gotten married yet.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If we get married, someone will laugh at us.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's not right.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
A couple should contact more and contact more.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So that after they get married, they won't feel that their temper is not good.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
My marriage was fixed when my parents were alive.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now that my parents are dead,

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
even if they don't have a good temper,

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
who should I talk to?

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Tiantian.

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yizhi.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Where is Tiantian? You shouldn't go over there to accompany her.

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Brother Chongshan, you came just in time.

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Tiantian,

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think that this 12th brother

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
is much better than that Zhu Yizhi.

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you can't do it,

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you can't get married.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But if it's not easy to get married,

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you can marry into the Shi family.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The aunt of the Shi family is nice.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The second brother wants to love you since he was a child.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If he is willing, he will definitely marry you.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yanyan, don't talk nonsense.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are just reading too much.

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There is a big heaven and earth in this book.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm right.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Enough, Brother Chongshan.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're even shy.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Little lady, you're here.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're getting prettier.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Come inside.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's really a dream.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Over there. Hurry up.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Really. If you're not a family, you won't get married.

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All of this is your own doing.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wait.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't blame me this time.

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Thank you for coming tonight.

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I announce that

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Xibao Flower Festival

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
officially begins.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Good.

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Look.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Look.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Look at that.

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Thank you for coming to Xibao Flower Festival.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I hope that everyone

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
can find their destined one today.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Next, let's welcome

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the owner of Xibao Pavilion, Lu Chi.

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Good.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank you for your support

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
for this festival.

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Xibao Pavilion will give away

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
a ticket to every friend who attends the festival.

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In addition, in this festival,

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
you can find your beloved wife or son.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
As long as you ask the guard to be your matchmaker,

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Xibao Pavilion

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
will give away a ticket to the bride and groom.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Good.

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you for your kindness.

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Next, let's welcome the second sponsor,

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the owner of the shop, He Kexian.

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Brother Kexian.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you.

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We are the same.

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
As long as we ask the guard to be our matchmaker,

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the new one will get

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the wedding gift.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Good.

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you, boss.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're welcome.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Thank you, boss.

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Please wait.

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I think everyone has already understood

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the rules of the exhibition.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Now, I'd like to invite you to watch it.

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Bravo!

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Bravo!

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Bravo!

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Bravo!

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Everyone,

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
in front of each bride,

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
there is a life-giving jade lantern.

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The young masters with names on the jade lanterns

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
can all go up one by one.

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If the young lady likes it,

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
she can light the jade lantern.

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The one who lights the lantern can ask

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the young master for his choice.

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If the young master is interested in the answer,

187
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
he can continue to light the lantern.

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If he likes it, he can blow out the jade lantern.

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If the young lady likes it too much,

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
what should he do?

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This young master asked well.

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All young masters

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
can choose one of the young ladies

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
to choose the one they like the most.

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You can invite him to go to the garden

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and talk about the land.

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you don't have it,

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
you can give up the right to choose.

199
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If you give up the right to choose, you won't find the one you like.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes.

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If you don't find the one you like here,

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
you can go back and look.

203
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Write down your name.

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Throw the lantern into the water.

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Give the marriage to the heavens.

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
See if you can get the lantern

207
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
of the one you like.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Who is the one who gets the lantern

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
of the one you like?

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Maybe it's a coincidence.

211
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What if the man gets the man

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and the woman gets the woman?

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Look at you.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes.

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
In life, it's not only about marriage.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Women have a secret friend.

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Men also have friends who know the Tao.

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If you get the same sex,

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
let's drink and chat together.

220
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Wouldn't it be nice to have a friend?

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Great.

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Good.

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Ke is really different.

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
A while ago,

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
he only looked at people around him

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and made a mess.

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Today, he can hold such a grand event.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He didn't have a good reputation before.

229
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But today,

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
he did it very well.

231
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I know it very well.

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But he is always

233
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
confused about his own affairs.

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He has a bad taste.

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No. I think Ke has a good taste.

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Look at Mr. Lu.

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He is handsome and handsome.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
My brother is not bad.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Brother Xian is good.

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But it depends on who Ke likes.

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Right?

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This time,

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
the ladies and gentlemen are too enthusiastic.

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There are many people.

245
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We can't arrange

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
the part of the Liuli Lantern.

247
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But to let everyone find a good match,

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
we have a new part

249
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
for the ladies and gentlemen.

250
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Of course,

251
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
the ladies and gentlemen

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
should not be discouraged.

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There are flowers every year.

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If you need it,

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you can hold it several times a year.

256
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The official media will find a good match for you.

257
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The following part

258
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
will be hosted by me and Mr. Lu.

259
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The flowers are sent out.

260
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Great.

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Then,

262
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
the ladies and gentlemen

263
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
who are in this part should come on stage.

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Zhu Yizhi?

265
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes.

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Listen,

267
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the first round.

268
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The ladies and gentlemen

269
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
will vote for the lake together.

270
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The person who votes will get

271
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
the gift box and the dessert gift box.

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Tiantian, don't be angry.

273
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I will give you an explanation

274
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
when I take it back.

275
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Brother Lu.

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This part is for the one

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
who hasn't been married yet.

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,400
He is Tiantian's fiance.

279
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,040
He signed up behind Tiantian's back

280
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,000
and got on the stage.

281
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,400
He even stared at other ladies.

282
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,240
He is so embarrassing.

283
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,480
He is really too much.

284
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,880
I will make him give up.

285
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,560
Really?

286
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,840
Don't worry, Ake.

287
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,720
The first pot begins.

288
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,040
Look.

289
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,200
Okay.

290
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,480
Not this time.

291
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,560
We didn't make any eclipse!

292
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,240
Again?

293
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,560
Again?

294
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,760
I was afraid you'd hit the cup.

295
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,600
You got lucky!

296
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,800
How can you do that?

297
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,480
You're so bad!

298
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,240
Great!

299
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,520
Great!

300
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,200
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,840
The second round.

302
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
Liu Liping is the lead.

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,360
The next couple, please come up to the stage.

304
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,080
I'll do it.

305
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,760
She dares to go?

306
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,280
Liu's Yours

307
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,320
Thank you.

308
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,440
It's one thing I feel embarrassed for.

309
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,920
What is going on here?

310
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,280
Ah!

311
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,120
Try this.

312
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,600
Stand on it!

313
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,840
Sun Dian.

314
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,400
The start of today's party

315
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,600
Let's begin.

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,600
Great!

317
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,640
Every young lady has a glazing lamp.

318
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,440
If there's a young man you like,

319
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,920
you can light the glazing lamp.

320
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
Lighting the lamp means you're willing to

321
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,640
get to know him

322
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,720
and get to know him.

323
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,880
If you turn off the lamp, you won't be angry.

324
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,760
If you leave the lamp until the end,

325
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,440
the young man will have the same thought.

326
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,880
The two of you will be in love.

327
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,160
You can get the gift from Xi Bao Pavilion

328
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,800
and enjoy the spring in the neighboring city.

329
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,960
Great!

330
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,400
You're so good at it.

331
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,280
Amazing!

332
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
You're so good at it.

333
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,160
Yeah.

334
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,560
Now, let's welcome the young men.

335
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,400
Great!

336
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,960
Next, let's welcome the first young man.

337
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,720
Mr. Lu of Xi Bao Pavilion,

338
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,800
Lu Zhu Xi.

339
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,440
Ladies and gentlemen,

340
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,320
please make a bow.

341
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,960
I'm Lu Zhu Xi.

342
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,240
I like to travel and read books.

343
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,640
I also like to write.

344
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,520
I'm afraid that

345
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,960
you don't know

346
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,480
who I am.

347
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,320
Please introduce yourself.

348
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,280
Please make a bow.

349
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,400
This is my brother, Lu Zhu Xi.

350
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,920
He's young and free.

351
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,400
He's kind and handsome.

352
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,640
His biggest advantage is that he's talented.

353
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,280
As for his shortcomings,

354
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
I haven't thought about it yet.

355
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,680
Now, it's time to ask questions.

356
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,600
If you have any questions,

357
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,520
you can ask.

358
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,040
After listening to Mr. Lu,

359
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,280
you can decide whether to light the lantern for him.

360
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,680
Mr. Lu,

361
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,760
Xi Bao Pavilion is your family property.

362
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,160
Do you have the right to inherit it?

363
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,880
Family property belongs to my brother.

364
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,080
I don't live on the money in the family.

365
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,480
I have no right to inherit it.

366
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,200
Mr. Lu,

367
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,560
who is your favorite painter?

368
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Who is your favorite painter?

369
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,360
Junior,

370
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,880
I have a talent to perform.

371
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,840
I want to sing a poem.

372
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,200
Mr. Lu will show you his talent.

373
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,400
Please.

374
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,240
Good.

375
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
The wall is broken in front of the stage.

376
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,000
The wedding ceremony will be held tomorrow.

377
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,000
The bride will be born with a golden son.

378
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,920
Let's see if the bride will be happy.

379
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
It's interesting.

380
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
It's interesting.

381
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
It's interesting.

382
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,840
Good.

383
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,000
It's interesting.

384
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,840
Mr. Lu, it's really interesting.

385
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,680
Right?

386
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
It's interesting.

387
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
It's interesting.

388
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,960
I'm afraid only one person knows this poem.

389
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,560
Only one person knows it?

390
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
Who knows it?

391
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
Only one person knows it.

392
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Who knows it?

393
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,560
Fine.

394
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,360
How about I decide

395
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
whether to light the lantern?

396
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,960
You can light the lantern.

397
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
You can light the lantern.

398
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
I don't understand.

399
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,960
He has a new style.

400
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Right.

401
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Really.

402
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
It's so easy.

403
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Right.

404
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
They understand it.

405
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
Yan Yan, what's this poem about?

406
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,960
You know Mr. Lu's poem.

407
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Yes.

408
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,960
This is a poem in the last book of the next mountain.

409
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,360
I didn't expect Mr. Lu to recite it well.

410
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
It's a poem in the last book of the next mountain.

411
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Right.

412
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
It's really interesting.

413
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Good.

414
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Good.

415
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Next, let's welcome the second young master.

416
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Lu Yi from Xibao Pavilion.

417
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Hello, everyone.

418
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm a staff of Xibao Pavilion.

419
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
My name is Lu Yi.

420
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Lu Yi is my subordinate and my family.

421
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
I know him very well.

422
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
He is loyal and kind.

423
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
He is smart and capable.

424
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Mr. Lu, you can tell that

425
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Mr. Lu is very upright

426
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
and a responsible man.

427
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
These qualities are very important

428
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
in marriage.

429
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Ladies, please ask questions.

430
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Mr. Lu, I want to ask

431
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
if you have real estate in the capital.

432
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Where is the real estate?

433
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
How much can you get if you get married?

434
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
I don't have real estate yet.

435
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,960
But I have a professional plan.

436
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
I also saved 450 taels of silver

437
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
to buy a house with a vegetable garden in the city.

438
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
As for the betrothal gifts,

439
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
I'm willing to do whatever I can.

440
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
But there is no 500 taels of betrothal gifts

441
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
after buying the house.

442
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Let's just forget it.

443
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
This young lady

444
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
is clearly a good thing for the target.

445
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
But she shouldn't be too harsh

446
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
on others.

447
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Mr. Lu is a good man.

448
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
He has a plan for life.

449
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
You don't like him.

450
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
But he may be a good choice

451
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
for others.

452
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Thank you for your advice.

453
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
I will pay attention to it.

454
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
Ladies,

455
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
as a matchmaker,

456
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
I also often hesitate.

457
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Is it good to be rich and rich?

458
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,960
Or is it good to be ordinary?

459
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Here,

460
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
I also want to say something psychological.

461
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
Marriage is not a business.

462
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Marriage is a promise.

463
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
A promise is a lifetime.

464
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
A good marriage

465
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
is the most important thing

466
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
between two lovers.

467
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Money is not the first standard of judgment.

468
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
You are right.

469
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
You are right.

470
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
You are right.

471
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
You are right.

472
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Okay, ladies.

473
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Please make your decision.

474
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

475
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Miss Qin Er

476
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
has lit the lantern for you.

477
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
I want to ask

478
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
why you

479
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
lit the lantern for me?

480
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
I...

481
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
I like to bring

482
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
food to the ground.

483
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Good.

484
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Good.

485
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
So romantic.

486
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
I also want to have food to the ground.

487
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Mr. Lu,

488
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
I also want to

489
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
No.

490
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
I...

491
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
I want to

492
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
perform a talent

493
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
for Miss Qin Er.

494
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Please.

495
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Good.

496
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Good.

497
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Good.

498
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Good.

499
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Amazing.

500
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Good.

501
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Good.

502
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
The flowers show

503
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
held by Miss Shi

504
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
is really good.

505
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Manager Li,

506
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
do you want to

507
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
have a walk?

508
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
It's great, right?

509
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Okay.

510
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Tiantian,

511
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
do you want to

512
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
go to the three-star hotel?

513
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Okay.

514
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
I'm sorry.

515
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
Thank you.

516
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
I announce

517
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
the lantern lighting session

518
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
of Xibao Flower Festival

519
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
is over.

520
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
Good.

521
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Good.

522
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Good.

523
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Good.

524
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Good.

525
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Good.

526
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Everyone,

527
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
this time,

528
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
a total of six teams

529
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
successfully selected

530
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
the young lady and young master.

531
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Congratulations to them

532
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
for winning the prize of traveling in the morning.

533
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
All the sessions of the lantern lighting session

534
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
have ended.

535
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Next,

536
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
young ladies and young masters

537
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
can attend the lantern lighting session.

538
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
I hope you can

539
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
find the one you like.

540
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
See you at the next lantern lighting session.

541
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Good.

542
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Good.

543
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Good.

544
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Let's go over there.

545
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
The lantern lighting session is great.

546
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
This place is great.

547
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
It's great.

548
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Look.

549
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
It's great.

550
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Let's go.

551
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Let's go.

552
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Let's go.

553
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Let's go.

554
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Let's go.

555
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Let's go.

556
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Let's go.

557
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Look over there.

558
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
It's very crowded.

559
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Let's go.

560
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Let's go.

561
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
Let's go.

562
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Let's go.

563
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Let's go.

564
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Let's go.

565
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Give it to me.

566
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
This lantern lighting session

567
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
is a great opportunity.

568
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Ke,

569
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
this is all your contribution.

570
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
You must have achieved a lot.

571
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Thank you, Brother Lu.

572
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Thanks to so many people who helped me,

573
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I was able to get the right to be the organizer.

574
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
It went so smoothly.

575
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
The lantern lighting session

576
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
has gathered everyone's efforts.

577
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
I have something to tell you.

578
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Brother Lu,

579
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
why didn't I hear you say

580
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
that you have a younger brother?

581
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
This is the first time I've seen him.

582
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Do you want to know more about me?

583
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
I...

584
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
I didn't mean that.

585
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
I was thinking

586
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
if I could borrow another pair of plum-flavored socks.

587
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
My younger brother is smart and sharp.

588
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
He has many tricks.

589
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
I don't know which lady

590
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
can subdue him.

591
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
What is love in this world?

592
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
It's only about one thing after another.

593
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
I think Yan Yan and your brother

594
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
are very close.

595
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Brother Lu, don't worry.

596
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
I will definitely give your brother

597
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
a good chance.

598
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
What about me?

599
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Brother Lu, if you are willing,

600
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
I can also help you

601
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
find a good match.

602
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
First of all,

603
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
you should be active

604
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
and decisive when you are chasing after your wife.

605
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
I didn't mean that.

606
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
I just want to...

607
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Tian Tian.

608
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Tian Tian is over there.

609
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Ake?

610
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Brother,

611
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
go and find Ake.

612
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
I'll just go and have a look.

613
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
But...

614
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
But Zhu Yi Zhi

615
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
has completely disappeared.

616
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
I'm worried about you.

617
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Brother,

618
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
just go.

619
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Don't worry.

620
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
I'm here.

621
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
I'll be with Tian Tian.

622
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Go.

623
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Thank you, Ake.

624
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
Ake,

625
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
I'll take you to a fun place.

626
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Let's go.

627
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
It turns out that our flowers

628
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
are so grand and brilliant.

629
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
And everyone is smiling.

630
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
They are smiling so happily.

631
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Yes, it's beautiful.

632
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Brother,

633
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
come on.

634
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Brother,

635
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
look.

636
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
There are lanterns over there.

637
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Do you like it?

638
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
It's so beautiful.

639
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Tian Tian,

640
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
I'm here.

641
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
I'm here.

642
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
I'm here.

643
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
I'm here.

644
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
I'm here.

645
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Why don't I go with you

646
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
to find Zhu Yi Zhi?

647
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
No need.

648
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Forget it.

649
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
Why?

650
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Look.

651
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Yan Yan and Mr. Lu

652
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
are of the same interest.

653
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
They are very similar.

654
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
I'm different from Zhu Yi Zhi.

655
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
I'm afraid he doesn't like me.

656
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
I don't have any

657
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
close feelings for him.

658
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Neither do we

659
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
have any common interests.

660
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Even so,

661
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
why bother to make it difficult for each other?

662
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
If in the future,

663
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
after we get married,

664
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
I can't

665
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
close my eyes all the time.

666
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
I won't be sad.

667
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Tian Tian,

668
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
you shouldn't

669
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
be so wronged.

670
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
If he dares to

671
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
betray you in the future,

672
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
I will...

673
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
I won't agree

674
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
with Brother Xian.

675
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
I won't.

676
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Brother,

677
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
I understand

678
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
how good you are to me.

679
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
But it doesn't matter

680
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
if I fail or not.

681
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
I just hope

682
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
you can find a girl

683
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
you like.

684
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Don't be like this.

685
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Tian...

686
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Brother Lu,

687
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
look.

688
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
A shooting star.

689
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Make a wish.

690
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Hurry up.

691
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
Stars have a soul.

692
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
May I stay with A Ke

693
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
forever.

694
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Stars have a soul.

695
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
I hope Brother Lu

696
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
can get what he wants.

697
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
I wish

698
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Brother Lu

699
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
can get what he wants.

700
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
I wish

701
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Brother Lu

702
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
can get what he wants.

703
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
What wish did you make?

704
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
You can't tell me.

705
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
If you tell me,

706
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
it won't come true.

707
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Fine.

708
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
I won't tell you.

709
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I will make it come true

710
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
if you tell me.

711
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
You have a kid?

712
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
I want to give you a kid.

713
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
You have a kid?

714
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
The next mountain.

715
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,360
Miss Zhu, please go first.

716
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,360
Mr. Lu thinks

717
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,160
Junshan is not with Cai Feng.

718
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,360
Should we

719
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,760
send the knife to the next mountain?

720
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,960
It's indeed a good idea.

721
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,960
But I think Junshan is too weak

722
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,560
and should be alone.

723
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,560
In the next episode,

724
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,160
Cai Feng will torture him

725
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,560
and make him sit on the wheelchair

726
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,160
and regret for life.

727
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,360
I think

728
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
he will regret for life.

729
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,560
You even know that?

730
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,360
Then the next mountain person is actually

731
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,160
my friend.

732
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,160
Really?

733
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,560
You...

734
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,760
You are friends with the next mountain person.

735
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,960
It means you can understand him.

736
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,160
By the way,

737
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,360
I heard from the bookstore a few days ago

738
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,160
that the film has been written.

739
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,560
But there is no print yet.

740
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
After a few days,

741
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
the book will be on sale.

742
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,360
Let's go shopping together.

743
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,160
Okay.

744
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,960
Mr. Lu,

745
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,160
since you are friends with the next mountain person,

746
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,760
can you help me urge him

747
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,360
to update the book?

748
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,160
Okay.

749
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,160
I will urge him.

750
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,360
But...

751
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
But what?

752
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Miss Zhu likes the next mountain person so much.

753
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,560
Is it...

754
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,160
Do you want to ask me

755
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,560
if I should give him a good impression

756
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,160
or not?

757
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,960
Let me put it this way.

758
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
I like to eat Heji's snacks.

759
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,760
But I never thought of

760
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,160
being close to Xiange.

761
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
For example,

762
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,560
I like to listen to Mr. Qiu Jiang's opera.

763
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
But I don't expect

764
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,760
to get along with him every day.

765
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,760
In fact,

766
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,160
the person he likes

767
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,960
can make us feel happy.

768
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,760
But marriage

769
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,160
is like what Ake said.

770
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
We should find

771
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,960
someone who can make us feel happy

772
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,160
and be willing to spend our lives together.

773
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,360
Mr. Lu,

774
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,960
can you understand

775
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,160
what I am saying?

776
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
I understand.

777
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
Then...

778
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,560
I have one more thing to tell you.

779
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
What is it?

780
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,360
I wonder when you will be free.

781
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Let's go to the next town together.

782
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,760
We can go there together.

783
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
Well...

784
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,160
I need to tell my grandfather

785
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,560
about this.

786
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,360
Okay.

787
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
I will wait for you.

788
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,960
Then I will go to Ake first.

789
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Okay.

790
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,760
I must find a chance

791
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
to make it clear to my beggar brother.

792
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
Brother Lu,

793
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,160
we have been here for so long

794
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,360
but we didn't welcome my brother and friends.

795
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,960
How about we go down?

796
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,760
Why are you so angry?

797
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,360
If we don't go down,

798
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,160
they will come to catch us.

799
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
Then

800
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,760
they will know

801
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,960
our little secret tonight.

802
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
I will take you down.

803
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
I am sorry.

804
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,360
Okay.

805
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,360
I am sorry.

806
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,360
I am sorry.

807
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
I am sorry.

808
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
I am sorry.

809
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
I am sorry.

810
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,360
I am sorry.

811
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
I am sorry.

812
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
I am sorry.

813
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
I am sorry.

814
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
I am sorry.

815
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
I am sorry.

816
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
I am sorry.

817
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
I am sorry.

818
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
I am sorry.

819
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
I am sorry.

820
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,360
I am sorry.

821
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,360
I am sorry.

822
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
I am sorry.

823
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
I am sorry.

824
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,360
I am sorry.

825
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,360
I am sorry.

826
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360
I am sorry.

827
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
I am sorry.

828
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,360
I am sorry.

829
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
I am sorry.

830
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
I am sorry.

831
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
I am sorry.

832
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
I am sorry.

833
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
I am sorry.

834
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Brother Xian.

835
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Brother.

836
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
Why didn't I see you on stage today?

837
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Do you have a woman you like?

838
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
Yes.

839
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
Really?

840
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Did she come today?

841
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
I will help you to check her mouth.

842
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,360
Brother.

843
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Actually, the person I like...

844
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
Brother.

845
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Let me ask you.

846
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
You and Boss He are like brothers and sisters.

847
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,360
If you are the woman Boss He likes,

848
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,360
what should you do if you don't like her?

849
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
I grew up with Brother Xian.

850
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
I like what he likes.

851
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
Even if I don't like her,

852
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
as long as they are in love,

853
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
I will support them.

854
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Brother Xian, don't worry.

855
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
I will tell you everything.

856
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
By then,

857
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,360
I will definitely do a good job for you.

858
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
You can save money for tea and water.

859
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
No need.

860
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
It's still too early to say these now.

861
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
It's not too early.

862
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
You should have told me earlier.

863
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
I could have prepared earlier.

864
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
Right?

865
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Let's talk about it later.

866
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
I will go for a walk.

867
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
You two.

868
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Let's go for a walk too.

869
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,360
Let's go.

870
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
How can I get to the garden?

871
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Please help me find a way.

872
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Miss Zhu.

873
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
It's you, Deng Shoumei.

874
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
Please find a way for me.

875
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Don't move.

876
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
I'm not moving.

877
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
I'm not moving.

878
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
I'm not moving.

879
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,360
I'm not moving.

880
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
Don't move.

881
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Miss Zhu.

882
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
I know that

883
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
you have a bad eye.

884
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
If you can't see clearly,

885
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
I can understand.

886
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
But what about the others?

887
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,360
Why are you all so arrogant?

888
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
You can't see me at all.

889
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Why are you all

890
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,360
surrounded by Shiba Ke?

891
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Fine.

892
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
Then I will show you today

893
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
who I am.

894
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
You are not as good as Ake.

895
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
You are a bad person.

896
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
You lost your money.

897
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
You can't even

898
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
defeat a little Shiba Ke.

899
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
I think

900
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
you should give up

901
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,360
your position as the guard.

902
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,360
Let the people know.

903
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
I'm the guard.

904
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
I'm the guard.

905
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,360
I'm the guard of Guanmei Hall.

906
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
I'm the guard.

907
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
I'm the guard.

908
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,360
The guard is me.

909
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,360
No one can replace me.

910
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
Help.

911
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
Help.

912
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Help.

913
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
Help.

914
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Help.

915
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Help.

916
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,360
Help.

917
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Look.

918
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
The moon is bright.

919
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
Water.

920
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Water.

921
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
Water.

922
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
Water.

923
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
It's too dangerous here.

924
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Let's go out.

925
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
No.

926
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
I can't go.

927
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
I'm the leader of the White Wolf Society.

928
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
Anyone can go.

929
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
I can't.

930
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,360
I want to save others.

931
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Chief.

932
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,360
What's up?

933
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
The situation is too serious.

934
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,360
There are people inside.

935
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Take Qin'er out first.

936
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
I'll call the Water Dragon Team.

937
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
No.

938
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
It's too dangerous here.

939
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Listen to me.

940
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
Go to call the Water Dragon Team.

941
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
Qin'er, go with Lu Yi to find the bodyguard.

942
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
Listen to me.

943
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Go with Lu Yi first.

944
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Go.

945
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Help.

946
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
Help.

947
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
Help.

948
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
Over there.

949
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
What's going on?

950
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
What's going on?

951
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Hurry up.

952
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
It's too dangerous here.

953
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
Manager Li.

954
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
I'll go out with you.

955
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Don't come back.

956
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
I'll take you to save others.

957
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
Okay.

958
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
You go with Qin'er.

959
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
I'll go with you.

960
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Hurry up.

961
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Go.

962
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Don't panic.

963
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
I'm the bodyguard of the government.

964
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,360
Shi Xianxian.

965
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
Come with me.

966
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
I'll take you out.

967
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
Yes.

968
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Don't panic.

969
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Follow the bodyguard.

970
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
He'll take us out.

971
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
Thank you, bodyguard.

972
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
Thank you, bodyguard.

973
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,360
I won't let you go.

974
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
Go.

975
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
You don't let me go either.

976
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
This way.

977
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,360
Yes.

978
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Grandpa.

979
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Go.

980
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
This way.

981
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
Grandpa.

982
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
This way.

983
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Hurry up.

984
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,360
Grandpa.

985
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
Where are you?

986
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Mr. Lu.

987
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Where are you?

988
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Mr. Lu.

989
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
Help.

990
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Mr. Lu.

991
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
Grandpa.

992
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
Grandpa.

993
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,360
I'm here.

994
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,360
Mr. Lu.

995
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Help.

996
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Grandpa.

997
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,360
Help.

998
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
Grandpa.

999
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Help.

1000
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
Grandpa.

1001
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
Mr. Lu.

1002
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
I'm here.

1003
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,360
Grandpa.

1004
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
Don't be afraid.

1005
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm here.

1006
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
Grandpa.

1007
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
Be careful.

1008
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
I'll take you out.

1009
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
Are you okay?

1010
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,360
I'm fine.

1011
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,360
Let's go.

1012
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Run.

1013
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Run.

1014
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,360
Brother.

1015
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
Did you see my brother?

1016
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Tiantian.

1017
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
You go out with my brother first.

1018
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,360
I'll go find Brother Xian.

1019
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,360
Yes, Tiantian.

1020
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
You go first.

1021
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
I'll go find Brother Xian.

1022
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
The phone.

1023
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,360
It's too dangerous here.

1024
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,360
Be careful.

1025
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,360
You don't go.

1026
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
I don't go either.

1027
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,360
Stay and look for it together.

1028
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
Tiantian.

1029
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,360
Don't squeeze.

1030
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
Don't squeeze.

1031
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,360
Slow down.

1032
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,360
Move.

1033
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,360
Move.

1034
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
Zhu Yizhi.

1035
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
Did you see my brother?

1036
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
It's not the time.

1037
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
It's none of your business.

1038
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Let go.

1039
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
Don't pull me.

1040
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
Zhu Yizhi, are you still a person?

1041
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
Tiantian.

1042
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
Be careful.

1043
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
Be careful.

1044
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,360
Don't squeeze.

1045
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
Let me go.

1046
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
Hurry up.

1047
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Help me.

1048
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Okay.

1049
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,360
Hurry up.

1050
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Listen to me.

1051
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
Be careful.

1052
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
Listen to me.

1053
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
Hurry up.

1054
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,360
I'm a criminal.

1055
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,360
I'll take you out.

1056
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
Now listen to me.

1057
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
All the young masters.

1058
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
Hold the little lady next to you.

1059
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Line up.

1060
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,360
Walk out safely.

1061
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,360
Everyone.

1062
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Follow me.

1063
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Line up.

1064
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
This way.

1065
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
Go.

1066
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Hurry up.

1067
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
Hurry up.

1068
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
Be careful.

1069
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
This way.

1070
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
Brother.

1071
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
Slow down.

1072
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
Brother.

1073
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Sister Pan'er.

1074
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
It's good that you're fine.

1075
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
Sister Pan'er.

1076
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,360
You follow my brother.

1077
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
He will take you out.

1078
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
We two have to save others.

1079
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
It's very dangerous here.

1080
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Take others out first.

1081
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
Don't worry, Master Lu.

1082
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm Bukai.

1083
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
I'm Ake's brother.

1084
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
I will take these people out safely.

1085
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
This is my duty.

1086
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
Qianxi.

1087
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Be careful.

1088
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Brother.

1089
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
You must take good care of Sister Pan'er.

1090
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
Don't worry.

1091
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,360
Please take good care of my sister.

1092
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
Brother, don't worry.

1093
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
I will protect you with my life.

1094
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Come on.

1095
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
Go.

1096
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
Hurry up.

1097
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,360
This way.

1098
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
Go.

1099
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
Hurry up.

1100
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
This way.

1101
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
This way.

1102
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
Be careful.

1103
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,360
Are you okay?

1104
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Are you okay?

1105
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,360
I'm fine.

1106
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
This way.

1107
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,360
That way.

1108
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
Hurry up.

1109
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
This way.

1110
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
Hurry up.

1111
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
Go.

1112
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Hurry up.

1113
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,360
Help.

1114
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
Is anyone there?

1115
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Brother Xian.

1116
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,360
Brother He.

1117
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
Brother Xian, where are you?

1118
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Do you hear me?

1119
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
Brother Xian.

1120
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Ake.

1121
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
Don't come over.

1122
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,360
Hurry up.

1123
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Brother Xian.

1124
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,360
Ake, be careful.

1125
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
Brother Xian.

1126
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,360
Be careful.

1127
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
Lu Chi.

1128
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,360
Take Ake away.

1129
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,360
No.

1130
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
I must save Brother Xian.

1131
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,360
Ake, believe me.

1132
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
I will save Brother He.

1133
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,360
It's too dangerous to go on like this.

1134
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Wait for me at a safe place.

1135
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Brother Lu.

1136
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,360
You must be careful.

1137
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,360
I'll wait for you and Brother Xian.

1138
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Okay.

1139
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
Hurry up.

1140
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
Get up.

1141
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,360
Get up.

1142
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,360
Why did you come to save me?

1143
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
I'll save anyone.

1144
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
Go.

1145
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,360
I know you like Ake.

1146
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
Cut the crap.

1147
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
We'll talk when we're alive.

1148
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Go.

1149
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
Brother Xian.

1150
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,360
Lu Chi.

1151
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,360
Thanks.

1152
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,360
Brother He.

1153
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,360
Brother He.

1154
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,360
Brother He.

1155
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,360
Brother He.

1156
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
Brother He.

1157
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,360
Brother He.

1158
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,360
Thanks.

1159
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
But thank you.

1160
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,360
I won't hurt Ake.

1161
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
Okay.

1162
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,360
I won't hurt you either.

1163
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,360
Brother Xian.

1164
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,360
Are you okay?

1165
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,360
I'm fine.

1166
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,360
Where's Tiantian?

1167
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,360
Is Tiantian okay?

1168
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,360
They should have escaped.

1169
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Brother Lu.

1170
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,360
I still have to see Zeng Mei Guan and Yan Yan.

1171
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,360
I'll go find them.

1172
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
Ake.

1173
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,360
Don't worry.

1174
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
When the enemy comes,

1175
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
we'll protect the leaves.

1176
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,360
It's too dangerous to go there.

1177
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,360
Lu Chi is right.

1178
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,360
You're too dangerous.

1179
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,360
Don't forget to run.

1180
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
Brother He.

1181
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,360
Brother He.

1182
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,360
Hurry.

1183
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
Master.

1184
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,360
Water Dragon Team is here.

1185
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
Sister Tao.

1186
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,360
Are you okay?

1187
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
I'm fine.

1188
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,360
Brother Lu.

1189
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,360
Look, Water Dragon Team is here.

1190
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,360
The fire will go out soon.

1191
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
Let's go find Yan Yan.

1192
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
Okay.

1193
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,360
But don't break the wall.

1194
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,360
Sister Tao.

1195
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
You have to be careful.

1196
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
Ru Yi.

1197
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Tell Water Dragon Team to protect the leaves.

1198
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
Take Boss He and Qian Er out.

1199
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
I'll go find Ake.

1200
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
Yes.

1201
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
Master, be careful.

1202
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,360
Hurry.

1203
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,360
Be careful.

1204
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,360
Come on.

1205
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,360
Let's go.

1206
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,360
Hurry.

1207
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,360
Hurry.

1208
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,360
Over there.

1209
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,360
Help.

1210
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,360
Help.

1211
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,360
Someone is going to kill me.

1212
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,360
Help.

1213
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,360
Help.

1214
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,360
Master.

1215
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
Master.

1216
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
Ake.

1217
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,360
Dang Yi.

1218
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
Don't be afraid.

1219
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,360
I'll save you out.

1220
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Dang Yi.

1221
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,360
Go and find someone to save her.

1222
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,360
Go.

1223
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
Okay.

1224
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
Go and call Water Dragon Team.

1225
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,360
Brother He.

1226
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,360
Ake.

1227
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,360
Dang Yi.

1228
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,360
Don't be afraid.

1229
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,360
I'll save you.

1230
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,360
I've been waiting for 15 years.

1231
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,360
Since I was 16, I've been a matchmaker.

1232
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,360
Dang Yi.

1233
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,360
I've been risking my life here.

1234
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
All my life,

1235
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,360
I've been a matchmaker for so many people.

1236
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,360
But I have no lover or children.

1237
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,360
I just want to be a matchmaker.

1238
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,360
But...

1239
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,360
But...

1240
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:55,360
But God took your mother to suppress me.

1241
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,360
I'm not as good as her.

1242
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:05,360
So she was born the most beautiful descendant in the world.

1243
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,360
No, Dang Yi.

1244
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,360
No one knows what I've done.

1245
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,360
No one even knows my name.

1246
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,360
Even if I become the head of the family,

1247
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,360
they don't even care about me.

1248
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,360
They only care about you and your mother.

1249
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,360
No, Dang Yi.

1250
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,360
You're a good matchmaker.

1251
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,360
You're hardworking and hardworking.

1252
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,360
I didn't know anything about it.

1253
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,360
I've been cheating on you.

1254
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
I admire you the most.

1255
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,360
You never do anything wrong.

1256
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,360
You work hard to be a matchmaker.

1257
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,360
Dang Yi.

1258
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,360
You're a good matchmaker.

1259
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,360
You're a good matchmaker.

1260
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
Dang Yi.

1261
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
Brother Xiaobao.

1262
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,360
Are you telling the truth?

1263
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,360
I'm telling the truth.

1264
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,360
You're the same as my mother.

1265
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,360
You're a good matchmaker.

1266
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
Dang Yi.

1267
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,360
Hurry.

1268
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,360
Hurry.

1269
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,360
Dang Yi.

1270
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Hurry.

1271
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
Brother Long.

1272
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,360
What should we do?

1273
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,360
Brother Xiaobao.

1274
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,360
Run.

1275
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,360
It's Dang Yi.

1276
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,360
He's a bad matchmaker.

1277
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,360
Dang Yi.

1278
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,360
It's dangerous.

1279
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,360
Dang Yi.

1280
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,360
It's me.

1281
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,360
Dang Yi.

1282
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
Run.

1283
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,360
Dang Yi.

1284
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,360
Dang Yi.

1285
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
Dang Yi.

1286
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
Dang Yi.

1287
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,360
Dang Yi.

1288
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,360
I know this meeting is the secret of fate.

1289
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:20,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1290
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:26,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1291
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:33,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1292
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:39,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1293
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:46,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1294
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:53,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1295
00:48:54,360 --> 00:49:00,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1296
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:06,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1297
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:14,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1298
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:22,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1299
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:29,360
I know that you're the one who gave me the chance.

1300
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,360
Some of my things have changed.

1301
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,360
Some of my longings have changed too.

1302
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,360
Some of the bad things have changed,

1303
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,360
some of the bad things have changed.

1304
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,360
My dear friend.

1305
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,360
From what I've said before,

1306
00:49:54,360 --> 00:50:03,360
I don't want to part with you.
