1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
Or not

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,460
So

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,320
Tell me

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,760
Silly

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The flowers are in the branches.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The years are passing by.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know if you have

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
any worries.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Some love is like

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
a hug,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but it's not fair.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A lifetime of love

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
is the best way.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 18

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Boss, Second,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
send her home.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Mr. Lu.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Little sister.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
One hundred years,

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
don't change.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What are you doing?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let go of me.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What are you doing?

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What are you doing?

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
My head hurts.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What are you doing?

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you okay, Brother Lu?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I tell you,

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
no one can send her away.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She's hurt because

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
she wants to save me.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I must take care of her.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I know she'll be fine.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you hear me?

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Little sister.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Little sister.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Little sister.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't leave me.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Stay with me.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let go of my hand.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Dad.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay, I won't go.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll stay with you.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The Long Ballad

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Madam.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Madam.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Brother Lu.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You're awake.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Madam.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Who are they?

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Madam?

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You call my daughter Madam?

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're pretending to be a fool,

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
trying to take advantage of my daughter, right?

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I'm still married to Madam.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I...

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then you must be my future wife.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not your wife.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not your wife.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Then you must be my future husband.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I...

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm your uncle.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Uncle?

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Are we in the same family?

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's your name?

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Brother Lu.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you want to live,

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
just shut up.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Dad.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You forgot what the doctor said.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He said Brother Lu was hurt.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He might have a brain injury.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He might have lost his memory.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Luckily he remembers me.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't bully him.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let go of my hand.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Brother Lu, I tell you.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He just wants to take advantage of you.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He called you little sister last night.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now he calls you Madam.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How ridiculous!

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ake is my little sister.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Little sister is Ake.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Ake has been promoted.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I want to marry him to my wife.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I disagree.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Dad, go back and rest.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm going to the official media to listen to the report.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He's my guest.

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He really looks for his little sister.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Brother Lu,

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
about that little sister,

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll help you find her later.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay?

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We'll go now.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You think I don't exist?

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Brother, calm down.

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Go, go.

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Go.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Ake,

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
did he just stare at me?

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Did he stare at me?

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Dad, dad.

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Calm down.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
A man should be calm.

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Dad,

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
your career is important.

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Bear with it.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Marquis, marquis.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I have something to report.

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't panic.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Just say it.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Deng Meiguan

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
went to the Shen family

132
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
to deliver the steel of the Shiling men.

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Who knows,

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Shen Chang didn't even look at it.

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He said

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
he must have his own daughter

137
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
like it.

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So what?

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
His daughter

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is a cool-faced and good-looking man.

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
She fell in love with Lu Chi,

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the handsome man around Shifake.

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Lu Chi

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
is the head of the Xibao Pavilion.

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
two days ago,

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Lu Chi was poisoned

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and was not cured.

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Now he is

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
at the Shifake family's old house.

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It shouldn't affect

152
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
our plan anymore.

153
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
God bless me.

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Marquis is a lucky man.

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
God will bless him.

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Someone

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
helped us solve the problem.

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't mind Lu Chi.

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Since Shen Tongyun

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
likes a handsome man,

161
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
we can do whatever we want.

162
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
My wife Li Yang

163
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
is the general of the General's Office.

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
She is very beautiful.

165
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
She is

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
very good.

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll do it now.

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Go.

169
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You must

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
take good care of her.

171
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Zhang Mei,

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Good morning, Ake.

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Morning.

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Shifake,

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
you don't know

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
any rules.

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't you know

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the official media

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
doesn't allow

180
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the idle people to enter?

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Deng,

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
this is my guest.

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll send you

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
anything you need.

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Who is your guest?

186
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Deng,

187
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
this Lu...

188
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Lu Chi,

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Mr. Lu,

190
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
is Shen Tongyun's

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
personal assistant.

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I

193
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
am Shen Tongyun's

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
personal assistant.

195
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you going to

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
ignore the guest's request?

197
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It doesn't seem to be right.

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You are a bunch of nonsense.

199
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Do you know

200
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Shen Tongyun has complained to me

201
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that you are not doing your job well?

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And you and

203
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Mr. Lu

204
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
are not good to

205
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Shen Tongyun.

206
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't you know?

207
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can tell you

208
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Shen Tongyun has asked me

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to be his assistant.

210
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I finally

211
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
keep this guest

212
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
for the official media.

213
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How can I let you do this?

214
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What are you doing?

215
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What are you doing?

216
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It hurts.

217
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It hurts.

218
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let go.

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let go.

220
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Deng,

221
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
for the sake of our colleagues,

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I kindly advise you

223
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
not to

224
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
treat me like this in the future.

225
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
In case Mr. Lu

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
thinks you are bullying me

227
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
because you are beautiful, kind,

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and young.

229
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's not good to hurt you.

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You...

231
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Whoever dares to bully my wife,

232
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I will kill him.

233
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wife?

234
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wife.

235
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Ke.

236
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's your relationship

237
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
with her?

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's okay.

239
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
She is just

240
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
hurt and lost her memory.

241
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
She said I was her

242
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
fiancee.

243
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No, Ke.

244
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
She looks like this

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and she protects you.

246
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She is not a loser.

247
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Zhao Meiguan, stop it.

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
She is just

249
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
confused now.

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
When she wakes up,

251
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
she always looks at Shen Tongyun.

252
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
She said she likes Shen Tongyun?

253
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
She didn't say that.

254
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But it's not completely meaningless.

255
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Shi Fakke.

256
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I made it clear

257
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
that Shen Tongyun has asked me

258
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
to take charge of his煤 case.

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I ordered you

260
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
to give me the information

261
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
as the chief of Guanmei Hall.

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't stay here.

263
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Aunt Deng.

264
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There is no

265
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
one-on-one explanation in Guanmei Hall.

266
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And the Lu Chi and He Kexian

267
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Shen Tongyun likes

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
are all my relatives.

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I will handle this case.

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I have to

271
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,920
I'll handle this case.

272
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,920
And we should help each other

273
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,240
when we return to the Meiyan Hall.

274
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,600
Only the capable can do it.

275
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,840
No need.

276
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,960
I've introduced the portrait

277
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,240
of that man to Shen Tongyun.

278
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,320
He has seen it.

279
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,040
He's very satisfied.

280
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
I have to tell this

281
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
to Shen Xiaoniang

282
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,800
in person.

283
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,520
If you want to do this Meiyan case,

284
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,200
we'll do it our own way.

285
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,040
Let's go.

286
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,240
Brother Shifang, you...

287
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,840
What's wrong?

288
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Why are you so nervous?

289
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Let's go.

290
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,000
Brother Lu,

291
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,520
I have something to tell you.

292
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,880
Little girl, do you remember me?

293
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,160
You're the one who lost your memory.

294
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,280
Why do you ask me if I remember you?

295
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,000
Didn't we agree that

296
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
you're my wife?

297
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
When you're in a rush,

298
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,880
I'll go to Nikahou.

299
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,560
This poison is really strong.

300
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,640
My brain is really broken.

301
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,720
Brother Lu,

302
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
you're talking nonsense.

303
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,480
It's not bad

304
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,760
to be like this now.

305
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,920
Follow me.

306
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Don't get lost.

307
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
In case someone

308
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,200
cheats you with some kind of excuse,

309
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,920
Xibao Hall will be in trouble.

310
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
You're right.

311
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,320
I said I'm not your wife.

312
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,720
You look silly,

313
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,440
but you're not.

314
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
I'm not.

315
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,520
You're not silly.

316
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Of course I'm not silly.

317
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,000
Brother Lu,

318
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,040
let me ask you.

319
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
If you're not a fox,

320
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,200
you followed Shen Tongyun before.

321
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,720
Are you following him?

322
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,160
No.

323
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,760
Then,

324
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,920
Shen Tongyun is your little sister?

325
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
No.

326
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,080
You like her?

327
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
No.

328
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,320
I'm not your wife.

329
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,880
You are...

330
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,640
Look.

331
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
You're still silly.

332
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
I don't like to be silly.

333
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,760
Brother Lu,

334
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,600
your memory is messy now.

335
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,440
You don't remember the past.

336
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,400
But don't worry.

337
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,520
It's all because of me.

338
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll take good care of you

339
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
until you get better.

340
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,120
If you don't get better in your life,

341
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,280
I'll take care of you forever.

342
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,480
For the rest of your life,

343
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,960
I can still live in your house.

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,920
You must be scared

345
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,400
by my father and brother.

346
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,280
Don't worry.

347
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,800
I'll do as I said.

348
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,920
Then,

349
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
I want to go to see the painting.

350
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,800
Painting?

351
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,960
Sure.

352
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,240
I'll take you to the Xibao Pavilion.

353
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,080
Maybe you'll remember something.

354
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,840
But it's not a responsibility to take responsibility.

355
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,720
I'll take good care of you.

356
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
But when you see Sister Pan'er,

357
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,240
don't say that

358
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,200
my two brothers hurt you.

359
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Or else, if she reports it to the government,

360
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,280
my brother will be dead.

361
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,200
Okay, I know.

362
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I'll keep my mouth shut.

363
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Let's go.

364
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,320
Okay.

365
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,000
Let's go.

366
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,440
Brother Lu,

367
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,280
why don't you go to the Xibao Pavilion?

368
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,360
There are more paintings

369
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,440
in the Xibao Pavilion.

370
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,280
I like this place very much, Ke'er.

371
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,440
Although it's not a famous painting,

372
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
it's very unique.

373
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,720
Not bad.

374
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,800
It seems that I just have a short sight.

375
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I didn't notice this place.

376
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,760
If you like it,

377
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,960
ask the boss to come out and ask the price.

378
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,240
Boss,

379
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,440
is anyone here?

380
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,200
Miss Shen Xiao,

381
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,240
why are you here?

382
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,000
The boss here is my friend.

383
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
He went out.

384
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
You two...

385
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,080
Miss Shen Xiao,

386
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,440
don't misunderstand.

387
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,720
Didn't you hear?

388
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,640
Brother Lu has lost his job.

389
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,520
Do you want to get into his head

390
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,480
and get the money first?

391
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,520
Shi Fak,

392
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,640
you didn't close the door.

393
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,960
I'll drag you to say no.

394
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,200
You stole my man.

395
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,800
No, no, no.

396
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,480
I didn't.

397
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,800
Don't misunderstand me.

398
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
Since you didn't want to steal him,

399
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,320
why didn't you come to me?

400
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,240
Listen to me.

401
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,120
Miss Shen Xiao,

402
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,560
after seeing Deng Mei Guan,

403
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,840
do you still want to marry Lu Zhi Cheng?

404
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,960
Deng Mei Guan took the initiative to find me first.

405
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,520
He is the guard of Guan Mei Ting.

406
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,160
I can't refuse him.

407
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,400
I think Deng Mei Guan

408
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,920
has found a good man for you.

409
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,200
Now Brother Lu is injured and has not recovered.

410
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,520
If you want to regret it,

411
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:03,920
I...

412
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,760
I didn't.

413
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,280
Deng Mei Guan said it was just a look.

414
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,320
I didn't set a marriage with the man he said.

415
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,560
To be honest,

416
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Brother Lu was injured because he saved me.

417
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,320
Now he has lost his memory.

418
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,680
I will cure him.

419
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,040
As for you,

420
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,040
if you are heartless to him,

421
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,040
we can just say that

422
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
he is injured

423
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,200
because he saved someone.

424
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,720
You are really a good man.

425
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
You have a good heart.

426
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,040
You are really a good man.

427
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,720
How about this?

428
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Send him to my house.

429
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,800
Send him to my house.

430
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,320
My maid has many servants.

431
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,920
I will treat him well.

432
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,640
The imperial jade and jade stones are not in the painting.

433
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,920
I will find a famous doctor to cure him.

434
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,800
Even if he loses his memory for the rest of his life,

435
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,320
you are willing to take care of him.

436
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,760
Shi Mei Guan,

437
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,520
as long as you can settle this matter,

438
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,720
I will hand over my wedding to you.

439
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,600
I won't go to

440
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,000
respond to Deng Mei Guan's blind date.

441
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,920
But I asked Brother Lu.

442
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,120
He said he didn't want to.

443
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Let's just forget it.

444
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,000
Shi Mei Guan,

445
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,800
is it Lu Chi who is unwilling

446
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,800
or you are unwilling to keep your feelings?

447
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,600
You are a Mei Guan

448
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,000
who ruined Xi Ke's marriage.

449
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,400
You are really the best person in Guan Mei Ting.

450
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,480
No, no.

451
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,880
I have no feelings at all.

452
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,000
It's just that

453
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,800
you have to ask him first.

454
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,400
How about we just spend a few more days together?

455
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,600
Even though he lost his memory,

456
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,920
he is not completely unconscious.

457
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,200
Since you have no feelings,

458
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,600
he is not a fool.

459
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,600
Why are you still waiting?

460
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,400
How about this?

461
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,480
In front of you,

462
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,600
I will get along with him.

463
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,680
He will decide it.

464
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,360
How about it?

465
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,880
Okay.

466
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,880
Ke,

467
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,280
let's wait for the owner of the flower shop.

468
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
I saw a picture.

469
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
The owner of the flower shop is my best friend.

470
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,880
If you like anything,

471
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,800
just tell me.

472
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,680
You... Who are you?

473
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,280
Lady Shen,

474
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,360
he lost his memory.

475
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm afraid of being loud.

476
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Please forgive me.

477
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,960
It's okay.

478
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,960
Lady Shen,

479
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,280
are you really going to be so direct?

480
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,160
I have always been straightforward.

481
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,080
You just ask him what he means.

482
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,160
I will listen to him.

483
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,840
Brother Lu,

484
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,360
this Lady Shen is interested in you.

485
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,760
Even if you lose your memory,

486
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,560
she is willing to take care of you for the rest of your life.

487
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,280
What is your intention?

488
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,440
Are you willing to make amends with her?

489
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,160
No.

490
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,280
Do you know what it means to make amends?

491
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,080
I know.

492
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,960
It means two people are in love with each other.

493
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
They will live together and never part.

494
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,520
But I don't believe in her.

495
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,280
I don't need her to take care of me.

496
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,960
So I don't want to.

497
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,800
I understand.

498
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,040
What do you understand?

499
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,960
Lu Chi,

500
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,440
you are so mean.

501
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,640
You are not the only man in the capital.

502
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,400
I will find Shen Tong Yuan again.

503
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,480
The one who is not closed is waiting for me.

504
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,360
Oh, no.

505
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,240
I forgot to turn off the light.

506
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,440
What should I do?

507
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,040
Brother Lu rejected Shen Tong Yuan.

508
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,480
I am so happy.

509
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,640
But...

510
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,240
But Shen Tong Yuan's life

511
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
will be ruined by the light.

512
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,320
Who in the capital

513
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,320
is as anxious as Shen Tong Yuan?

514
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,880
Should I tell my two brothers?

515
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,080
Come in.

516
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,120
Mr. Lu.

517
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,320
I made a special medicine for you

518
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,600
to help you recover your memory.

519
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,640
So you should learn how to kill doctor by drinking,

520
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,680
or the medicine can still kill you.

521
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,760
We can't go outside.

522
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,740
Everyone knows you

523
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,020
you are a good doctor in invited heading.

524
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,940
So if you can't open the medicine,

525
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,120
or help the doctor by showing your districts ill.

526
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,960
You should learn to save your eyebrows

527
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,880
when they Rome.

528
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,040
The beauty is gonna die on the crossroad.

529
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,960
If you can't make it,

530
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,960
which is your destiny?

531
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,160
Do you remember the old proposal?

532
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,160
Yeah.

533
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,240
Brother.

534
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,320
Brother.

535
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,400
I'll take you to

536
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,680
expose Lu Chi's true face.

537
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,480
Let's go.

538
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,480
Mountain Queen.

539
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,680
Mountain Queen.

540
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,040
I'm here to ask for forgiveness.

541
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,760
According to your plan,

542
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,200
I pretended to be a killer to poison you

543
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,080
and saved you.

544
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,360
But you were attacked and fainted.

545
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,680
This can make Marquis Wu'an

546
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,720
care about you

547
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,760
and make Lady Shi

548
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
feel grateful to you

549
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,720
and act in your favor.

550
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,560
It's even more reasonable

551
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,280
to say that Shen Tongyun

552
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,040
has been very kind to you.

553
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,800
But I didn't expect

554
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,080
Shi Chongshan to act so unkindly.

555
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,920
It's impossible to

556
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,800
act so unkindly.

557
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,920
Besides,

558
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,480
you've found out

559
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,560
Shen Tongyun's background.

560
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,840
But you didn't see the master today.

561
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,640
It seems that you still have to take Ake

562
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
to visit him.

563
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,720
By the way,

564
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,560
what's going on with Marquis Wu'an?

565
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,680
As the master expected,

566
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,840
he stopped investigating you

567
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
after he knew you were lost.

568
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,240
But Deng Meiguan

569
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
has arranged for Li Ang

570
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,720
to date Shen Tongyun tomorrow.

571
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,280
How can you get out of here?

572
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,800
I...

573
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,040
Listen.

574
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,440
You asked me to send you medicine.

575
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,840
I'm afraid that you've been found out

576
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,360
and then you've detained your brother.

577
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,760
I've told you

578
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,400
that Chen Longchi is not a good person.

579
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,000
Brother.

580
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,840
Lu Chi.

581
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,480
Brother, what's wrong?

582
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,280
What's wrong with you?

583
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,760
Brother.

584
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,480
It's not my fault.

585
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,920
Brother sent me medicine.

586
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,360
I thought it was hot and wanted to drink it later.

587
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,560
Brother insisted on not drinking it.

588
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,800
So I took the initiative to drink it.

589
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,320
But...

590
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,040
You brat.

591
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,200
Stop pretending.

592
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
My brother sent the medicine himself.

593
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,360
Why did he take the medicine?

594
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,440
Brother.

595
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,120
You see?

596
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,520
Even the second brother is in his hands.

597
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,240
He has no intention of losing his memory.

598
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,360
He sent the medicine himself?

599
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
It's a drug for the cold.

600
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,880
It's not poison.

601
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,400
It's a drug for the cold.

602
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,480
Brother.

603
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,120
I've heard everything.

604
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,760
Brother.

605
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,800
Are you going to take the second brother away

606
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,080
or should I tell you now?

607
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,800
No.

608
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,480
You're crazy.

609
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,640
Brother Lu.

610
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,560
I'm so sorry.

611
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Have a good rest.

612
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,960
Brother.

613
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm a little scared.

614
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,120
Then...

615
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,760
Come in.

616
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,320
You're still scared?

617
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,360
I'm not scared with you.

618
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,760
It's a long night.

619
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,320
If it's boring,

620
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,640
let's play a game.

621
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,680
What game?

622
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,360
Wait for me.

623
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,080
This is a game I played since I was a kid.

624
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,840
You and I grab paper cranes.

625
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,600
The loser will pinch the winner's shoulder.

626
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,880
Are you ready?

627
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm ready.

628
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,280
Three, two, one.

629
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,240
Go.

630
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,240
I won.

631
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:13,720
Ci

632
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
I'm playing...

633
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,480
How did I fall asleep and come up here?

634
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,720
Ke, I didn't do anything.

635
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,080
I saw you sleeping and helped you get up.

636
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Although I'm alone with you, I didn't do anything.

637
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,760
You know me well.

638
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,360
You can't let anyone else know about this.

639
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,320
You're my wife.

640
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,120
Of course I won't let anyone else know.

641
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,520
Brother Lu, I really am not your wife.

642
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,600
Today, let's go to the flower shop.

643
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,400
I want to talk to the boss and talk about the painting.

644
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,400
Okay.

645
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,680
Is there anyone else you're interested in?

646
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,480
Go ahead.

647
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,120
Thank you, Ke.

648
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,520
Why is my heart beating so fast?

649
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,560
It's all Brother Lu's fault.

650
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,640
He's too handsome.

651
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,520
Well, I'll go wash my face first.

652
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,720
This painting is a bit strange.

653
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,600
Brother Lu,

654
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,800
you can just let go of your hand first.

655
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,040
This painting is really good.

656
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
I don't know if it's sold out or the price is high.

657
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,920
The boss is asking for it.

658
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,400
Why don't I send these paintings directly to your house?

659
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,160
This way, you won't have to work so hard again.

660
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
No need.

661
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,000
I've been very bored lately.

662
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,240
I happened to come out to take a breath.

663
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,840
I was just in the bathroom.

664
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
I was just in the bathroom.

665
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
I was just in the bathroom.

666
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,440
I was just chatting with you.

667
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,440
I was watching the paintings you picked for me.

668
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,840
I was really happy.

669
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,560
Brother Ren,

670
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,840
your father has a master's degree.

671
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,720
He knows my hobby the best.

672
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,520
Only by talking to you can I relieve my stress.

673
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,720
Yun,

674
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,400
we grew up together.

675
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,920
I know your hobby.

676
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,120
Wang Xiucai

677
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,080
doesn't like Miss Shen, does he?

678
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,880
Brother Lu,

679
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,600
how about we act in a play?

680
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,400
That's not good.

681
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,920
Is it a play?

682
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,120
I want to help them.

683
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,720
I picked these paintings specially

684
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
for you to like.

685
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,520
Then Brother Ren, stay.

686
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,120
I'll go back by myself.

687
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,440
When did you two get here?

688
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,720
I'm sorry to have brought you here.

689
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,040
We're just here to have a look.

690
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
That's right.

691
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,520
Then please have a look.

692
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,720
If you need anything, just tell me.

693
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
Let's go.

694
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Go.

695
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Go.

696
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Go.

697
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Go.

698
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Go.

699
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Go.

700
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Go.

701
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Go.

702
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Go.

703
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Go.

704
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Go.

705
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Go.

706
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,600
Brother Lu,

707
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,200
look at this painting.

708
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,920
The girl in this painting

709
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,200
looks like Miss Shen, doesn't she?

710
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,200
Actually, I don't blame you.

711
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,800
You don't want to marry her,

712
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,400
but you have a reason.

713
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,920
After all, all the beautiful men in the capital

714
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,400
have asked for a marriage.

715
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,600
That's right.

716
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,400
Miss Shen is famous.

717
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
She's not famous.

718
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,400
Everyone calls her a beauty behind her back.

719
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,600
If you want to say something wrong,

720
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
just leave.

721
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,200
Yun'er is just being ambiguous since childhood.

722
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,600
Yun'er?

723
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,600
You know her well?

724
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,200
What's your relationship?

725
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,200
You want to drive the guests away to protect her.

726
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Aren't you afraid of ruining the business?

727
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,400
I don't care about business or guests.

728
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,800
You're not talking about Yun'er.

729
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,600
I'm going to drive you away.

730
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Okay, Wang Xiucai.

731
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,800
I'm the lawyer of Guanmei Court.

732
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
I took Miss Shen's case.

733
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,280
We're not good at

734
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,200
seeing people's differences.

735
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,800
I think you love Miss Shen very much.

736
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Why don't you ask for her?

737
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
I...

738
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,200
There are things that you can't get

739
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,400
if you don't fight for it.

740
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,000
Yun'er is ambiguous since childhood.

741
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,200
I'm just being ambiguous.

742
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,600
She won't like me no matter what.

743
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,800
How can a man and a woman be mixed?

744
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,600
Shen Tongyun has been pursuing many beautiful men.

745
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,800
But it's all his wishful thinking.

746
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
I don't think he's willing to do that.

747
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,000
But when he's with you,

748
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,200
his smile is sweet and gentle.

749
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,400
It's clear that he doesn't have feelings for you.

750
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,000
And you two are close friends.

751
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,400
You have the same hobbies.

752
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
How compatible are you?

753
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,800
Wang Xiucai,

754
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,800
don't you want to work hard for your happiness?

755
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,400
The worst result is that he marries someone else.

756
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,400
But at least you have no regrets.

757
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,200
Shi Meiguan,

758
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
please use this painting as a bait

759
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,200
and propose to Shen Tongyun for me.

760
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
You... you come down.

761
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
Ke, aren't we going to propose?

762
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,200
I'll go with you.

763
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,400
Are you crazy?

764
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
I'm going to propose to Wang Ren.

765
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
I'm going to propose to Wang Ren.

766
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
I'm going to propose to Wang Ren.

767
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
I'm going to propose to Wang Ren.

768
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
I'm going to propose to Wang Ren.

769
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,000
You rejected Shen Tongyun and made him angry.

770
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,200
What's the point of going in now?

771
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,000
And you're going in with Wang Ren.

772
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,600
Even if I break my promise,

773
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,400
I can't change Shen Tongyun's mind.

774
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,600
Just go there and wait for me.

775
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,400
Okay?

776
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,600
Brother Ren,

777
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,800
why are you here with Shi Meiguan?

778
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
He's here to give you a gift.

779
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,800
Lady Shen,

780
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
please look at this painting.

781
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,000
Yun'er,

782
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,600
I've been painting this painting for a long time.

783
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,400
I know.

784
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,600
When I was little, I told you

785
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,400
that I wanted to raise the most beautiful Jinli in the pond.

786
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,800
And I wanted to raise Jinli.

787
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
So you painted this painting for me.

788
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,200
Lady Shen,

789
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Wang Xiu was worried that

790
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
he was a fish.

791
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,200
He didn't deserve to be caught by you.

792
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,800
Brother Ren is always so modest.

793
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
He was young and got a lot of Xiucai.

794
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,800
He even opened a painting shop to support himself.

795
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,200
And he helped poor students in the same generation

796
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
to make Jinli.

797
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,600
If he was a fish,

798
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,800
he wouldn't have been able to do Jinli.

799
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,200
So Wang Xiucai is good.

800
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,400
Lady Shen, you know it all.

801
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,000
What does Shi Meiguan mean?

802
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
In this girl's fish tank,

803
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,400
there's already a fish.

804
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,200
There's already a fish that's in all the Jinli in the world.

805
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,600
But he wants to catch a Jinli.

806
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,000
Isn't this a sign of power?

807
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,200
Shi Meiguan,

808
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,800
are you here to make fun of me?

809
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
Yun'er,

810
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,200
Shi Meiguan didn't mean anything bad.

811
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,800
I asked him to come here to propose to you.

812
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,200
I will love you forever.

813
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,800
As long as you don't think I'm a normal person.

814
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,800
Brother Ren,

815
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,400
I know you love me very much.

816
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
But...

817
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,800
No buts.

818
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,200
He knows your feelings.

819
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,800
He understands your anger and sadness.

820
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,600
When everyone is teasing you,

821
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,200
he's willing to come out to protect you.

822
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,600
There are many Jinli in the world.

823
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,800
How many people can be like him

824
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,000
who treats you like this?

825
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,800
Brother Ren, I...

826
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,400
Miss.

827
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,000
The official of Guanmei Hall, Deng Meiguan,

828
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
brought General Li from the General's Office.

829
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,400
He said he was going to make an appointment with you.

830
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,600
Lady Shen.

831
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,000
Lady Shen, I've kept you waiting.

832
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh my god.

833
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,200
I think I saw my future husband

834
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,800
walking towards me with a smile.

835
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,000
Come.

836
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,800
Come, Lady Shen.

837
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,200
This is Li Yang.

838
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,000
General Li from the General's Office.

839
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,600
General Li, please sit.

840
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Please, General Li.

841
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,800
Deng Meiguan, please sit.

842
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,400
Okay.

843
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,600
General Li is really extraordinary.

844
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,800
The first time I saw you,

845
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,000
I thought you were my best match.

846
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,600
Lady Shen is so beautiful.

847
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,800
Everyone should admire her.

848
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm happy to see her.

849
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm so happy for Lady Shen.

850
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,600
General Li, you're so talented.

851
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,400
Lady Shen loves to draw.

852
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,000
Do you like this painting?

853
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,200
Painter is not famous.

854
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,400
He's so rough.

855
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,600
How can he bring it here

856
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,800
to ruin Lady Shen's eyes?

857
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
You...

858
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,400
Lady Shen, let's go.

859
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,200
Lady Shen,

860
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,200
good marriage needs mutual appreciation.

861
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,400
Wang Xiu knows you well.

862
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,200
You know Wang Xiu well too.

863
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,800
What I said just now,

864
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
you're obviously moved.

865
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Don't be moved by others' looks.

866
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,400
Who can live a life of youth?

867
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
One day,

868
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,200
all the glory will go away.

869
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,000
At that time, Lady Shen,

870
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
what can you rely on to maintain the marriage?

871
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
Lady Shen,

872
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,600
please think twice.

873
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,000
Deng Meiguan,

874
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,600
you and Brother Ren should go back first.

875
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,600
Deng Meiguan,

876
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,000
I've tried my best.

877
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,200
I won't regret it.

878
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,800
As long as Yun'er is happy,

879
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,200
we should go first.

880
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,600
Let's go.

881
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,800
Take care.

882
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,400
See you.

883
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Did I give you too little work?

884
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,800
Why are you staring at me?

885
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Don't blame me, Lady Shen.

886
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
It's just a coincidence.

887
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,200
I just saw Deng Meiguan bringing people here.

888
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,400
Li Yang is really

889
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
like that in appearance.

890
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Lady Shen,

891
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Manager Li asked me to ask if you've had enough fun.

892
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,800
It's best to find a good person to say you're good.

893
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
It's hard to end if you keep pretending.

894
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,600
If Lady Shen knows you're pretending,

895
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
I'm afraid you'll be in a hurry.

896
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,000
You're talking about

897
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,800
the blood and the heart.

898
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,800
What blood and the heart?

899
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,200
Shut up.

900
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,000
The blood and the heart is here.

901
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Ah Ke.

902
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
This is bad.

903
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Ah Ke.

904
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Ah Ke.

905
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,200
You can hit me or scold me.

906
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
I'll accept my mistakes.

907
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,800
Liar.

908
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,200
I feel guilty for you.

909
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
And you and your brothers are angry.

910
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,600
But you didn't do anything.

911
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,800
You...

912
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Brother Lu,

913
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,800
why don't you let go of your hand first?

914
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Wait.

915
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
You remember everything.

916
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Then why did you hold my hand

917
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
and stay with me?

918
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
You liar.

919
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
You liar. You didn't forget anything.

920
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
Ah Ke, listen to me.

921
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
It's true that you're poisoned.

922
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
But it's not deep.

923
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
I don't want to see you again.

924
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Ah Ke, wait.

925
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
I know one thing that can help you.

926
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Go away. I don't want to hear it.

927
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Li Yang.

928
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
The reason that Deng Mei Guan brought Li Yang.

929
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
I know it.

930
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
I promise you can solve this problem one by one.

931
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,800
I'll help you to make Shen Tong Yuan's marriage.

932
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
I just hope that

933
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Ah Ke can forgive me.

934
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
You can say whatever you want.

935
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
I won't forgive you even if you say it.

936
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
I'll say it. I'll say it now.

937
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Then you say it.

938
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
I'll listen to you.

939
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Are you serious?

940
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm not lying.

941
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Ah Ke, please forgive me.

942
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Who wants to forgive you?

943
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
When the marriage is over,

944
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
you can come to see our hospital.

945
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
It's great.

946
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Lady Shen,

947
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
since you two are very close,

948
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
tomorrow is a good day.

949
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
I'll send the wedding invitation to your home.

950
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Lady Shen, what do you think?

951
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Sorry.

952
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
What did you say?

953
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
It's a good marriage.

954
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
It's a good marriage.

955
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,800
It can't be delayed.

956
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,800
How about I exchange the iron and steel for you tomorrow?

957
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Deng Mei Guan,

958
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
I think you don't have to worry about it.

959
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
It's just the first time that I meet General Li.

960
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
I don't know his temperament.

961
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
In my opinion,

962
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
we should get to know each other first.

963
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Then we can talk about it.

964
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Lady Shen,

965
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
since it's like this,

966
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,800
I'll arrange another meeting for you two.

967
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
What do you think?

968
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Thank you, Deng Mei Guan.

969
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
It's okay.

970
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
It's okay.

971
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
It's okay.

972
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
I'll leave first.

973
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
General Li.

974
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
General Li.

975
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
General Li.

976
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
Walk slowly.

977
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
They came out so soon.

978
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,800
It seems that Shen Tong Yun didn't keep them.

979
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
Before it's done,

980
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Wang Xiu Zi still has a chance.

981
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Ake is right.

982
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Let's go.

983
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
General Li.

984
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
What is he?

985
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
He dares to pick and choose and recommend me.

986
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
I came to see him

987
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
because I want to give him a big welcome.

988
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
Yes.

989
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Doesn't he know who my uncle is?

990
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Calm down.

991
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
General Li, calm down.

992
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Although Shen Tong Yun doesn't know it,

993
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
don't worry.

994
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
I have my own way

995
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
to make him accept this marriage.

996
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
He doesn't even dare to say it now.

997
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
What can you do?

998
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Didn't he just say that

999
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
you two don't know each other yet?

1000
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Then find a chance to know each other more.

1001
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
I heard that he often goes to that

1002
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
Wang You Tea House to drink tea.

1003
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
Wang You Tea House?

1004
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
I will ask him to drink tea at the tea house.

1005
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
General Li, please be patient.

1006
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
After this Shen Tong Yun comes in,

1007
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
you can take care of him.

1008
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I have limited patience.

1009
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
Yes.

1010
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Take care, General Li.

1011
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Do you think you can make it difficult for me?

1012
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
You are too young.

1013
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
If I remember correctly,

1014
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Wang You Tea House

1015
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
is right next to Wang Xiu Cai's painting studio.

1016
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Yes.

1017
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
I remember it right.

1018
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Wang Xiu Cai also said that

1019
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
he often goes to the tea house

1020
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
to chat with Chen Xiao Niangzi.

1021
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
In this way,

1022
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
although Shen Tong Yun

1023
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
loves every man,

1024
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
he is very close to Wang Xiu Cai

1025
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
for years.

1026
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
I must help Wang Xiu Cai

1027
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
to get another chance.

1028
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
I will go with you.

1029
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
Don't bother.

1030
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
I have something important to do.

1031
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
I have something important to do.

1032
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Come on.

1033
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Drink tea.

1034
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
You two finally meet again.

1035
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Since the last time we met,

1036
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I have not forgotten Shen Xiao Niangzi for a long time.

1037
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
General Li, you are overpraising.

1038
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
I think General Li

1039
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
is also a man of great talent.

1040
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Come on. Drink tea.

1041
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Shen Xiao Niangzi,

1042
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
you are here.

1043
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Wang Xiu Cai is treating you to tea.

1044
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
It's better to invite you by chance.

1045
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
How about we go together?

1046
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
I don't know what you think.

1047
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Shifang,

1048
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
I advise you

1049
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
to give up earlier.

1050
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Otherwise,

1051
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
you will be fine

1052
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
and your guests

1053
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
will be embarrassed.

1054
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
You are over thinking.

1055
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
As an official,

1056
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
as long as my guests

1057
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
are good,

1058
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

1059
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
I can get married

1060
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
after running a hundred times.

1061
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
It's a merit.

1062
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
As for my guests,

1063
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I am very dedicated to the people I like.

1064
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

1065
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,800
I don't know if General Li

1066
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,800
likes to be a friend.

1067
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
I am a martial artist.

1068
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
I usually...

1069
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Although General Li is a martial artist,

1070
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,800
he usually reads books

1071
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
and reads calligraphy.

1072
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
General Li, you have a similar hobby as me.

1073
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
Yes.

1074
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
I don't know whose painting you admire.

1075
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
The most famous one in the capital

1076
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
is the painting of Mr. Lin Yuan.

1077
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,800
I like his paintings very much.

1078
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Then what do you think

1079
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,800
is special about Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings?

1080
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Which one do you admire the most?

1081
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
I like all of his paintings.

1082
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Then do you know which one

1083
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
is really hidden in your home?

1084
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,800
I don't keep them in my home.

1085
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Wang Qiucai is a painter.

1086
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
You have a lot of research on these paintings,

1087
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
right?

1088
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
I don't dare.

1089
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
My painting shop

1090
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
is just a shop

1091
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
that sells paintings of some famous painters.

1092
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Although they are not famous now,

1093
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
they are all different from their own styles.

1094
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,800
They are both beautiful and elegant.

1095
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,800
I like the painting of Gu Shan.

1096
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings are good

1097
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
and are also popular.

1098
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,800
But I always think

1099
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,800
his paintings lack some feelings.

1100
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
He seems to be far away from us.

1101
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
So I also like

1102
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Mr. Gu Shan's paintings.

1103
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,800
Someone has to be in love with someone.

1104
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
A couple should be in love

1105
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,800
and live together for a long time.

1106
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Waiter.

1107
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Why don't you serve tea?

1108
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Here is your tea.

1109
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Hurry up.

1110
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Sir, your tea.

1111
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
Sir, please forgive me.

1112
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Please forgive me.

1113
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Please forgive me.

1114
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
I'll wipe it clean right now.

1115
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,800
It's not easy to make a living.

1116
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,800
The tea shop is fragile.

1117
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,800
I'm afraid the shopkeeper

1118
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,800
is very thirsty.

1119
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,800
He must be full.

1120
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
I'll go to buy some food.

1121
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Thank you, sir.

1122
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
Sir, thank you.

1123
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
Thank you, sir.

1124
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
Miss Shen Xiao,

1125
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
you see,

1126
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,800
General Li is not only

1127
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
well-educated and well-educated,

1128
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,800
but also kind and kind.

1129
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800
He is a good match.

1130
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Unlike some people,

1131
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,800
they always have some crooked ideas.

1132
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
You are just a bad boy.

1133
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
You want to eat the meat of the swan.

1134
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
You...

1135
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
What's wrong with me?

1136
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
General Li is really extraordinary.

1137
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
I'm very happy.

1138
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
That's great.

1139
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
In that case,

1140
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
tomorrow is the ninth day of the first month.

1141
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
It's the day of Yi Tan's wedding.

1142
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,800
Why don't I go to send the documents and the iron

1143
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
to set your marriage early?

1144
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Miss Shen Xiao, what do you think?

1145
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Okay.

1146
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
I'll go back to report to my father.

1147
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Okay.

1148
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Thank you, Miss Shen Xiao.

1149
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,800
It's okay.

1150
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,800
Yun,

1151
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
I'll send you off.

1152
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
Miss Shen,

1153
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,800
I'm leaving.

1154
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,800
It's no use to be so clever.

1155
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,800
I'll send the iron tomorrow.

1156
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Only half a day left.

1157
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
No matter what you want to do,

1158
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
I'm afraid it's too late.

1159
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
I'll go back to report to my father.

1160
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,800
You are a beauty.

1161
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
You should be good to your conscience.

1162
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800
Brother Lu,

1163
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,800
Li Yang came prepared.

1164
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,800
The investigation is not done.

1165
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
The light is not turned off tomorrow.

1166
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
He's going to send the iron.

1167
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
What should we do?

1168
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,800
Don't worry.

1169
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,800
You stop Miss Shen Xiao

1170
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,800
and bring her back to watch the play.

1171
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
I'll go out myself this time.

1172
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,800
I'll help you.

1173
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:17,800
I know this encounter is the grace of fate

1174
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,800
Every time I see you

1175
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,800
I only have a cute stubbornness

1176
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
Although I can't remember

1177
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,800
Every difficult day

1178
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,800
I never thought of you

1179
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,800
Every difficult day

1180
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,800
I never forget the first time

1181
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,800
I saw you

1182
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Even if this love is heartless

1183
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,800
No sound, no day, no night

1184
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,800
No matter the wind and moon

1185
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,800
As long as you are fearless

1186
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,800
No worries, no worries

1187
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
Enjoy the coffin

1188
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,800
No matter the fire and the mortal world

1189
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Will there be any prejudice

1190
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,800
I'm willing to protect you with my own hands

1191
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,800
Even if I can't see you

1192
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
In front of me or in front of you

1193
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,800
I'm willing to do everything

1194
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,800
I only miss you

1195
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,800
Even if the sky is blue

1196
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,800
No more like the past

1197
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,800
Please remember the young man who used to be

1198
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:49,800
I don't want to part with you from now on
