I was afraid that you two
might wait too long and get worried,

Don't interfere in this matter.

00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,670
and searching for the evidence
strictly everywhere.

660
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,380
You can't stay here for a long time today.

661
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,500
We'll take good care of

662
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,310
Chief Matchmaker Tao and Mr. Shi.

663
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,520
Okay.

664
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,380
Father, Mother, I have to go.

665
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,290
Father.

666
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,190
Don't bully my mother.

667
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Just go.

668
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,540
You must be careful outside.

669
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,500
I'm leaving.

670
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,230
Go.

671
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,610
Bye.

672
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,770
Go. Be careful.

673
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,730
Lu, I'm back.

674
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,860
Lu, where are you?

675
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,400
Lu.

676
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,910
Are you feeling better now
after you saw your mother?

677
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,530
Why did you appear so suddenly?

678
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,890
You scared me.

679
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,720
Lu, the jailer said that

680
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,180
the Military Headquarters
lost the evidence last night.

681
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,440
It's not something uncommon.

682
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,520
You're wrong. This is something uncommon.

683
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,850
The chief commander is blocking the news.

684
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,550
How do you know that?

685
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,080
I know a lot.

686
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,310
Magistrate Zheng

687
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,510
went to pick up
the suspects under Mr. He's request.

688
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,100
Military Headquarters let your brothers
return to the magistrate's office.

689
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,140
I also know that if you pay the bail,

690
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,830
they can be released
to wait for the trial.

691
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,430
You just don't need to worry.

692
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,240
Why did the Military Headquarters

693
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,090
lose the evidence for no reason?

694
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,130
Could it be...

695
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,710
Are you the one who helped us secretly?

696
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,490
Well, you don't have to say it.

697
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,620
I understand.

698
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,840
The Military Headquarters
lost the evidence.

699
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,770
They deserve it.

700
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,320
It has nothing to do with us.

701
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,200
I just want to ask you

702
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,750
whether you told the jailers

703
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,580
to treat my parents well.

704
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,250
Ke, I want to give you a suggestion.

705
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,500
I know you helped us a lot.

706
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,210
Please say it, Lu.

707
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,710
The so-called stolen goods
mentioned by the Military Headquarters

708
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,640
belong to the Qi family
of the Weiyuan Escort Agency.

709
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,040
My parents are innocent.

710
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,380
Of course, Chief Matchmaker Tao
is innocent.

711
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,160
But now the stolen goods are missing.

712
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,310
If you can persuade the Qi family
to intercede for your parents,

713
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,970
they will have no reason
to go on detaining them.

714
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,230
But I'm not well acquainted
with the Qi family.

715
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,140
Young Master Qi is not married yet.

716
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,090
I have an idea.

717
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,370
My mother asked me to keep my position
at the Official Matchmaking Agency.

718
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,090
I can take this opportunity to provide

719
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,600
matchmaking service for the Qi family.

720
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,110
If I find a good match
for him successfully

721
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,430
and then beg the Qi family
to intercede for my parents,

722
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,430
there will be no reason for him
to refuse to help me, right?

723
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,160
Ke, you're quite smart indeed.

724
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,180
[Official Matchmaking Agency]

725
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,820
Under the government's order,

726
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,950
from today onwards,

727
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,430
I'll be the Official Matchmaking Agency's
Chief Matchmaker in place of Tao.

728
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,790
Greetings, Chief Matchmaker Deng.

729
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,720
Next, I'm going to take a roll call.

730
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,200
Where is Shi Fa'ke?

731
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,440
She... She hasn't arrived yet.

732
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,840
That's ridiculous!

733
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,870
Her mother was the Chief Matchmaker,

734
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,990
so she behaved unscrupulously.

735
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,070
Now Tao has been arrested because of

736
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,700
the case of betrothal gifts.

737
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,620
How dare she be so arrogant still?

738
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,920
Today, I'll teach her

739
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,250
how to be behave well.

740
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,700
From now on, I'll count to three.

741
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,760
If Shi Fa'ke still doesn't show up
at the Official Matchmaking Agency,

742
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,340
then her name will be

743
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,800
deleted from the list
of official matchmakers.

744
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,460
Three.

745
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,400
Two.

746
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,590
One.

747
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,060
I'm coming.

748
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,040
I'm coming.

749
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,790
Aunt Deng, I had something urgent
at home today,

750
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,830
so I'm late.

751
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,090
Now that I'm the Chief Matchmaker
of the Official Matchmaking Agency,

752
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,240
I can't indulge you like your mother.

753
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,230
Besides, if I delete your name
from the list,

754
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,930
Shi Fa'ke, isn't that what you want?

755
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,510
I...

756
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,360
Aunt Deng.

757
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,740
Aunt Deng, don't delete my name.

758
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,150
My parents have just been arrested.

759
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,510
I can't lose my job.

760
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,120
From now on, I'll be a good matchmaker

761
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,970
and won't be perfunctory.

762
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,570
I... I have a matchmaking case.

763
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,640
Hasn't Qi Shaoheng
from the Weiyuan Escort Agency

764
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,710
been the most difficult case
in the Official Matchmaking Agency?

765
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,010
Give his matchmaking case to me.

766
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,470
I'll definitely make Mrs. Qi satisfied

767
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,830
so that the Official Matchmaking Agency
can get a good reputation.

768
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,240
Ke, are you crazy?

769
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,310
Qi Shaoheng...

770
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,960
You...

771
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,510
Stop dreaming.

772
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,050
Qi Shaoheng has become my client.

773
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,520
From now on,

774
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,680
you won't be able to get
any matchmaking case

775
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,890
from the Official Matchmaking Agency.

776
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,070
He's a bad boy.

777
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,840
Aunt Deng, why did you become
his matchmaker?

778
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,590
I'm the Chief Matchmaker
of the Official Matchmaking Agency.

779
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,240
Why should I give you an explanation

780
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,750
about what I did?

781
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,750
Aunt Deng, I used to be immature.

782
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,800
Now I'm really regretting it.

783
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,670
But I can't just watch

784
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,790
my family's hereditary reputation
as the matchmaker

785
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,170
get ruined in my hands.

786
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,290
I still hope that you can

787
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,240
allow it so that I can
fulfill my filial piety.

788
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,450
Shi Fa'ke, let me tell you.

789
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,120
Even if I entrust this matchmaking case
to you today,

790
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,220
so what?

791
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,680
Do you think you can really
handle this case successfully?

792
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,620
Besides,

793
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,960
you are the family of criminals now.

794
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,510
You are not allowed to work
in the Official Matchmaking Agency.

795
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,290
Aunt Deng, please give me
another chance. Okay?

796
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,730
I will be a matchmaker carefully.

797
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,870
Aunt Deng, I beg you.

798
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,530
Please give me another chance.

799
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,130
Aunt Deng.

800
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,100
Let go of me!

801
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:45,790
Ke.

802
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,260
Well...

803
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,180
Aunt Deng.

804
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,820
This jade bracelet was given to my mother
by the late emperor.

805
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,180
It's priceless.

806
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,050
If you insist on kicking me out,

807
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,960
I won't consider
our previous friendship anymore.

808
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,050
Chief Matchmaker,

809
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,500
breaking something bestowed
by the late emperor is a tricky problem.

810
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,760
Just let Ke stay here.

811
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,130
Just consider this

812
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,150
as raising an idler and doing good things.

813
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,060
Was it really bestowed
by the late emperor as she said?

814
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,790
You said it was bestowed
by the late emperor.

815
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,990
Show me the evidence.

816
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:26,840
I...

817
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,790
Come on.

818
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,300
Aunt Deng, how dare I lie to you?

819
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,090
I just hope that you can give me a job

820
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,940
and give me a way out.

821
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,730
Didn't your mother say that

822
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,650
the Official Matchmaking Agency
never raised idlers?

823
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,220
I can't break this rule.

824
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,380
My colleagues are all here as witnesses.

825
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,540
If you can't finish

826
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,040
handling a matchmaking case
within this month,

827
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,240
your name will be deleted from the list.

829
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,180
Take care. See you next time.

830
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,160
Yang, it's hot in summer.

831
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,450
Make more Poria Cakes.

832
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,220
Qin, you are really talented.

833
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,700
Of course.

834
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,800
I'll hire you to work
in my shop in the future.

836
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,240
Tian.

837
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,540
Tian, you're poaching an elite
from our Shi family behind my back.

838
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,320
Chongshan.

839
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,300
Xianxian, both of you are back.

840
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,680
Xian, thank you for helping us
get out of jail.

841
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,430
But my parents are still in prison.

842
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,160
We still need to come up with
a solution together.

843
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,840
Why did she change
her attitudes so quickly?

844
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,400
A few days ago,
she was still my dear Aunt Deng.

845
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,060
Today, she asked me to get out.

846
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,400
How can I keep my position
as the official matchmaker?

847
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:33,840
Ke.

848
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,500
Lu, why are you here?

849
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,370
Let's go. I'll show you
something interesting.
