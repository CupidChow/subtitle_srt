I'm not afraid of anything.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No matter what,

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I won't notice it at all.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm Wang An Fan.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
After I die,

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I will be a woman.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you, my dear.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you, my dear.

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Thank you, my dear.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No matter what,

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I will be a man.

I love you.

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What's done is done.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I have something to do. I'll go first.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Aren't you going to eat something delicious?

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm going. I'm going.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What's so good about this?

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's go and take a look.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's right.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is a good official.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
By the will of Heaven, the Emperor has decreed

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
that when the Imperial Secretariat is appointed,

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Xu Ao will be the Imperial Envoy of the State

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and will be appointed by the decree of the State.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The imperial decree will be passed to the Emperor

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and the Emperor will be appointed by the decree of the State.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I, Xu Ao, swear to be loyal and filial to the State.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will be diligent and diligent.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I am very proud of my heart.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I am appointed as the Commander of the Imperial Secretariat.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I hope that I can be a clean and white man

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and a wise man.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I will be loyal to the State and protect the capital.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I hereby resign.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I congratulate you on being the Commander of the Imperial Secretariat.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
From now on, the Emperor will be the subject of the court.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Your Majesty will be the emperor.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I will soon be appointed as the Secretary of the Imperial Secretariat

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,380
and will be the

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thank you, Mr. Eunuch Guan.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Please accept this small gift.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I am very grateful to you.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Thank you, Madam.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are very lucky.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Madam Xu is virtuous and virtuous.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
She is famous in the capital.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Today, I can see that she is indeed famous.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you, Mr. Eunuch Li.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You are indeed too kind.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How can I take responsibility

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
for the words of the late Uncle Liang?

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Please, Mr. Eunuch Li.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Please wait, Mr. Eunuch.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Madam, what is it?

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I have already mentioned the divorce of He Li to the official media.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
From now on, we will be separated.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Madam, why is this?

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I have made up my mind.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You don't need to ask.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I agree.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It doesn't matter if you agree or not.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Marry Hua Yue Rong into the Xu family

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and give her to Xu Ao.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But...

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But Xu Ao already has a wife

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and just became the commander.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How can you let her be the wife of a man?

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm afraid...

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You are doubting the Marquis?

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I dare not.

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hua Yue Rong is the adopted sister of the Marquis.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The Liu family is also arguing about the divorce.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Forgive me for being stupid.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The Marquis is wise.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's good that Xu Ao is going to divorce.

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He can be the best in the world

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and be the best in the world.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
When the time comes,

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
marry Hua Yue Rong into the Xu family.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's good that you can help the Xu family.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's good that you can help the Marquis to accomplish great things.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I know. Hurry up and do it.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, Your Highness.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm telling you, you need to be more careful with that kind of case.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Ake.

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why didn't I see you yesterday?

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Do you know what we are in a hurry?

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What's the matter?

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've been taking care of myself at home recently.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know what happened.

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But...

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Looking at you, Deng Yi,

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
it should be a happy event.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Maybe it's to strengthen you.

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
After all, you even married Shen Tong Yuan.

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is one of the most difficult three major cases in the capital.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is one of the most difficult three major cases in the capital.

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's possible.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If I get a golden result,

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll treat you to dinner.

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Great.

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Your Highness, don't guess.

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Today,

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
there is indeed a major case.

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But,

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
this major case

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
can only be handled by the most famous

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
successor in the world.

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Shifak, come up.

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know what case

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Deng Mei Guan is going to reward me with.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't worry.

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll definitely handle everything you give me.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Liu Ying Ying and Xu Ao's divorce case.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What?

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Divorce?

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Who do you say is going to divorce?

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You heard it right.

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Liu Ying Ying

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
is going to divorce Xu Ao.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You've been yelling

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to get a job from Guanmei Hall.

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is your mother's bad luck.

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Please go and handle it quickly.

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No.

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No way.

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
My mom has so many good girls.

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She never had bad girls.

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It doesn't matter.

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's only one today, right?

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Look carefully.

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Liu Ying Ying's handwrote this.

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This...

167
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Xu Ao has a good reputation.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There must be some misunderstanding.

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Your mom

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
did the most beautiful bad girl in the world.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,600
I'll have to go find your mother

172
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,880
and let her clean up.

173
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,280
No need.

174
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,600
I'll go.

175
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,400
Ke.

176
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,640
What do you want to eat today?

177
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,280
I just blew the cowhide yesterday.

178
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,040
Liu Ying Ying is in a bad mood today.

179
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,240
I'll go and get her something to eat.

180
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,960
I'll go and get her something to eat.

181
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,800
I'll go and get her something to eat.

182
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,560
I'll go and get her something to eat.

183
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,280
I have to make up with Xu Yao.

184
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,640
I can't tell her about this.

185
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,160
Ke.

186
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,400
What's wrong?

187
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm fine.

188
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,600
I have something to do today.

189
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,760
Let's meet another day.

190
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,480
Immortal,

191
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,480
Ke had a problem today.

192
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,160
The light-burning official said

193
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,960
Liu Ying Ying suddenly wanted to make up with him.

194
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,520
I didn't dare to tell my mother.

195
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,920
I was afraid that she would be sad

196
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,080
but I had to do something about it.

197
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,320
What should I do?

198
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,440
Ke.

199
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,840
Mother.

200
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
What are you doing?

201
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,120
Are you talking bad about me

202
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,880
in front of the ancestors?

203
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,280
Mother.

204
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,360
How could I dare to say that?

205
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,960
I love you the most.

206
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,600
Why did you come back so early today?

207
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,600
I came back early

208
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,120
because there was nothing important.

209
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,760
Mother.

210
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,880
I have something to ask you.

211
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,400
Can all the lovers

212
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,960
be together forever?

213
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,600
Silly girl.

214
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,320
You'll get your teeth touched.

215
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,760
How can a couple

216
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,600
protect each other?

217
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
So what if there's a break-up?

218
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Should we break up?

219
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,360
Marriage is like a piece of white paper.

220
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,800
It's white and beautiful,

221
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,200
but it's also broken.

222
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,080
But if it's broken,

223
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,680
there will be traces.

224
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,680
We need to carefully collect them

225
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,800
and take good care of them.

226
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,800
Then,

227
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,800
is there any

228
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,560
in the plum tree in Mother's treasure?

229
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
Did you

230
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,760
run into something?

231
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,960
Nothing.

232
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,120
I just took the case of Zhuang and Li.

233
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,000
If Mother is still in the plum tree,

234
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
you must check

235
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,640
what's wrong.

236
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,080
If you can persuade her,

237
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,560
you should try to persuade her.

238
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,080
If you can't persuade her,

239
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,240
some people will change their minds.

240
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,160
No matter who made the plum tree,

241
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,040
you don't have to force them.

242
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,000
If it's a trap,

243
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
you'll be in a dilemma.

244
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
What if it's about

245
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,480
the reputation of the world's number one plum tree?

246
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,160
My child.

247
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,640
There are traces

248
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:54,920
on this

249
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,160
plum tree.

250
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,880
I understand.

251
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm sorry for not visiting you.

252
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,680
Please forgive me.

253
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,680
Hello, Sister Liu.

254
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
I should have come earlier

255
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
but I was in a bad mood at home.

256
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,640
I was afraid I would cause trouble to my uncle.

257
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
I didn't come.

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,680
Please.

259
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,280
I'm a little embarrassed

260
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,960
to hear you say that.

261
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,280
Xu Yao is a straightforward person.

262
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,800
She has no relationship with the General's Office.

263
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,760
She didn't help the head of the army.

264
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,040
Please forgive her.

265
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,120
I understand.

266
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,000
You don't have to blame yourself.

267
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,680
Ke.

268
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,920
I know why you came.

269
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm willing to make a compromise.

270
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,280
You

271
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,840
manage the house well.

272
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,800
You can see my intention.

273
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,200
The commandant Xu is now in a bad mood.

274
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,920
Do you really want to

275
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,480
tear this house apart?

276
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,240
I've made up my mind.

277
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,080
If you do it for my good,

278
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,680
just handle this case.

279
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,520
Sister Liu.

280
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,800
My mother often tells me

281
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,880
that teeth can also touch the tongue.

282
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,320
This marriage is like a white paper.

283
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,640
It's beautiful, but it's broken.

284
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,120
If you think too much,

285
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,800
it will be forever.

286
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,720
We've been married for seven years.

287
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,200
I wish all the lovers a happy marriage.

288
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,640
But now,

289
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,760
it's our turn.

290
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
Yesterday I caused a disturbance with all the leaves in the northern space.

291
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
The stem of flowers is broken.

292
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,960
Something else happened to my groups along the way.

293
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,200
Your mother

294
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:57,800
couldn't

295
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,880
Sister Liu, my mother has many people.

296
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,360
She won't take the wrong person.

297
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,760
She is so deep in love.

298
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,160
She shouldn't take the wrong person.

299
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,520
Sister,

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,200
I can see that

301
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,600
you still love her.

302
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
I'm not making you wrong yourself.

303
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,440
I can do this divorce thing.

304
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,200
But I hope you can

305
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,920
tell me the truth.

306
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
Xue Aoye didn't come back

307
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,760
because of the hundred-flower inn.

308
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,760
She is in an ambiguous relationship with the inn's manager.

309
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,880
She has been released from the prison.

310
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Mrs. Xu,

311
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,840
I'm Hua Yuerong.

312
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,200
I know you must be curious about me.

313
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,760
So I came to see you.

314
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
You're thinking too much.

315
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,680
I'm not curious.

316
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,200
I don't want to know.

317
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,320
You can try.

318
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,240
You should know that

319
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,520
escaping

320
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,560
doesn't mean nothing.

321
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm sure you've heard

322
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,160
that Xu Aoye is the manager.

323
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,760
She likes me.

324
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,280
Tell her to come to me.

325
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,920
I'll help her.

326
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,760
I heard that you haven't had a child for seven years.

327
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,040
Although you don't care about it,

328
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
but...

329
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,280
You're so innocent.

330
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,040
Please give us

331
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,280
a way out.

332
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,360
You're so mean.

333
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,240
How dare you come to me?

334
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,760
Everyone is congratulating me.

335
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,560
But who knows

336
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,040
that my new manager's name

337
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,000
is just a false name.

338
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,640
In that case,

339
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,720
I must get rid of this scumbag.

340
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,520
If it's really like what you said,

341
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,200
I'll make him do as you say

342
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,640
and give you a freedom.

343
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,920
If marriage is happiness,

344
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,640
and husband is love,

345
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,120
who would want a freedom?

346
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
Come on.

347
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Come on.

348
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,480
Come on.

349
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Be careful.

350
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,840
Brother Lu.

351
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,520
Ke.

352
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,240
I came to see you today.

353
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,760
I brought you some food.

354
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
I know you're worried about something.

355
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,720
But about the Xu family,

356
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,960
why don't you tell me

357
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,800
if I can help you?

358
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,680
I'm sure you've heard that

359
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,160
the Xu family is very reasonable.

360
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,360
If I don't do it,

361
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,000
Aunt Deng will go to stir up trouble

362
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,160
and harass my mother.

363
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
If I do it,

364
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,440
she'll catch me

365
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,720
and kick me out of Guanmian Pavilion.

366
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,600
She'll even ruin my mother's reputation.

367
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,240
Deng Wei Guan is

368
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,680
evil and evil.

369
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,120
What's the problem?

370
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,160
I'm so suspicious of him.

371
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,280
Who knows he'll change his mind?

372
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,520
In that case,

373
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,680
what do you suggest?

374
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,720
It's impossible.

375
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,800
Hua Yue Rong

376
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,640
is trying to provoke Sister Liu.

377
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,200
It seems that the rumors are not fake.

378
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,320
I must solve the problem myself.

379
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,040
We'll listen to Xu Yao's advice.

380
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,520
I think so, too.

381
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,640
But I waited for days

382
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,280
and didn't see him come back.

383
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,360
Since he's close to Hua Yue Rong,

384
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,120
why don't we go to Baihua Hall?

385
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,880
That's right.

386
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,800
But we're going there empty-handed.

387
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,720
It's like asking for punishment.

388
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,360
How about we bring gifts

389
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,840
and wish him a good luck?

390
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,200
Let's go to Xibao Pavilion.

391
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,880
Okay.

392
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,400
You're here.

393
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,280
What's going on?

394
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,200
Why didn't you tell me?

395
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,040
Why didn't you tell me?

396
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,880
I didn't know.

397
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,440
You were here too.

398
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,320
I didn't know.

399
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,600
Shi Bukui,

400
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,600
do you like my handkerchief?

401
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,840
Shi Bukui,

402
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,280
you're so strong.

403
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,120
You hurt my foot.

404
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,520
I didn't touch you.

405
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,400
Don't hurt me.

406
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,320
You suddenly grabbed my handkerchief

407
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,120
and smacked me.

408
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,720
You...

409
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,400
Are you trying to torture me?

410
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm not

411
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
a good singer.

412
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,880
Now,

413
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,160
I hurt my foot

414
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,880
and you humiliated me.

415
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,480
I'm going to your house

416
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,000
and make Tao Shuang Mei give me a lesson.

417
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,600
Let's go.

418
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,080
What are you doing?

419
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,200
What are you doing here?

420
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm just here for a while.

421
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,720
It's not convenient to walk.

422
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
But we have a lot of things to do in Xibao Pavilion.

423
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,240
Shi Bukui,

424
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
you have to take responsibility.

425
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,200
As long as Manager Li

426
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
doesn't tell the family about this,

427
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,080
I'm willing to take it off.

428
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,200
Actually,

429
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,080
I'm not a unreasonable person.

430
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,360
Once I'm done with my foot,

431
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,960
I won't bother Shi Bukui anymore.

432
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,200
Let's go.

433
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,800
Let's go.

434
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,160
Haven't you seen the owner being surrounded?

435
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,400
Shi Bukui is so dangerous.

436
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
He's a traitor.

437
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,160
No, no, no.

438
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,480
You win again.

439
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,080
Let's start over.

440
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,600
Let's start over.

441
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,400
Let's start over.

442
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,560
I...

443
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,520
Boss,

444
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,720
didn't I tell you to keep an eye on Ke?

445
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,480
Ke didn't come back.

446
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,360
Why are you back?

447
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,720
Brother, why didn't you say anything?

448
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,240
I...

449
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,280
I can't make it clear.

450
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,040
It's all because of that lady.

451
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,360
Son,

452
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
which lady?

453
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,920
Tell your mother to go to the wedding.

454
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a good thing.

455
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Tell Ke to go.

456
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,880
Yes, yes, yes.

457
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
Tell Ke to go.

458
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,480
Which lady?

459
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,600
If mother finds out

460
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,160
that I'm provoking Li Pan'er,

461
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
I'll be doomed.

462
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
I think Li Pan'er's reputation will be ruined.

463
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,440
But Ke can't just leave Ke alone.

464
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,160
What should I do?

465
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,600
It's too hard for me.

466
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,600
I'm too busy.

467
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,640
Son, what's wrong with you?

468
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,800
Which lady

469
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,160
has given you a headache?

470
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,480
Tell me, which lady?

471
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,240
I'm not.

472
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,880
I didn't.

473
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,600
Don't talk nonsense.

474
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,440
What nonsense?

475
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,200
What nonsense?

476
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,960
How can you talk to me?

477
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,880
How can you talk to me?

478
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,200
Brother, tell her.

479
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,120
This...

480
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,040
Father,

481
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,200
brother,

482
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,840
I...

483
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,600
I'm provoking her.

484
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,080
What?

485
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,560
What?

486
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,200
Provoking her?

487
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,880
No.

488
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,120
No.

489
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,120
It's...

490
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,600
It's Manager Li who said I provoked her.

491
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,480
No, no.

492
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,880
Manager Li must have been instructed by Lu Chi

493
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,120
to say that.

494
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,640
Isn't she

495
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,640
a high-ranking guard

496
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,960
because of me?

497
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,280
Son,

498
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,000
do you have a misunderstanding

499
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,160
about the words high-ranking and powerful?

500
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,400
Or Manager Li has a problem

501
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,320
with his eyesight?

502
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
What do you mean?

503
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
I mean,

504
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,600
how can he look down on you?

505
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,320
It makes sense.

506
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,040
This color looks better.

507
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,880
These don't seem to fit.

508
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Sister Pan'er,

509
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,600
what should I give her?

510
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,120
Don't worry, Miss Shiqiang.

511
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,200
Our Chief

512
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,840
must have made some arrangements.

513
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,200
Sister Pan'er,

514
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,560
what happy thing did you encounter

515
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,840
that made you smile so happily?

516
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,120
Did I smile?

517
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,160
Maybe it's the teacher

518
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,920
who made me smile.

519
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,800
It's so interesting.

520
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,480
Teacher?

521
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,480
What teacher?

522
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,240
Boss He.

523
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,200
Thank you.

524
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,280
Brother Xian.

525
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,840
Ke.

526
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Why are you here?

527
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,520
Manager Li, sorry for the inconvenience.

528
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,320
It's okay.

529
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,600
This is the telegram you ordered.

530
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,800
Please wait a moment.

531
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,600
Brother, this way, please.

532
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,160
Brother Xian, you're just in time.

533
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,160
I'm going to meet Xu Ao and Xu Commandant.

534
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
What do you think

535
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,200
is good about me and Song Qing?

536
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,560
Why don't you go back with me?

537
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,600
Let's choose some

538
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
exquisite desserts.

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,040
Is Tian Tian still angry with me?

540
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,320
If I go back with you,

541
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,920
will he kick me out?

542
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,800
He's not angry anymore.

543
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,880
He's been thinking about you these days.

544
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,520
But

545
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,960
Song Qing's food

546
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,760
is too ordinary.

547
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,680
I wonder

548
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,280
how this is.

549
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,120
Brother Lu,

550
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,600
what kind of drawing is this?

551
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,000
No matter what kind of drawing it is,

552
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,360
Xu Ao is an idol.

553
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,960
How can he draw it himself?

554
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,640
This pen

555
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,720
is very similar to Mr. Lin Yuan's pen.

556
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,360
It just doesn't have a print.

557
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,840
But this pen

558
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,480
is more advanced

559
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,960
than Mr. Lin Yuan's drawing.

560
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,400
Maybe this is the one.

561
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,800
Maybe it's just a copy.

562
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,600
How can it be a person

563
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,960
without a print?

564
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,240
Brother Xian, you're wrong.

565
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,440
Mr. Lin Yuan is a daughter of a thousand golds.

566
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,080
Xu Ao just got promoted.

567
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,640
If I give him a real one,

568
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,080
I won't be able to get a job.

569
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,840
This copy is

570
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,200
of good interest and good art.

571
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,280
As a gift from someone

572
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,560
who gives each other gifts,

573
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,640
it's not elegant

574
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,880
and doesn't violate national law.

575
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
That's right.

576
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,280
Brother Xian,

577
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,240
we have to do something important.

578
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,120
We'll see you and Tiantian next time.

579
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,280
Go ahead.

580
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,440
Be more careful.

581
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,920
Brother Lu,

582
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,520
do you think Xu Ao

583
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,520
is really like what Liu Ying Ying said?

584
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't dare to say it.

585
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,360
But everything is real.

586
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,760
I'll go to the White Flower Art Hall with you

587
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,800
to meet Xu Ao.

588
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,080
Then we'll make a decision.

589
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,280
How's the divorce?

590
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,760
Don't worry, sir.

591
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,920
I've sent Tao's daughter

592
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,200
to the Department of Law and Justice.

593
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,600
It'll be done soon.

594
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,400
You sent Tao's daughter to the Department of Law and Justice?

595
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,600
You're delaying the official affairs

596
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,680
for your own good.

597
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,840
I just want to humiliate

598
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,080
the world's number one media.

599
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,160
I want to be a real person.

600
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,360
I want to be a real person.

601
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,320
I want to get the best out of it.

602
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,120
I don't know

603
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,280
if I'm dreaming or not.

604
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,480
I finally forced Liu Ying Ying

605
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,760
to take the initiative to divorce.

606
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,120
But I didn't close the door.

607
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,600
But I delayed my brother's official affairs

608
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,960
because of personal reasons.

609
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,040
If my brother blames me,

610
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,880
you and I will be sorry.

611
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,320
I dare not.

612
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,400
I dare not.

613
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,760
I'll go to see Xu Ao

614
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,000
in person tomorrow.

615
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,880
No need.

616
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,640
Give me the divorce letter.

617
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,400
You may leave.

618
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,920
I'll leave now.

619
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,240
My Lady,

620
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,120
the lantern is not used.

621
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,400
It's really useless.

622
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,040
You almost got me into trouble.

623
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
His Lordship is still

624
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,280
worried about Xu Ao.

625
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,800
Don't worry, Brother Yi.

626
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Xu Ao has been

627
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,360
unwilling to go home.

628
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,920
He stays in my house every night.

629
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,800
He's in my control.

630
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,280
Men

631
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,440
can't let go of their homes

632
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,960
and can't bear to be out.

633
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,920
Please do

634
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,960
as His Lordship ordered.

635
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,720
Ask Xu Ao

636
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,200
to sign the divorce letter

637
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,680
and marry him

638
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,680
to help His Lordship.

639
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,680
Let Brother Yi

640
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,120
wait for my good news.

641
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,280
Yes, BER ADANS

642
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,720
Your Highness,

643
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
Chu Yunxi

644
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,720
sent you wine yesterday.

645
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,200
Your Highness.

646
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,640
Don't be too friendly.

647
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,080
We can't let anyone else know.

648
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,640
I'll go to have a look.

649
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,600
Leave the window.

650
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,320
Yes, Your Highness.

651
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,920
Mr. Hua, since you've brought wine,

652
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,400
come in and have a drink with me.

653
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,280
Brother Lu,

654
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
let's go and see what Xu Yao is doing.

655
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,840
Ke,

656
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
no matter what he sees,

657
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,760
don't act rashly.

658
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,880
Don't worry.

659
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,440
I know how to deal with him.

660
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,520
If he's just eating and drinking,

661
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,160
I won't do anything out of the box.

662
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,960
Let's go.

663
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,760
If you do as I said,

664
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,920
as long as you're a woman,

665
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,560
you'll be happy.

666
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,520
That's good.

667
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,920
As long as I can make her smile, that's good.

668
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,160
Mr. Xu.

669
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,280
Lady Shi.

670
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,480
Why are you here?

671
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,160
This is...

672
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,760
I think I've seen him somewhere.

673
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,920
Mr. Xu,

674
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,480
my surname is Lu Mingchi.

675
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,040
I'm the owner of Xibao Pavilion.

676
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,560
Are you the guests Mr. Xu invited?

677
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,760
This gift is to congratulate you on your promotion.

678
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,200
My mother is your matchmaker.

679
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,800
I'm here today

680
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,680
to talk to you about something important.

681
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,760
What is it?

682
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,480
You didn't even close the door just now.

683
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,080
I heard something outside the door.

684
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,520
I wanted to hear you confess your love.

685
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,760
But you two are so close.

686
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,160
I don't think it's necessary.

687
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,720
I'm here today

688
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,280
to ask you to sign this divorce agreement.

689
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,920
Lady Shi.

690
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,880
I'm friends with Mr. Hua.

691
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Don't misunderstand.

692
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,440
Stop quibbling.

693
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,000
I'll get justice for you.

694
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,480
Sign this divorce agreement

695
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,360
and you'll never have anything to do with me.

696
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
You'll never have anything to do with me.

697
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,760
I won't divorce you.

698
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,440
Give me the divorce agreement

699
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,200
and I'll tear it up.

700
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,000
You...

701
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,440
Take it.

702
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,160
You two won't leave

703
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,120
because it's settled like this?

704
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:58,020
Both of you are quite

705
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,340
and pedantic

706
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,080
conductance.

707
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,800
I've been Fa does everything here for the past three years.

708
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,680
I'd never just left here

709
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,040
if I was you.

710
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,840
You're the son of saying that you'd let me do anything I said,

711
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,760
whether it be to sleep at home,

712
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,980
or to bed.

713
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,320
Since it's you,

714
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,680
I'd like to take over the red carpet

715
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,600
How did you get here?

716
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,120
I didn't want to disband them

717
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,800
for my mother's reputation.

718
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,400
But now,

719
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,120
I need to have a crush on someone else.

720
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,320
I can't let you suffer for the rest of your life.

721
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,880
Besides,

722
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,200
there's only one woman

723
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,200
who is a good match for me.

724
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,800
The ones who get married after the marriage

725
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,880
will be even better.

726
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,440
You have a good appearance

727
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,400
and a good temper.

728
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,960
It's not difficult to find a good match for you.

729
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,120
Even if you don't,

730
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,280
you still have a good family.

731
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,360
You can get the property of that scoundrel

732
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,680
and live a good life.

733
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,720
Do you believe my Ten-person Book?

734
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,160
What did you see?

735
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,680
A'ge,

736
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,720
where did your ability to observe and enter the microcosm go?

737
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,280
Think about what happened just now.

738
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,120
Xu Yao made me angry

739
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,400
and went out of the cloud.

740
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,040
Wait.

741
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,120
When Xu Yao and Hua Yun Rong talked,

742
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,200
they didn't close the door.

743
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,880
Did Hua Yun Rong

744
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,320
really do all this on purpose?

745
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,240
It's very possible.

746
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,280
When Xu Yao ordered Hua Yun Rong to send the guest,

747
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,800
it's like what Brother Lu ordered Manager Li.

748
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,720
Even Brother Lu's words

749
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,920
are much more reasonable.

750
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,720
If Xu Yao really likes Manager Hua,

751
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,360
she should be kind to him all the time.

752
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,200
Not like this.

753
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,840
Did we really blame Xu Yao?

754
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Is it really Hua Yun Rong who is talking nonsense?

755
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,800
It's possible.

756
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,120
So we should figure out the truth.

757
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,920
We need to give Xu Yao an explanation to make it easier to make a decision.

758
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,640
We can't

759
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,840
just let the anger go and separate the couple.

760
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,000
Brother Lu is right.

761
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,240
I was too excited just now.

762
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,680
I wonder if Brother Lu

763
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,680
is willing to accompany me to find out the truth

764
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,680
and make a judgment.

765
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,000
Of course.

766
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,640
Let's go.

767
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,640
Let's go.

768
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:49,920
Is he insatiable?

769
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,520
He ruins his family with his stupidity.

770
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,520
He is cite

771
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,800
Why did he have to bring Xiao Feifei here?

772
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,400
He went home

773
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,200
seeking for peace after he skeletons the wall.

774
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,480
Perhaps it's because he couldn't once scientists saw him anymore.

775
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,360
This even makes him less capable.

776
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,880
He even organized it by hanging with related firing basket.

777
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,840
Xia Xiaofei isits this Years.

778
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,800
He even plates medicines on the walls in He Chief's comeback.

779
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
A man of good character is always a man of good character.

780
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
He doesn't look like a good person at all.

781
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Enough. Let's talk on stage first.

782
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Let's go.

783
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Brother Lu, you must not let go.

784
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I don't want to let the truth be found out.

785
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
I want to be cleared first.

786
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,800
I won't let go. But you must promise me.

787
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
No matter what you see or hear later,

788
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
don't forget it.

789
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Otherwise, we will be in trouble.

790
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
I won't be angry for a scumbag.

791
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
As long as you don't let go.

792
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Sir, have you sent the rouge?

793
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
I have.

794
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,800
It's on the dressing table that he often uses.

795
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Sir, don't think too much.

796
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
As long as you do as I say,

797
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
everything will be fine.

798
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Brother Lu, they...

799
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
They're not innocent.

800
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Let's go.

801
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Let's go.

802
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Don't worry, brother.

803
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
He's just drunk.

804
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
This is a long story.

805
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
I'm not telling you this because I want to help you.

806
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
You two should go back.

807
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Chief Hua, you...

808
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Brother, let's go.

809
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Sister Pang'er,

810
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,800
I wonder if there's a better rouge in the store.

811
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
Of course.

812
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
Xiaowen.

813
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Speaking of which,

814
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
this is a sample that a customer

815
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
specially ordered from us.

816
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
There's only one product.

817
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
The buyer took it yesterday.

818
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Lady Shiqiang, you can only take a look.

819
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
I'm afraid you can't buy it.

820
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
This color is really nice.

821
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Manager Li,

822
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
you hid such a nice thing and didn't sell it to me.

823
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
I wonder who

824
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
specially ordered such a nice rouge.

825
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
It's...

826
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Xu Ao,

827
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
Commander Xu.

828
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
It's him.

829
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
He bought the rouge

830
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
and must be given to that person.

831
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,800
That's why he's the one who fell in love with you.

832
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
This is the best for you.

833
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
You don't have to be so happy.

834
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
One more thing.

835
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
I want to ask you a question.

836
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
I'm really sorry.

837
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
I'm really sorry.

838
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm sorry.

839
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
I'm really sorry.

840
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
I'm really sorry.

841
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
I'm really sorry.

842
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,800
I'm really sorry.

843
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
I'm really sorry.

844
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,200
What is this?

845
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Sister Liu, look.

846
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
What is this?

847
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Why is it on my dressing table?

848
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,600
What is going on?

849
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,200
Sister Liu, if you want to know, just follow me to find out.

850
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Okay.

851
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Good! Good!

852
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,200
Brother Lu, you can definitely bring me here.

853
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,800
Why did you bring me to the cold room outside?

854
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,800
I thought you could hear it clearly outside.

855
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Brother He, do you want me to hold you two in the bed?

856
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,800
The First Lady's House

857
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,400
Lord Xu usually comes here after you fall asleep.

858
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,600
Why didn't you go back today?

859
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,600
I don't know if he saw the rouge.

860
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,800
Will he like it?

861
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,400
Ying Ying doesn't like me these days.

862
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,200
I shouldn't go back.

863
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,800
I'll wait until she calms down and I'll go back.

864
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,200
You're still so persistent and you still misunderstand him.

865
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,000
Don't you still want to divorce her?

866
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,400
Of course not.

867
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,200
When I was still a nobody, he just ignored me.

868
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,400
It's all my fault. I didn't take good care of him.

869
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,200
But since we're together,

870
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,800
I should be nice to him.

871
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,600
Please forgive me, Lord.

872
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,000
I have something to confess to you.

873
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,400
What is it?

874
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,800
Do you know why Madam

875
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,400
wants to divorce you?

876
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
Why?

877
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,800
You often ignore my care.

878
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,000
So someone forced me to seduce you

879
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,400
and let me marry into the Xu Manor.

880
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,200
But you never refused.

881
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,800
I'm willing to do anything for this.

882
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,200
I'm not stubborn.

883
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,800
But I'm willing to lie to Madam

884
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,200
to tell her I'm pregnant.

885
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,800
What?

886
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,200
No wonder Ying Ying wants to divorce me.

887
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,000
I thought she didn't like me for being rude.

888
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,200
I didn't take good care of her.

889
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,000
Xu Yao!

890
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,400
Madam!

891
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,000
My husband, I didn't write to you.

892
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But I can't give you a child

893
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,200
and I feel sorry for you.

894
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:23,600
And you often ignore me.

895
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
I thought you were tired of me.

896
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,000
How could that be?

897
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,600
How could I be tired of you?

898
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
You're not even enough.

899
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,200
I just have something on my mind.

900
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,000
I often ignore your feelings.

901
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,800
It's fate that I have you.

902
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,600
If I don't come, it's also destiny.

903
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,400
As long as I can grow old with you,

904
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
I won't ask for more.

905
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,000
But you're the only child of the family.

906
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Before I died, Aunt Wen told me

907
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,800
to continue the marriage for the Xu family.

908
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,000
How could I not listen?

909
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,800
My silly girl.

910
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,200
If you really can't have a child,

911
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,800
and you insist on having one,

912
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,000
we can adopt one.

913
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
You're right.

914
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,400
A couple's relationship is based on the two.

915
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,000
How can we rely on the child?

916
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,600
If you want to divorce because of the child,

917
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
he's not a good husband.

918
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,800
You're right.

919
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,800
You really think so?

920
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,000
I married you because I love you.

921
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,600
I won't divorce you because of this.

922
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,400
I'm not a good husband.

923
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,800
Ying Ying is different.

924
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
Madam.

925
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Mr. Xu, I'm going to tell you.

926
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,200
Song Yanzhi didn't tell Sister Liu.

927
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,400
If I didn't hear it,

928
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
when would Sister Liu see it?

929
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,600
It's all my fault.

930
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,000
It's all my fault.

931
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,400
It's my fault.

932
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,600
I shouldn't have not trusted you.

933
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,200
You're all right.

934
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,600
You're all right.

935
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,400
It's my fault.

936
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,600
I didn't eavesdrop earlier.

937
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,200
Ake, what's going on?

938
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,800
Didn't we agree not to see each other for a few days?

939
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Why did you send me a letter?

940
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,200
Don't listen to the rumors.

941
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,600
Xu Hao and I are innocent.

942
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,200
But I really have some difficulties.

943
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,600
Wait for me for a few days.

944
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,400
When I'm done with this,

945
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,800
we can leave.

946
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,000
What difficulties does Manager Hua have?

947
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,800
Tell me.

948
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,000
Manager Hua, you still won't tell me?

949
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,400
Shi Meiguan, Chief Lu,

950
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,000
that letter was written by Brother Feng.

951
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,400
What did you teach him?

952
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,600
Don't worry, Manager Hua.

953
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,000
Mr. Li is safe and sound.

954
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,800
Rong'er.

955
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,200
Brother Feng.

956
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,800
Chief Lu is here to help us.

957
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,200
He can help us get out of trouble.

958
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,800
Brother Lu,

959
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,000
they are deeply in love.

960
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,800
I believe Manager Hua has his difficulties.

961
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,200
Chief Lu,

962
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,000
I did do something wrong before.

963
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm deeply sorry about that.

964
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,400
The reason I did that was because I was forced.

965
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,200
I can't say it.

966
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,600
Who did it?

967
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,800
Chief Lu, please forgive me.

968
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,400
I can't tell you.

969
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,600
Don't worry, Manager Hua.

970
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,600
I promise I'll send you two out of the capital safely.

971
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,400
Not two,

972
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,800
but three of us.

973
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,000
Chief Lu, you can just bring Madam Liu here.

974
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,400
If there's any misunderstanding,

975
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,000
I can leave the city.

976
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,400
Manager Hua, you're straightforward.

977
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,600
But the truth is clear.

978
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,200
I'll send someone to send you and Mr. Li out of the capital.

979
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,800
Thank you, Chief Lu and Miss Shi.

980
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,600
We overheard the story

981
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,400
and knew that Mr. Xu was innocent.

982
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,600
But Manager Hua didn't want to tell us the truth.

983
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,000
Luckily, Brother Lu found the key person

984
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,200
and convinced him.

985
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:32,000
Ke, you found the

986
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
The person who has feelings will have another lover.

987
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'll do as I say.

988
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,400
Manager Hua, I'll keep your family safe.

989
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Chief Lu, Miss Shi,

990
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,200
you saved my reputation

991
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,800
and arranged a way out for me.

992
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
I'm very grateful.

993
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,800
It's all your fault.

994
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,000
Fine. It's all my fault.

995
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Why is it so hot today?

996
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Mother, I think

997
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,400
no matter what,

998
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
we can't let them get together.

999
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,000
Because the name of the mother

1000
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
is not the same as the name of the father.

1001
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I think we should

1002
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
not let them get together.

1003
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,600
Because the name of the mother

1004
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,800
is the most famous brand in the world.

1005
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,000
But when I know Xu Ao has a second heart,

1006
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,600
I can't use Sister Liu's pain

1007
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,000
to protect our family's reputation.

1008
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,600
So if Sister Liu is telling the truth,

1009
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,400
I will help them get together.

1010
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,000
Ke, that day

1011
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,400
when you and Ancestor were suffering,

1012
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,000
I heard it outside the ancestral hall.

1013
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,800
So you know

1014
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,200
why they want to get together?

1015
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,800
I just hope

1016
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,600
all the decisions you made

1017
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,800
are from your heart.

1018
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
It's not because of me

1019
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
or this brand.

1020
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,800
It's better if you just do it.

1021
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,400
Then let me ask you.

1022
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,600
Even if I blame you,

1023
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,000
will you still remember the original intention?

1024
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,800
Yes. I will.

1025
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,600
What a good boy.

1026
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
You are a beauty.

1027
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,200
You should always remember that

1028
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,600
if you move your mouth,

1029
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,400
you can be destined for the happiness of others.

1030
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,800
Everything is not as good as the true heart.

1031
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,400
No matter it's the reputation of the mother

1032
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,800
or the world's most beautiful beauty,

1033
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,800
it's not as important as the happiness of two people.

1034
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,400
This is the real place for beauty.

1035
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,800
Ke.

1036
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,200
Ke.

1037
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,200
You saved Liu Yingying's marriage.

1038
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,800
Why are you still unhappy?

1039
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,800
Brother Lu, why are you here?

1040
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,400
Don't let my brother find out.

1041
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,200
I wanted to tell you the good news,

1042
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,000
but I heard you sighing.

1043
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,200
Why don't you tell me about your depression?

1044
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,800
How could you understand?

1045
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,200
I spent three nights at the wedding

1046
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,400
to comfort my children.

1047
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,200
Sister Liu didn't love me

1048
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,400
but she didn't have children.

1049
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,800
I think life is not as good as willful.

1050
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,400
This is the good news I wanted to tell you.

1051
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,600
I asked the doctor for Mrs. Xu's diagnosis.

1052
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,000
She has willful treatment.

1053
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,600
So you don't have to worry.

1054
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,200
Xu Yao loves Liu Yingying.

1055
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,800
She doesn't care if she has children.

1056
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,000
Really?

1057
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,400
Thank you for opening her heart.

1058
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,800
Brother Lu,

1059
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,800
if you were Xu Yao, what would you do?

1060
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,600
I'm like that too.

1061
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,600
Whoever I can admire,

1062
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,400
whether they are children or not,

1063
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,600
I'll be true to myself.
