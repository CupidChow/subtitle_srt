I can't let you contribute
both labor and money.

Young Master, what book
are you looking for?

175
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,180
[Lu Zhuxi, Mount Qianya]

176

What's your best-selling novel?

181
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,840
For novels,

182
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,190
the ones by Neighboring Hermit
are the most popular.

183
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,760
However, for the past month,

184
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,620
he hasn't released any new chapters.

185
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,820

I can deliver them to your home myself.

198
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,350
Boss,

199
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,490

200

Neighboring Hermit's novels in a while.

201
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,740
I've read some others,

202
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,620
but I only want
Neighboring Hermit's new chapters.

203

Neighboring Hermit

204
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,160
hasn't written a single word for a month.

205
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,860
Why don't you take a look at this one?

206
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,380
It's by Nine-Turn Scholar

207
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,190
and it's quite good too.

208
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,390
That won't be necessary.

209
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,350
I only read Neighboring Hermit.

210
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,390
Boss, if a new chapter arrives,

211
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,010
please deliver it to my home.

212
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,440
Rest assured,

213
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,540
if a new chapter comes,

214
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,660
I'll deliver them
to the Prime Minister's residence.

Take care.

Who knew this young lady was so pretty

218
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,350
and had such great taste?

219
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,910
This is an authentic piece.

220
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,600
Really?

221
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,660
It must be quite valuable.

222
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,870
Look at these color combinations.

223
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,530
They're absolutely perfect.

224
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,790
I don't think I saw this
when I was here last time.

225
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,270
These must be updated daily.

226
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,630
Whenever something sells,

227
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,290
they put new items on display.

228
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,280
Young Master,

229
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,980
Would you like to take a look at
our new arrivals?

230
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,610
For family, we have pearls,
jade, and glass lamps.

231
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,800
For the ladies, we have necklaces,
earrings, and hairpins.

232
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,570
We have it all.

233
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,890
Your chiefâ€”

234
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,020
What bad timing,

235
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,500
our chief isn't here.

236
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,740
If you have urgent business,

237
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,380
feel free to leave your name.

238
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,740
Not here? That's good.

239
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,090
Ms. Li, go about your business.

240
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,480
Bring me some fine tea.

241
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,610
I want that... Snow-Tipped Jade!

242
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,090
He knows who our chief is
and isn't afraid of him.

243
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,930
He knows my full name,

244
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,590
yet I don't know his face.

245
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,590
The Snow-Tipped Jade
only arrived three days ago.

246
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,060
In the capital, besides me

247
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,450
and Chief,

248
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,540
even Lu Yi might not know about it.

249
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,810
Who on earth is this person?

250
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,260
Oh no.

251
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,460
I saw Snow-Tipped Jade
mentioned in a secret report,

252
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,380
and I accidentally let it slip!

253
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,510
So even Xibao Pavilion
doesn't have such fine tea.

254
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,870
They say Xibao Pavilion
has countless treasures,

255
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,390
but it seems that's an exaggeration.

256
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,400
It's not that we don't have it,

257
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,320
but even if Deputy Chief
wants to drink it,

258
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,410
he still needs Chief's approval.

259
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,810
What do you mean by that?

260
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,860
I've met countless people,

261
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,970
but just from the Snow-Tipped Jade,

262
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,050
I wouldn't dare make assumptions.

263
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,450
After all, Xibao Pavilion

264
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,490
often gets troublemakers.

265
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,080
However,

266
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,450
that jade belt at your waist

267
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,640
was specially made by Xibao Pavilion.

268
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,190
Only two sets were made,

269
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,420
one for Chief,

270
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,060
and one for Deputy Chief.

271
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,240
Deputy Chief,

272
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,910
you came down from the mountain
without permission.

273
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,110
Does the Master know?

274
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Ms. Li, please hush!

275
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,090
Of course my brother doesn't know.

276
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,670
I haven't figured out how to tell him yet.

277
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
I came here

278
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,330
to gather some information.

279
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,720
What don't I know?

280
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,960
Chi, how are you?

281
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,880
Tell me, why did you leave the mountain
without permission?

282
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,340
I couldn't see you on the mountain

283
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,720
and was really worried about your safety,

284
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,280
so I came down to find you.

285
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,590
It's only a 10-day journey from
Mount Qianya to the capital.

286
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,110
Why have you only shown up today?

287
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,810
Chi,

288
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,380
the capital is just so lively and fun.

289
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,200
It was beyond my expectations.

290
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,510
So... I got delayed for a few days.

291
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,300
Chi, I'm here now, aren't I?

292
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:04,960
I...

293
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,940
From now on,
we won't have to be apart anymore.

294
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,880
Master,

295
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,340
the samples of the glass lamps

296
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,770
for the Flower Assembly are ready.

297
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,470
Lu Yi?

298
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,400
Long time no see!

299
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,650
Deputy Chief!

300
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,550
Lu Yi, why are you evading him?

301
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,870
I finally managed to escape

302
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,330
this little demon.

303
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,870
Flower Assembly?

304
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,370
What is the Flower Assembly?

305
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,340
The Flower Assembly is a garden party
hosted by the Official Matchmaking Agency

306
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,740
for single men and women.

307
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,370
Ms. Li, tell me more.

308
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,830
Xibao Pavilion is sponsoring
the Flower Assembly this year,

309
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,500
and all the young ladies and
gentlemen of the capital

310
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,690
will come to enjoy the garden party

311
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,400
in hopes of finding their true love.

312
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,860
Then what are the glass lamps for?

313
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,570
The glass lamps were commissioned by
Miss Shi

314
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,660
of the Official Matchmaking Agency

315
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,030
to be used at the Flower Assembly.

316
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,150
Marriage Broker Shi?

317
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,600
Who is Marriage Broker Shi?

318
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,060
Marriage Broker Shi is...

319
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,150
This Flower Assembly sounds
so fun and lively.

320
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,760
I want to go too!

321
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,410
You will stay at
Xibao Pavilion and reflect.

322
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,940
You're not to step outside.

323
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,380
I don't want to!

324
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,869
Brother, I want to go to
the Flower Assembly!

325
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,020
The glass lamps have arrived.

326
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,000
They'll be delivered to
the Flower Manor soon.

327
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Marriage Broker Shi.

328
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,250
Our Chief personally instructed us to

329
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,300
get these rush orders out for you.

330
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,990
Wonderful.

331
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,560
This is exactly how I imagined them.

332
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,990
Brother Lu, you actually made it happen.

333
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,510
As long as you like them, Ke.

334
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,849
Not only did our Chief make it happen,

335
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,360
but in such a short time too.

336
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,550

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,080
I hope she can find a good partner too.

503
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,080
With Eldest Brother settled,

504
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,670
Second Brother has been
acting strangely lately too.

505
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,440
He's always running off to the He family.

506
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,070
Chongshan is clever and funny
and good with finances.

507
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,200
He's a perfect match for Miss He.

508
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,310
No, no,

509
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,810
Brother Lu, Ketian is already engaged.

510
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,370
We absolutely cannot
meddle in her affairs.

511
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,780
Well, have you ever asked Miss He

512
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
if she truly likes

513
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,740
the man she's engaged to?

514
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,110
Or if she even knows him?

515
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,710
And does that man sincerely

516
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,090
want to marry Miss He?

517
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,410
A promise is a promise.

518
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,610
How can a marriage agreement
be changed so easily?

519
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,560
Just because you met
someone more suitable,

520
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,420
you want to break the engagement?

521
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,490
Ketian would never do such a thing.

522
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,280
What about the person you're engaged to?

523
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,880
Do you truly know each other?

524
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,420
Do you even like each other?

525
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,590
I...

526
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,070
I'll need to arrange Ketian's wedding,

527
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,920
and then help my brothers find wives.

528
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,930
I'm in no hurry.

529
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,060
I'll just wait for that person
to come and fulfill his engagement.

530
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,710
Brother Lu, let's not talk
about me anymore.

531
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,930
The Flower Assembly is coming up.
Work comes first.

532
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,650
Today, we're paying respects
to our ancestors.

533
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,880
Mother has prepared a small banquet

534
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,950
and specifically asked me

535
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,760
to invite you and Ms. Li

536
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,910
to express our gratitude.

537
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,700
Then I'll go prepare some gifts now

538
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,430
and make sure to arrive on time.

539
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,640
Okay.

540
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,360
Brother, you like her?

541
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,080
Is it that obvious?

542
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,650
You're just one banner
short of telling the whole world.

543
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,410
But Ke has no idea.

544
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,250
Then you need to listen to

545
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,810
golden advice from
a master novelist like me.

546
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,590
When pursuing a lady,

547
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,340
first, you need to take initiative,

548
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,900
and be direct and decisive.

549
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,090
Second,

550
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,640
you need to present yourself well.

551
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,360
And third,

552
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,640
you should seek help from others.

553
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,200
What should I do then?

554
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,440
For this dinner,

555
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,860
you need to seize the opportunity

556
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,770
to win over her parents.

557
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,610
Make them see you're a good match.

558
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,640
Also,

559
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,120
talk more about business during the meal.

560
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,660
That way, you'll seem
mature and dependable.

561
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,710
Really?

562
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,690
Really.

563
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,740
[Novel Shop]

564
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,010
Boss.

565
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,890
has Neighboring Hermit's
Junshan Collection

566
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,620
arrived yet?

567
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,410
How's it selling?

568
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,410
The Junshan Collection reprint...

569
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,010
the publisher
just delivered it this morning.

570
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,500
How'd you know that?

571
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,380
Don't tell me you're...

572
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,340
I'm...

573
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,240
A competitor?

574
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,850
I guessed right,
you're a competitor.

575
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,430
Let me tell you, competitors are enemies.

576
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,890
-Don't steal my business.
-Boss, we're here to collect books.

577
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,920
Don't steal my business!

578
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,770
Come, follow me.

579
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,230
Miss is here to buy novels too?

580
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,450
I heard the Junshan Collection
has been reprinted.

581
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,980
I wonder when I can get a copy.

582
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,290
So Miss is also a fan of
the Neighboring Hermit?

583
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,410
I absolutely adore his books.

584
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,370
I read each one over and over again.

585
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,350
When the Junshan Collection arrives,

586
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,750
I'll definitely buy several copies

587
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,330
to collect at home.

588
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,900
Young Master, are you also a fan of
the Neighboring Hermit?

589
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,900
I'm actually...

590
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,380
My Lady.

591
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,780
We've paid.

592
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,080
Let's go back home.

593
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,830
Uncle, Aunt.

594
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,460
I've brought some small gifts.

595
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,590
Please accept them.

596
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,140
Is this for me?

597
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,270
Uncle.

598
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,550
Stop touching that!

599
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,840
Eldest Brother.

600
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,470
Thank you.

601
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,430
I have one too?

602
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,640
This is a jade balance scale.

603
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,730
Our Chief hopes

604
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,100
Miss Shi will find every matchmaking case

605
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,330
measured to your heart's desire.

606
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,500
Thank you, Brother Lu.

607
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,280
Chief Lu,

608
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,150
these gifts are far too generous.

609
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,500
Just small tokens, not worth mentioning.

610
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,090
Let's all take our seats.

611
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,360
Come, please.

612
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,550
Kexian, please.

613
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,330
Brother, sit here.

614
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,280
Come, sit down.

615
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,680
With this toast, I'd like to thank

616
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,830
Chief Lu, Ms. Li,

617
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,590
Kexian, and Ketian.

618
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,980
Xibao Pavilion has generously sponsored
the Flower Assembly.

619
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,890
Ms. Li has worked tirelessly
for the event,

620
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,040
and Kexian and Ketian

621
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,020
have also devoted themselves completely.

622
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,510
I will always remember this kindness.

623
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,040
Our Shi family can never repay you enough.

624
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,750
Come, let's all have a drink.

625
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,990
I also want to thank everyone.

626
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,920
Thank you Brother Xian and Ketian.

627
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,270
And Lu...

628
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,140
Chief Lu.

629
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,650
You gave your time, money, and effort,

630
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,030
sponsored the Flower Assembly,

631
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,360
and even finished all the glass lamps

632
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,920
in such a short time.

633
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,030
Thanks also to Xibao Pavilion,
Sister Pan'er, and Lu Yi.

634
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,200
You've all been helping me.

635
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,600
All for the success of
the Flower Assembly.

636
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,490
Thank you.

637
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,350
Thank you, Aunt Tao and Ke.

638
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,540
Ke is honest, straightforward,
and sincere.

639
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,610
Meeting Ke is my greatest fortune
in three lifetimes.

640
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,770
I don't deserve Aunt Tao's gratitude.

641
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,360
Our Xibao Pavilion

642
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,690
should really thank
Marriage Broker Shi for the promotion.

643
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,030
Ke is full of ideas and creativity.

644
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,470
She's made this year's event

645
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,530
more lively and refreshing than ever.

646
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,170
You're too kind, Brother Lu.

647
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,920
I should be the one thanking you.

648
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,050
I was able to break tradition
and get the hosting rights.

649
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,790
Ms. Li, you've worked so hard this time.

650
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,130
I heard from Xianxian

651
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,920
that you coordinated everything for
the Flower Assembly.

652
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,710
I had no idea you're not only beautiful,

653
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,010
but also so capable.

654
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,840
It's Eldest Brother Shi
who is reliable and competent.

655
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,320
I'm so grateful he's been
at Xibao Pavilion lately

656
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,240
and has taken on so much of my workload.

657
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,470
He does all the dirty and hard work.

658
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,820
It's no trouble at all.

659
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,320
Kexian, Ketian.

660
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,220
Aunt Tao is well aware.

661
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,110
Without He's Bakery,

662
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,710
Ke alone

663
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,030
couldn't have pulled off such a big event.

664
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,680
Here, let me thank you all.

665
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,360
Aunt Tao, you're too kind.

666
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,770
Ke and I grew up together.

667
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,060
We're already like family.

668
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,310
Ke's matters are my matters.

669
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,660
Shi family matters
are He family matters too.

670
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,420
Alright, let's eat.

671
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,710
Eat up, don't be shy, dig in.

672
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,760
Ke, this is your favorite dish,

673
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,250
I'll put it here for you.

674
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,230
Thank you, Brother Xian.

675
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,430
Brother Lu, try this,

676
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,400
it's delicious.

677
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,150
Thanks.

678
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,389
Ketian.

679
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,040
Try that fish.

680
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,230
Brother Xian, don't you love fish?

681
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,350
Have some more.

682
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,190
Ms. Li, this,

683
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,500
this is especially delicious,

684
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:28,710
try some.

685
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,650
Thank you, Eldest Brother Shi.

686
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,960
Ms. Li, forgive me for being forward.

687
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,230
I see you're young, beautiful,
and capable.

688
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,280
Are you married yet?

689
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,000
Thank you for your concern, Aunt Tao.

690
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,239
I...

691
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,810
To be honest,

692
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,920
my late husband passed years ago.

693
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,620
I've had no plans to remarry.

694
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,190
Although I'm a matchmaker,

695
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,740
I don't believe

696
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,770
marriage is the only path for women.

697
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,490
As long as you don't
dwell on past heartaches,

698
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,500
whether you remarry or not,

699
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,370
what matters is that you feel content.

700
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,510
Of course,

701
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,670
Ms. Li, you're beautiful and kind-hearted.

702
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,400
You'll surely find happiness.

703
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,940
Yes, Sister Pan'er.

704
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,140
Life is unpredictable.

705
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,660
If you meet someone you like,

706
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,920
open your heart to them

707
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,240
and be grateful for the fate
that brought you together.

708
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,630
I understand all that,

709
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,970
but

710
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,950
it's easier said than done.

711
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,050
Ms. Li,

712
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,040
I think Ke is right.

713
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,130
You're beautiful and kind-hearted.

714
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,590
You'll definitely find your own happiness.

715
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,950
Brother Xian.

716
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,610
I've saved you a ticket to
the Flower Assembly.

717
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:30,140
You can see if
someone catches your eye there.

718
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:30,780
I...

719
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,630
Ke, those tickets are limited.

720
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,630
I don't need one.

721
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,390
You're at the age for marriage now,

722
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,230
you should consider it, alright?

723
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,060
Ke!

724
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,630
My brother would never look for someone at
the Flower Assembly.

725
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,020
He...

726
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,150
Since it's from Ke,

727
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,510
I'll accept it.

728
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,430
Thank you, Ke.

729
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,080
By the way,

730
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,180
Second Brother, I'd like to toast you.

731
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,260
Thank you for helping Ketian look after
He's Bakery these past few days.

732
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,600
Brother Xian, you're too kind,

733
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,000
it's the least I could do.

734
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,630
I should toast Second Brother too.

735
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,520
Thank you for helping at the bakery.

736
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,270
I know

737
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,050
you've always treated me
like your own sister.

738
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,910
That's not true.

739
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:28,810
Yes.

740
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,920
Why is Second Brother acting so strange?

741
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,110
Everyone,

742
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,630
I believe Ke will definitely make
this year's Flower Assembly

743
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,290
a grand and successful event.

744
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,840
Let's raise our glasses and wish her well.

745
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,510
Come.

746
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,640
Thank you all.

747
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,120
Best wishes to Ke.

748
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,820
Alright, don't just drink and talk,

749
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,780
eat more food.

750
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,800
Come on, eat.

751
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,500
Thank you.

752
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,780
Brother, why are you still up so late?

753
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,570
Why are you still awake at this hour?

754
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,990
Did I disturb you?

755
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,980
No, I just couldn't fall asleep.

756
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,510
It's probably because it's too hot.

757
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,390
Aren't you always craving mung bean cakes?

758
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,190
How about this, I'll make some,

759
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,770
you have some

760
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,240
and I can give some to Aunt Tao, okay?

761
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,070
Brother, today's dinner

762
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,430
showed that

763
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,440
Aunt Tao and Uncle

764
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,970
still consider us as family,

765
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,200
especially Uncle.

766
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,000
Yes.

767
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,840
Aunt Tao's decades of friendship
with our family

768
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,180
isn't something Lu Chi

769
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,670
can compete with by throwing money around.

770
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:06,770
However,

771
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,920
from what I can see,

772
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,510
Ke seems

773
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,780
closer to Lu Chi.

774
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,030
Brother, you grew up with Ke.

775
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,130
For marriage matters,

776
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,460
we should still respect
our elders' wishes.

777
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,940
Marriage should be with someone
from a family you know well.

778
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,070
Look at our parents.

779
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,160
Even though the Shi brothers
were there first,

780
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,190
they still chose to betroth me

781
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,260
to Zhu Yizhi,

782
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,580
just because he was a scholar,

783
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,370
and they hoped I could marry into
a scholarly family.

784
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,300
Even though I wasn't very willing,

785
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,440
I still had to obey our parents.

786
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,210
I know,

787
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,400
I know Aunt Tao and Uncle
are very protective of me.

788
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,110
The match they choose will be a good one.

789
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,500
I also trust that Aunt Tao and Uncle

790
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,110
will choose a family they know well.

791
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,710
Alright, Ketian,

792
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,100
go get some rest now,

793
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,160
it's getting late.

794
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,270
When you wake up tomorrow morning,

795
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,330
delicious cakes will be waiting for you.

796
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:09,880
Okay.

797
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,550
Off you go.

798
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,390
You should get some rest too.

799
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:36,920
Ms. Li.

800
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,580
I think Aunt Tao made a lot of sense.

801
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,990
You've worked hard managing
Xibao Pavilion all these years.

802
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,830
Having Ke help you find someone suitable

803
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,960
would be a good idea.

804
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,790
Thank you for your concern, Master.

805
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,190
It's just that I don't know

806
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,620
if there's still someone
out there I'd like,

807
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,380
and whether that person would
even be interested in me.

808
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,740
If it happens,

809
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,260
I'll certainly seek Miss Shi's help.

810
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
I believe you will
definitely meet someone.

811
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,490
Perhaps, look more closely
at those already around you.

812
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,490
Master, I'll go rest now.

813
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,220
[Honesty and Mutual Benefit]

814
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,230
Lu Yi, you're crazy...

815
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,300
Brother.

816
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,490
Lu Yi,

817
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,230
you're not a maid.

818
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,260
Why are you massaging my legs?

819
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,900
Brother, how was the meal?

820
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,940
The only downside was that

821
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,240
the He siblings were there too.

822
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,220
So, you're upset because

823
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,920
you didn't get any private time
with your potential in-laws.

824
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,800
It seems the Shi family
may be grateful to you,

825
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,650
but that doesn't mean they've chosen you

826
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,780
as their future son-in-law.

827
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,590
You're not their

828
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,410
one and only best candidate.

829
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,530
Brother, you need to step up your game.

830
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,720
Do you have any ideas?

831
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,680
First, appeal to their interests.

832
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,750
The Flower Assembly is what
Aunt Tao cares about most.

833
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,950
You must help Miss Shi make it a success,

834
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,050
and make it unique and creative.

835
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,850
Then, you'll naturally

then...
