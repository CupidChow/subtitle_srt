1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
Two.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Tell me.

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Do I have to have a wife?

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Alright, alright.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's not talk about this.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I heard that you've been out of the palace frequently lately.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Is there anything new about that Marquis Wu An?

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I met a woman

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
who was very beautiful.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I met an interesting person.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It must be a young lady.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Senior.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It seems that

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
it's not clear who will drink first.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's not right.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
She and I are not progressing so fast.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Come on.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come on.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Today

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is the last day of the exhibition.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
After today,

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
where else can I find Mr. Lin Yuan?

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Take the painting

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and send it back to Mr. Lin Yuan's mansion.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hurry up.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't leave anything behind.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hello.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Are you the person in charge?

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Can I

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
meet Mr. Lin Yuan?

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
My husband is a low-key person.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He doesn't like to see outsiders.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Please go back.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I come here every day

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and wait here every day.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Just to meet you.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If I don't see you today,

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I won't leave.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Young Master, I can testify.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This young lady does come here every day.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It seems that the young lady

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
really likes my husband.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then I'll testify.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Please come with me.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sir,

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
there is a young lady who must see you.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How can you bring someone here?

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm here to see you.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Where are you from?

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You know I never see outsiders.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't mind the management.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I must ask her to take me to see you.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've been admiring your painting for a long time.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm lucky to see you today.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Go ahead.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Come on.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Please sit down.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I've seen you before.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You've seen me before?

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Where?

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
When?

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How?

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I've never seen you before.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Since the exhibition was opened,

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
you've come here every day.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're happy to see my painting.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're also sad.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think you must know me.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You really like my painting.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm good at painting.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But you can do whatever you want

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
to me.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm so grateful to you.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm so grateful to you.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm so grateful to you.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You really see me.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
To be honest,

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I've been admiring you for a long time.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I came to the capital for you.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Thank you for your kindness.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm so grateful to you.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's worth it to see you today.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ke.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I've found Mr. Lin Yuan.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've seen him.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
When?

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Where did you see him?

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Tell me what happened.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Why did you meet him suddenly?

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ke.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Mr. Lin Yuan is not Mr. Lu.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The real Mr. Lin Yuan

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
is a young man.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He's not married yet.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Look.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He's totally different from what you're worried about.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Mr. Lin Yuan and I are fated to meet.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You should know it's not Brother Lu.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Qi Yue.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're his first time seeing him.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You must know it well before you see him.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What are you talking about?

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm not stupid.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I just said I admire him.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I didn't mention the marriage.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And he asked me to meet him again.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll listen to you and meet him more.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll decide after I get to know him better.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll think about what I should talk to him about

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and ask him about something.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What a coincidence.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Something is wrong.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Brother Lu.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Qi Yue said he met Mr. Lin Yuan.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
When?

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Where did he meet him?

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You asked me the same question.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He said Mr. Lin Yuan is a man of great power

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and a talented man.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He even asked him to meet him again.

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I think it's strange.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
A man of great power?

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Who is pretending to be Mr. Lin Yuan?

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why did he pretend to be Mr. Lin Yuan?

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's not Mr. Lin Yuan.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He's not Mr. Lin Yuan.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why did he pretend to be Mr. Lin Yuan?

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What are you thinking about?

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mr. Lin Yuan is a fake.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why are you so sure he's a fake?

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Ke, believe me.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yan Xiao Niangzi must have been cheated.

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You must stop her from impulsively marrying someone.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Brother Lu, I believe you.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll go find him now.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Qi Yue, I have something to talk to you.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Mr. Lin Yuan is very low-key.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He has been selling paintings in Xibao Pavilion for years.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
In all these years, no one has seen him.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He has never held a painting exhibition.

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now, he suddenly wants to sell paintings.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He wants to hold an exhibition and he's willing to meet you.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There are too many coincidences.

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You have to think about it.

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ke, you're thinking too much.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Isn't this what you said about fate?

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm a matchmaker.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Of course I believe in fate.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But Brother Lu is sure that he's a fake Mr. Lin Yuan.

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Ke, don't say anymore.

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Qi Yue, you can't believe Brother Lu.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Ke, he's the one you like.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You have to believe him.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But I have my own feelings.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I have someone I like.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mr. Lin Yuan and I have already been meant to be.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you know his real name?

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Where is his ancestor?

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What does he have in his family?

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I thought Mr. Lin Yuan was Lu Chi.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I can understand if you say no.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But now I've found Mr. Lin Yuan.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You still say no. What do you want me to do?

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I want you to be good.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You didn't want me to be with Mr. Lin Yuan at the beginning.

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Qi Yue.

175
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Qi Yue.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Sorry for keeping you waiting. I'm late.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No, no.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You know your place. You can wait as long as you want.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Come.

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Qi Yue, please sit.

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Qi Yue, do you know who he is?

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Ke, why are you here?

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is Mr. Lin Yuan I told you about.

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He is not Mr. Lin Yuan.

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He is my son.

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Ke, what are you talking about?

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Miss, do you have any evidence to prove that I'm not Mr. Lin Yuan?

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're still pretending here, aren't you?

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're so...

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ke, please leave right now.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Qi Yue.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Please.

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Please.

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Actually, what my friend said is right.

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I am indeed Wu An Hong.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's why,

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't want to tell the world my real identity.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If they all know my real identity,

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
they will definitely mistake me for

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
relying on my power to gain fame.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Fame?

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How can someone really pay attention to my paintings?

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No wonder.

204
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You have a sense of loneliness in your paintings.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You are indeed unparalleled.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's better that you know me.

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Please sit.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Here, have some tea.

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Qi Yue, if that lady still suspects me,

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I hope you won't argue with her.

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't want to affect your sister's feelings because of me.

212
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's okay if I'm misunderstood.

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But I don't want you to suffer.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You don't have to worry.

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Just now, Ke was too impulsive.

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
After I go back, I will explain it to him.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's okay.

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
By the way, are you living with that lady?

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I left home for a long time.

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I have been living with her for a long time.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Now, I'm living in Ke's house.

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That dispute just now,

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I think it's hard for you to go back and live there.

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think the misunderstanding in her heart is hard to get rid of.

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
She doesn't want us to meet again.

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But I don't want to give up and never see you again.

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
If you believe me,

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
leave everything to me. I'll help you.

229
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Qi Yue, give me a chance.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let me take care of you.

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I know your good intentions.

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But I've been living in Ke's house for a long time.

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
If I leave like this, it's too heartless.

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's what you should do.

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you're not happy,

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
you can come to me anytime.

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm always here.

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm always here.

241
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Here, have some tea.

242
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Ke.

243
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're too much.

244
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You're too much.

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Brother Lu, I'm not talking about you.

247
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's Wu An Hou.

248
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Wu An Hou?

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes, he's the one who pretended to be Mr. Ling Yuan.

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Qi Yue was deceived by him.

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't believe that the bad guy in his heart is Mr. Ling Yuan.

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I think it's strange.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Why would Wu An Hou waste his time to lie to Lady Yan?

254
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
He's a man of his own.

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Why would he keep an eye on Qi Yue?

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He loves to be rich.

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But Qi Yue doesn't even have money to live in the inn.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I have no idea about this.

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No.

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I can't wait.

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Qi Yue trusts him so much.

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I can't wait to marry him.

263
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Even if he's not Mr. Ling Yuan,

264
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
even if he is, I can't let Qi Yue marry him.

265
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What's Ke going to do?

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm having a fight with him.

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If I tell him, he won't believe me.

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I have to figure it out.

269
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I got it.

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Brother Luo, I'm leaving.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Ke.

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Ke.

273
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Master.

274
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Master, something happened in Mount Qianya.

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
A large number of soldiers are gathering around Mount Qianya.

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There are scouts every day.

277
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They must be investigating at every pass.

278
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They must be preparing to attack Mount Qianya at any time.

279
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So, the Marquis of Wuan used a trick to attack the west.

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He's waiting for me at Mount Qianya.

281
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Master, what should we do now?

282
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Send a message to Zhu Xi.

283
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't fight with the enemy at the bottom of the mountain.

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Don't act rashly.

285
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Keep a close watch on them.

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Be careful.

287
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes.

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Luo Yi.

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Okay.

290
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Go.

291
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Send it to that man.

292
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes.

293
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Ke.

294
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Brother Luo, what do you want from me?

295
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm leaving.

296
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Where are you going?

297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm leaving for Mount Qianya today.

298
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why so sudden?

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Although I have no choice,

300
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I do have something important to do.

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I must go back.

302
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Ke.

303
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
This is the seal I gave you.

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's a pity that it's not finished yet.

305
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I hope that you can use it to change your face

306
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
on the scroll

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
every time you complete a beautiful case.

308
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
When will you come back?

309
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This time, I'll go to Mount Qianya

310
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to complete what I told you.

311
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll be a man in Uncle's heart.

312
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Then I can go to Mount Qianya

313
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and marry you in a grand way.

314
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't want this now.

315
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll wait for you to come back.

316
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'll give it to you

317
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
when you're back.

318
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I promise you.

319
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'll come back for sure.

320
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Come back.

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Uncle.

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You must come back.

323
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I promise you.

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Brother.

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I have some medicine in my body.

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm going back to Mount Qianya.

327
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
While I'm away in the capital,

328
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
please take care of Ke for me.

329
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Don't worry.

330
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
We'll protect Ke.

331
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I won't let Ke suffer any grievances.

332
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm relieved then.

333
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
When I come back,

334
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll marry Ke.

335
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll wait for you.

336
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll wait for you.

337
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Brother Lu.

338
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't worry about me.

339
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll take good care of myself.

340
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's good that you come back soon.

341
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Boy.

342
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You must come back safe and sound

343
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and marry my Ke.

344
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I won't let you off.

345
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You two brothers are here.

346
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Please accept my respect.

347
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Go.

348
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Go.

349
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I often drink tea here.

350
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Here. Qi Yue.

351
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Try the tea I made for you.

352
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's sweet.

353
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I made it myself.

354
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Go.

355
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Go.

356
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Go.

357
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Go.

358
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Go.

359
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Go.

360
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Go.

361
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Go.

362
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Go.

363
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Go.

364
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Go.

365
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Go.

366
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Go.

367
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Go.

368
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Go.

369
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Go.

370
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,600
Have a taste of the snowy mountains and clouds I made for you.

371
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,040
How is it?

372
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,600
It's good.

373
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,560
Sorry to bother you.

374
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,520
Ke.

375
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,760
It's me, Ke.

376
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,200
What do you want?

377
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,560
Mr. Li Yuan.

378
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
I've heard about you for a long time.

379
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,240
This is

380
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,160
an old work I collected.

381
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,000
But I really don't understand

382
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,320
the meaning of the painting.

383
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,360
Today, I met you

384
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,720
and came to ask for your advice.

385
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,800
Sir,

386
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,120
please give me your advice.

387
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,400
The high mountains flow with the water,

388
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,800
the layers overlap.

389
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,480
The beauty of the mountains lies in the shape.

390
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,400
And the beauty of the water lies in the shape.

391
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,680
What people often see is

392
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,960
the beauty of the mountains and the water.

393
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
But they don't know

394
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,120
it's a wound in my heart.

395
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,600
The high mountains are the bones.

396
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,480
And the water is clear.

397
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,440
I have no friends.

398
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,000
Who can know

399
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,160
the loneliness of high mountains and low water?

400
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,320
Really?

401
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,040
I bought this painting

402
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,960
at Yunlong Painting Shop.

403
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,600
There's someone else who paints.

404
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,840
Since you like it so much,

405
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,280
you can buy more.

406
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,920
I've never painted in my life.

407
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,280
I often paint

408
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,280
at random after drinking.

409
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,960
The mountains and water are ordinary things.

410
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,080
To be honest,

411
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,840
I don't remember it.

412
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,760
Yes.

413
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,280
You're right.

414
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,960
It's normal for a scholar to be elegant and greedy.

415
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,520
It's impossible to forget

416
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,080
if you paint countless things.

417
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,960
Yao Xia'ng,

418
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,240
this painting is surely

419
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,800
one of the best paintings

420
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,760
in this case.

421
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,120
Sir Lin Yuan,

422
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,440
please give Mo Bao.

423
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,560
If you can see it in person

424
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,040
and draw a picture for me,

425
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,480
I will have no regrets.

426
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,720
Why should I draw a painting for you?

427
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,480
Sir Lin Yuan,

428
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
I also want to see you on July.

429
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,360
Please.

430
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,880
Okay.

431
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,160
Since Miss Qi Yue wants to see it,

432
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,760
I'll do as you say.

433
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,080
This...

434
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,520
This...

435
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
It's wet.

436
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,560
I'm sorry.

437
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,720
I didn't mean to.

438
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,760
It's okay.

439
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,360
It's okay.

440
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:16,960
It's okay.

441
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,560
It's okay.

442
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
It's okay.

443
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,760
Come on.

444
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,560
It's okay, Hou Li.

445
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
I brought a lot of fan.

446
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:37,820
Group fan,

447
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,160
Master, please give me the test.

448
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,800
Qi Yue, let's go.

449
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,640
Go.

450
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,360
Ke,

451
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,360
how could I meet such a liar?

452
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,840
I only want to find Mr. Lin Yuan.

453
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,560
Why is it so difficult?

454
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,800
Is it possible that

455
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,840
I really have no fate with Mr. Lin Yuan?

456
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,600
Am I really going to be lonely?

457
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,760
How could it be?

458
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,600
I'm here.

459
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,000
How could you be lonely?

460
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,760
You're just too anxious

461
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,640
to be watched by someone who's interested.

462
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,320
You must act on your own.

463
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,720
Don't be so impulsive.

464
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,560
Or I'll be worried.

465
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,280
I was wrong about you.

466
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,840
I'm sorry.

467
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,760
Qi Yue,

468
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,040
it's not wrong to admire Mr. Lin Yuan.

469
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,720
But have you ever thought

470
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,920
that Mr. Lin Yuan behind the painting

471
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,360
is also a living person?

472
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,600
Marriage is not only about the beauty and beauty.

473
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,080
You have to face

474
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,920
all kinds of troubles together.

475
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,920
If you don't know each other,

476
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,360
you're just being enthusiastic.

477
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,120
How can you spend your life together?

478
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,520
Where can I find someone

479
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,320
who can spend his life with me?

480
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,320
Qi Yue,

481
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,640
sooner or later,

482
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,120
you'll meet someone who can spend his life

483
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
with you.

484
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,960
Really?

485
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,840
Will God arrange such a person for me?

486
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,720
This can't be handed over to God.

487
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,160
Not to mention Mr. Lin Yuan.

488
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,440
What about you?

489
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,400
No.

490
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,520
You can only

491
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,600
think about it.

492
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,760
I can only help you make a good marriage.

493
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,520
You have to decide

494
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,080
who you like.

495
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,400
I see.

496
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I was wrong before.

497
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,160
Don't be angry with me.

498
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm not angry.

499
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,000
This Shifake again.

500
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,120
Just one step away

501
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,000
and I can marry Yan Qi Yue.

502
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,680
I won't let him off this time.

503
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,800
Don't be angry, My Lord.

504
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,520
The news has been sent to Qianya Mountain.

505
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,200
How is it?

506
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,040
It's been deployed.

507
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,520
I'll wait for your instructions.

508
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,400
OK.

509
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,680
Pass my order.

510
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,840
Attack Qianya Mountain immediately.

511
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,240
I want to completely destroy

512
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,400
his forces outside

513
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,880
and cut off his wings.

514
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,560
I want to

515
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,520
kill all those

516
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,040
who are against me.

517
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,440
My Lord is a man of the heaven.

518
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,320
He will fight for the throne

519
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,760
and conquer the city.

520
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,520
Qi Yue.

521
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
This play is very beautiful today.

522
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,760
You will be able to

523
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,240
make the audience laugh after watching it.

524
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,640
I hope so.

525
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,360
Ladies.

526
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,080
It's boring to have two people.

527
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,720
How about...

528
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,560
That's right.

529
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,960
How about we go with you?

530
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,560
Go.

531
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,520
My Lord.

532
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,400
I'm telling you.

533
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
My brother is not a fast person.

534
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Don't be lazy. Go away.

535
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,920
You have to be reasonable.

536
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,080
We just want to

537
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
make friends with you two.

538
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,920
You are a girl who breaks the rules

539
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,320
when making friends.

540
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,120
Who wants to make friends with you?

541
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,880
Go away.

542
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,680
Don't run, young lady.

543
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,200
Qi Yue.

544
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,320
Go away.

545
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,040
Mr. Huang.

546
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,600
Miss Qi Yue.

547
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,600
Leave now.

548
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,000
Don't mind my business.

549
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,800
Lu Yin.

550
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,640
Go.

551
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,280
Get lost.

552
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,160
Little lady.

553
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,760
Are you okay?

554
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,640
I'm fine.

555
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,600
Thanks to you.

556
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,680
But

557
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
why didn't you leave?

558
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,000
The continuer told me to stay

559
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,200
to protect Lady Shi.

560
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,120
Ke.

561
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,760
This is Mr. Huang.

562
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,680
He's the second friend

563
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,120
I've met since I came to the capital.

564
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,760
Hello, Mr. Huang.

565
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,920
I'm Shi Fakke,

566
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,240
the official of the Guanmei Hall.

567
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,160
Thank you for your help.

568
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
You're welcome.

569
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,160
It's my pleasure to help you.

570
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,480
Qi Yue,

571
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,320
we haven't seen each other for a long time.

572
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,800
Forget it.

573
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,400
Let's have a good talk.

574
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,040
You don't come to this theater often, do you?

575
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,640
The theater is nice,

576
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,000
and the pastry is delicious.

577
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,360
Let me guess

578
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,960
what you like the most.

579
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,520
Red sugar cake.

580
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,600
Here, have some tea.

581
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,720
Qi Yue likes this.

582
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,880
Try it.

583
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,880
But be careful, it's hot.

584
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,560
Here.

585
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,080
Try one, too.

586
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,960
Mr. Huang,

587
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,560
you look familiar.

588
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,760
Are you from the capital?

589
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,000
Where do you live now?

590
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,800
I live in Qingfeng Inn temporarily.

591
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,320
You're not from the capital?

592
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Mr. Huang,

593
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,440
where's your ancestors?

594
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,120
Ke,

595
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,640
don't be so arrogant.

596
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,520
Just tell him you're not from the capital.

597
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,680
Mr. Huang,

598
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,880
it's fate.

599
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
I'm from the capital.

600
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,960
Mr. Huang,

601
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,200
it's fate.

602
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,040
Qi Yue also passed by Qingfeng Inn.

603
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,920
But he's doing it for Mr. Lin...

604
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,920
Ke.

605
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,800
Have some pastry, too.

606
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Have another one.

607
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,880
This is delicious, too.

608
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,840
Try it.

609
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,880
Qi Yue is so annoying.

610
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,800
It seems he's not normal to Mr. Huang.

611
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,320
Qi Yue has not gone to the coverage for this year.

612
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,160
He can't go this year.

613
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,960
But he has to wait for him that year.

614
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,160
When he first went in last year,

615
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,600
has Hei He not finished?

616
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,760
I feel like it's...

617
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,920
Is it this one?

618
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,400
It seems to be this one.

619
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,400
Which number is it?

620
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
This is quite good.

621
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Ake is here.

622
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
The letter that the Chief wrote for you.

623
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
The road to Mount Jianya is long.

624
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
The Chief is in a hurry to get there.

625
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
He hasn't forgotten to write you a letter.

626
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
It shows how much he misses you.

627
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
All right. I won't bother you anymore.

628
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
I'll get back to work.

629
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Ake.

630
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
My little Ake.

631
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
I've seen you for a long time.

632
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
I've missed you for many days.

633
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm here with you.

634
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Everything has become so boring.

635
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
The days I loved most on Mount Jianya

636
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
have become so boring.

637
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Since we met,

638
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I've never been so lonely.

639
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
I miss you.

640
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
I miss you.

641
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Qi Yue.

642
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
What are you thinking about?

643
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Ake.

644
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
I've been like this all the time.

645
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Sometimes I'm happy.

646
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
But sometimes...

647
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
I'm just very entangled.

648
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Qi Yue.

649
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
You must be the young master of Xin Yue.

650
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Impossible.

651
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
I'm not.

652
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
I'm not.

653
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
I'm not.

654
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
I'm not.

655
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
I'm not.

656
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
I'm not.

657
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I'm not.

658
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
I'm not.

659
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Impossible.

660
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
We're just friends.

661
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
We all admire Mr. Lin Yuan.

662
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
So we can have a chat.

663
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Mr. Lin Yuan is not fake.

664
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Qi Yue.

665
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200
You don't have to explain to me.

666
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
You don't have to convince me.

667
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
You're the only one who knows

668
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
who you like.

669
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
You just need to ask yourself

670
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
if you have a young master in your heart.

671
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
If you don't have feelings for him,

672
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
then you shouldn't see him again.

673
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Otherwise, the palace will have

674
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
an unrealistic idea.

675
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
It's not good for anyone.

676
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
I don't know.

677
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I'm not happy without him.

678
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
But you asked me to give up on Mr. Lin Yuan.

679
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
I'm not happy.

680
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
I'm really confused.

681
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
I don't know what's going on in my heart.

682
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
It's okay.

683
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Give me a few more days.

684
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I'll figure out a way

685
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
to make you realize your feelings.

686
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Bugu.

687
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Bugu.

688
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Lady Shi.

689
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Please.

690
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Come on.

691
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Do you understand?

692
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Yes.

693
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Qi Yue.

694
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Do you have any paintings

695
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
of Mr. Lin Yuan in these paintings?

696
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Again?

697
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I don't want to choose.

698
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
I didn't even have any clothes last time.

699
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
You want to fool me again.

700
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
I promise.

701
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
I'm not kidding.

702
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
There really is

703
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
a collection of Mr. Lin Yuan's works.

704
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
I don't know what's going on.

705
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
What's the matter?

706
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm sorry.

707
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
I'm sorry.

708
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
I can't tell.

709
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Each painting looks so similar.

710
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Look.

711
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Even if there is

712
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
a collection of Mr. Lin Yuan's works,

713
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
you can't tell.

714
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Am I

715
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
really not destined to

716
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
have Mr. Lin Yuan?

717
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Come here.

718
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Ke.

719
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
What are you doing?

720
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
There are five young masters here.

721
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Can you tell

722
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
which one is the young master

723
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
by looking at them?

724
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
The young master is here.

725
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
I'm sorry.

726
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Qi Yue.

727
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
You said you admired Mr. Lin Yuan.

728
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Through the paintings,

729
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
you can't tell

730
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
which one is Mr. Lin Yuan's genuine work.

731
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
But by looking at them,

732
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
You are the son of the emperor.

733
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
Qi Yue.

734
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,080
Your heart has already made a choice for you.

735
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,240
Do you prefer the one who draws,

736
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,800
or the one who is more fond of painting with you?

737
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,520
Eyes won't lie.

738
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,000
You must have just seen

739
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,200
his feelings for you.

740
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,680
Qi Yue.

741
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,480
You might as well look back

742
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,920
and look at the people around you.

743
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,480
Feel muddled with joy and sad conceptually.

744
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,240
Right now.

745
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,520
protector, excuse me.

746
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:28,920
Speak.

747
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,800
Lu Chi has set off to Mount Qianya.

748
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Good.

749
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,640
Everything is in my plan.

750
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,720
As long as I can catch Lu Chi's soft body,

751
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,440
I'll take this Shifake into my hands.

752
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,720
I'll make him go east.

753
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,360
He won't go west.

754
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,440
I'll go get that Shifake right now.

755
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,280
Go now.

756
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,040
Yes.

757
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,760
Xiaweightetian Temple

758
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,800
ipl trägi Lu...

759
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,560
Plchégi Lu...

760
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,040
A'Kei.

761
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,080
Wait.

762
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,840
It's bad!

763
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,080
A group of plain soldiers comes from outside

764
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,400
and say they come for Tang.

765
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,680
What are you doing?

766
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,920
Ake, hand over the teacher and the teacher and the teacher.

767
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,280
I am the teacher and the teacher.

768
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,040
Ake.

769
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,520
What did my daughter do?

770
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,200
How can she just come up and arrest people?

771
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,440
Did you arrest Wen Shu

772
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,640
and break into the famous place according to the law?

773
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,560
You can't push me down.

774
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,560
The sword is blind.

775
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,320
It's not appropriate to hurt anyone.

776
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,880
I tell you

777
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,640
you don't want to take my daughter away today.

778
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,400
What's the matter with you?

779
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,720
I don't want to take Ake away today.

780
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,400
Cut the crap.

781
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,680
Take her away.

782
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,200
Yes.

783
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,280
What are you doing?

784
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,840
What are you doing?

785
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,600
Be careful.

786
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,360
Don't be rude.

787
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,760
Move.

788
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,440
Don't be too much.

789
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,160
What are you doing?

790
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,560
Move.

791
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,200
Stop.

792
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,960
Move.

793
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,680
I'll go with you.

794
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,800
Ake.

795
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,920
No.

796
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,600
No.

797
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,880
Ake, think it over.

798
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,440
I did what I should do.

799
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,040
I didn't do anything wrong.

800
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,080
She will let me out sooner or later.

801
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,640
Daughter.

802
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,200
Go.

803
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,840
Ake.

804
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,600
Ake.

805
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,200
Ake.

806
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,840
Sir.

807
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,640
Mother.

808
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,760
Father.

809
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,720
Mother.

810
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,360
Miss Qi Yue.

811
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,880
Qi Er.

812
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,880
We'll find a way to save Ake.

813
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,560
Er.

814
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,160
Let's go.

815
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,560
Wait.

816
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,120
Brother.

817
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,320
I'll go with you.

818
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,840
Okay.

819
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,080
Greetings, Chief.

820
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,320
Wu An Hao is really too much.

821
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,760
Brother.

822
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,360
We have limited troops.

823
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,400
We've been fighting with them for a while.

824
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,360
We've been hurt badly.

825
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,040
Please punish us.

826
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,120
Brother Qi.

827
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,960
It's not your fault.

828
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,080
The one who led the troops is Li Ang.

829
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,240
He used himself and died in the battle.

830
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,040
You've been taught by them.

831
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,400
You know their situation.

832
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,920
You should be careful with the future battles.

833
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,440
They sent the elite troops here

834
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,840
to break the rear of the capital.

835
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:33,840
Good.

836
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,160
We'll let them go and never come back.

837
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,760
And let the capital have no future.

838
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,840
Brother.

839
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,000
Do you have an idea?

840
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,560
Soldiers, listen to my order.

841
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,440
Yes.

842
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
If you lose to me,

843
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,520
you'll lose to me.

844
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,960
You'll lose to me.

845
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,600
You must use the advantage of Qian Ya Mountain.

846
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,040
Pass my order.

847
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,880
Qi He sent people to go down the mountain to build a valley

848
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,760
to buy provisions.

849
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,200
With the battle flag,

850
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,200
shout out loud.

851
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,760
Make sure the enemy thinks we have more provisions.

852
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,280
Before the provisions arrive,

853
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,600
they dare not to be reckless.

854
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,040
Once the provisions arrive,

855
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,960
we'll fight with them for a long time.

856
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,520
If we can't win,

857
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,040
we'll break them.

858
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,840
But I'm worried that

859
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,160
we may not be able to hold out for a long time.

860
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,440
Don't worry.

861
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,000
We can't sit back and wait.

862
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,280
Zhu Xi.

863
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,640
I have a new idea.

864
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,800
I can use their strategy.

865
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:58,640
I know this laughter is the grace of fate

866
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,640
Every time I see you, I only have a cute stubbornness

867
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,640
Although I can't remember every difficult day

868
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,640
I never forget the first time

869
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,640
I never forget the first time

870
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,640
I saw you

871
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,640
Even if this love is heartless, heartless, no sun, no night

872
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,640
No matter the wind and the moon, as long as you are here from now on

873
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,640
No worries, no worries, just stay by my side

874
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,640
No matter the fire and the human world

875
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,640
Will there be any border

876
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:53,640
I'm willing to protect you with my own hands

877
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,640
Even if I can't love you as I love you

878
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,640
I'm willing to give my all to you

879
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,640
I'll only miss you all day

880
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:14,640
No matter the sea or the sky, they are all the same

881
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,640
Please remember the youth that once burned my life

882
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:29,640
From now on, I don't want to part with you
