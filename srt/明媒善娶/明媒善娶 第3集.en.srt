It means that Mrs. Qi is anxious to
arrange a marriage for her son.

You can't be so sure.

171
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,400
We still don't know who started this.

172
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,050
Qi Shaoheng is here.

173
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,030
He's the notorious Qi Shaoheng?

174
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,390
[Liu's Teahouse]

175
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,140
Look.

176
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,090
The usual.

177
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,000
Mr. Qi, if you want to go home for tea,

178
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,600
I can send it to your home.

179
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,680
It's serene and light here.

180
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,340
How could my home compare?

181
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,640
Mr. Qi.

182
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,070
I'm Shi Fa'ke from
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

183
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,200
Mrs. Qi asked me to talk
to you about marriage proposals.

184
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,390
Shaoheng.

185
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,620
Why did you splash water on me?

186
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,840
You forced me to do it.

187
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,150
Sir, please don't.

188
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,000
Calm down.

189
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,620
I've never seen you before.

190
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
What's your name?

191
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,570
Not only do I want to fight,

192
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,220
but I also want to touch...

193
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,720
Qi Shaoheng.

194
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,230
Do you want me to expose
your true nature in public?

195
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,910
Expose me?

196
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,080
You should be exposing yourself to me.

197
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,240
What are they talking about?

198
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,570
Will something happen?

199
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,650
I can't hear them.

200
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,070
Should we separate them?

201
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,240
I don't know.

202
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,210
You're not admitting defeat?

203
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:24,940
I'm not.

204
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,180
Why did Mr. Qi splash water on me?

205
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,750
It seems that the rumor
about his love for violence

206
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,790
is true.

207
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
So the rumor must be true.

208
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,050
What should we do?

209
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,340
That's really scary.

210
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,720
Brother Lu, forget it.

211
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,840
There are too many people
who'll talk. Let him go.

212
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,220
Ke, are you okay?

213
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm fine.

214
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,130
Qi Shaoheng, you'll regret it.

215
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,080
Lu,

216
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,320
I'll remember you.

217
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,810
You'd better remember me.

218
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,240
Alright, let's go.

219
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,430
Let's go.

220
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,360
Mr. Qi.

221
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,800
Well done.

222
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,230
In just half a day,

223
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,950
word about about my
perverse and violent temperament

224
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,280
has been widely spread.

225
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,870
Here's your reward.

226
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,660
Thank you.

227
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,200
The man who fought with me
at Liu's Teahouse today

228
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,130
is called Lu Chi.

229
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,750
You just need to exaggerate it

230
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,910
and spread the word.

231
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,640
Mr. Qi, you're so demanding.

232
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,470
Have you asked Lu about it?

233
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,630
It's one thing to spend money
to spread rumors about yourself.

234
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,900
Did Brother Lu offend you?

235
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,710
You're dragging him down with you too.

236
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,770
Tell me, did you bribe

237
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,910
the candied hawthorn vendor?

238
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,280
And my former colleague.

239
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,880
Did you pretend to break his leg

240
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,210
so he would work for you?

241
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,240
Your Official Matchmaking Agency
is full of women.

242
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,410
He's the only man.

243
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,060
He wanted to quit long ago.

244
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,080
Isn't it a good thing that he's
of use to me then?

245
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,280
You tried so hard to deceive your mother

246
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,980
and refused all matchmakers.

247
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,380
Is it because you already

248
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,780
have someone in your heart?

249
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,150
It's none of your business.

250
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,710
Qi Shaoheng.

251
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,650
Looks like you did all this.

252
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,440
Marriage Broker Shi, since you saw it,

253
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,200
I'll tell you the truth.

254
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,150
That's right.

255
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,160
I like to beat people up.

256
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,630
I think this young master
is quite skilled.

257
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,940
Can you play with me?

258
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,980
Mr. Qi, people have
different personalities.

259
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,400
But everyone has their strengths.

260
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,450
No matter who you want to get married to,

261
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,970
as long as you two love each other,

262
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,350
I will be your matchmaker.

263
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,480
But I'm warning you.

264
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,530
Lu doesn't want to get involved with you.

265
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,990
Don't tarnish his reputation.

266
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,700
Sure,

267
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,560
you could be my matchmaker.

268
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,300
But I have to test you

269
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,270
and see whether you are as snobbish

270
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,060
as the people from
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

271
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,860
For example,

272
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,900
what about witnessing
a marriage for my sister?

273
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,170
Who does she want to marry?

274
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,510
Ke, don't trust him so easily.

275
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,640
Don't be afraid.

276
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,320
I'm the best at witnessing marriages.

277
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,160
Whatever sister this is,
she'll be satisfied.

278
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,890
Don't worry.

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Marriage Broker Shi,

280
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,070
just witness a marriage
for my sister Xiao Hei.

281
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,940
My future brother-in-law

282
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,060
is amazing.

283
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,480
His skin is as dark as ink

284
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,590
and his legs are seven feet long.

285
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,740
He grew up with my sister.

286
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,410
In terms of family background,

287
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,870
his is of equal social rank.

288
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,470
Oh yes, most importantly,

289
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,480
Xiao Hei really likes...

290
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,120
Seven feet long?

291
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,630
May I ask what ethnic group
your brother-in-law is from?

292
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,980
He has such long legs.

293
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,270
The horse tribe.

294
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,550
What?

295
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,840
Marriage Broker Shi.

296
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,900
If you don't witness my sister's marriage,

297
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,140
you will never get involved in
my marriage again.

298
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,670
Let's go.

299
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,430
A horse marriage?

300
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,930
Qi Shaoheng, how could you think of that?

301
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,290
Qi Shaoheng! Shameless!

302
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,460
Who did that?

303
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,670
Who did that?

304
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,740
It wasn't me.

305
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,110
If it were me,

306
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,610
how could one egg be enough?

307
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,150
I'd need to throw
a basket of eggs to relieve my anger.

308
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,780
You...

309
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Throw them at him.

310
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,150
Disgraceful!

311
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,080
That's right.

312
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,050
Shameless.

313
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,480
How dare you come out?

314
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,810
Mr. Qi.

315
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,650
It seems that we don't
need to do anything.

316
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,710
You've already pissed everyone off.

317
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,920
It hasn't been long since we parted,

318
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,490
and you want to

319
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,530
compete with me again already?

320
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,200
I advise you to put your hands down.

321
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,490
It's so disgraceful.

322
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,670
How could he do this?

323
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,150
Move!

324
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,240
What are you doing?

325
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,740
How inappropriate!

326
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:51,820
If you continue,

327
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,270
I'll take you to the officials one by one.

328
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,130
Did you hear me?

329
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,750
Go away.

330
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,580
Stop looking.

331
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,640
Go away.

332
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,840
Go.

333
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,320
Let's go.

334
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,840
Let's go.

335
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,430
Let's go.

336
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,140
Mr. Qi, are you alright?

337
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,790
Mr. Qi, I think

338
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,510

Once you get married,

Besides, marriage doesn't affect anything.

It's not like the Qi family

If someone takes the money,
they're willing.

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,320
Of course.

508
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,000
In that case,

509
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,880
if I want to arrange a marriage for you,

510
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,820
I just need to ask for Mrs. Qi's opinion,

511
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,050
remember her preferences,

512
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,110
arrange a suitable young lady for you

513
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,020
and give her the betrothal directly.

514
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,880
I don't need to ask you how you feel.

515
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,720
Is that so?

516
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,240
A horse marriage is a horse marriage.

517
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,070
How can you compare that to a human marriage?

518
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,720
You asked me to be the witness to this marriage.

519
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,210
Why can't I compare them?

520
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,790
You're not asking for Xiao Hei's opinion

521
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,510
nor is your mother asking for yours.

522
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,160
These two scenarios are the same.

523
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,200
What's the difference?

524
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Shi Fa'ke, you...

525
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,510
You said you would
let me arrange your marriage,

526
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,900
but you never believed

527
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,960
I would be on your side

528
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,510
and consider your position.

529
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,520
Qi Shaoheng,

530
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,040
you're a man
but you keep repeating yourself.

531
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,700
What kind of woman
would entrust her life to you?

532
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,750
Mr. Qi,

533
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,710
you should keep your word.

534
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,670
Marriage Broker Shi,
I will fulfil my promise today.

535
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,730
I will entrust my marriage to you.

536
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,400
I hope you won't be

537
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,610
like those people from
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

538
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,900
For my mother's liking

539
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,900
and for a good match
in the eyes of other people,

540
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,480
they sacrificed my preferences.

541
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,210
Since I've agreed to your case,

542
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,560
I will respect your preferences

543
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,720
and fulfil your love.

544
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,060
I won't make you unhappy

545
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,550
because of others' views.

546
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,820
When will you sign the contract?

547
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,590
Sign it now. No backing out.

548
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,960
Wait.

549
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,340
Who is it?

550
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,180
Shi Fa'ke, you should know that

551
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,770
your mother is still guilty.

552
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,870
How can I let you run around
playing matchmaker

553
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,950
and ruining the reputation of
the Official Matchmaking Agency?

554
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,210
Marriage Broker Deng,

555
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,050
what makes you think I'm playing around?

556
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,110
I guess

557
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,470
Marriage Broker Deng must have
found a suitable candidate.

558
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,670
Why don't you tell us?

559
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,240
Brother Lu,

560
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,080
how could you ruin my matchmaking case?

561
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,850
After all,

562
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,620
it depends on whether Mr. Qi
is willing or not.

563
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,850
But if I lose the matchmaking case,

564
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,490
I'll lose my position
as a marriage broker.

565
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,550
Then I'll entrust my marriage to you.

566
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,840
Deal.

567
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,760
I should definitely reveal it.

568
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,770
But it's inappropriate

569
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,850
to reveal the young lady's name in public.

570
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,620
Mr. Qi,

571
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,090
why don't we find a secluded place

572
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,640
and hear what
Marriage Broker Deng has to say?

573
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,310
Both of you,
please don't make a scene here.

574
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,640
Although I'm anxious to
get my son married,

575
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,440
I still have some requirements.

576
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,350
By the parents' command
and the words of the matchmaker.

577
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,140
The parents' command comes first.

578
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,490
You don't even know this.

579
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,880
What right do you have

580
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,780
to be a marriage broker, Shi Fa'ke?

581
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,780
Of course I'll ask for your opinion.

582
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,790
Madam, if you have any requirements,
please feel free to list them.

583
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,460
We, a single son and widowed mother,

584
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,190
have worked hard
to reach our current situation.

585
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,110
A poor girl trying to climb to wealth
is absolutely not unacceptable.

586
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,890
I do not seek nobility either.

587
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,240
The social and economic backgrounds
just need to be compatible.

588
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,300
What are you doing?

589
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,180
This is your marriage.

590
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,570
Mr. Qi, tell us.

591
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,670
Mr. Qi, you have to think carefully.

592
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,030
Shi Fa'ke

593
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,750
is just trying to get a matchmaking case

594
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,210
to keep her position in
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

595
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,020
And her mother

596
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,510
is suspected of robbing
your family's property.

597
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,350
Well...

598
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,030
Mrs. Qi, Mr. Qi.

599
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,650
My mother is innocent.

600
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,800
Mrs. Qi,

601
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,460
Shi Fa'ke

602
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,480
instigated Mr. Qi
to ruin the Qi family's reputation

603
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,640
and then came to witness
his horse's marriage.

604
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,230
This person has evil intentions.

605
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,230
She can't take the responsibility.

606
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,310
Mrs. Qi, I'm worried,

607
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,930
this matter has already become
a big deal in the capital.

608
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,650
If you keep using her,

609
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,520
I'm afraid you'll ruin
the Qi family's reputation.

610
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,190
You...

611
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,100
The person that Marriage Broker Deng chose

612
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,450
must be the one who invited
your family to transport the grain.

613
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,580
Who dares to smuggle official grains?

614
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,920
Have you ever thought about the risks?

615
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,570
I...

616
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,370
Heng.

617
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,460
Mother.

618
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,580
I've heard what the two marriage brokers

619
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,060
said just now.

620
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,360
I raised you alone.

621
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,620
Now you are at a marriageable age.

622
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,320
I'm just trying to help you.

623
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,130
You mustn't insist on your own way

624
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,050
and let me down

625
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,700
and disgrace the Qi family.

626
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,820
Mother is right.

627
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,140
My father died early.

628
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,050
I shouldn't make my mother sad.

629
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,940
But I love playing and drinking

630
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,920
and I want to live a happy life.

631
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,100
Both marriage brokers

632
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,070
made sense.

633
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
It's really

634
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,270
difficult to make a choice.

635
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,450
Mr. Qi,

636
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,260
your future happiness
and the Qi family's foundation

637
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,280
is all up to you now.

638
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:08,960
I...

639
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,620
Qi Shaoheng, you're not
a person who obeys instructions.

640
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,110
Are you really unwilling to make a choice

641
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,510
about your own marriage?

642
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,460
I...

643
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,740
Mr. Qi, you must understand that

644
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,430
it's always wise to listen to your elders.

645
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,440
How about this?

646
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,280
Mother,

647
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,320
why don't you let the two marriage brokers

648
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,670
find a good match for me?

649
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,090
Then you and I can look at each one.

650
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,180
If any of the two marriage brokers

651
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,100
can help me find a girl I like,

652
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,660
they'll be my marriage broker.

653
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,810
What do you think?

654
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,520
Okay, it's a deal.

655
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,570
Mrs. Qi, I'll make arrangements.

656
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,700
I'll go too.

657
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,930
Are you trying to delay it?

658
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,670
What are you talking about?

659
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,810
Mr. Qi, don't go back on your word.

660
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,040
I wonder when there'll be a young lady

661
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,940
who can make my son
care about her this much.

It's all over the street.

They say you used the horse as an analogy

669
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,030
and provoked Qi Shaoheng.

670

I remember.

844
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,790
But...

845
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,300
Have you forgotten?

846
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,090
There are seals outside.

847
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,270
If you barge in like this,

848
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,420
not only will you harm yourselves,

849
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,680
but also Brother Xian.

850
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,730
I just came back to copy some names.

851
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,230
I'll leave after that.

852
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,350
Ke, I'm happy

853
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,370
that you're thinking for me.

854
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,240
Why are you happy?

855
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,300
You want to go to jail too?

856
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,470
Ke is so thoughtful.

857
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,130
Have you finished copying?
I'll do it for you.

858
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,060
Eldest Brother.

859
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,910
After being in prison for too long,
you've become naggy.

860
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,380
Let's go.

861
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,270
Let's go.

862
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,770
Let's go.

863
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,720
Let's go.

864
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,010
[Xibao Pavilion]

865
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,160
Master.

866
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,300
I’ve found out everything

867
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,490
after going to the lord's house
to deliver the goods.

868
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,020
It's Mrs. Zhu who's keeping
Zhu Yanyan at home

869
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,110
and not allowing her to
go out or see anyone.

870
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,250
If Ke knew what happened to Zhu Yanyan,

871
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,600
she wouldn't be so sad,

872
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,020
thinking she was betrayed by her sister.

873
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,280
But more importantly,

874
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,060
Lord Zhu asked about
the Shi family’s case,

875
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
so Li Ang wouldn't dare to go too far.

876
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,679
No wonder he would
show mercy to the magistrate

877
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,100
and let the two sons go.

878
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,409
Master, you even foresaw that?

879
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,020
I'll recommend
Xibao Pavilion to Qi Shaoheng.

880
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,120
Then, Ke and Marriage Broker Deng

881
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,949
will definitely bring someone to
Xibao Pavilion

882
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,239
to have a blind date with Qi Shaoheng.

883
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,250
I understand.

884
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,699
Everything will be arranged.

885
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,929
We'll help Miss Shi.

886
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,020
Remember,

887
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,040
don't ask Miss Shi for money.

888
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,219
All her expenses are on me.

889
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,670
Of course. I understand.

890
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,139
Master, I know

891
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,420
the girl that
Marriage Broker Deng has her eyes on.

892
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,659
Her surname is Wang.

893
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,510
My father is a Grand Tutor.

894
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,690
He's an official

895
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,500
but he insists on
marrying a escort agency family.

896
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,730
I have to suspect that it's a trap.

897
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,840
The Weiyuan Escort Agency of the Qi family

898
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,040
refused to privately transport grain.

899
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,050
Then, they were robbed.

900
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,610
At this moment,
there are no goods to carry,

901
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,580
yet someone still wants to marry off
the Grand Tutor's daughter.

902
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,370
It shows that someone wants to control

903
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,060
Qi Shaoheng through marriage

904
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,540
and use the Qi family.

905
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,020
So this marriage can't happen.

906
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,590
Why did the Grand Tutor
not look for well-matched suitors

907
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,610
and insist on the escort agency family?

908
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,410
I think the person behind him
is insisting on this.

909
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,860
Keep an eye on Qi Shaoheng for me.

910
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,210
Yes.

911
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,710
When the Qi family matter is settled,

912
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,480
I'll tell Ke about the ten-year contract.

913
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,710
Stop it.

914
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,980
Didn't you ask me to meet you
at Xibao Pavilion?

915
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,440
Why aren't you going over?

916
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,470
I've searched both East and West Cities.

917
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,470
I want to persuade someone to
go on a blind date with Qi Shaoheng,

918
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,690
to support me.

919
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
But everyone listened to Aunt Deng.

920
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,300
No one is willing to help me.

921
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,990
I heard some news.

922
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,720
Maybe it can redeem your grievances.

923
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,390
What news?

924
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,380
You didn't even say it's good news.

925
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,180
How can it redeem my grievances?

926
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,170
I heard from Xibao Pavilion

927
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,770
someone who
delivered goods to the Zhu family.

928
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,050
A deliveryman?

929
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,980
What about Yanyan?

930
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,340
Miss Zhu is grounded by her stepmother.

931
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,970
She can't go out and meet people.

932
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,090
I knew it.

933
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,360
Yanyan wouldn't ignore me.

934
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,380
Her grandfather is
busy with work every day.

935
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,590
He must not know that
so many things happened in the mansion.

936
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,470
When I settle down in
the Official Matchmaking Agency

937
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,860
I'll find her a good husband

938
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,590
and help her escape from there.

939
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,660
Are you feeling better?

940
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,780
Much better.

941
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,950
No matter what,

942
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,570
I must take a girl

943
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,970
to visit Mrs. Qi at Xibao Pavilion.

944
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,850
I don't believe she can influence

945
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,750
so many ladies in the capital.

946
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,150
There must be a loophole.

947
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,920
Ms. Li asked me to tell you.

948
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,460
She's ready.

She's on your side.

She will keep
Marriage Broker Deng and the others.

and act accordingly.

00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,820
Is this the only dress in her house?

1011
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,250
What kind of gentle temperament is that?

1012
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,510
Marriage Broker Deng,

1013
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,280
you don't have a good eye for people.

1014
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,860
Am I right, Mr. Qi?

1015
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,780
I don't like bad-tempered women.

1016
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,010
Mr. Qi, this is a misunderstanding.

1017
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,370
Please keep observing.

1018
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,540
Mr. Qi.

1019
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,360
I brought Miss Song here to visit
Xibao Pavilion.

1020
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,170
Look, that's her.

1021
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,310
Miss Song's clothes are ordinary.

1022
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,120
She must come from an ordinary family.

1023
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,650
How can she match Heng'er?

1024
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,570
Mrs. Qi,
although Miss Song's family is ordinary,

1025
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,390
she is beautiful,
intelligent, and virtuous.

1026
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,100
Unlike some ladies,

1027
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,920
who only know how to
compare clothes and jewels.

1028
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,180
Mrs. Qi, family background
is not the most important.

1029
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,120
The most important thing
is to live happily ever after.

1030
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,160
If Mr. Qi

1031
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,600
can find a nice woman to accompany him,

1032
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,010
and have a happy life...

1033
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,150
It's still inappropriate.

1034
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,100
Marriage Broker Deng,

1035
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,900
I think what Marriage Broker Shi
said makes sense.

1036
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,670
Are you satisfied with Miss Song?

1037
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,180
I'll send the Information Card
to your mansion now.

1038
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:47,830
No.

1039
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,850
You're indeed my son.

1040
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,100
You know how Mother feels the best.

1041
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,090
Marriage Broker Shi,

1042
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,560
I don't like this woman.

1043
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,590
I just think what you said

1044
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,960
is pleasant to hear.

1045
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,280
All right, keep looking.

1046
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,100
Mother, let's go back and rest.

1047
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,200
Are you kidding me?

1048
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,440
Don't think that

1049
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,760
you can succeed if I fail.

1050
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,250
You're still young.

1051
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,820
Let me tell you.

1052
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,240
Mr. Qi

1053
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,800
is well-known for being erratic.

1054
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,420
If you can control him,

1055
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,280
you're capable.

1056
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,150
Ke.

1057
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,740
Brother Lu.

1058
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,730
I suspect Qi Shaoheng
doesn't want to get married.

1059
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,290
He's just looking for trouble.

1060
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,290
He tricked me to entertain himself.

1061
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,660
Not necessarily.

1062
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,440
If I don't eat a stick of
candied haws today,

1063
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,970
I can't get rid of my hatred.

1064
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,840
Okay, let's have one.

1065
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,190
Let's go.
