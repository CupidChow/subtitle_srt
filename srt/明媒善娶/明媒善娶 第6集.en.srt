00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,820
Come on.

174
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,320
Let's go.

175
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,960
W-Wait.

176
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,280
It's him.

177
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,720
What do you mean?

178
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,520
The gentleman I'm talking about is him,

179
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,710
Lu Chi.

180
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,000
Wait.

181
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,830
Who is Lu looking at?

182
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,380
Me or Shen Tongyun?

183
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,020
Forget it.

184
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,010
What does that have to do with me?

185
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,530
Ke, come in and let's talk.

186
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,920
I was right about you.

187
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,740
Marriage Broker Shi and Mr. Lu
are actually old acquaintances.

188
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,280
Then the proposal of marriage
can be put on the agenda.

189
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,300
Let's do it today.

190
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,730
I think we can do it today.

191
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,410
Mr. Lu, I'm Shen Tongyun.

192
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,680
You must have received my visiting card.

193
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,250
Visiting card?

194
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,940
Ke, is this your friend?

195
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
Sort of.

196
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,240
Let me introduce you to each other.

197
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,320
This is Miss Shen Tongyun,

198
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,610
the daughter of the Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Works.

199
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,360
He's Lu Chi, the Chief of Xibao Pavilion.

200
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,550
My taste is really unique.

201
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,640
I didn't expect Mr. Lu
to be the Chief of Xibao Pavilion.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,930
Don't forget what you promised me.

203
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,670
Ke, what did you promise her?

204
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,870
I...

205
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,120
There are too many people here.

206
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,500
And it's not good to talk about
such things on the street.

[Xibao Pavilion]

208
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,760
Why don't you go back
to wait for my good news?

209
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,150
I finally saw him in person
after sending the visiting card.

210
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,750
I don't want to leave so soon.

211
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,460
Chief.

212
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,000
Since you're Ke's friend,

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,870
please come in.

214
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,510
I still have something to do.

215
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,320
Ms. Li, please receive the guests.

216
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,990
Yes.

217
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,910
Since Mr. Lu has invited me to go inside,

218
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,130
I'll accept it.

219
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,050
Ladies, come with me.

220
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,040
Let's go. Accompany me to take a look
around the Xibao Pavilion.

221
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,640
Whatever you like, I'll pay.

222

-Let's go.
-I...

223
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,740
I know about this.

Revealing the Dagger at the Last Minute.

225
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,700
Why has that person
been so fond of classics lately?

226
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,670
It's fine that there's trouble.

227
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,650
But the trouble has come to me.

228
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,550
Master, I don't quite understand.

229
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,590
Jing Ke assassinating King Qin
is very troublesome?

230
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,280
Does this turret look familiar to you?

231
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,910
This was built
during the late emperor's reign.

232
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,510
Rumor has it that there's a secret passage
to the Forbidden Palace.

233
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,990
I've never heard of such rumors.

234
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,640
What's the trouble then?

235
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,200
The construction of this turret

236
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,730
was led by Lord Shen, the Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Works.

237
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,240

238

Come in.

239
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,550
Has the daughter of the Shen family left?

240
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,150
She's wandering downstairs.

241
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,150
It doesn't look like she's leaving.

242
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,420
Got it. I'll go take a look.

243
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,840
By the way,

244
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,120
if the daughter of the Shen family
leaves the Xibao Pavilion,

245
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,360
remember to keep an eye on her for me.

246
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,160
Yes.

247
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,120
Which one is Master
going to take a look at?

248
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,870
Is it Miss Shi

249
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,950
or the daughter of the Shen family?

250
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,040
Stop asking me.

251
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,260
I'm confused, too.

252
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,510
Miss,

253
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,390
how about I help you
try on this one again?

254
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,360
This one looks nice, too.

255
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,160
Forget it. I don't like this one.

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:17,970
Yes.

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
This way, please.

258
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,370
He said there was something urgent.

259
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,500
And now he's in a hurry to see this girl.

260
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,690
Lu, do you need me to introduce her again?

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,730
Miss Shen Tongyun
is from a prominent family.

262
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,080
She also looks beautiful

263
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,980
and has a gentle temperament.

264
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,750
She's even extremely loyal
in her relationship.

265
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,720
Ke, what do you mean?

266
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,160
I...

Marriage Broker Shi,
don't beat around the bush.

268
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,040
Let me be frank.

269
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,250
Mr. Lu,

270
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,340
I've always liked
your handsome appearance.

271
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,240
In the capital,

272
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,260
only He Kexian can compare with you.

273
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,030
Of course, you are more handsome than him.

274
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,100
So I've asked Marriage Broker Shi
to be my matchmaker.

275
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,530
What do you think?

276
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,390
It turns out that you've taken
this matchmaking case.

277
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,310
Lu, I haven't.

278
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,120
I know I should...

279
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,780
You know?

280
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,900
Mr. Lu, don't misunderstand.

281
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,140
I've just found out about your identity.

00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,900
See the guests out.

287
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,420
The Xibao Pavilion is too small.

288
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,220
I'm sorry, but we can't receive
Miss Shen anymore.

289
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,150
Then... Then I'll also...

Marriage Broker Shi, please stay.

291
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,870
Since you're a marriage broker,

please listen to more of my advice.

What are you looking at, ugly girl?

299
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,020
I'm Marriage Broker Deng,

Miss Shen,

302
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,690
can I talk to you?

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,420
Ke.

304
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,040
Have you really agreed
to be Shen Tongyun's matchmaker?

305
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,530
Do you still remember
that you were drunk yesterday?

306
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,810
While we're talking about matchmaking,

307
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,410
why are you suddenly mentioning
that I was drunk yesterday?

308
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,710
Of course I remember.

309
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,270
You're

You're known as the God of Wealth
in the capital.

What else?

314
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,690
What else could there be?

315
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,990
Why can't I remember anything?

316
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,840
Forget it.

317
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,010
But Ke,

318
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,630
there are many matchmaking cases.

319
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,830
Why did you choose Shen Tongyun's case?

320
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,220
Marriage Broker Deng said

321
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
she wouldn't assign
matchmaking cases to me anymore.

322
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,430
My mother can't go back
to the Official Matchmaking Agency now.

323

I'm the only hope
for being No.1 matchmaker in the world.

324
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,440
I also want to make a choice.

325
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,810
But I have no choice.

326
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,260
Apart from Qi Shaoheng, Shen Tongyun

327
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,930
is another tricky problem
in the the capital.

328
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,990
If I succeed in her matchmaking case,

329
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,990
Marriage Broker Deng will no longer have
any reason to kick me out.

330
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,490
Of course, I know

331
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,569
I should've asked for your opinion first.

332
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,349
But I've also thought about it carefully.

333
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,310
To me, she is

334
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,050
my only client now.

335
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,270
I can't offend her.

336
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,720
I have no choice.

337
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,970
No matter what,

338
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,030
I want to be a good marriage broker.

339
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,050
Since I've taken this matchmaking case,

340
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,780
I should work hard till the end.

341
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,790
Besides,

342
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,920
since Miss Shen likes you,
it's understandable

343
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,520
that she wants to pursue you.

344
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,390
I think she is quite
straightforward and sincere.

345
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,610
She's not trying to beat around the bush,
and that's good.

346
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,490
It's not wrong to find

347
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,810
a husband she likes.

348
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,830
I'm not saying that she's not good.

349
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,560
It's just that I don't like her.

350
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,920
You were in a hurry to see her just now.

351
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,700
But now you're saying you don't like her.

352
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,740
Do you like her or not?

353
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,650
If you don't understand me,
it's useless to say more.

354
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,400
What's going on?

355
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,170
Why does my chest feel so uncomfortable?

356
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,340
Forget it. I shouldn't be sad.

357
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,900
It looks like

358
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,400
Lu doesn't want it.

359
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,880
I need to find a substitute
as soon as possible

360
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,290
to show my talent and sincerity.

361
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,250
I can't let this matchmaking case
get ruined.

362
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,430
[He's Bakery]

363
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,950
[He's Bakery]

364
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,350
Their pastries are very delicious.

365
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,190
Ketian.

366
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,880
Xian, look.

367
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,650
It's a bunny.

368
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,830
It's so cute.

369
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,380
I love bunnies.

370
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,920
Kexian, your cooking skills
are getting better and better.

371
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,410
Put it down.

372
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,310
This is for Ke.

373
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,000
Ke hasn't been here for a long time.

374
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,910
I finally developed a new set of desserts.

375
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,370
I'm going to send it to her.

376
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,490
You always talk about Ke.

377
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
All you know is Ke.

378
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,720
Xian.

379
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,870
Ke.

380
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,960
You're just in time.

381
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,660
Look.

382
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,640
These are the new desserts
I specially developed for you.

383
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,370
-Taste them.
-They're so cute.

384
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,460
It's delicious.

385
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,950
If you can make it iced,

386
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,480
it'll be a hot-selling product in summer.

387
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,440
Okay. I'll make it iced next time

388
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
and send it to you.

389
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,710
Ketian.

390
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:45,860
Ketian.

391
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,240
Xian, I know you treat me the best.

392
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,250
Can you do me a favor?

393
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,490
Don't... Don't cry.

394
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,810
Don't cry.

395
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,590
If you need anything,

396
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,720
I'll help you, okay?

397
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Currently, my mother can't go back
to the Official Matchmaking Agency.

398
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,120
Now I'm the only one who's hanging in.

399
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,030
And Marriage Broker Deng
always gives me a hard time.

400
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,140
If I can't solve the matchmaking case,

401
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,660
how can I explain to my mother?

402
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,920
How can I gain a foothold
in the Official Matchmaking Agency?

403
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,050
Okay. I'll help you.

404
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,970
Xian.

405
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,060
You're like a real brother to me.

406
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,840
Let's go.

407
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,470
Where are you taking my brother to?

408
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm going to take him
to have a blind date with Shen Tongyun.

409
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:26,960
A blind...

410
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,920
Shi Fa'ke! You have no conscience!

411
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,650
My brother won't go on blind dates.

412
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,240
Kexian, don't let her tears fool you.

413
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,430
She was just pretending to cry.

414
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,550
Ketian.

415
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,360
Please show some mercy.

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,330
My acting was probably too much.

417
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,270
But what I said was sincere.

418
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,300
Look at Xian.

419
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,210
He should think about
marriage at this age.

420
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,850
Shen Tongyun is from a good family
and is a good person.

421
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,480
But she just loves handsome men.

422
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,410
She's kind of a good match for Xian.

423
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,310
Kexian, tell her.

424
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,270
You clearly like her. Why don't you...

425
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,880
Ketian.

426
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,700
Stop it.

427
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,110
Shi Fa'ke, if you don't leave today,

428
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,900
I'll cut ties with you.

429
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,510
Ketian.

430
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,660
Xian!

431
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,760
-Ketian.
-Xian!

432
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,640
Stop messing around.

433
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,290
Ketian!

434
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,990
Kexian, you can't go.

435
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,830
Do you know why she treated you like that?

436
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,750
Because you kept

437
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,680
your feelings in your heart
and refused to tell her.

438
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,920
If you dare to go today,

439
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,560
I'll tell her for you.

440
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,330
Ketian, can you stop messing around?

441
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,210
Ke is just childish.

442
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,260
If you say that to her,

443
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,340
you'll scare her.

444
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,240
Fine. I'll stay out of it. Okay?

445
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,110
Well... Ketian.

446
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,470
Master!

447
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,770
Master!

448
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,180
Master!

449
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,240
Master, something bad happened!

450
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,090
Make it short.

451
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,590
Since Qi Shaoheng's incident,

452
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,110
Marquis Wu'an has been
keeping an eye on you.

453
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,670
I've met several spies.

454
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,200
I didn't dare to alert them,

455
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,660
so I didn't deal with them.

456
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,950
No need to deal with them.

457
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,680
I have a way to make Marquis Wu'an
relax his vigilance.

458
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,240
Master, I haven't finished speaking yet.

459
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,820
The daughter of the Shen family
met with Marriage Broker Deng.

460
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,210
I only liked Lu Chi's appearance.

461
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,750
I didn't expect him to be the chief
of the Xibao Pavilion.

462
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,680
I've really selected a perfect candidate.

463
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,940
But this person is a very proud man
and has high standards.

464
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,370
I'm afraid it'll be hard to persuade him.

465
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,200
Lu Chi is nothing.

466
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,950
He's just a bit rich

467
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,890
and looks handsome.

468
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,240
But don't forget

469
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,920
that he has no power in the capital

470
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,400
and has no foundation.

471
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,170
Actually, it doesn't matter
whether he's rich or not.

472
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,660
Marriage Broker Deng, as you know,

473
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,160
I only care about facial appearance.

474
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,290
Facial appearance?

475
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,670
The husband I've chosen for you

476
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,540
is very handsome, too.

477
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,560
He's not inferior to Lu Chi at all.

478
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,880
Fine. I'll take a look.

479
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,510
Alright.

480
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,190
I hope this gentleman
can also be handsome.

481
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,160
Marriage Broker Deng
seems to have persuaded Miss Shen.

482
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,450
I'm afraid you'll like

483
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,360
the following news.

484
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,210
What a coincidence.

485
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
When I followed them
out of the restaurant,

486
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,350
I happened to run into Miss Shi,

487
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,500
who was kicked out of He's Bakery.

488
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,340
Why was Ketian suddenly so fierce?

489
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
I didn't ask her to go on a blind date.

490
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,240
Thank you, Marriage Broker Deng.

491
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,980
Alright. See you then.

492
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,560
Okay.

493
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,740
Then what happened?

494
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,310
Then...

495
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,180
You mean

496
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,680
Ke followed Shen Tongyun?

497
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,210
Exactly.

498
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,030
Go investigate the people
around Shen Tongyun,

499
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,290
especially the ones who are close to her.

500
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,840
As for Marriage Broker Shi,

501
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,630
you don't need to care about her.

502
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,410
Master.

503
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,240
Actually, you don't have to
be so worried about me.

504
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,510
I'm very healthy.

505
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,060
I can...

506
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,550
Buns!

507
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,830
Hot buns!

508
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,300
Sir, please give me some buns.

509
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,280
[Shen's Mansion]

510
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,000
They're both duplicitous liars.

511
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,370
One of them promised
to entrust her marriage to me,

512
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,370
but she secretly contacted Aunt Deng.

513
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,730
Lu is even worse.

514
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,380
He's playing hard to get.

515
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,030
He rejected her on the surface,

516
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,830
but he secretly went to the gate
of her house

517
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,940
and stared at her from behind.

518
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,720
Marriage Broker Shi, why are you here?

519
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,500
You're a duplicitous man,
and you broke your promise.

520
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,430
Let go of me!

521
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,520
Let go of me!

522
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,010
Ke, are you okay?

523
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,400
It hurts!

524
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,370
Don't touch me.

525
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
Luckily, it's just a sprain.

526
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,620
Since you have many male friends,

527
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
which one should I ask to pick you up?

528
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,170
Don't change the subject.

529
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,880
I know

530
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,160
you like Miss Shen.

531
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,680
Don't worry.

532
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,750
I'll try my best
to bring you two together.

533
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,010
Bringing us together?

534
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,360
So you'll be happy
if you can bring us together?

535
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,220
Then you won't be angry
after you bring us together?

536
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,150
That's... That's not what I mean.

537
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,620
Don't talk nonsense.

538
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,480
I'm an official matchmaker.

539
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,160
Why would I be unhappy for handling
my client's matchmaking case?

540
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,760
I would surely be very happy.

541
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,470
Yes, I'm very happy.

542
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,640
Alright. It's fine
as long as you're happy.

543
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,010
When I take you back home,

544
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,610
you can continue to be happy.

545
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,390
I don't need you to take me back home.

546
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,130
I can endure the pain and go home myself.

547
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,600
I can't bear it.

548
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,700
Stop!

549
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,210
My dear brothers, why are you two here?

550
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,030
If we still hadn't come yet,

551
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,630
you would be abducted by him.

552
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,770
He's a stranger.

553
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,800
How could you be so close to him?

554
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,090
Let's go. We'll take you home.

555
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,640
-Xianxian, I need dignity, too.
-I'll keep a close eye on you.

556
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,350
Xianxian, don't I also need dignity?

557
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,830
How embarrassing!

558
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,040
Put me down at once!

559
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,940
I'm so angry!

560
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,440
This person has gone too far, hasn't he?

561
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,070
How dare he covet your sister?

562
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,350
Confine your sister for a few more days
while her leg is injured.

563
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,270
Father, it seems that Ke needs to
be the matchmaker for Mr. Lu

564
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,750
and the daughter of the Shen family.

565
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,500
Father.

566
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,450
Although Lu has you-know-what towards Ke,

567
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,070
he hasn't you-know-what yet.

568
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,100
What if we you-know-what

569
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,790
and Ke gets angry?

570
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,110
Then should we really you-know-what?

571
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,650
We absolutely gotta you-know-what!

572
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,510
Let me tell you.

573
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,590
I'd rather kill a thousand people wrongly

574
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,110
than let one guilty person escape.

575
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,750
Besides, Lu's background
remains unknown.

576
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,380
While the three of us were away from home,

577
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,320
he broke into our house,

578
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,110
bullied your sister

579
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,070
and made her angry.

580
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,160
She even sprained her ankle.

581
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,790
That's too much.

582
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,090
That's too much.

583
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:43,790
"Too much" you say?

584
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,710
That is way beyond "too much".

585
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,110
I can't stand it anymore.

586
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,660
Cousin, does it still hurt?

587
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,940
I'm fine.

588
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,880
Here's the thing.

589
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,200
We couldn't figure out Lu's thoughts.

590
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,240
How about I go to see Xian
and give it a try again

591
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,640
when Ketian is not angry?

592
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,030
Anyway, Shen Tongyun is determined
to marry a handsome man.

593
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,450
Right?

594
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,970
I think so, too.

595
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,530
Let's go.

596
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,900
Ke! Ke!

597
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
My dear daughter.

598
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,400
You should have a good rest

599
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,820
at home these days.

600
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,250
Wait for me and your two brothers

601
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,380
to find an interesting place.

602
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,180
Then we can go have fun together.

603
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,350
-We can ask Xian to join us.
-Okay.

604
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,700
Brothers, you misunderstood Mr. Lu today.

605
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,540
Why don't we ask him to join us

606
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,890
so that you can apologize?

607
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,910
We'd better go somewhere with snacks.

608
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,760
Let's eat from one end
of the street to the other.

609
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,160
That's what makes it fun.

610
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,270
We'll go deal with it now.

611
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,050
Is it okay?

612
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,140
Of course.

613
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,670
But Ke, you need to recuperate.

614
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,180
Yes.

615
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,720
Chongshan and I caused trouble.

616
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,450
Of course we will go invite him.

617
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,810
Okay.

618
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,320
Daughter, we haven't played chess
for a long time.

619
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,190
Why don't we play chess?

620
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,110
Let's play chess together. Okay?

621
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,440
Come on.

622
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,270
Come on.

623
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,820
Come on.

624
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,410
What's that sound?

625
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,070
Why is there the sound of breaking tiles?

626
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,540
Maybe the house is old.

627
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,750
It's time to replace the old tiles
with new ones.

628
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,920
Leave the household matters to me.

629
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,510
Your only job
is to look after your sister well.

630
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:04,960
Okay.

631
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,490
Come on.

632
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,910
Is it really necessary
to repair the house?

633
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,940
Miss Shi's injury is not serious.

634
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,350
She'll recover after a few days' rest.

635
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,190
But I heard

636
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,190
Miss Shi wanted to eat snacks.

637
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,980
Lu Yi.

638
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,830
Purchase the remaining shops
in Ping'an Alley.

639
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,880
Turn them all into snack shops.

640
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,910
Hold opening ceremonies
for them in 3 days.

641
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,180
We have to promote them widely.

642
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,510
Ke will definitely go.

643
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,660
It's not appropriate
to attract so much publicity

644
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,680
at this time, is it?

645
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,550
Shen Tongyun has been pestering you,

646
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,240
while Mr. Shi and his sons

647
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,030
wouldn't allow you to approach Miss Shi.

648
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,200
Even Marquis Wu'an
is investigating your background.

649
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,850
Don't worry. Just do as I said.

650
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,780
I have my own way.

651
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,070
[Ping'an Alley]

652
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,100
[Ping'an Alley]

653
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,170
When did this snack street appear here?

654
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,350
There's a lot of delicious food
and fun things.

655
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,610
It's like they're specially made for me.

656
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,060
Ketian isn't willing to come.

657
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,890
Is she really cutting me off?

658
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,610
Ke, don't be sad.

659
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,800
Ketian is just a bit impatient.

660
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,410
She won't cut ties with you.

661
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,600
Chongshan,

662
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,450
you're talking so much
at the mention of Ketian.

663
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,270
Ketian must be angry with me.

who bribed the jailers?

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,950
Mother, to save me, Lu was poisoned.

835
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,730
We have to take good care of him

836
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,790
until he recovers.

837
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,680
Daughter,

838
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,590
I promise you

839
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,280
I will find that culprit.

840
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,920
However,

841
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,230
just let Mr. Lu go back
to his own home first.

842
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,440
He just lives next door, doesn't he?

843
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,840
How... How about sending him
to the hospital?

844
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
What do you think?

845
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,030
Mother.

846
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,870
If Lu hadn't saved me,

847
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,150
I would be the one lying inside now.

848
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,400
-You wouldn't.
-He saved my life.

849
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,870
How can we be so ungrateful?

850
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,850
Ke.

851
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,560
Calm down.

852
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,060
Let's go inside to check on Mr. Lu first.

853
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,800
Chongshan.

854
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,720
Why are you hiding?

855
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,680
Come here.

856
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Tell me the truth.

857
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,590
Why is the powder

858
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,630
so similar to the white powder

859
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,870
on Mr. Lu's clothes?

860
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,750
You...

861
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,560
Did you poison him?

862
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,920
Father, explain this for me.

863
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,780
Huai, do you know the truth too?

864
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,230
Explain this for me.

865
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,170
What could I say?

866
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,120
Well, Dear, don't be angry.

867
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
Here's the thing.

868
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,610
Lu has always been with Ke.

869
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,150
I've warned him before.

870
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,960
If he had listened to me,

871
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,400
there would be no conflicts between us.

872
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,480
But he behaved more recklessly

873
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,800
and didn't restrain himself at all.

874
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,710
So I asked Chongshan

875
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,270
to put a bit of the knockout drug
in his food.

876
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,110
It's not poison. It's really not poison.

877
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,970
He deserved it.

878
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,730
You...

879
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,830
So you two did this?

880
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,480
Xianxian must have
been involved in this, too.

881
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,250
Yes, yes.

882
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,890
Huai, are you out of your mind?

883
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,610
[As Eternal as the Sun and the Moon]

884
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,150
You even suggested sending him back home?

885
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,190
After we send him back home,

886
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,920
what if he sues you guys

887
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,130
for hurting him?

888
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,800
Hurting him?

889
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,330
H-He wouldn't do that, huh?

890
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,060
From now on,

891
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,610
take good good care of Mr. Lu

892
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,670
until he recovers.

893
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,050
Then sincerely apologize
to him and repent.

894
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,580
After he recovers,

895
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,400
just see how I'll teach you guys a lesson.

896
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,530
Got it, Mother.

897
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,720
[As Eternal as the Sun and the Moon]

898
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,620
Chongshan, come here.

899
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,630
I told you not to put too much in it.

900
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,160
Did you put too much in it?

901
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,380
Just a little.

902
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,450
Lu, I will take care of you.

903
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,290
You have to recover soon.

904
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,690
Though you didn't tell me, I know

905
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,450
you were the one who saved me every time.

906
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,100
Why are you guys here?

907
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,320
I brought your two brothers here

908
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,780
to apologize to you.

909
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,970
Say something. Say something.

910
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,580
-Ke, it's our fault.
-Ke, it's our fault.

911
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,810
Your fault?

912
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,390
You guys poisoned him, didn't you?

913
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,290
No.

914
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,510
What poison did you put?

915
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,840
Don't you know it might kill him?

916
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,040
We didn't poison him.

917
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,850
We just put a bit
of the knockout drug in his food.

918
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,630
You...

919
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,480
It's not fatal. Don't worry.

920
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,510
How about this, Ke?

921
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,160
I'll ask your two brothers
to take care of him.

922
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,460
Go back to your room
for a rest first. Okay?

923
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,100
No.

924
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,840
I'll take care of my own friend.

925
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,920
Ke, you're not married yet.

926
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,840
You can't take care of the man
who isn't your family.

927
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,030
If this news gets out,

928
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,580
well...

929
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,590
You both will have difficulty
getting married.

930
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,850
Yeah, you still need to care about
your reputation, right?

931
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,030
Shen Tongyun has a crush on Lu,

932
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,250
and Lu hasn't given me a reply yet.

933
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,500
What if this gets out?

934
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,920
Alright.

935
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,780
Take good care of him.

936
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,180
If anything bad happens to him,

937
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,230
I won't talk to you anymore.

938
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,430
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

939
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,150
Go back to your room for a rest.

940
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,090
Be good.

941
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,490
Go back to your room.

942
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,180
Take good care of him.

943
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,710
Alright. Be good.

944
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,380
Father, did we put too much
medicine in his food?

945
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,750
I've just asked Chongshan about it.

946
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,010
Did you put too much medicine in his food?

947

[Shi's Mansion]

948
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,700
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

949
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,230
Did you not take good care of him?

950
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,960
It's not like that. Look at him.

951
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,550
It's not like that at all.

Great!

It's good that you're awake.
