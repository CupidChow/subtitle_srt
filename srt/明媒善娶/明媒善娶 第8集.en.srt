3
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,270
Lu,

4
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,570
Li Ang came prepared.

5
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,160
The tea-spilling plan failed.

6
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,470
Ms. Deng will deliver
the Information Card tomorrow.

7
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,470
What should we do?

8
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,410
Don't worry, Ke.

9
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,870
You go stop Miss Shen

10
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,950
and bring her back to watch the show.

11
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,810
This time, I'll handle it myself.

12
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,180
I promise it'll work.

13
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,340
Lu.

14
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,720
Be careful.

15
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,880
Don't take unnecessary risks.

16
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,880
She's Miss Shen, right?

17
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,870
Miss Shen.

18
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,180
I...

19
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,990
Tongyun, don't feel pressured.

20
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,630
I just don't want you
to end up with the wrong person.

21
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,070
Rumors say General Li is quite...

22
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,730
Perhaps someone spread the rumors
out of jealousy.

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,120
As long as he's not a bad person,
that's enough.

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,190
Tongyun, be careful on your way.

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,670
I'm leaving.

26
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,270
Miss Shen, wait.

27
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,120
I have something to tell you.

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,190
What else do you want to say? Go ahead.

29
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,810
General Li is violent and cruel
and kills innocent people.

30
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,810
You truly haven't heard
even a whisper of such things?

31
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,910
Miss Shi,

32
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,750
I thought you were someone

33
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,750
who could see beyond common prejudice

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,430
and wouldn't blindly believe rumors.

35
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,360
I never expected

36
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,400
you'd be just like the rest.

37
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,940
In the capital,

38
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,290
rumors about me being boy-crazy
are everywhere.

39
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,020
I know better than anyone

40
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,560
what it feels like
to live under a storm of rumors.

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,690
I only trust what I see with my own eyes.

42
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,040
You trust what you see with your own eyes.

43
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,440
I have no issue with that.

44
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,490
If he truly has a gentle nature,

45
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,890
he should be consistent.

46
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,370
Why don't you go back with me

47
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,829
to see for yourself again?

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,360
If he really is a good man,

49
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,930
I'll give up the idea
of finding someone else for you.

50
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,620
Fine, I'll go back with you

51
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,850
so that you can give up your idea.

52
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,680
Damn woman!

53
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,150
How did Shen Tongyun know
such a lowly, penniless scholar?

54
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,980
What right does he have

55
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,710
to enter my private room and sit here

56
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,640
drinking tea and chatting with me?

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,840
Yes.

58
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,830
General, please don't be angry.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,910
Wang Ren

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
was brought here by Shi Fa'ke

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,290
to disgust you on purpose.

62
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,150
Fortunately,

63
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,590
I knew
Shi Fa'ke wouldn't give up so easily

64
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,990
and discussed countermeasures with you.

65
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,070
But honestly,

66
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,519
you handled the situation today

67
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,410
with such ease and composure.

68
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,270
If it were any other time,

69
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,870
I would've chopped them up
and fed them to dogs!

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,100
General Li.

71
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,970
General Li, please calm down.

72
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,030
Calm down.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,670
There's no need to be upset.

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,159
Once Shen Tongyun becomes your wife,

75
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,550
when you're not happy,

76
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,710
you can scold or beat her as you like,
right?

77
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,790
General Li, listen to me.

78
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,870
A little impatience spoils great plans.

79
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,100
Once this is done,

80
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,690
if you're not satisfied,

81
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,190
leave it to me.

82
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,890
I'll find you another beautiful wife.

83
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,120
What do you say?

84
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,860
Calm down, General.

85
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,450
You had just left, and he already
started saying harsh words,

86
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,520
talking about marrying someone else.

87
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,010
I'm afraid after you marry him,

88
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,340
he won't treat you well.

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,100
Miss Shen, can't you see?

90
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,980
Lu Chi?

91
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,300
Who are you?

92
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Why did you barge into my private room?

93
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,430
I am Lu Chi,

94
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,580
the new owner of this restaurant.

95
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,730
I heard my staff member was clumsy

96
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,550
and stained your robe.

97
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,950
I've specially prepared
the most famous soup noodles

98
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,150
from the snack street

99
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,320
to apologize to you.

100
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,320
I hope you can forgive us.

101
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,940
You...

102
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,710
You're asking for death!

103
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,690
Stop!

104
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,760
General Li!

105
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,050
Come quickly. Hurry.

106
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,640
Shen Tongyun,

107
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
are you here to die too?

108
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
He's way too hot-tempered.

109
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,920
Yes, quite frightening.

110
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,980
Miss Shen, you've seen it yourself.

111
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,830
It's time to decide whether you want

112
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,680
to marry someone like him or not.

113
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,530
General Li is talented and imposing.

114
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,670
But I'm unpredictable.

115
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,890
I dare not aspire to such a match.

116
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,620
Let's call off our engagement.

117
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,540
Everyone here can bear witness:

118
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,880
I know I'm not worthy of General Li,

119
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,020
so I'm calling off the engagement.

120
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,290
Don't, Miss Shen.

121
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,930
Don't be deceived by Shi Fa'ke.

122
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,320
This is a scheme
devised by Shi Fa'ke and Lu Chi

123
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,090
to frame General Li.

124
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,890
Yes, I planned it.

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
But I only did this

126
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,860
because someone else lied first.

127
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,730
So I wanted to make him
show his true colors.

128
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,550
Ms. Deng,

129
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,550
you deceived Miss Shen too.

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:09,950
I...

131
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,700
You told General Li
to pretend to be gentle

132
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,170
and hide his violent nature,

133
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,510
tricking Miss Shen

134
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,240
into marrying such a dangerous man.

135
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
It's marriage fraud!

136
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,310
You...

137
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,200
Fine!

138

and immoral.

140
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,190
I never intended to marry you anyway!

141
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,870
General Li! General Li!

142
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,150
It scared me to death.

Don't worry.

I promise it'll work.

Scholar Wang is right next door
at the painting shop.

Why don't we strike while the iron is hot

and think of another plan?

over there.

Who knows what she was looking at?

Looking at men of course.

She was so excited
that she nearly rushed out.

Give me a moment.

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,890
Miss, that's pearl powder.

343
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,780
Yes, that's exactly what we need.

344

This is Mr. Gushan's painting.

Gushan Sou is an old friend of mine.

I specially came today to propose to you.

If you accept me,

I promise I'll love and protect you
for a lifetime

And if I don't accept you,

382
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,890
will you not give me this painting?

383

I will.

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,690
This painting was meant
to be a gift for your wedding.

385

If you agree to marry me,

Scholar Wang has loved you faithfully
for over a decade.

get rid of Li Ang,
Scholar Wang's love rival.

510
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,510
I should thank you for that.

511
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,570
Ke, you're not angry with me anymore?

512
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,170
Of course I was angry,

513
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,340
but I'm over it now.

514
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,940
If my brothers hadn't hurt you secretly,

515
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,310
you wouldn't have had the chance
to fake illness.

516
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,950
Anyway,

517
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,100
it's their fault.

518
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,740

519
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,370
I...

520
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,020
Lu,

521
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,980
have you forgotten why I was angry?

522
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,810
Mind your manners.

523
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,920
Don't think about it.

524
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,020
Shi Fa'ke, you're engaged.

525
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,170
How can you lose your composure
over another man?

526
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,260
I'll leave the invitations here.

527
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,910
Don't forget to pick them up.

528
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,110
Get down!

529
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,170
Chief Lu, no more pretense?

530
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,330
Xianxian, beat him!

531
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,540
Stop!

532
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,620
Xianxian, Chongshan, what are you doing?

533
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,110
Lu has regained his memory.

534
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,880
He's well now.

535
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,690
Ke, he was pretending.

536
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,570
I don't know if he was pretending.

537
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,840
I only know you gave him knockout drugs!

538
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,550
Ke, we were just...

539
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,470
You were what?

540
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,270
He's my helper now.

541
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,840
If anything happens to him,

542
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,020
I'll tell Mother.

543
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,930
Chongshan, I'm suddenly sleepy.

544
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,990
Help me back to bed.

545
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,070
Mr. Lu is afraid of the dark.

546
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,790
Let's go together.

547
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,200
I'm not afraid of the dark.

548
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,960
Wait.

549
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,050
I said Lu must not be harmed.

551
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,910
Remove your hands.

552
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,880
Lu, come here.

553
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,730
This is a secret.

554
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,410
Don't let them find out.

555
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,150
Walk Lu out properly, got it?

556
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,310
Mr. Lu, it's so late.

557
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,610

560
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,650
you two have honored
your ancestors' teachings

561
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,290
and fulfilled the wishes of your parents.

562
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,180
Today, you are joined in marriage.

563
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,290
The ceremony is complete!

564
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,170
Congratulations.

565
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,030
Congratulations.

566
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,070
A perfect match of talent and beauty.

567
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,440
Indeed.

568
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,790
Congratulations.

569
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,830
Congratulations.

570
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,900
Such a lovely couple.

571
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,300
Truly a perfect match.

572
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,360
They truly are perfect for each other.

573
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,000
Tongyun lost her mother early,

574
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,500
so I took on the role of her mother.

575
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,880
I've always worried
I haven't taken care of her well enough,

576
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,420
so I've spoiled her a bit.

577
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,810
Now that someone truly cares about her,

578
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,790
I can finally be at ease.

579
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,300
Father-in-law, rest assured.

580
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,700
I will treat Tongyun well

581
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,100
and make her happy.

582
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,250
Good.

583
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,940

584
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,890
Very good.

Miss Shi.

586
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,640
Lord Shen, what are you doing?

587
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,110
You'll overwhelm me with such courtesy.

588
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,610
Miss Shi, this honor is well deserved.

589
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,030
It was your mother, Tao,

590
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,640
who arranged the marriage
between Tongyun's mother and me.

591
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,760
And now, you've found
such a good husband for Tongyun.

592

I'm very grateful.

Lord Shen, you flatter me.

They have finally become husband and wife.
