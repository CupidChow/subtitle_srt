00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,200
We need 20,000 taels.

669
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,950
There's a shortfall of about 18,000 taels.

670
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,460
I'm willing to contribute 10,000 taels.

671
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,280
10,000 taels?

672
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,780
Lu is...

673
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,120
Are you serious?

674
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,970
I won't break my promise.

675
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,230
However, I have a small request.

676
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,440
Chief Lu, since you're so generous,

677
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,150
please tell us your request.

678
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,590
I've heard the Flower Assembly
is almost the same every year.

679
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,150
Since I'll contribute the money this year,

680
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,810
I'd like to see something new.

681
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,050
What do you mean by that, Chief Lu?

682
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,780
It's just the literal meaning.

683
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,720
I want to spend money on something I like.

684
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,960
The capable person should be in charge.

685
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,110
Let's select the organizer
of the Flower Assembly by a competition.

686
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,580
Whoever has the best ideas
will be in charge.

687
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,120
Lu is clearly helping me.

688
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,130
But Chief Lu, you need to understand that

689
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,110
the Flower Assembly

690
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,380
is usually organized
by the Chief Matchmaker.

691
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,630
Chief Lu,

692
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,620
this approach goes against our tradition.

693
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,930
Besides,

694
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,740
which one here do you think

695
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,220
would be willing to compete against me,
the Chief Matchmaker?

696
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,340
In that case, just forget it.

697
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,350
Who said no one is willing to do that?

698
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,640
I'm willing to compete.

699
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,560
Chief Lu, please stay.

700
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,720
Since you're so generous,

701
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,360
we can certainly discuss this further.

702
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,220
Alright.

703
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,960
Why don't we hold a competition?

704
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,370
Kexian.

705
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,810
Why are you here?

706
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,150
Well, Ketian noticed
that you were in low spirits,

707
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,590
so she asked me to bring you some desserts
to cheer you up.

708
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,250
Kexian,
I'm so lucky to have you and Ketian.

709
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,860
How's it going?

710
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,429
If I want to host the Flower Assembly,

711
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,570
what are my chances
of defeating Marriage Broker Deng?

712
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,870
I don't know.

713
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,880
But if you want to
host the Flower Assembly,

714
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,179
I'll do everything in my power to help you

715
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,070
and make your wish come true.

716
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,960
Besides, you've learned so well
from Aunt Tao.

717
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,360
I'm sure you can organize it properly.

718
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,230
You're right.

719
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,800
I am my mother's daughter.

720
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,199
I can definitely do this.

721
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,590
Kexian, I'll take these desserts.

722
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,070
I'll prepare for it carefully.

723
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,520
Okay.

724
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,050
[Shi's Mansion]

725
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,550
[As Eternal as the Sun and the Moon]

726
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,190
[The one that invests the most can get
the naming right in the Flower Assembly.]

727
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,550
Today, you and I are gathered here

728
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,150
to raise funds for the Flower Assembly.

729
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,940
Of course, the money
can't be donated for nothing.

730
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,660
We still need to hear the opinions
of our two marriage brokers

731
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,870
to see if you all are willing to
contribute the money,

732
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,560
how much you're willing to offer

733
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,160
and which of them
you want to spend the money on.

734
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,620
So, let's begin.

735
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,610
Which of you would like to start first?

736
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,880
Shi Fa'ke, you may start first,

737
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,360
as I don't want others to blame me
for bullying my junior.

738
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,650
Everyone,

739
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,800
if I am entrusted with this position,

740
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,360
all those who contribute to
the Official Matchmaking Agency

741
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,150
can use this opportunity
to gain wide recognition.

742
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,670
By that time at the Flower Assembly,

743
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,320
everyone will see the names
of your distinguished shops.

744
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,110
Your shops will surely become famous.

745
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,740
That sounds wonderful.

746
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,510
This is something good.

747
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,190
Indeed.

748
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,150
Your shops will not only be famous
throughout the capital

749
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,680
but also be included in

750
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,010
the Top Recommended List
for the procurement

751
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,070
of the Official Matchmaking Agency.

752
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,880
What is this Top Recommended List?

753
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,490
Yeah.

754
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,630
When the Official Matchmaking Agency
purchases betrothal gifts and dowries,

755
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,550
it'll surely prioritize collaboration

756
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,430
with shops that have invested.

757
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,730
So there will be quite a lot of business?

758
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,110
If Marriage Broker Shi is in charge,

759
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,360
He's Bakery is willing to
contribute a year's revenue

760
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,920
to support the Flower Assembly.

761
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,370
A year's revenue?

762
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,650
That's very generous.

763
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,790
We don't have that much cash.

764
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,010
We're preparing to open a branch store.

765
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,800
Let's support Ke's dream first.

766
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,030
Money can be earned again.

767
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,260
But that's not very realistic.

768
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,240
We have the intention but not the ability.

769
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,250
I'm the manager of He's Bakery.

770
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,360
I won't allow you to take such a big risk.

771
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,890
Ketian.

772
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,590
If Marriage Broker Shi is in charge,

773
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,440
He's Bakery is willing to
contribute half a year's revenue,

774
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,550
1,500 taels.

775
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,370
Ketian.

776
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,230
If He's Bakery is willing to
contribute 1,500 taels,

777
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,160
then He's Bakery

778
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,400
will be the Official Matchmaking Agency's
preferred partner for wedding cakes.

779
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,880
All the desserts needed
for the wedding celebrations

780
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,960
of the Official Matchmaking Agency

781
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,670
will be purchased from He's Bakery.

782
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,720
Good! Good! Good!

783
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,670
Good! Good! Good!

784
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,690
Impressive!

785
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,720
Also,

786
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,800
whoever invests the most
in the Flower Assembly this time

787
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
can gain the naming right.

788
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,620
For example,
if Xibao Pavilion invests the most,

789
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,320
then the Flower Assembly this time

790
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,510
will be called the Xibao Flower Assembly.

791
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,440
And there's only one opportunity.

792
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,990
Shi Fa'ke.

793
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,860
Why are you trying so hard
to fawn on Chief Lu?

794
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Don't forget that

795
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,900
I am the Chief Matchmaker.

796
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,710
I can also do all these things
you've mentioned.

797
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,190
So you'd better tell us

798
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,800
your plans for the Flower Assembly now.

799
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,060
Yes, that makes sense.

800
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,230
The Flower Assembly is held every year.

801
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,920
But if we do it the same way as before,

802
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,550
with unmarried men and women
separated by screens,

803
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,810
how boring it would be.

804
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,790
So this time, we must make some changes.

805
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,230
So what would you like to do,
Marriage Broker Shi?

806
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,360
What changes could you possibly make?

807
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,250
I wonder if she has any good ideas.

808
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,370
Let's hear it.

809
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,710
Everyone, please look.

810
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,510
By that time at the Flower Assembly,

811
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,040
in front of each young lady,

812
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,550
there will be a glass lamp
with her name engraved on it.

813
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,920
Then each young gentleman
will present himself on stage by turns.

814
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,710
The ladies can learn about
the gentlemen's talents,

815
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,430
interests and mannerisms

816
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,710
before deciding
whether to keep their lamps lit or not.

817
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,310
A lit lamp means preference.

818
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,480
An extinguished one means dispreference.

819
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,340
The lady who keeps her lamp lit
may arrange to talk with the gentleman.

820
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,480
What if multiple ladies

821
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,590
are interested in the same gentleman?

822
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,510
What will happen then?

823
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,390
Yes, yes.

824
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,680
Then the gentleman may choose one lady

825
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,190
and ask her a few questions

826
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,850
before deciding
which one he wants to talk with.

827
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,850
This is utterly absurd!

828
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,960
Men and women will choose each other

829
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,020
and then meet privately afterwards?

830
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,720
How inappropriate!

831
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,480
Marriage Broker Deng,
why are you in such a hurry to oppose it?

832
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,190
I think
Marriage Broker Shi's idea is excellent.

833
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,800
Since the gifts are so exquisite,

834
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,440
I think all young ladies and gentlemen

835
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
like them, right?

836
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,840
Also,

837
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,830
I've designed some small games

838
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,730
to provide more options

839
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,230
for those who don't want marriages

840
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,070
so that the Flower Assembly
can become a grand event,

841
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,400
which buzzes with
people and a lively atmosphere.

842
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,670
It can also help to avoid suspicion.

843
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,170
How dare you treat marriage
so frivolously?

844
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,190
So, Marriage Broker Deng,
what have you prepared?

845
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,550
Please share your ideas with everyone.

846
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,160
In my opinion,

847
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,840
marriage must
prioritize parental approval.

848
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,750
I think at the Flower Assembly this time,

849
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,410
we must invite the parents or elders
from each family to attend it.

850
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,280
With their parents there,

851
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,230
how can the young people feel comfortable
getting to know each other?

852
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,110
After all,
it's the young people's marriage.

853
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,150
Their own wishes
are surely the most important.

854
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,080
They'll make their own decisions?

855
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,120
Let me ask you.

856
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,030
So what if young men and women

857
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,030
fancy each other?

858
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,360
They have no authority
to settle a marriage agreement.

859
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,170
Their parents have to be there

860
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,760
with the presence of marriage brokers
from the Official Matchmaking Agency.

861
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,030
That's the only way of respecting
parental wishes and matchmakers' words.

862
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,400
This is killing two birds with one stone.

863
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,660
Don't you understand?

864
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,240
Don't you all agree?

865
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,430
That's right.

866
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,920
Marriage Broker Deng's words make sense.

867
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,110
Marriage Broker Deng's words
are very reasonable.

868
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,510
Indeed. Although it's a good idea,

869
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,300
it doesn't conform to proper etiquette.

870
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,840
This is about mutual affection
between men and women.

871
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,800
Why do we have to insist on
the presence of parents?

872
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,620
Indeed. Liu's words make sense.

873
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,660
What both sides said makes sense.

874
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,650
Why don't we

875
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,370
let the shop owners here vote to decide?

876
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,580
Lu Chi.

877
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,950
Ke's design is clearly more innovative
and interesting.

878
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,590
But you still want to
make things difficult for her with a vote.

879
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,550
Even if you and Ke were just strangers,

880
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,110
you should still speak
with your conscience.

881
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,770
I only speak for what's right.

882
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,800
What's more,
the minority submits to the majority.

883
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,930
That can't be wrong.

884
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,840
What Chief Lu said makes sense.

885
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,680
I'm glad
Marriage Broker Deng agrees with me.

886
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,980
Kexian, just forget it.

887
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,110
Stop giving Chief Lu a hard time.

888
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,770
What he said makes sense, too.

889
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,000
Since you both have no objections,

890
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,690
Ms. Li, please prepare for it.

891
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,560
Ladies and gentlemen, please choose

892
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,690
the organizer you want

893
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,630
and the amount of investment.

894
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,360
The number of votes
is determined by the amount of investment.

895
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,820
The one with the most votes

896
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,130
will be the organizer
of the Flower Assembly this time.

897
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,480
Shi Fa'ke.

898
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,910
Chief Lu is truly a shrewd man.

899
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,120
What he says can't be wrong.
