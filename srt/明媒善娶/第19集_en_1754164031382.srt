1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
There is an hidden treasure in the wooden box

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,900
Is it you who hid it?

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,780
Little girl misright and child convenience

4
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,780
Who is the one who is shy to express?

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,780
The blush of your face, the fluttering of your heart

6
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,780
Who is willing to?

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,780
It's better to be honest and simple

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,780
Falling into the abyss of regret

9
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,780
Seeing the flowers in the branches

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,780
The strange years

11
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,780
I don't know if you have any worries

12
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,780
Some people want to repay

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,780
But there is no way to do it

14
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,780
A life together is the best way

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,780
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,780
Episode 16

17
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Buns, hot buns

18
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Hot buns

19
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,780
Sir, can I have your room money?

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,780
Please wait a moment

21
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,780
I'll think of a way

22
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
Please hurry up

23
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,780
Mr. Yang, look, this is so beautiful

24
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,780
It must be suitable for you

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,780
I'm not a woman

26
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,780
I'm a woman

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,780
I'm a woman

28
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,780
I'm a woman

29
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,780
I'm a woman

30
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,780
It must be suitable for you

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,780
Boss, help me carry this, this, this

32
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,780
OK

33
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,780
What's wrong?

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,780
Why are you so unhappy all day?

35
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,780
Is there any difficulty?

36
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,780
Brother, can you lend me some money?

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,780
I'm in a hurry to go out

38
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,780
Jingdu is so fun

39
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,780
The money is all spent

40
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,780
It's no problem

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,780
But that's all for today

42
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,780
You can take it to the emergency first

43
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,780
Come on

44
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,780
Thank you, brother

45
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,780
But these days

46
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,780
There is still no whereabouts of Mr. Lin Yuan

47
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,780
Such a big sea fish is really looking for

48
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,780
I don't know when to find

49
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,780
In Jingdu, boat-hunting

50
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
All aspects have to spend money

51
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,780
I don't know how long these can last

52
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,780
This is not simple

53
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,780
You returned the room in the inn and lived in my house

54
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Isn't this saving a lot of money?

55
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,780
Ake, you really saved me

56
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,780
Today's grace

57
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,780
I will do my best to repay you in the future

58
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,780
but

59
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,780
Is there any difficulty?

60
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,780
There is indeed a problem that has not been solved

61
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,780
You are dressed as a man now

62
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,780
I haven't left the house yet

63
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,780
If I just take a stranger home

64
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,780
My brother and father will flip the roof first

65
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,780
And if brother Lu knew

66
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,780
I brought a man home

67
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,780
I don't know what he would do

68
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,780
So this is what you are worried about

69
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
This is simple

70
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,780
go

71
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,780
Mr. Yan

72
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,780
No no no

73
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
Yan Xiaoyangzi

74
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,780
You are so beautiful

75
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,780
Can you do it now?

76
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,780
Of course

77
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,780
Madam

78
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Madam, I am back

79
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,780
Ake

80
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,780
Ake

81
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,780
This lady is

82
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,780
Let me introduce you

83
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,780
This is my first wife

84
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,780
This is my second wife

85
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,780
This is my third wife

86
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,780
Let me introduce you

87
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,780
This is my new friend

88
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,780
His name is Yan Qi Yue

89
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,780
Greetings, uncle and aunt

90
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
Greetings, everyone

91
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,780
Qi Yue

92
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,780
This is my big brother, Shi Xianxian

93
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,780
My second brother is Chong Shan

94
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,780
And my little cousin, Qin'er

95
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
Hello, Miss Yue

96
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,780
So you are friends of the Tang family

97
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
Sister Yue is so beautiful

98
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,780
Greetings, big brother and second brother

99
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,780
Hello, sister Qin'er

100
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,780
Miss Yue, where are you from?

101
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,780
I am from the outside

102
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,780
From the outside

103
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,780
Mother

104
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,780
She is here to travel in the capital

105
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
She has no relatives here

106
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
She is so beautiful

107
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,780
I am worried about her

108
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,780
Mother

109
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,780
Can you let her

110
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,780
live in our house for a few days?

111
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
Since she is your friend

112
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,780
Our house is welcome

113
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,780
I will tell the servants

114
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,780
to clean up the room on the east side

115
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,780
You can live there

116
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,780
It is closer to Ake

117
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,780
It is convenient to walk

118
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,780
Thank you, uncle and aunt

119
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,780
Qi Yue, sorry for bothering you

120
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,780
It is okay

121
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,780
You can treat this as your own home

122
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,780
Except Ake

123
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,780
You can find them

124
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,780
Yes, Miss Yue

125
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,780
If you need anything

126
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,780
Just call us

127
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,780
Miss Yue is Ake's friend

128
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,780
She is our friend

129
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,780
You are welcome

130
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,780
Thank you, big brother and second brother

131
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,780
Let's go, I will take you to have a look

132
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
Go

133
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,780
Go

134
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,780
Master

135
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,780
Master

136
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,780
Master

137
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,780
Miss Shi didn't meet Mr. Yan today

138
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,780
But she brought a young and beautiful lady home today

139
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,780
Lady?

140
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,780
Ake is still alive

141
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,780
Manager Li

142
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,780
The two brothers of the Shi family

143
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,780
seem to be interested in

144
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,780
the young and beautiful lady

145
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,780
Why do you tell me about this?

146
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,780
What does it have to do with me?

147
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Does it have nothing to do with you?

148
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
The young lady is very intimate with the Shi family

149
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,780
She is very intimate

150
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,780
She is very intimate

151
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,780
Does it really have nothing to do with you?

152
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,480
I'm willing to lay my life

153
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,780
on the ground

154
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,780
Then he would have played other songs

155
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,780
If he weighed the eight notes

156
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,780
escorting in and out

157
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,780
him

158
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,280
Lord, please

159
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,780
Shall I to do the work of traveling?

160
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
I will

161
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
I almost forgot.

162
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,720
I'll add these things.

163
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,080
Manager Li, you go ahead.

164
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,360
Are you buying rouge?

165
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,280
Is this rouge?

166
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,080
Yes.

167
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,160
Which one is the best?

168
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,840
This one is more suitable for the bride.

169
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,760
Okay.

170
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,080
Miss Yue'er will definitely like it.

171
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,840
Wrap it up.

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,520
Okay.

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,520
This one.

174
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,040
Wrap this one too.

175
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,720
Okay.

176
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,680
What else?

177
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,440
This one.

178
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,160
This one.

179
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,920
This one.

180
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,720
This one.

181
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,480
This one.

182
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,240
This one.

183
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,560
What else

184
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,080
do the ladies like?

185
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,200
You can also look at the group fan here.

186
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,440
Okay.

187
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,320
This one.

188
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,040
Wrap this one too.

189
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,720
Okay.

190
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,080
Miss Yue'er will definitely like it.

191
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,440
Who told you to put it here?

192
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,720
Is it nice to put it here?

193
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,840
Don't do anything I didn't say in the future.

194
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,280
Yes.

195
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,920
Take it away now.

196
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
I did it on my own.

197
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Sister Pan'er.

198
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,280
Why are you angry?

199
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,160
What's bothering you lately?

200
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Ke is here.

201
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,920
The head of the group has been busy lately.

202
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,000
Are you two having a good time together?

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,680
Sister Pan'er.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,520
How are you doing with my brother recently?

205
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
What do you mean?

206
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,240
He's not interested in me at all.

207
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Impossible.

208
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,680
My brother is not that kind of person.

209
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,080
Sister Pan'er.

210
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,960
Don't worry.

211
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
I'll take care of these.

212
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,560
I'll think of a way.

213
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,880
Ke.

214
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,760
Aren't you here to find the head of the group?

215
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,960
I'll come tomorrow.

216
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,760
I'm leaving.

217
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,880
Brother.

218
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,600
Brother.

219
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,080
You're back.

220
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,880
Come on. Come here.

221
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,520
Ke.

222
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,520
What's up?

223
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,680
Brother.

224
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,360
Have you been to Xibao Pavilion recently?

225
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,600
Yes.

226
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,880
Didn't you ask me to give Miss Yue

227
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
some daily necessities?

228
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,040
Do you think

229
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,120
Sister Pan'er has any abnormalities?

230
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,800
Abnormal?

231
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,520
No.

232
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,680
She's still as beautiful

233
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,760
as usual.

234
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,560
Brother.

235
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
Have you considered

236
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
your future plans?

237
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,720
Ke, what are you talking about?

238
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,960
What future plans?

239
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,920
She's the manager of Xibao Pavilion.

240
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,880
And I

241
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,280
am just a small supplement.

242
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,320
Brother.

243
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,160
How can you say that?

244
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,480
Although our Shi family is not a famous family,

245
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,920
we are also a decent family.

246
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,800
And you're the eldest son of the Shi family.

247
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,280
You don't care about those rich people at all.

248
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
And you're honest,

249
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,840
considerate and take care of the family.

250
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,120
It's the ideal type of many ladies.

251
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,440
Really?

252
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,400
Of course.

253
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,880
I'm not as good as you said.

254
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Brother.

255
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,560
You should be more confident.

256
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,720
Even if it's as you said,

257
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,120
but Manager Li is beautiful

258
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,280
and smart.

259
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,280
She's so good.

260
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,360
I don't deserve her.

261
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,240
Okay, Ke.

262
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
I'm going back to my room.

263
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,000
You should rest early.

264
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,600
Brother.

265
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,960
You're so annoying.

266
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,440
You and Sister Pan

267
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,000
are enemies.

268
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,840
But you're so unconfident.

269
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,520
No.

270
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,000
I have to think of a way to help you.

271
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
I'll find you.

272
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,000
Manager Li.

273
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,520
Don't turn around.

274
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,040
Manager Li.

275
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,760
Manager Li.

276
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,320
Manager Li.

277
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,640
Why did she pull that company?

278
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,200
Let's go.

279
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,560
Brother.

280
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,920
Do you have something on your mind?

281
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,280
No.

282
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm enjoying the moon.

283
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,640
The moon is good tonight.

284
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,680
What's there to enjoy about the moon?

285
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,120
You don't look so happy.

286
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,680
I... I'm not not happy.

287
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,240
I'm going to sleep now.

288
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,640
Ke.

289
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,200
Go and have an early rest.

290
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,120
That's it.

291
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,040
Okay.

292
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,520
Damn it!

293
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,560
It should be

294
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,400
I'm sorry.

295
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,040
Ke.

296
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,640
What's wrong?

297
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,040
I might have messed up something.

298
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,720
I wanted to go to Brother Yan

299
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,840
to stimulate him.

300
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,120
But he didn't seem to be in the right mind.

301
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,120
How can I help him

302
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,680
get Sister Pan'er back?

303
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,960
Love is

304
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,880
in the mutual understanding of two people.

305
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,040
You should encourage him

306
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,320
to express his feelings

307
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,760
in the most direct way

308
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,160
to express his feelings.

309
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,920
In case they get confused,

310
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,800
they won't know each other's feelings.

311
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
Brother Lu is right.

312
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,000
I didn't expect Young Master Yan to be so powerful.

313
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,840
My brother doesn't know how to change.

314
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,720
I should open him more.

315
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
I heard that you've been

316
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,480
very close to Young Master Yan recently.

317
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,320
Are you jealous?

318
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,280
Young Master Yan and I are really friends.

319
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,880
Really.

320
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,360
Write a poem and put it in your dream

321
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,920
No one will hear it even if it's a flower-like stream

322
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,320
This is no longer a story

323
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,800
It's just a game of luck

324
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Take a bottle of the color of the moon

325
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,280
Listen to the sound of the flower falling and you smile at me

326
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,960
Thank you.

327
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,040
Don't say anything that's not good

328
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,080
Please look at yourself

329
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,280
Listen to the sound of the rain

330
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,960
I forget certain distances

331
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,200
What's wrong with it?

332
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,840
Understand the fingers and fl này yo

333
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
Enough for now.

334
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,440
My dream is all about you

335
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,200
The lonely one

336
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,700
Brother Lu,

337
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,640
You're my favorite.

338
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,520
No one can replace you.

339
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
Brother.

340
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,240
Nak.

341
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Why are you still awake?

342
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,480
You're still awake.

343
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Still in a coma?

344
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,000
I can't sleep.

345
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,320
Brother.

346
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,720
I know why you're so confused.

347
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,400
You should tell someone you like them.

348
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,360
You should let them know your feelings.

349
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,760
Even if they reject you,

350
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,600
you should know what they think.

351
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,360
You're hiding things from them.

352
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
You can't torture yourself.

353
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
You should be more direct,

354
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,720
brave,

355
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,840
and thorough.

356
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,440
Manager Li.

357
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,960
I have something important to tell you.

358
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,720
This house has a Cadet teacher.

359
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,680
There was a misunderstanding just now.

360
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,400
I hope you don't report it to the police.

361
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,560
Professor.

362
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,320
What are you doing?

363
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
ester

364
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,260
manager Li

365
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,300
These are all my family's

366
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,440
if

367
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,360
It's hard to guess when you're not fast.

368
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,080
You said it's all your belongings when you got here.

369
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,920
You didn't say you wanted to buy anything.

370
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,960
How would I know

371
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,560
what you're going to use all your belongings for?

372
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,760
Be more direct,

373
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,840
be braver,

374
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,080
and be more thorough.

375
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,760
I...

376
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,720
Mr. Ye.

377
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,240
I...

378
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,800
I...

379
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,520
I like you.

380
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,280
I...

381
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,640
I want to take care of you forever.

382
00:18:50,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Twenty five forget your

383
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,960
No need.

384
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,160
I know what you're thinking.

385
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,880
I was the one who was poisoned.

386
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,280
Sorry for disturbing you.

387
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,520
I don't want any of these.

388
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,960
I just want

389
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,920
your sincerity.

390
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,080
But

391
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,080
there's one more thing

392
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,400
you have to do.

393
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,520
Not just one,

394
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,320
but thousands and thousands of them.

395
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,320
No.

396
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,520
In the end,

397
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,800
because of you,

398
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,960
it's a miracle.

399
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,680
Only you make me

400
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,520
want to

401
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,280
live my life recklessly.

402
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,080
Maybe you're just doubtful.

403
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,200
You won't do it for me?

404
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,000
Maybe you're just doubtful.

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,120
Go ask someone else.

406
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,840
No.

407
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,040
I'll do it for you.

408
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,640
Who is the legend in the fog?

409
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,440
So annoying.

410
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,200
So annoying.

411
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,920
Come here.

412
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,680
Alright.

413
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,880
It's fine.

414
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,360
You scared me.

415
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,160
Don't be afraid.

416
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,960
I'm here.

417
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,200
Don't worry.

418
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Since you want me to be your rose,

419
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,040
I'll do my best

420
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,000
to protect you.

421
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,560
Alright.

422
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,720
I'm looking forward to it.

423
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,320
Fang Shoumei.

424
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,680
Your Highness.

425
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,080
This lady is...

426
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,480
Fang Shoumei.

427
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,840
This is Yan Qiyue,

428
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,720
Yan's daughter.

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,320
She came to the capital to have fun.

430
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,440
Qiyue.

431
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,040
This is Fang Shoumei from Guanmei Hall.

432
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,320
Hello, Fang Shoumei.

433
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,160
She came to the capital to have fun?

434
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,360
Where do you live now?

435
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,600
I live in my brother's house now.

436
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,120
You're the most enthusiastic one.

437
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,120
You should be used to

438
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,480
the life in the capital.

439
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,080
Brother took me to

440
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,320
many interesting places.

441
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,040
The capital is prosperous and well-off.

442
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,240
I'm happy here.

443
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,120
Fang Shoumei.

444
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,600
I'm going to the capital now.

445
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,720
Excuse me.

446
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,800
Let's go.

447
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,080
It smells great.

448
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,360
Gouwa.

449
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,400
Why do I feel

450
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,920
that Fang Shoumei

451
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,280
is watching me?

452
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,480
It smellsvine!

453
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,560
Really.

454
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,960
You must have thought too much.

455
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,200
Fang Shoumei has always been very concerned

456
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
about everyone's case.

457
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,400
Fang Shoumei seems to be very concerned about Qi Yue.

458
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,800
She really makes people look down upon her.

459
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,000
Fang Shoumei has been frequently coming to the Marquis of Wu'an's mansion recently.

460
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,280
But we haven't found out what happened.

461
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,720
This is indeed strange.

462
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,680
The Marquis of Wu'an has been very concerned about Qi Yue.

463
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,120
He even has a secret secret.

464
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,320
Lu Yi, continue to investigate.

465
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,960
Yes.

466
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,680
But it's not a good thing, right?

467
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,400
We have to think of a way

468
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,320
to stop the alarm

469
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,040
and not let the Marquis of Wu'an get what he wants.

470
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,800
I have an idea.

471
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,160
Fang Yue is smart, brilliant, and has a good sense of sense.

472
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,200
She has achieved countless good things and is blessed with a long life.

473
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,720
Now Princess Yi'an will marry Gao Youguo.

474
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,280
She has ordered Fang Yue to marry Gao Yue

475
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,520
and let her marry him.

476
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,680
I order Fang Yue to send Princess Yi'an off

477
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,360
and leave the city soon.

478
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,040
I will obey your order.

479
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,800
Fang Shoumei.

480
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,120
Fang Shoumei was just transferred to the capital.

481
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,760
She was sent to the palace to send Princess Yi'an off.

482
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,840
This...

483
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,440
Gao Youguo is far away from the world.

484
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,480
This is going to be a tough trip.

485
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,800
Be quiet.

486
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,920
The thunder and rain are all military graces.

487
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,000
His Majesty is fond of Fang Shoumei.

488
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,920
My fellow colleagues,

489
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,240
I will leave the city soon.

490
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,720
I hope that you can still be at my service

491
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,960
when I am not around.

492
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,680
Be sure to make beautiful clothes for me.

493
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,200
I am here to thank you.

494
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,840
May Fang Shoumei have a safe trip.

495
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,560
Fang Shoumei,

496
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,560
have you really made up your mind?

497
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,040
You are the one who is going to host the Guanmei Hall.

498
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,000
If you don't want to go,

499
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,080
there may be a chance for you to change.

500
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,920
No need.

501
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,160
I have thought about it.

502
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,240
Thank you for your concern.

503
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,040
Fang Shoumei,

504
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,880
I wish you a safe trip.

505
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,960
Have a safe trip.

506
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,520
Thank you, Zhao Meiguan and Shi Meiguan.

507
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,400
Shi Meiguan,

508
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,080
take care.

509
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,600
The thing about Princess of the Han State

510
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,840
is about to be done.

511
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,760
Why did His Majesty suddenly

512
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,960
ask Fang Yue to send the letter?

513
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,880
Please calm down, My Lord.

514
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,320
I have good news.

515
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,440
What is it?

516
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,640
My brother

517
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,360
left the capital a few days ago.

518
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,160
I sent someone to check on him.

519
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,000
Finally, I found out

520
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,240
the real identity of Lu Chi.

521
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,080
He is the owner of Mount Qianya.

522
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,280
Mount Qianya?

523
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,440
It's really good news.

524
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,680
It turns out that Mount Qianya belongs to the emperor.

525
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,240
In this way,

526
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,080
I have known

527
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,240
my brother's future plans and retreat.

528
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,640
What are you arguing with me about?

529
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,360
Please tell me

530
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,600
if you want to

531
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,120
destroy the future.

532
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,800
Cut off the future

533
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,680
and cut off the chance.

534
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,960
Send someone to

535
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,320
deploy Mount Qianya immediately.

536
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,920
Yes.

537
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,840
Do you understand?

538
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,640
Isn't this

539
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,680
a normal landscape map?

540
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,720
No.

541
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
This is Mount Qianya.

542
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,000
Mount Qianya?

543
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
Wu Anhao may have been suspicious

544
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
of my identity.

545
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,720
I'm afraid

546
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,920
Mount Qianya is not

547
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,160
the real Mount Qianya.

548
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,960
I'm afraid

549
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,160
he is not the real one.

550
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,040
I'm afraid

551
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,160
he is not the real one.

552
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,120
I'm afraid

553
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,280
he is not the real one.

554
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,240
I'm afraid

555
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,480
he is not the real one.

556
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,440
I'm afraid

557
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,800
Mount Qianya will be caught.

558
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,400
That man

559
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,920
asked us to deploy him in advance.

560
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,400
Lu Yi.

561
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,360
Send a letter to Zhu Xi.

562
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,480
Tell him to be prepared.

563
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,120
Yes.

564
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,680
Master.

565
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,480
Then

566
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,360
this painting...

567
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,280
According to the old rules,

568
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,120
the painting was sold at a high price in Xibao Pavilion.

569
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,800
Yes.

570
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,280
That's the painting.

571
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,000
I want it.

572
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,200
Boss.

573
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,960
Do you have

574
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,280
Mr. Lingyuan's painting?

575
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,080
No.

576
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,200
Thank you, boss.

577
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,280
Boss.

578
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,200
Do you have

579
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,600
Mr. Lingyuan's painting?

580
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,680
I don't have it.

581
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,280
You can go to Xibao Pavilion to have a look.

582
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,080
Boss.

583
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,080
Welcome.

584
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,360
Do you have

585
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,760
Mr. Lingyuan's new work?

586
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,800
You are late.

587
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,760
That painting

588
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,280
was sold as soon as it arrived at the shop.

589
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,560
So fast?

590
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,960
Boss.

591
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,480
Do you know the person who sent the painting?

592
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,720
Who sold Mr. Lingyuan's painting

593
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,960
to the shop?

594
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,840
It's a

595
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,360
child.

596
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,040
Child?

597
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,880
Child?

598
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,560
Child?

599
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,320
Child?

600
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,120
Child?

601
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,840
Child?

602
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,680
And

603
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,120
the person who sent Mr. Lingyuan's painting

604
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,280
is not the same person.

605
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,440
Xibao Pavilion

606
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,720
is just a auction.

607
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,320
As for the person who sent the painting

608
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,720
and the person who painted it,

609
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,440
we don't know each other well.

610
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,360
I see.

611
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,200
Sorry to bother you.

612
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,680
You are welcome.

613
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,920
I didn't expect

614
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,560
Mr. Lingyuan's

615
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,000
colleagues in the capital

616
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,120
are so many.

617
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,560
I went to buy them

618
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
some flowers.

619
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
I still missed it.

620
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,120
Give me back my bank account.

621
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,360
Give me back my bank account.

622
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,120
Give it back to me.

623
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,200
Don't blame a good person.

624
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,320
Give it back to me.

625
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,600
When I gave it back to you,

626
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,760
it was a bank account.

627
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,640
Why did it become

628
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,680
a blank paper when you got it?

629
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,720
Did you hear that?

630
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,080
He said it was a bank account.

631
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,920
Now it becomes a blank paper

632
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,960
when I got it.

633
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,520
I don't care.

634
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,200
Give me back my bank account.

635
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,440
Why does it become a blank paper?

636
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,240
Give me back my bank account.

637
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,200
Yes.

638
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,160
It's a change of rules.

639
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,760
Yes.

640
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,000
You are so kind.

641
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,200
My bank account

642
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,840
is for the money

643
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,440
for my 80-year-old mother.

644
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,680
How can I take this money

645
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,240
to do such a lie?

646
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Sir,

647
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,720
if you really get her bank account,

648
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,520
give it back to her.

649
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,120
I said I didn't take the change of rules.

650
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,000
Well,

651
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,240
let's go to the government.

652
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,840
Let's change the rules in the court.

653
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,360
Let's go.

654
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,800
What are you doing?

655
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,160
I... I won't go.

656
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,800
I... I won't go.

657
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,360
There are two entrances under the government.

658
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,520
I'm a poor

659
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,920
little citizen.

660
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,000
Can I still come out?

661
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,800
My poor 80-year-old mother.

662
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,120
Mother,

663
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,600
I'm unfilial.

664
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,320
I have no money to cure you.

665
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,760
All right.

666
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,440
If your mother is really sick,

667
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,400
you can take the money.

668
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,320
Wait.

669
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
Do you remember which bank account

670
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,760
this bank account is from?

671
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,800
It's...

672
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,480
It's from Jiao Tai Bank.

673
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,800
Good.

674
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,680
Now,

675
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,920
let's go to the government

676
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,320
to uphold justice for you.

677
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,560
We'll go to the bank account to check it.

678
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,160
Yes.

679
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,840
I... I remembered it wrong.

680
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,680
It's... It's from a foreign bank account.

681
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,600
No matter where the bank account is from,

682
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,760
it's the most appropriate way to go to the government.

683
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,600
In the ancient times,

684
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,640
even a bank account

685
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,800
was not enough to keep a baby.

686
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,040
How can you

687
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,200
forget the bank account

688
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,560
in which bank account?

689
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,840
You dare not go to the government.

690
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,880
You must be a pervert.

691
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,480
Look.

692
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,600
Look, everyone.

693
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,240
There's a fake in the middle of the white paper.

694
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,040
The bank account is drawn on it.

695
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,920
You're so young.

696
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
How can you do this?

697
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,360
Do you know

698
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,480
what's the crime of faking a bank account?

699
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,160
Give it to me.

700
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,800
Wait.

701
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,400
Thank you for helping me.

702
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,560
My surname is Huang.

703
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,480
May I ask your name?

704
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,640
You're welcome.

705
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,160
My name is Yan Qi Yue.

706
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,440
It's not easy to go out.

707
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,200
I think he's too rude.

708
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,240
I didn't help you because I didn't like it.

709
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Put away your money.

710
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,880
It's done.

711
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,960
I'll leave now.

712
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,480
Qi Yue.

713
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,880
I'm Tang Tu.

714
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,760
I want to ask you to

715
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,920
use a change of clothes to express my gratitude.

716
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,440
I just don't know what to do.

717
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,080
You don't have to be so polite.

718
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,760
No.

719
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,880
Thank you for helping me today.

720
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,600
Let's pretend to be friends.

721
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,880
Okay.

722
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,320
Let's be friends.

723
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,120
Then I'll ask you

724
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,440
to go to Xibao Pavilion to have a meal.

725
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,760
No wonder he's so mean.

726
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,480
He's so stupid.

727
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,080
He's so stupid.

728
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,800
Don't you know how much he'll spend

729
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,160
to have a meal in Xibao Pavilion?

730
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,080
Forget it.

731
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,040
Come with me.

732
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,360
Here we are.

733
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,480
This is it.

734
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,280
This is my favorite

735
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,600
noodle stall with someone.

736
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,960
Boss.

737
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,000
Two bowls of beef noodles.

738
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,560
Okay.

739
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,600
Please wait a moment.

740
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,960
This beef noodle is tender and smooth.

741
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,840
It melts in your mouth.

742
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,200
You can't eat it anywhere else.

743
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,080
I said I'd ask him to go to Xibao Pavilion.

744
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,760
But he took me to this stall.

745
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,520
He's so familiar with this place.

746
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,920
It seems that he's a normal girl

747
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,560
who knows how to solve problems.

748
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,240
Sit down.

749
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,200
Okay.

750
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,320
Then I'll have a good taste.

751
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,040
Two customers.

752
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,440
Here's your noodles.

753
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,120
Thank you.

754
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,280
Here you are.

755
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,180
Thanks.

756
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,480
긴용한 일

757
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
So much trouble.

758
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,480
When can we meet Mr. Lingyuan?

759
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,720
Xiyue.

760
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,440
Xiyue.

761
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Why don't you eat?

762
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,680
Something on your mind?

763
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,960
No.

764
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,120
Actually, if you have something on your mind,

765
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,480
you can tell me.

766
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,080
Maybe I can help you.

767
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,000
I thought about it.

768
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,080
It's complicated.

769
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,120
You can't help me.

770
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
If you don't tell me,

771
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,920
how do you know I can't help you?

772
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,520
I want to get married.

773
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,240
Get married?

774
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,680
See?

775
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,840
I told you.

776
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,240
You can't help me.

777
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,840
The person I like

778
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,040
is like a dream to me.

779
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,840
I've never seen him.

780
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,800
I don't know where he is.

781
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,880
But I like him.

782
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,640
It must be hard to understand

783
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,160
this feeling.

784
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,120
I understand.

785
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,320
Actually, the feeling of liking someone

786
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,920
is the same.

787
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,120
But I think

788
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,720
as long as you try to pursue me,

789
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,920
you won't regret it

790
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,840
even if you don't get the result.

791
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,160
You're right.

792
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,080
Mr. Huang and I are really in love.

793
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,600
Come on.

794
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,640
I'll toast you with tea and wine.

795
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm happy to know you.

796
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,600
I'm happy to know you, too.

797
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,760
It's really delicious.

798
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,600
Right?

799
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,600
This is my friend,

800
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,520
Shi Fak.

801
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,720
Ake brought it to me.

802
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,600
Have some.

803
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,600
Thank you for bringing me back.

804
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,160
You should go back and rest.

805
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,360
It should be me

806
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,800
who brought you back.

807
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm sorry.

808
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,880
I'm sorry.

809
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,920
I'm sorry.

810
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,040
I'm sorry.

811
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm sorry.

812
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,960
I'm sorry.

813
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,480
It's me who should thank Miss Qi Yue.

814
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,920
Thank you for your help.

815
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,680
You're welcome.

816
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,440
Miss Qi Yue.

817
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,440
When can we meet again?

818
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,160
We'll meet another day.

819
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,400
Okay.

820
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,680
I'll leave now.

821
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,600
Mr. Huang.

822
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,680
Let's go to the snack street together next time,

823
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,440
okay?

824
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,760
Snack street?

825
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,360
Okay.

826
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:30,920
Then...

827
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,720
It's a deal.

828
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,600
Thank you for trusting me today.

829
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,120
Please buy me life.

830
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,760
Thank you.

831
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,000
How did you know my name?

832
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,480
And how did you know my brother's name?

833
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Tell me this.

834
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,420
My brother has a veryş

835
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,240
carrying

836
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,240
a Fourier star.

837
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
It's a trap.

838
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,480
Ke, why are you still awake?

839
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,920
Today, Fang Shoumei received the imperial edict

840
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,360
to send Princess Song to another country.

841
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,160
If I want to be as good as her,

842
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,760
I have to work harder.

843
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,720
What's there to envy about sending Princess Song?

844
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,440
Have they ever asked Princess?

845
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,840
Princess is a human too.

846
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Why can't she marry the one she loves?

847
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,080
Those people are full of kindness and morality.

848
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,080
They are loyal to the country and the people.

849
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,160
They actually treat Princess as a pawn

850
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,480
and do whatever they want.

851
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,560
Wait.

852
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,000
What's wrong with you?

853
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,440
Why are you so excited?

854
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,800
Nothing.

855
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,200
Are you in a bad mood?

856
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,760
Why don't you tell me?

857
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,040
I haven't found Mr. Lin Yuan yet.

858
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,040
And I haven't even bought his new work.

859
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,840
I will help you.

860
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,240
I'm just afraid that you will be a crybaby.

861
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,280
But...

862
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,320
Have you ever had a dream?

863
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,480
Of course I have.

864
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,160
I was born in the world's number one family.

865
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,560
I thought I would be the number one too.

866
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,360
But at that time,

867
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,000
I couldn't even do one job every month.

868
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,760
I only thought about my beggar brother.

869
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,960
I wanted him to fulfill his promise and marry him.

870
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,320
But I don't even know where he is from.

871
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,200
What about now?

872
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,280
How are you now?

873
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,520
Now?

874
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,800
I have become a real beauty.

875
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,720
And I have waited for my brother.

876
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,880
Qi Yue.

877
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,000
I think I know

878
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,720
that everyone thinks it's impossible.

879
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,800
It seems that if you hold on for a while,

880
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,120
you will get the result.

881
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,360
Do you really think so?

882
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,280
Ake, you know me the best.

883
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,520
I know.

884
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,160
You won't be happy if you don't see that person.

885
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,520
Don't worry.

886
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,680
I will help you find Mr. Ling Yuan.

887
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,680
Madam,

888
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,600
can I have a good one?

889
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,720
These are all delicious.

890
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,680
This is the best.

891
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,400
This is the best.

892
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,360
Look at the limit.

893
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,800
It's so beautiful.

894
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,960
Yes.

895
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,760
It's a gift.

896
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
It's worth 40,000 yuan.

897
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,120
Do you know?

898
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,560
This is the limit.

899
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,360
I can eat it all day.

900
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,400
It's worth 90,000 yuan.

901
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,600
Okay.

902
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,560
Take care.

903
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,600
Tiantian.

904
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,480
Long time no see.

905
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,000
Why are you here?

906
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,800
Tiantian.

907
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,120
What you said

908
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,680
broke my heart.

909
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,080
We have had a marriage contract.

910
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,720
Why are you so cold to me now?

911
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,440
Zhu Yizhi.

912
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,040
Don't make noise in this direction.

913
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,840
What are you doing?

914
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,000
What are you doing?

915
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,480
Be more polite.

916
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,280
You...

917
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,480
Let go of me.

918
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,480
I came here

919
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,200
because I'm a little tight.

920
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,160
I want you to take care of my fellow.

921
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,280
You want money?

922
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:05,920
Yes.

923
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,880
You can just sit on the side of the road

924
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,000
and make a bowl.

925
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,400
Why are you here to congratulate us?

926
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,160
Let me tell you, He Ketian.

927
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,760
You are my wife.

928
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,640
The money of the He family is my money.

929
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,240
If you don't give me the money,

930
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,240
do you believe that I will

931
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,280
smash your rabbit?

932
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,560
You can't do business.

933
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,440
Stop talking nonsense.

934
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,200
Take the money.

935
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,680
Let me go.

936
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,160
You hurt me.

937
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,800
Zhu Yizhi.

938
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,120
You shameless bastard.

939
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,080
I have already asked you to give me back the money.

940
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,720
How dare you come to me?

941
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,440
You dare to push me?

942
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,320
Do you believe that I will beat you?

943
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,720
Give me the money.

944
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,960
Give me the money or not?

945
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,320
Brother.

946
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,640
Tiantian, are you okay?

947
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Bastard.

948
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,880
If you say that again, I will break my heart.

949
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,640
I will see if you can

950
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,080
get out of this trap today.

951
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,840
Smash it.

952
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,600
Yes.

953
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,200
Stop.

954
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,280
Let's go.

955
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,520
Brother.

956
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,640
Zhu Yizhi.

957
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,040
Brother.

958
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,080
Brother.

959
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,160
Are you okay?

960
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,840
Master, bad news.

961
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,280
Zhu Yizhi is very angry.

962
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,920
He is beating the shop now.

963
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,720
What?

964
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:43,960
Get out of the way.

965
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,440
Beat me, brother.

966
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,000
Get out of the way.

967
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:46,920
Tiantian.

968
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,400
Tiantian.

969
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,320
Brother.

970
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,960
Brother.

971
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,520
What's going on?

972
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,200
It's you again.

973
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,600
I have long seen

974
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,920
that you two are not in love.

975
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,040
You two must have had a private relationship

976
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,640
before you got married.

977
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

978
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,720
Brother.

979
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,560
Brother.

980
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,440
Brother, are you okay?

981
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,080
I will not let you get away with it.

982
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,080
I still have

983
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,880
the letter of resignation left by my parents.

984
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,960
I will not return the marriage.

985
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Kun Ketian.

986
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,360
I will marry you.

987
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,480
Zhu Yizhi,

988
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,720
you are a dreamer.

989
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,720
I will never marry

990
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,040
a black-hearted pig like you.

991
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,600
You.

992
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,600
Young Master.

993
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,040
Young Master.

994
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,640
If you dare step in evolve again,

995
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,600
I will let you rest along at home.

996
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,960
I don't want to come anymore.

997
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,920
I don't want to.

998
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,760
Do you still want money?

999
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,640
No more.

1000
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,440
No more.

1001
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,960
Then the relationship you have with Miss He

1002
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,640
shall be atéed by me.

1003
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,080
I don't regret it.

1004
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,680
Don't worry.

1005
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,560
I will never holidaysize now.

1006
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,480
I still want to see the world,

1007
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,120
Then what about your relationship with Miss He?

1008
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,960
I have nothing to do with her.

1009
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,160
Nothing.

1010
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
Come here.

1011
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,880
Thank you for saving me, Mr. Lu.

1012
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,360
You're welcome.

1013
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,360
Tiantian.

1014
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
Brother.

1015
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,560
Well...

1016
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,240
Brother.

1017
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:06,920
What's going on?

1018
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,760
Why are there so many people?

1019
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,840
I was so scared just now.

1020
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,400
You know what?

1021
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,760
Zhu Yi Zhi came to the store and made trouble.

1022
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,080
He insisted on asking me for money.

1023
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,600
How could I give him the money?

1024
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,320
And...

1025
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,160
I didn't expect him to hit someone.

1026
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Are you okay?

1027
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,200
I'm fine.

1028
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,800
Brother Lu.

1029
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,840
Thank you for your help today.

1030
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,280
Lu Chi.

1031
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,400
Thank you.

1032
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,000
You're welcome.

1033
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,000
He's a good guy.

1034
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,120
He's capable of protecting Ake Zhou.

1035
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,720
Brother Lu.

1036
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,440
You're really a good boy.

1037
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,680
I'm fine.

1038
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,880
You're not hurt, are you?

1039
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:45,760
No.

1040
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,600
My hair is messy.

1041
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,240
It's okay.

1042
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,000
Are you really okay?

1043
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm really okay.

1044
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,600
Let me see.

1045
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,560
Look.

1046
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,480
It's good that you're okay.

1047
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,480
Brother Lu.

1048
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,480
I'll give you some money.

1049
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,480
It's okay.

1050
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,320
I'll help you.

1051
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,560
Brother Lu.

Thank you for today.

1053
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,840
If it weren't for you,

1054
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,360
I don't know what would happen to Tiantian.

1055
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,080
Brother Xian's shop...

1056
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,920
Ake.

1057
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,440
You're always so polite to me.

1058
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,880
Your family is my family.

1059
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,240
Your friend is my friend.

1060
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,480
It's all my duty.

1061
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Thank you, Brother Lu.

1062
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,220
She sn Çünkü.

1063
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,300
Really?

1064
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,160
Got to be her friend.

1065
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,300
It's possible to catch you if she كان happen to be Tiantian's friend.

1066
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,900
They all will get What?

1067
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,460
Okay.

1068
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,300
I have good terms with her.

1069
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,320
I'll go with her later.

1070
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,100
She won't suspect me any more.

1071
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,700
What?

1072
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,280
You're said to have got him.

1073
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,020
Hu Ji evaluation?

1074
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,100
Really?

1075
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,480
Let's go first and think about it.

1076
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,220
This could just be a trap.

1077
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,060
I want to see you

00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,060

Every day of困頓

1081
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,340
But I never forget the first time

1082
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,340
I saw you

1083
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,940
Even if this love has no star, no sound, no day, no night

1084
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,940
It doesn't matter this wind and moon

1085
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,100
As long as you never stop

1086
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,380

I'm willing to protect you with my life

1090
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:05,340
Even if I can't look at you like the sky

1091
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,340

I don't care about the past

1096
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:28,460
Please remember the youth that was once so bright

1097
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:37,660
From now on, I don't want to part with you
