1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Graduated

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The flowers are in the branches.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The strange years.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm worried.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Some people

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you want to repay

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But there is no way to do it.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A lifetime of love

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is the best way.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The end

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The guard is awake.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The guard is awake.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My wife is pregnant.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My wife is pregnant.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm here to thank you.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Madam Xu is very affectionate.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm just trying to persuade you.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How dare you attack me?

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're modest, aren't you?

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The peach tree is called the world's first.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The peach tree is called the world's first.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's the marriage of my husband and his wife.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now you're young.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's not going to be his glory.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's the world's first.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In a few days

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You will inherit the glory of the world's first.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is what we should do.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Madam Xu, you're right.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The marriage of adults

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Is the duty of the official media?

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Deng Mei Guan

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
At that time, he tried to persuade me to divorce.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It can be seen that the official media

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Not everyone hopes that my husband and wife will get along.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Misunderstanding

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
After that, I immediately sent out

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Shi Mei Guan to be in the middle of the court.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm kind of

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In the end

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Madam Xu

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then I'll take this banner.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What you deserve.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You go ahead. I'll go first.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you, Madam Xu.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you, Madam Xu.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ke

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So great, Ke

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, no

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's all the honor of Madam Xu.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What are you doing?

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I see you people

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There is no rule.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Always in the official media

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's so embarrassing.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Such a big banner, hurry up and put it in the warehouse.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
go

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Fierce

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What is this?

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Must be a lot of money

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come come come

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Shi Mei Guan is here

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We are all here to invite the world's first beauty

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Say kiss

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I want to invite you to be a beauty

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Tell us the truth

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Everyone

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Wait, thank you all

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can go to the official media

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
At that time, I will visit you one by one.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Must help everyone get a good distance

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Great

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Shi Mei Guan, give me a kiss

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm here first

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Give me a kiss

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't go

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't go

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Give me a kiss

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't go

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let me go

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let me go

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Shi Mei Guan, let me kiss you

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Shi Mei Guan

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Shi Mei Guan

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm here, I'm here

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Shi Mei Guan

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Shi Mei Guan

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Shi Mei Guan

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Shi Mei Guan

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Shi Mei Guan

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Shi Mei Guan

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Shi Mei Guan

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Shi Mei Guan

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Shi Mei Guan

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Shi Mei Guan

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Shi Mei Guan

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Shi Mei Guan

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Shi Mei Guan

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Shi Mei Guan

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:42,060
This is a

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will definitely surrender to you.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You are so wise.

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,600
You are so wise.

121
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Why are you still kneeling?

122
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
Go and get Lu Shi out of the city.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,600
Yes.

124
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,400
Get lost.

125
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,400
Chief,

126
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,000
I will send Manager Hua and Childe Li out of the city.

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,400
I won't thank you.

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
I won't disturb you.

129
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,000
Take care, Chief Lu.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,400
Take care, Junior Sister.

131
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I wish you two a happy marriage.

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's grow old together.

133
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,400
Manager Hua, you are late.

134
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Manager Hua,

135
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600
you misunderstood.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,400
I am from the past.

137
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,000
I won't be wrong.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,800
I am a lady.

139
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,200
I am a good match.

140
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Lu Yu.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Lu Yu

142
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,000
Ke,

143
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,600
just now I...

144
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Brother Lu,

145
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,000
I know you were careless.

146
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
I was careless,

147
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,600
but I did it on purpose.

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Brother Lu,

149
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
let's pretend nothing happened.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,600
You will marry me in the future.

151
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,800
Ke.

152
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,600
Ke,

153
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,200
today you...

154
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Brother Lu,

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
you are thinking too much.

156
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
Actually, I have a marriage agreement long ago.

157
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,800
You have your little sister.

158
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
We should keep our etiquette

159
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,200
and not be too strict.

160
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Marriage agreement?

161
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
Who did you have a marriage agreement with?

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Brother Lu,

163
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,000
I didn't make it clear to you.

164
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I think

165
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
you should find your little sister as soon as possible.

166
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,200
Mo Yuan,

167
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,400
can I help you find out her whereabouts?

168
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
I will go back first.

169
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,800
Go.

170
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,400
Brother Lu.

171
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,200
Ke, Ke,

172
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,800
they will come to save us soon.

173
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,400
Brother Lu,

174
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
are you okay?

175
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,600
Brother Lu, hang in there.

176
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,400
Hurry.

177
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,400
Brother Lu.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Brother Lu.

179
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,000
Brother Lu, don't be scared.

180
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,200
Brother Lu, don't scare me.

181
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
I am late.

182
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
Please forgive me.

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,600
Oh no,

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Ke is poisoned.

185
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Lady Shi,

186
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
don't worry too much.

187
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,800
Although the knife was poisoned,

188
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
our Master has a deep power.

189
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
After a rest, he will...

190
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
With our Master's martial arts,

191
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
he should be able to avoid it.

192
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,200
It's really strange.

193
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,800
It's all because of me.

194
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Pan'er,

195
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,800
I am sorry.

196
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I am sorry.

197
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,200
Sister,

198
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,800
tell me the truth.

199
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Will Brother Lu be okay?

200
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,600
When I saw Lu Yin,

201
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,400
when I saw his wound,

202
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
his face changed.

203
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,800
Being poisoned is a big deal.

204
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Especially today,

205
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
it's very important.

206
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,600
You can't leave anyone for a moment.

207
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Lady Shi Jiang,

208
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
you must take good care of our Master.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Brother Lu,

210
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I am sorry.

211
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
I didn't know

212
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,200
I would meet you when I grow up.

213
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
But I have promised you

214
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,400
I won't bother you.

215
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
It's all my fault.

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,200
I have always caused you to be hurt.

217
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
I hope that God will help me

218
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
and keep Brother Lu happy.

219
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
As long as Brother Lu is well,

220
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I will

221
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
never leave you.

222
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Brother,

223
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Eun possibile

224
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Is that person so important to you?

225
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
My Lord.

226
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
My Lord.

227
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
My Lord.

228
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
My Lord.

229
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Please wait, My Lord.

230
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
My Lord.

231
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Are you here to wait for me?

232
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Can I have a word with you?

233
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I have something to discuss with you.

234
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
What is it?

235
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
My Lord, you can talk here.

236
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I have been very busy in my life.

237
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I have never had the chance to talk to you.

238
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Okay.

239
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
If so,

240
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I will not talk to you.

241
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
My Lord, you know that

242
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
since my wife died of illness,

243
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
the position of the head of the family has been vacant.

244
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,200
No one has been in charge of the matter of loyalty and guilt.

245
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,200
I feel very lonely.

246
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
You are too much.

247
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
My Lord is a Marquis of Wu'an.

248
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
The Guanmei Hall is so full of Marquis.

249
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,200
It shows that the person in charge is doing something wrong.

250
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
The Guanmei Hall is indeed not like the words.

251
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
My Lord,

252
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I will report this matter to His Majesty tomorrow.

253
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
My Lord, please wait.

254
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
You may have misunderstood me.

255
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
My Lord,

256
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,200
I happen to have a book that I have not yet married.

257
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I am sincerely seeking for it.

258
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I hope that you and I can get married forever.

259
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,200
My granddaughter has been fond of reading since childhood.

260
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
She is different from the family.

261
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Thank you for your kindness.

262
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Unfortunately, my daughter is not a good match for you.

263
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Goodbye.

264
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Goodbye.

265
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
This old man.

266
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,200
He is not even drinking.

267
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Tang!

268
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Tang!

269
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Get up!

270
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
It's time for you to light the candles.

271
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Tang!

272
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
What time is it now?

273
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,200
It's past the hour of the morning. Hurry!

274
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Tang!

275
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Tang!

276
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Tang!

277
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Tang!

278
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Is there any news from the Xibao Pavilion?

279
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Is there any news from Brother Lu?

280
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
No, there is no news. It's good news.

281
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
You are right.

282
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Anyway, we haven't heard from the wedding yet.

283
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
You...

284
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
What are you talking about?

285
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I remember when I left yesterday,

286
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Sister Tan'er said Brother Lu was dead.

287
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Didn't Sister Tan'er say that

288
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
no news is good news?

289
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,200
The Xibao Pavilion hasn't heard from the wedding yet.

290
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,200
That means Brother Lu is still alive.

291
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Learn to talk.

292
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Since Sister Tan'er hates me for not talking,

293
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
then go to the Xibao Pavilion to get news yourself.

294
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Everyone has the right to go.

295
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Even I don't have the right to go.

296
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Why am I so sad?

297
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Didn't I do a lot of things before?

298
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Why am I so sad now? I don't want to do anything.

299
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Master, the poison on your body

300
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
should have been cleaned up long ago.

301
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Why does your face still look so bad?

302
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Master,

303
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
do you want me to get another doctor to check on you?

304
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
I don't need you to say a few words.

305
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Master.

306
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Master, the guard at the door of the Shi family reported

307
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
that the young lady of the Shi family went out late today.

308
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
She just went to the Pavilion.

309
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Then...

310
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Master.

311
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Lu Yi.

312
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm here.

313
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
If Marquis Wu An doesn't take any action,

314
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
he will definitely do it again.

315
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
I'm worried about only one person watching over the Shi family.

316
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Bring a few more people to follow up.

317
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Shi Mei Guan.

318
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
I'll be there to protect her at any time.

319
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
But Master, you also need to protect me.

320
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Then you do it, okay?

321
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
I'll do it?

322
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
This...

323
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
isn't good, right?

324
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
If it's not good, then go.

325
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Listen to your Master.

326
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Yes.

327
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
So stupid.

328
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Master,

329
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,200
aren't you going to see the young lady of the Shi family?

330
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Let's see what Marquis Wu An does first.

331
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
We can't get Yage involved again.

332
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Everyone is here.

333
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I have something to say today.

334
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Ever since I became the Chief Mei,

335
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,200
all of you have no interest in music.

336
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
You play around and play around all day.

337
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
You're always busy with work.

338
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
So the Chief Mei is very dissatisfied with the Pavilion.

339
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
As the Chief Mei,

340
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
if I don't make any mistakes,

341
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
it's a shame for my position.

342
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
The flowers are going to be held this month.

343
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,200
From start to finish, I'm the only one who's in charge.

344
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Until now,

345
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
have you made any action?

346
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
So,

347
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
I've decided to

348
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
deduct all of your salary this month.

349
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
What?

350
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
The Chief Mei is well-known.

351
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
All of you are diligent.

352
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
You don't have any work to do.

353
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Are you the Chief Mei or am I?

354
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
I have my own decision.

355
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
I said to deduct the salary.

356
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
That's deducting the salary.

357
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
You...

358
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
You think I'm going to take your money?

359
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
You think I'm going to take your salary

360
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
and keep it for free?

361
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
You should know that

362
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,200
the money needed for the Pavilion is very large.

363
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
But until now,

364
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
we haven't collected enough money.

365
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
So,

366
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,200
your salary, including mine,

367
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
is all for the Pavilion's grand opening.

368
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Chief Mei,

369
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
without salary,

370
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
how can we support our family?

371
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
How can we do our job well?

372
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
When my mother was in charge of the Pavilion,

373
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
all the businessmen were the chief chefs.

374
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Yes.

375
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
As the Chief Mei,

376
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
shouldn't we find a way to collect money?

377
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Even if we can't,

378
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
we shouldn't deduct our salary.

379
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Yes.

380
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
We don't have much money.

381
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Shi Fak,

382
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
since you care about your colleagues,

383
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
I'll give you a chance.

384
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
There are still some days left before the meeting.

385
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
You'd better find some money

386
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
or move some money from your home

387
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,200
to meet the demand of your colleagues.

388
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Then I won't deduct the salary of my colleagues.

389
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Okay.

390
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
It's a deal.

391
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Chief Shi.

392
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Chief Shi.

393
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Here, I'll give you a stamp.

394
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Chief Deng has been here.

395
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
I've given him what he should have.

396
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Boss,

397
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
would you consider

398
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
my mother's participation

399
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
in the Pavilion?

400
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
It's not the end.

401
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,200
If Tao's Pavilion is hosting the meeting,

402
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
I can add some more.

403
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
But now,

404
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I'm not willing to do so.

405
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
But I've given the money.

406
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
So I can't add any more.

407
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Boss,

408
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
I...

409
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Shi Fak,

410
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
please go to the other house.

411
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
I won't see you off.

412
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
What should we do?

413
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Sorry.

414
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Shi Fak,

415
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
I can only give you this much.

416
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Thank you, boss.

417
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Ke.

418
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Ke, you're back.

419
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Brother.

420
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Give me the money.

421
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Hurry up.

422
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Give me the money.

423
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Here.

424
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
What do you want to buy?

425
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Is it enough?

426
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
It's not enough.

427
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
But thank you, brothers.

428
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
It's the time of the meeting again.

429
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,200
When I wanted to host the meeting,

430
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
it was a great success.

431
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Now,

432
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
the Pavilion is always

433
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
holding the new title.

434
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
It's a great success

435
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
that ruined my mother's reputation.

436
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Ke,

437
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
why are you in a daze?

438
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Mother,

439
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm just thinking

440
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
that I've been fine recently.

441
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Now that the Pavilion is holding the new title,

442
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
you should be busy, too.

443
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
I...

444
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm fine.

445
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
I'm a little tired.

446
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
I'll go back to my room.

447
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Take care of yourself.

448
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Mother,

449
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
you look so pale.

450
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
It must be because of the meeting.

451
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Since Mother couldn't go back to the media,

452
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
she has been depressed and depressed.

453
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Now the Pavilion is holding the new title.

454
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
She must be more sad.

455
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
I'm sorry.

456
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I'm sorry.

457
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
I'm sorry.

458
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I'm sorry.

459
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I'm sorry.

460
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
I'm sorry.

461
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
I'm sorry.

462
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
I'm sorry.

463
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I'm sorry.

464
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
I'm sorry.

465
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
I'm sorry.

466
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
I picked up the flower

467
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
at the white-blossom meeting

468
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
with Mother

469
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
when I was a kid.

470
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
The White-Blossom Meeting

471
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
used to be full of fun

472
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
and fun.

473
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Everyone was looking forward to it.

474
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,480
so many ladies

475
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,240
will wear the best clothes

476
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,520
and have fun.

477
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,800
Mother has put so much effort

478
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,520
for the Baihua Society.

479
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,520
She always comes home

480
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,200
very late before and after the Baihua Society.

481
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
But this year,

482
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,400
she suddenly can't be busy

483
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,680
with the Baihua Society anymore.

484
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,400
She must be very disappointed.

485
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,200
How can I make

486
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,840
Mother happy?

487
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,320
Yes, that's it.

488
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,120
I must hold the Baihua Society.

489
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,760
But the Baihua Society

490
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,200
is always run by the media.

491
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,160
How can I get

492
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,680
the rights of the Baihua Society?

493
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,080
How about

494
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,600
discussing it with Brother Lu?

495
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,040
No.

496
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,520
I said I wouldn't see you.

497
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,800
I'll figure it out myself.

498
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,640
Thank you.

499
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,240
Thank you.

500
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,760
Thank you.

501
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,440
Thank you.

502
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,240
Thank you.

503
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,760
Thank you.

504
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,480
Thank you.

505
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,200
Thank you.

506
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,040
Thank you.

507
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,680
Thank you.

508
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,400
Thank you.

509
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,240
Thank you.

510
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,960
Thank you.

511
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,680
Boss,

512
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,720
I want to ask you

513
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,120
if the Baihua Society

514
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,560
is still run by our Shi family,

515
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,880
would you like to

516
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,920
pay some money?

517
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
If it's still run by your family,

518
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,040
I'd like to pay

519
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,320
100 taels of silver.

520
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,520
It's a good deal.

521
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,720
Thank you, boss.

522
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
For the sake of Tao Xiaomei,

523
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,600
I'd like to pay

524
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,680
80 taels of silver.

525
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,440
I've been to all the shops

526
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,520
that make money in the capital.

527
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,360
I've only got hundreds of taels.

528
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,080
It's enough to pay off my colleagues' salary.

529
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,040
It's still not enough to get

530
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
the rights of the Baihua Society.

531
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,160
Which shops

532
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,360
haven't I been to?

533
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,800
Miss Lu, you should come here often.

534
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,920
Take care.

535
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,160
It's me.

536
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,320
Miss,

537
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,120
why don't you come in and have a seat?

538
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,400
Sister Pan'er,

539
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,000
I just passed by.

540
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,600
I...

541
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,640
You're here.

542
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,200
Why don't you go in and have a cup of tea

543
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,360
and take a break?

544
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,040
Our Chief is not here.

545
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,280
I happen to have time

546
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,080
to show you our new goods.

547
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,680
You can help me evaluate

548
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,880
if they're easy to sell.

549
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,400
All right, let's go.

550
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,480
Come in.

551
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,840
What have you been busy with recently?

552
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,360
Nothing.

553
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,000
I've been walking around

554
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,960
the shops nearby.

555
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,320
Miss,

556
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
have you been short of money recently?

557
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,640
No, no, no.

558
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,880
I'm not short of money.

559
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,160
I'm just looking for

560
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,600
the money for the Baihua Society.

561
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,600
I'm not short of money.

562
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,560
The Baihua Society?

563
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,080
That's a good thing.

564
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,520
The Taoist Mei used to run it.

565
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
We, the Xibao Pavilion,

566
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,280
always need to pay some money.

567
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,200
First,

568
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,720
the Taoist Mei is a good person.

569
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,560
Second,

570
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,680
thank you for visiting us often.

571
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,040
Miss,

572
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,200
how much money do you need this year?

573
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,320
Just tell me.

574
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,840
Sister Pan'er,

575
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,840
I'm really not here for money.

576
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,640
I...

577
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,600
What's the matter

578
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,160
with you?

579
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,480
I...

580
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,720
I want to host

581
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,600
the Baihua Society on behalf of my mother

582
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,120
to make her happy.

583
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,760
Sister Pan'er,

584
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,960
I have something to do.

585
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,200
I'll leave now.

586
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Miss Shi.

587
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,920
Master,

588
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,320
Miss Shi has a problem.

589
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,760
How should we help her?

590
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,160
Transfer all the money

591
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,200
we've received to the bank

592
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,160
and ask her to pay it back.

593
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,680
Besides,

594
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,400
ask Lu Yi to follow Miss Shi

595
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
to report to her

596
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,960
if she has any problems.

597
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,960
But

598
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,520
don't let her find out.

599
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,680
Yes.

600
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,520
I heard that their cakes are delicious.

601
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,320
Really?

602
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,880
You haven't tried it?

603
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,880
Try it.

604
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,160
I'll try it.

605
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,360
Is Tiantian still angry with me?

606
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,920
Forget it.

607
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,400
Let Brother Yi ask about it first.

608
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,480
Brother.

609
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Help me to wrap it up.

610
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,480
Okay.

611
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,800
Wait a moment.

612
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,320
Don't bother Brother Yi.

613
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,120
I'm not that petty.

614
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Let's go.

615
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,120
Is there enough tea?

616
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,520
Yes.

617
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,800
Brother.

618
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,720
Ke.

619
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
It's been a long time.

620
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,920
I'm afraid that Tiantian is still angry with me.

621
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,080
I'm not that petty.

622
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,920
I'm the mean one

623
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,880
who took Tiantian's father away.

624
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,960
It's my fault.

625
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,040
Then I'll forgive you

626
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,680
as much as I can.

627
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,920
By the way,

628
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,800
I heard that you're collecting money recently.

629
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,320
Why didn't you come to me?

630
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,280
It's my own business.

631
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,120
I don't want to bother you.

632
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,880
You're kind.

633
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,320
Ke, what are you talking about?

634
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We're like a family.

635
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,840
You can tell me if you need anything.

636
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,320
If you don't come to me,

637
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,560
we'll be angry.

638
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,640
It's the White Flower Society?

639
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,400
Don't worry.

640
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,880
I'll do it on time.

641
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,160
I'll give you a slap.

642
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,040
But I have no money to pay.

643
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,720
I'll give you a slap.

644
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,600
Forget it.

645
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,000
We don't have much money anyway.

646
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,520
Let's just buy it.

647
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,680
Don't worry, Ke.

648
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Tiantian said so.

649
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,840
There won't be any problem.

650
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,120
But it's still not enough.

651
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,800
Why is it not enough?

652
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,920
Then,

653
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,480
did you ask your Master Lu?

654
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,480
No.

655
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,280
It's not convenient.

656
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,680
Ke,

657
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
remember that we're a family.

658
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,840
Just tell me if you need anything.

659
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,760
No.

660
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,080
The White Flower Society needs too much money.

661
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,160
Even if you give me,

662
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,400
it's still not enough.

663
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,560
But the money for the preparation

664
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
should be more important.

665
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,160
Because this time,

666
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,880
I want to hold the White Flower Society for my mother.

667
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,960
So I need enough money

668
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,360
to have a chance.

669
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,000
Besides having enough money,

670
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,920
the White Flower Society

671
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,600
has always been run by the Chief Mei.

672
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,520
But you...

673
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,680
I know.

674
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,760
I'll go back to the Guanmei Hall first.

675
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,040
Ke.

676
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,880
Ke.

677
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,960
Go to the West Treasures Office.

678
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,320
You went to the West Treasures Office?

679
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,920
How did you know?

680
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,720
Chief Lu is here.

681
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,240
He's talking with Chief Mei.

682
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,280
Who else can it be if it's not you?

683
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,280
Why did Brother Lu suddenly come to the Guanmei Hall?

684
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,920
He even talked with Chief Mei so much.

685
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,960
Chief Mei,

686
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,320
how much money does the White Flower Society need?

687
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,360
How much is left in the Guanmei Hall?

688
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,240
It needs 20,000 taels.

689
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,960
There's almost 18,000 taels of empty space.

690
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,480
I'll give you 10,000 taels.

691
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,320
Money?

692
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,760
Brother Lu, this is...

693
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,160
Are you serious?

694
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,120
I'll keep my word.

695
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,120
I'll do whatever I can.

696
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,320
But I have a small request.

697
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,560
Since you're so generous,

698
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,040
please tell me what you want.

699
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,280
I heard that the White Flower Society is almost the same every year.

700
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,960
Since I'm giving out money this year,

701
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,640
I want to make some new patterns.

702
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,040
What do you mean?

703
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,360
It's a written meaning.

704
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,520
I want to spend money to buy a favorite.

705
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,680
The one who can do it will know it.

706
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,960
The person who chooses the organizer of the White Flower Society

707
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,720
will be chosen by the winner.

708
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,200
Brother Lu is clearly helping me.

709
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,000
But Chief Lu, you should know that

710
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,880
the White Flower Society

711
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,480
is always organized by hand.

712
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,640
Chief Lu,

713
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,600
it's not proper to do so.

714
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,960
Moreover,

715
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,640
which one of you

716
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,760
would like to compete with me?

717
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Since it's like this,

718
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,480
forget it.

719
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,040
Who said I don't want to?

720
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,520
I do.

721
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,360
Chief Lu, please wait.

722
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,560
Since you're so generous,

723
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,800
we can have a long discussion.

724
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,080
Okay.

725
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,560
Let's have a competition.

726
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,560
Brother Xian, why are you here?

727
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,240
Well,

728
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,200
you look down every day.

729
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,040
So I brought some snacks to cheer you up.

730
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,600
Brother Xian,

731
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,400
I'm glad to have you and Tian Tian.

732
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
How's it going?

733
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,520
How sure are you that I can win

734
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,600
the Dengmei Hall if I want to organize the White Flower Society?

735
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,120
I don't know.

736
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,720
But if Ke'er wants to organize the White Flower Society,

737
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,160
I'll do my best to help you

738
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,880
and help you achieve your dream.

739
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,880
Besides,

740
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,040
you'll be able to do well

741
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,080
if you get the Taoist God's Boat.

742
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,320
You're right.

743
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,720
I'm my mother's daughter.

744
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,960
I can do it.

745
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,560
Brother Xian, I'll take this.

746
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,720
I'll prepare it well.

747
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:44,720
Okay.

748
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
It's been a long time.

749
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,800
What's going on?

750
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,120
Today, I'm here with you

751
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,720
to organize the White Flower Society.

752
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,480
Of course, we can't spend the money for nothing.

753
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,720
We have to listen to your high-level advice.

754
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,400
Let's see if you're willing to spend the money.

755
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,960
How much money do you want to spend?

756
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,640
Who do you want to spend the money on?

757
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,360
So, let's start.

758
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,280
Who wants to go first?

759
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,560
Shi Fak, you go first.

760
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,760
I'll go first.

761
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,680
You go first.

762
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,560
I'll go first.

763
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,520
You go first.

764
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,360
I'll go first.

765
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,120
You go first.

766
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,000
You go first.

767
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,280
Or I'll be bullied.

768
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,680
Everyone,

769
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,520
if I can do this,

770
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,120
I can do it for the official media

771
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
and the officials.

772
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,040
I can use this opportunity to get the public.

773
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,760
I can see the name of the nobility

774
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,320
at the White Flower Society.

775
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,680
No one can know it without a fight.

776
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,720
What's good is good.

777
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,960
It's not enough to have a lot of names.

778
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,720
At that time, everyone's shops

779
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,120
can also enter the first-time list

780
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,560
of purchases in the official media.

781
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,840
What is the first-time list?

782
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,520
Yes.

783
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,400
When the official media wants to buy the wedding dowry,

784
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,560
it naturally requires cooperation with the business

785
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,400
that is paid first.

786
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,840
So, it's a lot of business.

787
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,720
If the junior official is in charge,

788
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
we are happy to take out a year's shop flow

789
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,400
to support the White Flower Society.

790
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,400
A year's flow?

791
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,680
It's a lot of money.

792
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,800
There's not so much cash.

793
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,520
We are in the middle of a branch.

794
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,720
The dream of the senior official

795
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,920
can be realized in the future.

796
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,880
It's not too close.

797
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,000
I am the manager of He Ji.

798
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,200
I don't allow you to take such a big risk.

799
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:43,920
Tian Tian.

800
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,400
If the junior official is in charge,

801
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,400
He Ji is willing to take out a year's flow of 1,500 taels.

802
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,320
Tian Tian.

803
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,080
If He Ji is willing to pay 1,500 taels,

804
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,720
He Ji will be the first wedding gift

805
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,080
cooperation shop selected by the official media.

806
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,400
When the time comes,

807
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,000
all the snacks needed by the official media

808
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,240
will be purchased by He Ji.

809
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Good.

810
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,480
Good.

811
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,800
Good.

812
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,480
Good.

813
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,760
Good.

814
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,800
Also,

815
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,280
the most people who pay the most

816
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,640
will be awarded the title of the most expensive.

817
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,440
For example,

818
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,600
if Xi Bao Ge pays the most,

819
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,280
the flowers show

820
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,200
will be called the Xibao Flower Show.

821
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,240
And there is only one chance.

822
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,880
Shi Fang Ge.

823
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,880
Why do you have to please Chief Lu so much?

824
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,200
Don't forget.

825
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,720
I am the one who is the winner.

826
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,360
I can do what you said.

827
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,280
So you should tell us

828
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,840
your plan for the flowers show.

829
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,160
The flowers show is held every year.

830
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,760
If it's still the same as before,

831
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,680
it's boring to look at each other

832
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,600
before marriage.

833
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So this time,

834
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,800
we have to make some changes.

835
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,200
What does the official media want to do?

836
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,600
What changes can there be?

837
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,360
What else is there to say?

838
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,440
Let's hear it.

839
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,360
Please look.

840
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,480
At the flowers show,

841
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,120
every young lady

842
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,880
will have a

843
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,440
life-changing lantern.

844
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,760
Then every young man

845
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,520
will come on stage to show himself.

846
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,680
The young lady can understand

847
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
the young man's talents,

848
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,560
hobbies,

849
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,600
and behavior.

850
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,600
Then she can decide whether to keep the lantern or not.

851
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,440
If she keeps the lantern, she likes it.

852
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,320
If she turns it off, she doesn't like it.

853
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,800
The young lady can

854
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,880
talk to the young man in person.

855
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,200
What if

856
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,760
there are many young ladies

857
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,360
who like the same young man?

858
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,520
What will they think?

859
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,200
Yes.

860
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,840
Then let the young man choose one person

861
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,080
and ask her some questions.

862
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,560
Then they can decide who they want to talk to.

863
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,040
This is ridiculous.

864
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,840
Men and women are in love with each other.

865
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,640
And they meet each other in private.

866
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
This is ridiculous.

867
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,120
It's none of your business.

868
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,120
I think it's a good idea to keep it out.

869
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,720
In such a delicate half-man,

870
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,440
which young man and young lady

871
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,520
will not like it?

872
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,880
And

873
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,760
I also designed some games

874
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,880
that can provide more choices

875
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,160
for those who don't want to get married.

876
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,120
Make the flowers show a grand show.

877
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,520
It's more lively and more people can avoid money.

878
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,760
How can you be so naughty and silly

879
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,320
with such a game?

880
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,960
What about the preparation of the lantern show?

881
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,800
Why don't you tell us?

882
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,400
For me,

883
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,520
marriage is the life of parents.

884
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,640
I think this time the flower show

885
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,640
must invite parents

886
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,280
or elders to attend.

887
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
Parents are in the factory.

888
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,000
How can two people be free to look at each other?

889
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,160
After all, it's the marriage of young people.

890
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,200
Of course, it's the most important thing to have your own hospital.

891
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,560
Make your own decision?

892
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,520
I want to ask you.

893
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
Even if young men and women

894
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,200
like each other,

895
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,160
what about it?

896
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
They are not qualified to set a marriage contract.

897
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,280
It must be the parents who make the show.

898
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,600
The officials who didn't listen are also there.

899
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,880
That's the way to follow the orders of parents

900
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,040
and the words of the plum tree.

901
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,400
This is the one and only.

902
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,360
Don't you understand?

903
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,360
Am I right?

904
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,400
Yes.

905
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,640
What the plum tree said makes sense.

906
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,360
Yes.

907
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,200
Yes.

908
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,560
Although the idea is good,

909
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,800
it makes sense.

910
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,360
Yes.

911
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,400
It's a good idea.

912
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:16,880
Yes.

913
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,920
Why do you have to find the parents

914
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,840
for the marriage of young men and women?

915
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,600
What did you say?

916
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,440
Both sides are right.

917
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,920
How about

918
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,600
the boss of the factory

919
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,600
to vote?

920
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,600
Lu Chi.

921
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,920
It's clear that Ake's design is more interesting.

922
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,560
But you still have to vote to make it difficult for him.

923
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,440
Even if you and Ake are just strangers,

924
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,000
you should speak with conscience.

925
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,480
I just speak for the truth.

926
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,520
And the minority obeys the majority.

927
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
It won't be wrong.

928
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,120
You have a point.

929
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,320
It's good that Deng Meiguan agrees with me.

930
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,120
Mr. Xian.

931
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,240
Forget it.

932
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,920
Don't make it difficult for him.

933
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,600
He makes sense.

934
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,680
Since you both have no objection,

935
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,400
Mr. Li, get ready.

936
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,280
The bosses of the factory

937
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,760
please choose the host and the number of the numbers

938
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,200
of the wedding.

939
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,000
The number of the numbers will decide the number of votes.

940
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,360
The number of votes

941
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,200
will decide the host of the wedding.

942
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Mr. Shi.

943
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,800
You are really a smart person.

944
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,360
He is right.

945
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,520
