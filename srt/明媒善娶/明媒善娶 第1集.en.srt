00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,800
I want this painting.

170
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,180
I'm determined to get it.
Having Equal Status in Marriage.

171
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,490
You like this painting?

172
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,620
Of course, I like it.

173
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,660
Look, the theme of this painting

174
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,470
fits my profession.

175
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,430
As a matchmaker,

176
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,270
our primary goal
is for the couples we bring together

177
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,010
to love each other
and have equal status in their marriages.

178
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,900
My goodness.

179
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,550
Could it be that Mr. Lin Yuan
and I are in sync?

180
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,230
This is obviously a painting for me.

181
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,450
Pan'er, name a price.

182
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,980
I'll take this painting.

183
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,730
He Ketian.

184
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,460
You know I like this painting.

185
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,520
Why are you trying to compete with me?

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,590
Can it be sold?

187
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,940
Painting is meant to be appreciated.

188
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,080
Of course,
it can be sold to the fated one.

189
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,140
200 taels at least.

190
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,430
300 taels.

191
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,560
500 taels.

192
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,230
500 taels?

193
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,920
What? You want to buy the painting too?

194
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,090
Although Mr. Lin Yuan's
paintings are rare,

195
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,840
if you increase the price
to acquire one simply due to his fame,

196
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,800
young ladies,

197
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,630
you're being too impulsive.

198
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,230
You don't even know
what I'm going to do with it.

199
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,980
You only know how to cause trouble for me.

200
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,630
If no one increases the price,

201
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,470
I'll...

202
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,610
800 taels.

203
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,580
I'll pay in cash. I won't delay it.

204
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,430
Ms. Li.

205
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,600
She hasn't completed
any matchmaking cases this month.

206
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
She won't be able to pay any cash.

207
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,760
Let me do it.

208
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,720
He Ketian, are you bullying me
because I don't have cash?

209
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,780
Shi Fa'ke, you'll piss me off one day.

210
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,550
Pan'er.

211
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,980
Let's go settle the bill.

212
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,650
Okay.

213
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,630
My painting.

214
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,800
Miss, is there anything else?

215
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,220
I do have something urgent.

216
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,350
Although I lost my beloved painting,

217
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,370
I can't lose the one who can help me.

218
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,530
What do you mean?

219
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,580
Young Master, you look unfamiliar.

220
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,240
I know most of the young masters

221
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,670
in the capital.

222
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,690
But I have never seen you.

223
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,840
I just arrived in the capital today.

224
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,160
You just arrived?

225
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,310
That's great.

226
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,320
Young Master, which family are you
considering for a marriage alliance?

227
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,910
We just met today.

228
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,750
We are not close enough
to talk about matchmaking.

229
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,080
If I want to get married,

230
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,550
I will go visit
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

231
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,270
I have something personal to do.

232
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,670
Allow me to take my leave.

233
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,180
Young Master, wait.

234
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,200
You seemed to be here for Mr. Lin Yuan.

235
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,950
But why didn't you
participate when my friend and I

236
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,230
were competing just now?

237
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,790
A gentleman won't take what others love.

238
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,920
Since you liked that painting so much,

239
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,290
I couldn't just take it for myself.

240
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,370
I...

241
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,950
It seems that he
has no money to buy the painting.

242
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,000
But he's full of excuses,
saying he couldn't act unilaterally.

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,390
I didn't expect
that with his outstanding looks,

244
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,220
he's so vain and proud.

245
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,650
Wait.

246
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,690
He just said he's going to visit
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

247
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,680
It seems that he
really wants to get married.

248
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,830
I will win him over today.

249
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,090
Wait.

250
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,260
Miss, what do you want?

251
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,860
Your forehead is reddish.

252
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,600
Your eyes are filled with affection.

253
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,000
I guess you're
inviting guests to a dinner.

254
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,150
Why don't I treat you to a meal

255
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,930
to thank you for inviting me
to appreciate the painting?

256
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,130
We just met by chance.

257
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,670
No need to dine together.

258
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,050
Don't be polite.

259
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,770
Eating with me is
nothing but a gain for you.

260
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,920
Maybe I can help you find someone.

261
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,760
You and I were just socializing.

262
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,490
How did you know
I was looking for someone?

263
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,880
It's the first time we've met.​​

264
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,390
You were quite guarded against me.

265
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,400
But when you heard
my mother was the Chief Matchmaker,

266
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,930
you became nice to me.

267
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,870
You're not in a hurry to go
to the Official Matchmaking Agency

268
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,320
but you said you would be there
in the future.

269
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,670
You were not in a hurry to talk to me,

270
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,480
but you treated me politely.

271
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,000
So you're not in a rush
to marry someone you already love,

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,750
but rather, you're looking
for the person you're going to marry.

273
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,570
The agency has the list
of all men and women in the capital,

274
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,900
including the unmarried and the married.

275
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,170
Young man,

276
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,330
it won't be a loss for you to eat with me.

277
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,220
You just said

278
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,040
all men and women in the capital?

279
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,800
Of course.

280
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,600
In that case,

281
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,680
I should treat you to dinner.

282
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,620
How about having dinner here?

283
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,330
Here?

284
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,790
Fine.

285
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,010
Looks like you've made preparations,

286
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,810
so you know they
serve banquets at Xibao Pavilion.

287
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,430
Ms. Li, I'm going to dine here.

288
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,330
Okay, I'll get ready.

289
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,860
As an outsider,

290
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,350
does he know that meals
at Xibao Pavilion are quite expensive?

291
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,120
He might not be able to afford them
even if he sold himself.

292
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,160
So luxurious?

293
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,000
They're only ordinary things
and not hard to get.

294
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,990
I'll see how he'll pay later.

295
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I think we should share names

296
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,280
and get to know each other.

297
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,750
Fa'ke means cutting
wood for an axe handle.

298
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,320
"To cut wood for an axe handle,

299
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
you need an axe.

300
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,210
To marry a wife,

301
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,050
you need a matchmaker."

302
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,430
You're right.

303
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,620
Young Master, you are so cultured.

304
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,130
Wait.

305
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,510
I only said it once.

306
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,940
And you remember it all?

307
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,540
Are all marriage brokers so eloquent?

308
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,960
You flatter me.

309
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,860
You already know my name,

310
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,950
but I don't know your name

311
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,340
and where you're from.

312
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,570
I'm Lu Chi.

313
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,670
"Lu" means above ground. My name
implies someday I'll rise to prominence.

314
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,520
[Lu Chi]

315
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,770
Mr. Lu,

316
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,880
you're articulate and good
at calligraphy and painting.

317
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,930
You're a rare man in the capital.

318
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,140
I wonder who you're looking for.

319
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,430
She's cute with a round face.

320
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,670
She should be coming of age now.

321
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,080
Girls who have come of age

322
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,120
will be categorized
as "eligible for marriage".

323
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,720
Their family background and certain
situations will be illustrated.

324
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,700
It's convenient for selecting

325
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,400
the right spouse for them.

326
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,150
Wait.

327
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,660
You mean

328
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,510
girls in the capital get married early?

329
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,580
Not only girls but boys too.

330
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,820
The capital is prosperous.
People prefer early marriage.

331
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,520
Common families
tend to seek a son-in-law early,

332
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,740
so girls get married early.

333
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,010
There are exceptions for rich families.

334
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,930
Just like me.

335
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,680
It's time to get married
when I've come of age.

336
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,550
But I need to inherit the family business.

337
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,420
My family loves me so much,

338
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,690
so they don't rush me.

339
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,590
She was also from a wealthy family.

340
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,830
She had the fragrance of cake

341
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,060
and a precious gold badge.

342
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,360
He knows little about that girl.

343
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,130
But he remembers
that she was from a wealthy family.

344
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,130
I don't think he loves her very much.

345
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,350
Forget it. Since he has that idea,

346
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,750
I can be his matchmaker.

347
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,340
Miss.

348
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,900
What do you mean by that smile?

I'm trying to figure out
a way to help you.

let me show you around.

If you find somewhere familiar,

353

I'll select those from nearby families

in appearance, age, and social status,

Good. Let's go.

I'll pay for the meal this time.

Besides,

362

363
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
I'll pay for that too.

What's wrong with my outfit?

365
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,550
The fabric was popular last year.

366
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,110
There is an unwritten rule in our capital.

367
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,210
The impression of a person
is often based on their attire.

368
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,270
I'll take you out to meet people soon.

369
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,890
You need to dress properly.

370
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,640
Exaggerated and vulgar.

Young Master.

372

I think she's right.

Why don't you come with me?

374

What a temper.

375
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,120
I want to see

how much money he brought to the capital.

377
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,720
He doesn't have any money with him.

378
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,800
How dare he take credit in Xibao Pavilion?

379
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,950
What a handsome young man.

380
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,000
Why did he pretend to be generous?

381
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,660
He is so vain and extravagant.

382
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,800
How dare he criticize us
in the capital for being vulgar?

383
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,240
Although he is vain,

384
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,000
he's handsome.

385
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,730
He remembers that the girl was wealthy,

386
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,670
and doesn't care about her looks.

387
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,710
Why don't I introduce him to a girl
who has a plain look but is wealthy

388
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,490
and eager to get married?

389

I just feel dizzy
after crouching for a long time.

Miss, did you use incense?

We've just met, and you're
already asking me about my fragrance.

This

is the aroma of He's Bakery's desserts.

405

Their dessert
leaves a fragrance after eating.

It can linger for a long time.

If you like this fragrance,

we can go buy some as souvenirs.

Don't worry.

Hurry up, pack me the crunchy candy.

By the way, Xian..

You and Ketian remember to visit me.

508
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,950
Don't worry.
I've already prepared you a gift.

509
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,280
It must be a gift
you've never seen before.

510

Yes.

I have invited many noble ladies
to my coming-of-age ceremony.

It's fate that we meet.

something to do. I have to go.

What is it?

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,380
I carefully chose her family.

But...

00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,490
What?

525
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,490
It's just that we don't know

526
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,790
what Miss Wu looks like.

527
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,740
What if she looks...

528
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,180
I just want to find that girl.

529
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,910
I don't care about her appearance.

530

If you don't want to go in with me,

I won't force you.

without me,
the marriage broker's guidance,

This crunchy candy

Yet she's so skinny.

Her maid is quite plump.

She can tell it's walnut-flavored
even through the oil paper wrapping.

Besides, he may be a foreigner,

you're not meant to connect.

But Madam is not at home.

until Madam comes
back for a formal blind date?

Why don't you stay for dinner?

585

The fresh fish our family
makes is the most delicious.

586

At this time, there are
no fresh fish available for sale.

has the most generous use of sugar
and oil among all the He's desserts.

589
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,620
The two siblings from the He family
have never been willing to sell me more.

590
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,370
One said eating
too much would hurt my teeth.

591

The other said I would
gain weight after eating too much.

Impossible.

598
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,860
I don't know if they lied to me.

But you two

600
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,730
shouldn't lie to me.

601
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,150
You two exchanged your clothes

and your identities

As the legitimate eldest daughter,

611
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,090
you called your mother Madam

612

instead of calling her "Mother".

Look at your hands.

614
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,050
They have thick bones and rough skin.

615
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,960
It can't be like this without more
than ten years of hard work.

If it weren't for your
coming-of-age ceremony today,

It’s such a trivial matter,
yet you come in person.

You're being polite, Mr. Shi.

Besides, I have five daughters.

How can I not come?

1046

Thank you, Lord Zheng.

and become
the No.1 matchmaker in the world.

Isn't the Vice Commander
of the Imperial Cavalry here too?

1065
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,310
They are either betrothed by our mother

1066

or their family's marriages

We have to guard against him.

1085

He became our neighbor out of the blue.

1106

00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,330
It's time to think about marriage.

1108

Kexian,

1109
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,630
you should know

1110
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,230
I'm the heir
to the No.1 matchmaker in the world.

1111
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,510
I haven't achieved my career.

1112
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,240
How can I think about marriage?

1113
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,280
Besides...

1114
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,440
Mother taught me
to keep my promise since I was young.

1115
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,110
I promised to marry a beggar boy.

1116

Kexian.

1117
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,020
You'd better not know.

1118
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,540
It's too hot. My makeup is messed up.

1119
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,200
Kexian, please wait
for me in the front hall.

1120
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,730
I need to touch up my makeup.

1121
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,270
My mother will scold me

1122

when she sees me like this.

1123
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,970
Okay, I'll wait for you in the front hall.

The coming-of-age ceremony
is about to begin.

1125
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,610
I'm afraid you don't have enough time.

1126
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,910
You...

1127

Here.

1128
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,340
Your lipstick is smudged.

1129
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,010
Are you going
to show up with a smeared face

1130
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,870
for the coming-of-age ceremony?

1131

Oh no. Where is the mirror?
