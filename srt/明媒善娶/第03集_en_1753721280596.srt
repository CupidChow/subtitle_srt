1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,380
Love is No Poppin'

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You can walk a few kilometers with me.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It doesn't matter at all.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know if it starting from you.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll walk as far as I can.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll go as you give.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
You take care of yourself.

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,000
Got it.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,200
I understand. Thank you.

44
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,320
I'll be late tomorrow.

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
You can send the stuff first.

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,640
This is money.

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,520
You did a good job.

48
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm the best at this.

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm entrusted to the official media office, Deng Mei Guan.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,160
From today on,

51
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,600
I'll be the only child of Qi's family.

52
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
What are you doing?

53
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,160
What are you doing?

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,960
You're Deng Mei Guan?

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes.

56
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,120
You just went to my house

57
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,360
and used your words

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,320
to trick Qi Shu into the handbag from my mother.

59
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,640
So you're Mr. Qi.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,960
It's not a joke.

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,120
I'm just telling the truth, right, Mr. Qi?

62
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
You're the only child of the family

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,880
since you were born.

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,760
After my father died,

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,560
my mother supported the family, right?

66
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,360
So?

67
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,040
Listen.

68
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,160
I can be filial to my mother

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,640
and run the family business.

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
I'm warning you.

71
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,120
If the official media office

72
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,600
dares to show up in my house again,

73
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,360
the one who broke his leg

74
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,760
will be your sword.

75
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,680
Do you understand?

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,600
Okay.

77
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,840
I got it.

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,160
I'll tell the official media office

79
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,800
if they dare to show up in my house again,

80
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,040
I'll beat them up.

81
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,680
I'll beat them up twice.

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,920
I'm so angry.

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
This mixed-race devil is really cruel.

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
Although I'm angry at you,

85
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,040
I shouldn't beat up the elders.

86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,160
In my opinion,

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,240
although Qi Shao Heng doesn't want to get married,

88
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,800
he has to.

89
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,080
It means that Mrs. Qi

90
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,800
is looking for some sons to marry.

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,800
But now, Deng Mei has lost her uncle.

92
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Qi Shao Heng doesn't want

93
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,080
other maids from the official media office to come.

94
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,200
There's no such thing as a matchmaker.

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,600
It's just a matchmaker.

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
It's just a matchmaker.

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's just a matchmaker.

98
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
It's just a matchmaker.

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
It's just a matchmaker.

100
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,920
If there's no matchmaker,

101
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,080
isn't it the right time

102
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,520
for you to fight for the good of the Qi family?

103
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,600
It makes sense.

104
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,680
And then?

105
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,160
About Qi Er,

106
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,080
don't worry about Qi Shao Heng's fist.

107
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,520
Because I'm better than him.

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
If Qi Shu is still alive,

109
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,840
Qi Shao Heng can't do anything about it.

110
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,200
If it's okay,

111
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,480
it'll be just a half.

112
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
It makes sense.

113
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,280
In that case,

114
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
let's wait in person

115
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,080
and discuss it with Lady Qi.

116
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,080
Let's go.

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,680
Hurry up.

118
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,400
Okay.

119
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,000
You're from the law department, right?

120
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,440
You're late.

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,760
I've already talked to

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
the Deng Mei Guan of the Meiting Court.

123
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,280
Besides,

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,320
your case with my family

125
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,520
is still unclear.

126
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,880
I don't want to talk to you.

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,760
Let's go.

128
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,400
No, Lady Qi.

129
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm here because...

130
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,160
Lady,

131
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,760
Deng Mei Guan from the Meiting Court is here.

132
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Why is he here again?

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,360
Lady,

134
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
I've already seen him.

135
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,560
Mr. Chen,

136
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,600
how dare you tear my letter of resignation?

137
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,480
Lady,

138
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,120
it seems that Mr. Qi is not satisfied with Deng Mei.

139
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,120
Lawyer,

140
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,480
you're a daughter of a criminal.

141
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
The case with Qi's family is not clear.

142
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,120
I'll order you to go back

143
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,320
as the Meiting Chief of the Guan Mei.

144
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,360
I'll go back and sort out the information.

145
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,120
You...

146
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,440
Lady Qi,

147
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,080
Deng Mei Guan is not good at it.

148
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,640
Why don't you let the Meiting Chief try it?

149
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,440
Lady,

150
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,920
Deng Mei Guan is a bit old.

151
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,360
The young people

152
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,120
must not like his taste.

153
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,720
I have a suggestion.

154
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
Why don't you let the young Meiting Chief try it?

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,800
Maybe my taste

156
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,400
will match Mr. Qi's.

157
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,960
He's willing to entrust the marriage to me.

158
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,800
What a joke!

159
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,160
I'm very experienced

160
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,800
and I still can't convince Mr. Qi.

161
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Why do you think so?

162
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,360
First,

163
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm young and have good taste.

164
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,160
Second,

165
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,920
I know many young ladies.

166
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,760
Third,

167
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,960
I can talk to Mr. Qi.

168
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:06,800
You...

169
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,360
Enough.

170
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,760
Don't argue with Deng Mei Guan.

171
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Actually, this young lady

172
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,280
is not unreasonable.

173
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,280
My son

174
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,560
is very stubborn.

175
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,280
Since you've suffered from him,

176
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,760
I'm afraid he won't let you

177
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
be his matchmaker anymore.

178
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,760
Lady, you're wise.

179
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,960
Lady, you can't.

180
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,280
Enough, you two.

181
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,920
Since you two

182
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,520
care so much about your son,

183
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,560
why don't you

184
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,120
go talk to my son in person?

185
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,760
As long as he agrees

186
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,440
to give this marriage to someone,

187
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,360
I'll let him have it.

188
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,400
What do you think?

189
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,000
Thank you, Lady.

190
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
I'll go to Mr. Qi right now.

191
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,800
If Deng Mei is worried about you,

192
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,040
why don't you

193
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,600
leave Mei'an to me?

194
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,120
No need.

195
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,360
I...

196
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,320
I have my own safety.

197
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,280
Lady Liu.

198
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,440
Here.

199
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,560
Here.

200
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,760
Take it.

201
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,520
Thank you.

202
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,560
Lady Liu.

203
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,840
This man

204
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,600
was talking to Qi Shao Heng yesterday

205
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,000
and he thought he was right-handed.

206
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
But he's left-handed today.

207
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,760
He's really something.

208
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,800
He's really a good man.

209
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,120
Did you hear that?

210
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,960
Qi Shao Heng, a top-notch star,

211
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,240
is violent and often makes mistakes.

212
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
You heard that too?

213
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,120
He's only been working for half a day

214
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,640
and he's already talking nonsense.

215
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,600
No wonder

216
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,240
he's still not willing to marry

217
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,240
an old man.

218
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,600
Qi Shao Heng

219
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,920
just killed Deng Mei's uncle.

220
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,720
Today, he has such a scandal.

221
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,240
Could it be

222
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,000
that Deng Mei is making trouble outside?

223
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,800
Don't be so stupid.

224
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,280
It's not decided yet

225
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
who's making trouble.

226
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,880
Qi Shao Heng is here.

227
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,960
He's the famous

228
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,280
Qi Shao Heng.

229
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,200
Look.

230
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,160
Zhao Xiu.

231
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,920
If you want to go back to your house for tea,

232
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,480
I can send you to my house.

233
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,440
There are many clouds and wind here.

234
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,240
How can I compare with you in my house?

235
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,280
Mr. Qi.

236
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm the teacher of the Guan Mei Hall.

237
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,280
Madam Qi

238
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,360
entrusted me to tell you about our marriage.

239
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,000
Xiao Heng.

240
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,720
Why did you break it?

241
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,720
You forced me to do it.

242
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,040
Sir, don't do it.

243
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,120
Please tell me the truth.

244
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
You look quite familiar.

245
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,560
What's your name?

246
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,440
I don't just want to do it.

247
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,760
I also want to move.

248
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,520
Qi Shao Heng.

249
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Do you want me to expose your skin?

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,880
Expose?

251
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,800
Then expose one for me.

252
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,840
What are they talking about?

253
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
Is there something wrong?

254
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,360
I can't hear it clearly.

255
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,880
Do you want to separate them?

256
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,040
I don't know.

257
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,160
You don't admit defeat?

258
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,880
I don't admit defeat.

259
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,600
Why is Mr. Qi

260
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,120
still using water to splash people?

261
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,040
It seems that the rumors

262
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,520
about the marriage are true.

263
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,240
What should we do?

264
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,040
Brother Lu.

265
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,320
Forget it.

266
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
There are so many people.

267
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,760
Let them go.

268
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,160
Brother, are you okay?

269
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,640
I'm fine.

270
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,680
Qi Shao Heng.

271
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,960
You'll regret it.

272
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,080
Lu.

273
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,960
I remember you.

274
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,480
You'd better remember me.

275
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,480
Okay.

276
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,800
Let's go.

277
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,240
Let's go.

278
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,320
Mr. Qi.

279
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,760
You did a good job.

280
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,960
But after half a day,

281
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,520
the rumors about my good temper

282
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,000
have spread.

283
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,600
Come on.

284
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,440
I'll pay you.

285
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,440
Thank you, sir.

286
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,160
Today,

287
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,200
the man who fought with me

288
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,080
at the tea shop

289
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,120
is Lu Chi.

290
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,440
You just need to

291
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,800
make it public.

292
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,400
Mr. Qi is so stubborn.

293
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,880
Have you asked Lu?

294
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,000
You can spend money

295
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,440
to spread your scandal.

296
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,680
Brother Lu made you angry.

297
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,200
But you dragged him into it.

298
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,240
Let me ask you.

299
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,600
Did you buy

300
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
the Tanghulu merchant?

301
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,000
And my former colleague.

302
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,640
Did you pretend to break his legs

303
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,880
and do things for you?

304
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,840
There are only women in your Guanmei Hall.

305
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,400
He's the only man

306
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,760
who doesn't want to work for you.

307
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,840
It's not good for me.

308
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
You tried so hard to lie to your mother

309
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,680
and refused all the marriage proposals.

310
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,280
Is it because

311
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
you already have someone in your heart?

312
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,840
Mind your own business.

313
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,480
Mr. Qi.

314
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
It seems that

315
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,720
it's all your fault.

316
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,840
Mr. Qi.

317
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,320
Since you've seen it,

318
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,960
I'll tell you the truth.

319
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,840
That's right.

320
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,960
I like to hit people.

321
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,360
I think you're not good at it.

322
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,680
But you're not as good as me.

323
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,080
Mr. Qi.

324
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,960
People have different personalities.

325
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,120
But everyone has his own advantages.

326
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,000
No matter who you want to marry,

327
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,680
as long as you two are in love,

328
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,920
I'll definitely be your matchmaker.

329
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
But I warn you.

330
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,200
Brother Lu doesn't want to have anything to do with you.

331
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,680
Don't ruin other people's reputation.

332
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,360
You can't say that

333
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,000
you want to be my matchmaker.

334
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,040
But I have to test you.

335
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,040
Let's see if you can

336
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,280
play the role of the people in the hall.

337
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,800
For example,

338
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,960
how about getting married for my sister?

339
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,960
Which young master does he want to marry?

340
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,920
Brother.

341
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,400
I'm willing to die.

342
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,360
Don't be afraid.

343
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,080
I'm the best at getting married.

344
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,800
I can get any sister to be satisfied.

345
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,720
Don't worry.

346
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,720
Junior sister.

347
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,160
You just need to get married to my sister, Xiaohei.

348
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,760
My brother-in-law

349
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
is very good.

350
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,200
He's as dark as a wood.

351
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,280
He has long legs.

352
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,800
He grew up with my sister since childhood.

353
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
This family

354
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,480
is of course also a matchmaker.

355
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,240
By the way,

356
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,360
the most important thing is

357
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,560
that my Xiaohei likes it very much.

358
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
Long legs?

359
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,360
May I ask which family's bloodline is your brother-in-law?

360
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,680
His legs are so long.

361
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,120
The horse clan.

362
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,320
What?

363
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,240
Junior sister.

364
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,560
If you don't get married for my sister,

365
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
don't think about burning my marriage again.

366
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,520
Go.

367
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Horse marriage?

368
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,320
Qi Shaohe, you can think of it.

369
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,080
You're shameless.

370
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,200
Who did it?

371
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,520
Who did it?

372
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,440
Not me.

373
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,880
If it were me,

374
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,440
how can one egg be enough?

375
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
Or I'll be angry if one egg is enough.

376
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,960
You...

377
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,800
Mr. Qi.

378
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,560
It seems that we don't need to do anything.

379
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,040
You're also a man of justice.

380
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,720
It's not long after we broke up.

381
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,160
You're still young.

382
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,560
You want to compete with me?

383
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,240
Enough.

384
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,880
I advise you

385
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,480
to get married as soon as possible.

386
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,080
Move away.

387
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,080
What are you doing?

388
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,200
You're really...

389
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,600
How dare you!

390
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,720
If you keep messing around,

391
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll drag you to the county government one by one.

392
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,800
Do you hear me?

393
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,720
Go away.

394
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,800
Stop looking.

395
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,440
Go away.

396
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Go away.

397
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,920
Go away.

398
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,760
Go away.

399
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,560
I don't want to see it.

400
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,800
Mr. Qi, are you okay?

401
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,040
Mr. Qi,

402
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,320
I think

403
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,040
you should leave your marriage to me.

404
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,080
Think about it.

405
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll be kicked out of the official media

406
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
soon after the punishment.

407
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,560
Listen to me.

408
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,960
Marriage is still going to happen.

409
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,680
Once it happens,

410
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,440
there won't be so much gossip.

411
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,560
Besides,

412
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,600
marriage doesn't affect anything.

413
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,680
If you have any other hobbies,

414
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,080
you can still do it.

415
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,280
Mr. Qi,

416
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,080
are you talking about cheating?

417
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,040
When did I say that?

418
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
You didn't give me a wedding gift.

419
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,920
It's my wish to receive money.

420
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Receiving money?

421
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
That's called buying and selling.

422
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Don't people in the official media

423
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,480
only like money?

424
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,720
Take the money

425
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,160
and get away from me.

426
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,760
What is this?

427
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,920
He's not a decent man.

428
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,320
But he's just a few money

429
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,560
and he's just acting.

430
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,120
Mr. Deng,

431
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,120
I dare not

432
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
to talk about what you said.

433
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,480
Marriage

434
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,880
is about your love and my wish.

435
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,040
Love

436
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
is his sincerity to his future wife.

437
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,000
It's not money.

438
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,520
You shouldn't help him cheat.

439
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,520
You shouldn't humiliate him.

440
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,560
Mr. Deng,

441
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,960
when did I help him cheat?

442
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,560
When did I humiliate him?

443
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,880
Don't talk about those

444
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,160
official and non-fraudous things.

445
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,000
Since you're talking for him,

446
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,480
you can ask him.

447
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,840
Will he ask you to marry him?

448
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,000
Qi Shao Heng,

449
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,200
I'm asking you.

450
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,640
Will you marry him?

451
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,040
No.

452
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
You heard that, right?

453
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,080
You know how much you're worth.

454
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,160
You just said

455
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,200
if I get your little black girl married,

456
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,800
you'll hand over your marriage to me.

457
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,080
A man

458
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,040
dares to say it

459
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,080
but he doesn't dare to admit it.

460
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,160
I, Qi Shao Heng, swear to God

461
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,160
if you can help my sister

462
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
to get the marriage done,

463
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,120
I'll entrust my marriage to you.

464
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,840
What?

465
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,680
Little black girl?

466
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,640
You mean,

467
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,760
a horse?

468
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,880
Shifak,

469
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
are you crazy?

470
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,440
Mr. Deng,

471
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,120
a man should find a lover.

472
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,560
A horse should find a partner.

473
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,640
Although a man and an animal

474
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,680
have no common sense,

475
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,120
he entrusted me with it.

476
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,560
I didn't reject it.

477
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,960
Besides, I didn't hurt anyone.

478
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,840
You, me,

479
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,240
and everyone on the street

480
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,600
didn't blame him.

481
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,720
Okay.

482
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,920
Shifak,

483
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,240
I'll entrust my marriage to you for now.

484
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,920
Don't let me down.

485
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,920
I gotta go.

486
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,240
Fine.

487
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,640
I really wanna see

488
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,200
what tricks you'll give to Zheng Hun

489
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,120
to stone him!

490
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
See, do fast.

491
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,720
If you don't resign now...

492
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Stop.

493
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,960
If he doesn't like it,

494
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,080
I think it's the way.

495
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
I will convince him.

496
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,400
You two

497
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,960
don't sleep in the living room.

498
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,200
Why do you come to me?

499
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,720
He is afraid of darkness.

500
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,160
I am afraid of darkness too.

501
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,080
You two can talk.

502
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,640
Anyway, don't talk to the fairy.

503
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,840
Don't talk to her

504
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,320
in your dreams.

505
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,840
Do you hear me?

506
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
If it weren't for my brother

507
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,920
to watch the movie for me,

508
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,120
I wouldn't dare to

509
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,520
be with you two stupid little bad guys.

510
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,400
Enough.

511
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,600
Stop it.

512
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,720
I haven't slept with Tiantian for a long time.

513
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,800
Yes.

514
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,280
You liked to come to my house when you were a kid.

515
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,920
Besides the delicious pancakes and candies,

516
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,440
my brother still surrounded you every day.

517
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,120
I didn't know that

518
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,840
you are his sister.

519
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,720
Look.

520
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,560
Here you are again.

521
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,760
Let's make the bed.

522
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,480
Brother Xian.

523
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,640
You are here to deliver delicious food again.

524
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,680
This is a sweet bean.

525
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,160
It's usually kept outside.

526
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,920
If you have time to eat,

527
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,240
you can have one.

528
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,040
It can support you for a while.

529
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,960
Thank you, Brother Xian.

530
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,080
You two brothers

531
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,200
slept well in the guest room.

532
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,520
Brother.

533
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,560
We are going to sleep.

534
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,240
Tiantian, eat the soup.

535
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,880
No.

536
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,560
Tiantian, do you want to drink?

537
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,560
What is Qi Shao Cong fighting about?

538
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm so old.

539
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,360
It's my first time to hear about it.

540
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,280
What's going on?

541
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
What's going on?

542
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,800
What's going on?

543
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,520
What's going on?

544
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,240
Look at the light.

545
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
It's like you.

546
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,440
It's written here.

547
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,240
Yes.

548
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
It's written here.

549
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
It's written here.

550
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
What's going on?

551
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
What's going on?

552
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
What's going on?

553
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
What's going on?

554
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,920
I don't know why they like it.

555
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
It's so interesting.

556
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Brother.

557
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,600
What's going on?

558
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
You really came.

559
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,000
What are you doing?

560
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Of course.

561
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,520
It's not just you who said

562
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,040
you would marry Xiaohei

563
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,840
and give me your marriage.

564
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
I'm sure I'm not a fool.

565
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Come on.

566
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Look.

567
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,160
Your sister is called Xiaohei.

568
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Your brother-in-law is called Dahei.

569
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,880
Just by listening to the name,

570
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,360
I can say they are a heavenly and earthly couple.

571
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,000
As for the two sides' feelings,

572
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,320
I have to confirm it again.

573
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,520
Don't talk nonsense.

574
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,640
You can start.

575
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,280
Please rest assured.

576
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,480
You are so ridiculous.

577
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
You are so ridiculous.

578
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
You are so beautiful.

579
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Mr. Qi.

580
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,000
Marriage is not a game.

581
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,600
The relationship, the family,

582
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,160
the character, the age,

583
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,800
must be confirmed by the prime minister.

584
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,720
I said

585
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,320
they are childhood friends.

586
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,520
They are more like a family.

587
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,280
There is no need to confirm their feelings.

588
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Just get married.

589
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
Xiaohei gets married.

590
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,160
You should ask Xiaohei.

591
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,040
You don't count.

592
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
No need.

593
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
I can decide.

594
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,400
According to what you said,

595
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
the person's wish is not important.

596
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,800
No one should listen to the likes of their parents.

597
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Right?

598
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Of course.

599
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,160
In this case,

600
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,800
if I want to get married for you,

601
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,680
I only need to ask Mrs. Qi's wish.

602
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,040
Remember her likes.

603
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Then arrange a match for you.

604
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,920
Then get married directly.

605
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,720
I don't need to ask your heart.

606
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,880
Is that okay?

607
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,240
Marriage is marriage.

608
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,880
How can you compare it with a person's marriage?

609
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,680
You asked me to get married for Ma.

610
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,280
Why can't we agree on it?

611
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,840
You don't ask Xiaohei's wish.

612
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,360
Your mother doesn't ask your wish either.

613
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,200
These two are the same.

614
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,040
What's the difference?

615
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,200
Shi Fak, you...

616
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,600
You said you would give me the marriage.

617
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,880
But you never believed

618
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,920
I would stand by your side

619
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,640
and consider you as my priority.

620
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Qi Shaohe.

621
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,080
You are a man and a man.

622
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,040
You are so repetitive.

623
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
What woman will entrust her life to you?

624
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,080
Mr. Qi.

625
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,560
You should be a man

626
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,160
and be a man.

627
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,800
Shi Meiguan.

628
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,000
I will fulfill my promise today.

629
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,760
I entrust the match to you.

630
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,680
I hope you won't be like those people in the hall.

631
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,200
For my mother's likes,

632
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,000
for the match in the eyes of the people of the world,

633
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,560
you sacrifice my likes.

634
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,240
Since I agreed to your match,

635
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,480
I will respect your likes

636
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,640
and fulfill your wish.

637
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,040
I won't make you unhappy

638
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,240
because of other people's likes.

639
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
When will you stop talking?

640
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,760
I will go now.

641
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,080
Don't go back on your word.

642
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
Wait.

643
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,000
Shi Fak.

644
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,400
You should know

645
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,920
your mother is not acquitted yet.

646
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,880
How can I let you continue to make trouble

647
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
and ruin the reputation of Guanmei Hall?

648
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,360
How can Deng Meiguan agree

649
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,080
that I am making trouble?

650
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,280
I guess

651
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,440
Deng Meiguan must have a choice.

652
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Why don't you tell me?

653
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,320
Brother Lu.

654
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,080
How can you ruin us?

655
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,160
In the end,

656
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,240
it depends on whether Mr. Qi is willing to do it.

657
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
But if I lose the match,

658
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,560
Meiguan won't run away.

659
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,320
Then I will entrust my marriage to you.

660
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
It's a deal.

661
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,640
Say it.

662
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,000
I will say it.

663
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,760
But in the public,

664
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,880
it's really not appropriate to tell Miss's name.

665
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,040
Mr. Qi.

666
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
Why don't we find a secret place

667
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,600
and listen to what Mr. Deng Meiguan says?

668
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,600
Don't make trouble in my house.

669
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,720
Although I'm in a hurry to ask my son to marry his wife,

670
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,200
I still have some requirements.

671
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,400
The parents' order is the silver of the plum tree.

672
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,120
It's also the parents' order to be in the front.

673
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,560
You don't even understand this.

674
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,040
May I ask, Shifake.

675
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,760
What qualifications do you have to be Guanmei?

676
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,200
Of course I will ask Miss's idea.

677
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,960
Madam.

678
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,840
Please ask me if you have any requirements.

679
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,520
We orphans

680
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,280
have to work hard to manage the situation.

681
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,080
A poor woman who wants to climb up the rich is not allowed.

682
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,920
I don't want to be a high-ranking nobleman.

683
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,360
As long as the door is open.

684
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,040
What are you doing?

685
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,440
After all, you are the one who got married.

686
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,680
Mr. Qi.

687
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,560
You should talk about it.

688
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,480
Mr. Qi.

689
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,800
You should think twice.

690
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,000
This Shifake

691
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,640
just wants to get a good job

692
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,080
to keep his position in Guanmei.

693
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,840
And his mother

694
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,640
is suspected of stealing your family's property.

695
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,320
It's...

696
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,080
Madam Qi.

697
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,240
Mr. Qi.

698
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,440
My mother is innocent.

699
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,160
Madam Qi.

700
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,360
This Shifake

701
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,960
first threatened Mr. Qi

702
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,760
to ruin his reputation.

703
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,880
Then he used it to prove his marriage to Mr. Qi.

704
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,160
He is not a good person.

705
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,400
He can't take the responsibility.

706
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,160
Madam Qi.

707
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm worried

708
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,840
that this matter has been going on in the capital.

709
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,320
If you continue to use it,

710
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,640
I'm afraid it will ruin your reputation.

711
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,120
You...

712
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
The choice of Deng Meiguan

713
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,640
must be made by the Qingyue family.

714
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,760
Who dares to have personal relations with him?

715
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,280
Do you want to be a part of it?

716
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,440
I...

717
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,360
Heng.

718
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,360
Mother.

719
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,480
I've heard

720
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,280
what the two Meiguan just said.

721
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,360
I raised you up alone.

722
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,680
Now you're at the age of marriage.

723
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,320
I'm also asking for your kindness.

724
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,040
You can't do it alone.

725
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm disappointed.

726
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,400
And Qi's family will be ashamed.

727
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
Mother is right.

728
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,120
Father died young.

729
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,000
He shouldn't have hurt his mother.

730
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,120
But I'm a playboy.

731
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,200
I want to make myself happy.

732
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,960
What the two Meiguan just said

733
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,360
makes sense.

734
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,440
It's really hard to make a choice.

735
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,120
Mr. Qi.

736
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,480
Your future happiness

737
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,600
and the experience of the Qi family

738
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,920
are in your mind.

739
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,480
Qi Shaoheng.

740
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,400
You're not a person who is against the law.

741
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,840
Are you really unwilling to make a choice

742
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,760
in front of your own marriage?

743
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,440
I...

744
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,880
Mr. Qi.

745
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,200
You have to understand.

746
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,560
The elders say that the marriage can last forever.

747
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
How about this?

748
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
Mother.

749
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,320
How about

750
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,360
the two Meiguan go to Liangpei for me?

751
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,080
I'll see which one of us

752
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,280
can find the girl

753
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,280
I like.

754
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,920
Then we'll decide who will be the Meiguan.

755
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,520
What do you think?

756
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,280
Okay.

757
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,680
It's a deal.

758
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Mrs. Qi.

759
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
I'll go make the arrangement.

760
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
I'll go too.

761
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,800
Are you trying to play tricks?

762
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,400
What are you talking about?

763
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,560
Mr. Qi.

764
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,680
Don't make a fool of yourself.

765
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,480
I don't know when I can have a little lady

766
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,240
who can make my son worry about me.

767
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,920
I...

768
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,680
Ke.

769
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,600
Ke.

770
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,960
I'm glad you're okay.

771
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,120
The news spread that you are using the horse as a bait

772
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,520
to make Qi Shao Heng angry.

773
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
Ke.

774
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,920
I'm fine.

775
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,880
Please let me go.

776
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,080
You're strangling me.

777
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,120
By the way, Ke.

778
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,440
Let me introduce you someone.

779
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,160
Ke.

780
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,080
Who are you introducing?

781
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,480
The one who introduced you...

782
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,200
Ke.

783
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Ke.

784
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,160
Ke.

785
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,080
Brother.

786
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,560
Let's go back first.

787
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Let's go, Ke.

788
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,000
Brothers.

789
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,400
You go back first.

790
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,520
I have something to do.

791
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,920
I'll come back to He's house later.

792
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,920
Wait.

793
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,600
I understand.

794
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,800
My father said

795
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,080
that every powerful person

796
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,880
can't stand the world's people.

797
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,200
I'm just a mortal.

798
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,480
I'm not a powerful person.

799
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,320
Then why?

800
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,040
Your brother is here.

801
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,600
So is the horse rider.

802
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,640
I'm an outsider.

803
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,800
I should leave first.

804
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
How can Brother Luo be an outsider?

805
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,680
You mean

806
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,800
I'm not an outsider?

807
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,920
Of course.

808
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,200
If Qi Shao Heng doesn't get married,

809
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,680
you're my guest.

810
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,080
Guests are

811
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,840
like parents to me.

812
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,920
Where are you going?

813
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm too young to be a father.

814
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,120
I just want to go home and sleep.

815
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,080
Don't go.

816
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,560
I have something to show you.

817
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,240
This is my family's treasure.

818
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,160
Besides my family,

819
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,680
you're the only one who can see it.

820
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,120
What about He Ke Xian?

821
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,640
Brother Xian is my best friend's brother.

822
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,120
Why should I show him?

823
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,640
Then I'll go to see him for free.

824
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,240
Let's go.

825
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,560
It'll be done soon.

826
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,560
You stepped on my foot.

827
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,840
I'm sorry.

828
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,360
I didn't mean to.

829
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,080
You want me to take you home

830
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,000
to see the treasure in this secret room?

831
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,640
This is the only treasure in the capital.

832
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,040
This is the only treasure in the capital.

833
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,800
What treasure?

834
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,520
Brother Lu.

835
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,080
I brought you here

836
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
to talk about marriage.

837
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,760
Aunt hasn't come back yet.

838
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,000
Isn't it too early to talk about it now?

839
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,480
My mother will come back.

840
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,400
And it's not early now.

841
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,240
In the capital,

842
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,960
people who haven't got married

843
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,520
are just filial sons.

844
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,320
Qi Shao Heng only cares about his own health.

845
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,280
Be careful.

846
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,240
What should I be careful about?

847
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,040
Be careful.

848
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,680
You will also be 謝謝Indeourd.

849
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,200
Come on, hurry up.

850
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,320
Look.

851
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,160
pace can go up for a moment.

852
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,920
Although you're still young,

853
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,000
you'll get old in a blink of an eye.

854
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,600
I'm a man.

855
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,600
I don't care

856
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,320
if I'll get old.

857
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,280
No, no, no.

858
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,000
Are you really going to waste your time

859
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,040
on finding your sister?

860
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,600
Don't you want to make your life better?

861
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
With your appearance,

862
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
you can easily conquer half of the capital.

863
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,360
No.

864
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,920
It's the lady of the whole capital.

865
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,880
With your appearance,

866
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,880
you can find a lady with power and power.

867
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,600
You can ensure your life.

868
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,280
I'll go to ask her to be my wife

869
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,360
and change her to a good girl.

870
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,560
I'm leaving.

871
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,800
Brother Lu.

872
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,400
Misunderstanding.

873
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,600
Misunderstanding?

874
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,800
I'm just afraid that I'll lose my memory

875
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,400
and get a bad mouth.

876
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,160
Don't be angry with me.

877
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,240
Okay.

878
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,240
I won't say it anymore.

879
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,120
I won't say it anymore.

880
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,880
Brother Lu.

881
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,520
Look.

882
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,200
This is the marriage certificate

883
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,600
my mother carefully organized.

884
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,000
It's the first of the family

885
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,880
and the second of the family.

886
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,400
The newly-wed women of all families

887
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,640
are all recorded here.

888
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,360
According to their looks,

889
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,680
talents and temperament,

890
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,760
they are all different in their appearance

891
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
and have no problem.

892
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,160
Lingtang is really a good girl.

893
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,120
As the saying goes,

894
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,160
there's no need to show off under the name.

895
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,080
As long as you say your requirements,

896
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
I'll definitely find a lady

897
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,400
who's satisfied for you.

898
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,240
By the way,

899
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,040
don't you miss your little sister?

900
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,640
As long as she's here,

901
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,760
she'll be there.

902
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,640
Brother Lu.

903
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,560
Why are you here again?

904
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,560
With your memory and misunderstanding,

905
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,800
how can you say that for others?

906
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,040
I...

907
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,520
Okay.

908
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,720
I won't say it anymore.

909
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,920
I won't say it anymore.

910
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,880
Brother Lu.

911
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,720
Well...

912
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,640
I've sorted out a few candidates.

913
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,400
You...

914
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,120
Help me copy them.

915
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,360
I have to prepare

916
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,280
a good candidate list for Mrs. Qi.

917
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,520
No matter how much you prepare,

918
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,040
Qi Shaohong won't like it.

919
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,040
I'm showing this to Mrs. Qi.

920
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,640
Mrs. Qi wants to be a part of the team, right?

921
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,040
I have to show my sincerity.

922
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,720
Cheng Xi is a good mother with good acting skills.

923
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,240
No.

924
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,240
She can't be good with acting skills.

925
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:36,180
Qi Shaohong may look

926
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,380
I'll distract them first.

927
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,580
And then you leave quietly.

928
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,700
See you at the West Castle.

929
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,420
The door is open.

930
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,500
Ah Ke must be in there.

931
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,180
Yes.

932
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,180
Ah Ke.

933
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,980
Let me see.

934
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,940
You've been away for so long.

935
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,940
You've lost weight.

936
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,220
You should tell your brothers at home.

937
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,660
Why are you going there alone?

938
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,340
Yeah.

939
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,860
I...

940
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,020
No.

941
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:03,860
No.

942
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:04,780
No.

943
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,740
No.

944
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,380
No.

945
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:06,980
No.

946
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,900
Did you take someone else with you?

947
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,860
How is that possible?

948
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,940
Absolutely not.

949
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,980
Ah Ke.

950
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,100
This secret room is the most important

951
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,460
and the most important one in our family.

952
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,180
My mother said no outsiders are allowed.

953
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,580
I remember.

954
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,660
But...

955
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,980
Did you forget?

956
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,900
There's a seal outside.

957
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,020
If you break in,

958
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,220
you'll hurt yourself

959
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,580
and Brother Xian.

960
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,500
I just came back to copy some people.

961
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,020
I'll leave after copying them.

962
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,780
Ah Ke.

963
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,100
I'm happy that you can think for me.

964
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,020
Why are you happy?

965
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,100
You want to eat?

966
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,460
You're so thoughtful.

967
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,140
Have you finished?

968
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,820
I'll help you.

969
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,500
Brother.

970
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,060
If you eat too much,

971
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,340
people will talk.

972
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,060
Let's go.

973
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,100
Go.

974
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,460
Go.

975
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,540
Go.

976
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,060
Master.

977
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,060
I've got the goods from the Lord's Mansion.

978
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,020
I've got it all figured out.

979
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,220
It's that Mrs. Zhu

980
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,620
who asked Zhu Yan Yan to leave

981
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,580
and not to meet anyone.

982
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,940
If Ah Ke knew Zhu Yan Yan's situation,

983
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,500
he wouldn't be so sad

984
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,740
because she betrayed him.

985
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,980
But more importantly,

986
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,340
Zhu Xiang asked about the Shi family's case.

987
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,580
Li Yang wouldn't dare to go too far.

988
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,420
No wonder he sold the Lord's Mansion

989
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,940
and let the two sons of the Shi family go.

990
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,260
Master, you've got this all figured out?

991
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,380
I'll recommend Xibao Pavilion to Qi Shao Heng.

992
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,580
At that time,

993
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,900
Ah Ke and Deng Mei Guan

994
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,580
will bring people to Xibao Pavilion.

995
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,820
They'll meet Qi Shao Heng.

996
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,980
I understand.

997
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,460
I'll make sure

998
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,860
to help the Shi family.

999
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,780
Remember.

1000
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,980
Don't ask for money from the Shi family.

1001
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,100
I'll pay for all of their expenses.

1002
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,180
Of course.

1003
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,380
I understand.

1004
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,180
Master.

1005
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,980
I've known that

1006
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
Deng Mei Guan is interested in...

1007
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,380
That young lady's surname is Wang.

1008
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,060
Her father is a government official.

1009
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,580
She's a good official.

1010
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,740
She insisted on marrying a government official.

1011
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,660
She made people doubt

1012
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,820
that there was something wrong with it.

1013
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,920
The Qi family's

1014
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,620
long-distance escort service

1015
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,620
refused to be

1016
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,820
transferred to the Shi family.

1017
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,020
Then the escort service was cancelled.

1018
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,300
When the escort service was cancelled,

1019
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,260
someone else

1020
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,940
wanted to marry the daughter of the Grand Preceptor.

1021
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,260
It can be seen that

1022
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,340
someone wanted to control Qi Shao Heng

1023
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,420
through marriage.

1024
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,580
He wanted the Qi family to be under his control.

1025
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,700
So this marriage

1026
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,100
couldn't be done.

1027
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,180
The Grand Preceptor

1028
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,180
doesn't want a family with a marriage of their own.

1029
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,140
Why did he want to be in contact with the Escort?

1030
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
It must be the person behind him.

1031
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,060
Keep an eye on Qi Shao Heng for me.

1032
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,100
Don't leave him overnight.

1033
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,100
Yes.

1034
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,020
When the Qi family's matter is resolved,

1035
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,980
tell Ake about the promise of ten years.

1036
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,820
Yes.

1037
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,660
Stop it.

1038
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,180
You asked me to meet you at the Xibao Pavilion.

1039
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
Why don't you go now?

1040
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,980
I've run around

1041
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,060
with so many things.

1042
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,220
I wanted to persuade them to get married

1043
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,620
and help me with the business.

1044
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,420
But everyone listened to me.

1045
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,940
No one is willing to help me.

1046
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,820
I heard a piece of news.

1047
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,340
Maybe it can make up for your grievance.

1048
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,100
What news?

1049
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,140
You don't even want to add a word of good.

1050
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,700
How can it make up for my grievance?

1051
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,940
I heard the news from the Xibao Pavilion

1052
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,340
about the goods delivered by Zhu's family.

1053
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,820
The goods?

1054
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,780
What about Yan Yan?

1055
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,900
Zhu's wife was abandoned by her stepmother.

1056
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,700
She can't go out or meet anyone.

1057
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,900
I knew it.

1058
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,460
Yan Yan wouldn't ignore me.

1059
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,980
Her grandfather is busy with official affairs every day.

1060
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,060
He must not know

1061
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,460
so many things happened in the house.

1062
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,180
When I stand firm in the official's house,

1063
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,660
I'll tell him to be a good husband

1064
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,940
and help him get out of the fire.

1065
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,340
Are you feeling better?

1066
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,500
Much better.

1067
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,900
Anyway,

1068
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:21,980
today,

1069
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,420
I must take my wife

1070
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,740
to the Xibao Pavilion to see Madam Qi.

1071
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,540
I don't believe

1072
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,700
so many women in the capital

1073
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,620
can give him a good advice.

1074
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,820
There must be a way out.

1075
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,620
Li Zhang Guai asked me to bring you a message.

1076
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,340
He's prepared.

1077
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,340
He's on your side.

1078
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,100
He'll keep Deng Meiguan and the others.

1079
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,780
You just need to take your wife

1080
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,660
to the Xibao Pavilion

1081
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,420
and see what's going on.

1082
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:41,660
Okay.

1083
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,380
I'll go find my wife now.

1084
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,740
Brother Lu.

1085
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,100
Thank you.

1086
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,620
The Xibao Pavilion

1087
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,780
This way, please.

1088
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,180
Please.

1089
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,540
Sister Pan'er.

1090
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,060
This is Miss Song.

1091
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,060
Deng Meiguan has brought Wang Qianjin here.

1092
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,820
She's over there.

1093
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,860
Miss Song,

1094
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,100
please leave her to me.

1095
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,380
I'll be sure to greet her.

1096
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,900
Miss Song, this way, please.

1097
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,100
There are a lot of makeups on recently.

1098
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,540
Miss Song, please have a look.

1099
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,220
You're so shy to bring

1100
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,820
a lady from a small family.

1101
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,220
You should marry a woman who's married to you.

1102
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,060
Madam Qi.

1103
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
This smell...

1104
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,900
Hurry up.

1105
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,180
I have an appointment with someone to drink.

1106
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,700
It's okay then.

1107
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,980
If you really need to drink,

1108
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
just go.

1109
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,700
I'll let Madam choose a guest for you.

1110
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,260
Forget it.

1111
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,060
I'm not that anxious.

1112
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,420
That's good.

1113
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,700
Madam Qi, come here.

1114
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,660
Look.

1115
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,420
Today, Wang Qianjin is here to visit the Xibao Pavilion.

1116
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,900
You can secretly

1117
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,660
observe her

1118
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,580
and see if she's a good-looking woman.

1119
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,660
Wang Qianjin is a daughter of a royal physician.

1120
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,860
She's a good-looking and gentle girl.

1121
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,820
And she's also

1122
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,540
a gentle and handsome girl.

1123
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
If you want to marry her,

1124
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,300
you should marry a woman who's a good-looking girl.

1125
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,540
You're so mean!

1126
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,420
Please forgive me, Madam.

1127
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,820
Please forgive me, Madam.

1128
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,860
You know how much I'm worth in this dress.

1129
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,620
I must pay you a lot of money

1130
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,100
to buy you a dress.

1131
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,980
Madam, don't be angry.

1132
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,820
The maids in our Xibao Pavilion

1133
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,820
are clumsy.

1134
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,900
How about this?

1135
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,900
I'll compensate for all the losses.

1136
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,620
Compensate?

1137
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,020
This dress is my favorite.

1138
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,380
What will you compensate with?

1139
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,500
In our Xibao Pavilion,

1140
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,900
there are thousands of dresses

1141
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,020
of different styles.

1142
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,460
Madam, you can choose as you like.

1143
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,900
What a great woman!

1144
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,420
She's moved by a dress.

1145
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,540
Is there only one dress in the family?

1146
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,020
She said she was a gentle and gentle girl.

1147
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,980
But she didn't care.

1148
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,220
She doesn't have a good taste.

1149
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,740
Right, Mr. Qi?

1150
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,340
I don't like

1151
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,660
a bad-tempered woman.

1152
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,860
Mr. Qi, it's a misunderstanding.

1153
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,220
Please observe it again.

1154
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,300
Mr. Qi,

1155
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,140
I brought Miss Song to visit Xibao Pavilion.

1156
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,860
Look, that's her.

1157
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,980
Miss Song,

1158
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,580
we cameary.

1159
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,020
We wanted to go to see you,

1160
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,260
but we two don't may be late.

1161
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,500
We want to go with you.

1162
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:58,780
Miss,

1163
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,380
we'll wait in the garden.

1164
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,340
Hello, madam.

1165
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,660
Have we had reheated before?

1166
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,300
Don't stay here.

1167
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,940
Miss Song and Mr. Qi

1168
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,180
came to visit you last time.

1169
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,820
So we asked them to lorsque a little bit.

1170
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,980
Believe me.

1171
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,780
Yes, Madam.

1172
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,500
Really?

1173
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,340
Tell Miss Song this.

1174
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,220
Let's go and wait there.

1175
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,860
Yes.

1176
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,780
Miss Song.

1177
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,500
My dearest,

1178
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,340
Madame,

1179
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,260
in Xibao Pavilion,

1180
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,660
you still have the time to learn something.

1181
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,660
Madam, a family is not the most important thing.

1182
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,540
The key is to marry a beautiful girl and grow old together.

1183
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,260
If Mr. Qi can find a woman with a good mood to accompany him,

1184
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,460
it can also be a happy ending.

1185
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,060
It's still not right.

1186
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,660
evaluable official, I think what the teacher said is not reasonable.

1187
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,060
Then is Mr. Qi satisfied with his wife?

1188
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,260
I'll send the iron rod to your house.

1189
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,260
No.

1190
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,860
You are indeed my son.

1191
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,660
You know your mother's feelings the best.

1192
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,860
Yes, official. I don't like this woman.

1193
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,260
I just think what you said is very obedient.

1194
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,060
Okay, continue looking.

1195
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,860
Mother, let's go back and rest.

1196
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,860
Are you playing me?

1197
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,860
Don't think that if I don't succeed, you can succeed.

1198
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,260
You are still very tender.

1199
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,060
I can tell you that this Mr. Qi

1200
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,860
is a famous person with a good temper.

1201
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,660
If you can really hold him,

1202
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,060
that's called skill.

1203
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,860
Ake.

1204
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,460
Brother Lu, I suspect that Qi Shao Heng doesn't want to get married at all.

1205
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,060
He just has nothing to do.

1206
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,460
He only wants to have fun.

1207
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,860
That's not necessarily.

1208
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,260
Today, I won't eat a single piece of sweet gourd.

1209
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,860
It's hard to get rid of my hatred.

1210
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,660
Okay, then eat one.

1211
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,060
Let's go.

1212
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:21,060
I know this meeting is a secret of fate

1213
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:27,260
Every time I see you, I only have a lovely stubbornness

1214
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,060
Although it is not clear

1215
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,260
Every day is a difficult day

1216
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:40,660
I know this meeting is a secret of fate

1217
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,860
I can't remember every difficult day

1218
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:53,860
But I never forget the first time I saw you

1219
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:58,460
Even if this love is heartless, silent, day or night

1220
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,460
It doesn't matter if it's a storm

1221
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:06,060
As long as you are never afraid, never shy, never worried, never worried

1222
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,060
I'll be with you in this life

1223
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,460
No matter in this world or in the next

1224
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:21,260
I'm willing to protect you with my own hands

1225
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,860
Even if I can't love you as I love you

1226
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,460
I'm willing to give my all to you

1227
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:35,460
I'll be with you in this life or in the next

1228
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,860
Even if the sky is blue or the sky is blue

1229
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,260
I don't care about the past

1230
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:48,860
Please remember the young man who used to be so pure

1231
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:58,060
From now on, he doesn't want to part with you
