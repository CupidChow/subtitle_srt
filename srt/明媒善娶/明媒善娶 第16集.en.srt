-Canceled?

509

We already bought tickets.

510
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,160
We'll refund all tickets
at double the original price.

Miss Cheng,

514
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,660
refunding at double the price—

515
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,070
isn't that too big a loss?

Young Master Qiujiang's health
is our top priority.

517

I'll personally bear the entire loss.

Young Master Qiujiang
has worked year-round without rest,

she was thinking
for Young Master Qiujiang.

538

When the audience complained,

539

she agreed to refund

at double the ticket price
without hesitation.

541

If you think
there's something between them,

542
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,090
you'll need evidence.

you say there's something between them?

545
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,350
Cheng Ruoning is a woman.

546
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,470
Her thoughtfulness to others

547
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,100
is perfectly reasonable.

548
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,600
But my matchmaker's intuition tells me

549
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,480
what's between them
is not just a simple relationship

550

Do you still remember me?

556

I once went to your mansion
to arrange a marriage proposal.

557

Ms. Fang, I already told you last time

558

Miss Cheng, you'll get married eventually.

Miss Cheng,
why don't you tell me your problem?

564

Perhaps I can solve it.

00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,950
My problem?

566
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,680
The Cheng family's affairs
are no secret in the capital.

567
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,160
Since your father passed away,

568
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,200
you've taken on the family business alone.

569

Your relatives around you are like wolves,

570
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,610
constantly showing up to stir up trouble.

571
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,240
What you've been through

572
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,480
is beyond
what ordinary people can imagine.

573

I believe
you must want someone by your side,

574
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,000
to support you and share the burden.

575
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,390
So, I don't believe you don't want

576
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,810
to get married.

577
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,490
Ms. Fang, please sit.

578

I've been managing business

579
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,450
since I was 16.

580
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,590
I know how to tell sincerity
from mere politeness.

581
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,870
You're about 70% sincere.

582
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,760
But I'm curious.

583

Why do you insist on finding me

584
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,670
a husband?

585
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,600
I wonder who you'll introduce to me.

586
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,530
I'd like to ask who you think

587
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
would be a suitable match for me.

588
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,720
Miss Cheng,
you've always prioritized your business.

589
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,900
In my opinion,

590
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,660
you need someone strong and responsible.

591
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,000
Someone who can help manage your business
and handle conflicts outside,

592
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,950
while cherishing
and protecting you at home.

593
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,080
Someone to share the joy of family.

594
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,340
So, who exactly is the man

595
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,810
that you recommend?

596
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,380
Marquis Wu'an.

597
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,590
He's skilled in literary and martial arts,
disciplined and restrained,

598
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,480
with a steady temperament
and great foresight.

599
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,860
Most young men from noble families
indulge in pleasure,

600
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,610
but he is different.

601
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,080
His noble status can protect you

602
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,920
and even the entire Cheng family.

603
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,650
Lord Marquis has a high status,

604
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
while I come from a merchant family.

605
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,040
How could I possibly be worthy?

606
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,880
That's precisely the point.

607
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,700
If you marry Marquis Wu'an,

608
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,550
your greedy relatives

609
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,750
wouldn't dare cause trouble again.

610
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,350
The Cheng family's business
could also thrive further.

611
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,920
He will surely protect you

612
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,390
and keep you safe.

613
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,590
I've never had any connection with him,

614
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,320
nor any emotional attachment.

615
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,690
Feelings can be developed.

616
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,010
Marriage, at its core,

617
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,680
is simply a life choice.

618
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,140
Since it's a choice,

619
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,090
you should weigh the pros and cons.

620
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,790
Why not give yourself a chance

621
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,420
to get to know him?

622
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,310
I'm not asking you
to marry someone you don't love.

623

I just want you to understand

the mountain path is steep,
but the main road is smooth.

625

With the right partner,

626
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,920
life will be much easier.

627
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,790
According to what you said,

628
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,090
I think

629
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,040
you admire him very much.

630
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,650
Do you know what I think?

631
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,030
It's not that I'm not eager to marry.

632

Clearly, love alone isn't always enough.

[Lily Bulb: 5 mace, Licorice Root: 3 mace]

667
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,590
As long as the herbs work,
that's all that matters.

668
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,050
Miss, even medicine can be harmful.

669
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,900
Though a throat ailment may seem minor,

670
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,830
the patient still needs to come in person.

671
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,830
So I can prescribe the right remedy.

672
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,130
Okay.

673
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,290
Miss Cheng.

674
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,180
Since our star performer

675
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,590
Hua Yuerong left,

676
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,030
we've been relying
solely on Young Master Qiujiang

677
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,350
to hold things together.

678
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,970
But now we've refunded the tickets
at double the price,

679
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,000
and we don't know when
Young Master Qiujiang can return on stage.

680
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,010
We're already running at a loss.

681
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,170
Now we still need to find doctors
and buy medicine

682
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,230
and tonics for him.

683
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,590
If this continues,

684
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,900
we'll be forced to shut down.

685
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,890
Sir, I know it hasn't been easy for you.

686
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,420
But no need to say more.

687
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,680
Before
Young Master Qiujiang's throat recovers,

688
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,220
I won't let him sing.

689
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,000
But Miss Cheng,

690
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,400
why are you so insistent?

691
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,220
If this continues,

692
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,880
would you really
risk Flower House's business?

693
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,360
His first performance was at Flower House.

694
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,640
No matter who tried to poach him,
he wouldn't left.

695
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,890
Over the years,
he's contributed a lot to Flower House.

696
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,680
This is just a minor illness.

697
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,210
It's reasonable for him
to rest for a few days.

698
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,040
I've made up my mind.

699
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,290
I won't abandon him.

700
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,840
And I will cure his throat.

701
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,630
Miss Cheng.

702
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,120
You go back to work.

703
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,110
Miss Shi, why are you here again?

704
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,110
I told you I don't need a matchmaker.

705
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,350
Miss Cheng,

706
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,500
is the man you love Young Master Qiujiang?

707
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,860
Yes.

708
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,780
Since you're in love with him,

709
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,960
I can help

710
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,560
bring you together.

711
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,320
I know you mean well,

712
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,200
but it's just my one-sided affection.

713
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,700
I really wish to grow old with him,

714
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:00,870
but...

715
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,170
every time I confessed my feelings to him,

716
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,540
all I received in return was his refusal.

717
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,450
I've stopped having false hopes.

718
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,760
I only hope we can continue as we are now.

719
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,320
You were refused?

720
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,160
Every single time?

721
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,170
Miss Shi, don't bother.

722
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,040
No, no.

723
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,000
Miss Cheng, don't be discouraged.

724
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,880
Let me find out

725
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,480
how Young Master Qiujiang
feels about you first.

726
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,360
But...

727
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,400
if he truly doesn't like you,

728
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
what would you do?

729
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,300
If he doesn't like me,
I'll stay single for the rest of my life.

730
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:49,860
Lu,

731
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,110
are you sure this is the right place?

732
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,640
Is this really the place
where Young Master Qiujiang lives?

733
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,250
My information shouldn't be wrong.

734
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,650
This is where Young Master Qiujiang lives.

735
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,120
Let's go.

736
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,320
Greetings, Young Master Qiujiang.

737
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,280
I'm Shi Fa'ke
from the Official Matchmaking Agency.

738
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,710
Pardon the uninvited visit.

739
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,470
Miss Shi, please come in.

740
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,160
This is strange.

741
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,280
Young Master Qiujiang's the star performer
at Flower House.

742
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,340
He's the most popular in the capital.

743
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,190
He should have earned a fortune
over the years.

744
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,090
Why does he live
in such a shabby, run-down place?

745
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,980
Miss Shi. Please have a seat.

746
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,800
These... were from Miss Cheng, right?

747
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,800
Miss Cheng cares about her employees.

748
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,480
And she's extremely generous.

749
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,510
Out of kindness,

750
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,360
she specially delivered these to me.

751
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,730
From what I know,
this isn't just kindness.

752
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,260
It's true love.

753
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,440
You should know

754
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,770
her kindness to you

755
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,650
is not simply
about caring about an employee.

756
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
I already know how Miss Cheng feels.

757
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,740
I came here

758
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,210
because I want to know your attitude.

759
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,340
You know what?

760
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,510
Before I came here,

761
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,940
I asked her a question.

762
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,450
What question?

763
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,220
I asked

764
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,530
if you don't like her,

765
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,230
what she would do.

766
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,250
She said

767
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,570
she'd rather remain single
for the rest of her life.

768
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,030
Miss Cheng being all alone,

769
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,000
unable to be with the one she loves—

770
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,610
is that what you want?

771
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,640
Is that the outcome you hope to see?

772
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,810
I don't believe
you have no feelings for her at all.

773
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,450
She doesn't have to do that.

774
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,030
I'm just an actor.

775
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,580
I'm not worthy of her.

776
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,150
Do you know

777
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,170
what she would have to go through

778
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,280
if she's with me?

779
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,340
I did think

780
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,960
about taking her somewhere else

781
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,620
and living under new names.

782
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,570
But she is Cheng Ruoning.

783
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,010
She is Miss Cheng.

784
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,090
She should
protect the Cheng family's business,

785
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,370
find a man who will marry into her family,

786
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,790
and live a life admired by them,

787
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,210
instead of being with an actor like me,

788
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,460
being gossiped by others,

789
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,790
or living a life away from her hometown.

790
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,990
Young Master Qiujiang,

791
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,690
you live so frugally

792
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,140
because you want to save money

793
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,110
to take her away from the capital one day

794
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,240
and start a new life.

795
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,470
That means you haven't given up

796
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,100
on your feelings for each other.

797
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,220
The money I have

798
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,920
can't compare to
the Cheng family's generations of wealth.

799
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,340
Have you ever asked her?

800
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,570
What if she's willing
to run away with you?

801
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,370
Miss Shi,

802
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,180
I've made up my mind.

803
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,020
No need to say more.

804
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,780
Please leave.

805
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,460
Miss Shi, go ahead.

806
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,460
I'm ready.

807
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,220
Miss Cheng,

808
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,190
I've confirmed
Young Master Qiujiang's feelings.

809
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,410
You two are in love with each other.

810
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,190
How is that possible?

811
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,770
Trust me, he has feelings for you.

812
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,040
It's precisely because he loves you

813
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,300
that he won't respond to your affection.

814
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,880
Because he doesn't want you
to face gossip

815
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,170
or live a hard life with him.

816
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,820
How...

817
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,450
How could these be his reasons?

818
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,310
Rest assured.

819
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,550
If you don't love each other,

820
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,600
I wouldn't interfere even if you beg me.

821
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,420
But because you love each other,

822
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,760
this is a match I must see through.

823
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,800
I will help you both fulfill your wish,

824
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,930
so that you two can have a happy ending.

825
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,880
Ms. Fang.

826
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,610
Miss Shi.

827
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,590
It's been a few days.

828
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,630
What have you been busy with lately?

829
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,320
I've been working
on Cheng Ruoning's matchmaking case.

830
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,330
The man Miss Cheng loves
is Young Master Qiujiang.

831
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,390
They are in love with each other.

832
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,540
I'm planning to bring them together.

833
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,460
I see.

834
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,090
Fang Yue.

835
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,600
I asked you to handle
the matter with Cheng Ruoning.

836
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,620
How is it going?

837
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,910
Cheng Ruoning is in love with someone.

838
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,020
Judging by her resolute attitude before,

839
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,180
she absolutely won't accept anyone else.

840
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,620
Who is that person?

841
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,530
I don't know.

842
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,050
I only heard

843
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,770
Cheng Ruoning has someone she loves.

844
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,780
And...

845
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:55,930
And what?

846
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,020
She has entrusted her marriage matters
to Shi Fa'ke.

847
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,020
Fang Yue,

848
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:03,840
I originally thought

849
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
you were much smarter than that girl!

850
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,370
Turns out you're no better.

851
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,880
I don't care what methods you use.

852
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,940
You must help me marry Cheng Ruoning.

853
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,450
My Lord,

854
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,330
are you so determined
to marry Cheng Ruoning?

855
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:23,410
Yes, I am determined to marry her.

856
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,050
Do you know how rich the Cheng family is?

857
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,590
Do you know how important that is to me?

858
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,930
I see.

859
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,970
Tomorrow, I will deliver
your Information Card to Cheng's Mansion

860
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,250
and propose marriage on your behalf.

861
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,860
Good. Good.

862
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,670
I'll take my leave.

863
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,620
[Cheng's Mansion]

864
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,920
Ms. Fang, what a coincidence.

865
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,720
Miss Shi.

866

[Information Card]

867
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,360
Ladies, please come in.

868
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,360
Please, Ms. Fang.

869
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,240
Miss Shi, please wait a moment.

870
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,730
Miss Cheng.

871
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,340
Greetings, Ms. Fang.

872
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,490
Why did you come again?

873
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,480
Marquis Wu'an sincerely wishes
to marry you.

874
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,480
I specially came
to deliver his Information Card.

875
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,010
Wu'an...

876
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,240
When I first met you,

877
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
I knew you were a persistent person.

878
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,010
But I didn't expect you
to be this persistent.

879
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,910
Please think twice, Miss Cheng.

880
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,470
Some people just can't be refused.
