SoundsysÅ‚able

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm still at the end of my life.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The strange years.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't know if you have any worries.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Some people want to repay.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But there's no way to do it.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A lifetime of love is the best way.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ake.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Brother Lu.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I suspect that Qi Shao Heng doesn't want to get married.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He's just looking for trouble.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He's just looking for trouble.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's not necessarily.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not going to eat a piece of sweet gourd today.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's hard to get rid of my hatred.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay, then eat one.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's go.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Brother Lu.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you think Qi Shao Heng's scent is familiar?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It smells like tea.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I also found out.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The sweet gourd.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The tea shop of Liu Ji.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Brother Lu.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Go with me to see if it's true.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Go.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Enjoy your meal.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mr. Qi.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Please sit down.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Second,

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
go and welcome the guests.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Two guests,

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
what would you like to drink?

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'd like to drink a little bit of wine.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'd like to drink a little bit of wine.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What would you like to drink?

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Two bottles of Gui Luo Chun.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay, wait a minute.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Lu...

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Enjoy your meal.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Brother Lu.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Why aren't you surprised at all?

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
As long as there's enough information,

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
we can definitely find out the answer we want.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Brother Lu, you're really amazing.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
These two people seem to be completely out of touch,

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
but they have a lot of understanding.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A sweet gourd delivery man,

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
a sweet gourd delivery man.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Exactly.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I understand.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This little lady is running this tea shop.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm afraid she's not related to the Qi family at all.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Qi Shao Heng is unwilling to marry Qi for her,

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
but he dare not tell Mrs. Qi directly.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Brother Lu is right.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Brother Lu,

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
you usually give me advice.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Since you said I was right today,

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you're right.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If you don't like me to cater to you,

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can change my mind.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, no, no.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's good.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We're friends,

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
so we should be honest with each other.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't want to be your friend.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why?

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can think about it.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just got paid extra recently,

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
so I'm short of money.

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But I'm very righteous.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I know how to eat and drink.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The key is to be kind and generous.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You'll know when you get along with me.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why are you laughing?

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm telling the truth.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I know.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Go back.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Miss,

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is the sweet and sweet gourd Mr. Qi gave you delicious?

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But I don't have...

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You?

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Who?

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You don't have what?

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You don't have love?

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's good.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll find a bride for Mr. Qi

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and let him get married.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No!

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What?

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You don't want him to get married

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
or find a bride for him?

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't want them both.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come on.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's find a place to talk.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Tell me what you're thinking.

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll help you solve your problem.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's go.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The gourd is like my family.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't worry, Sister.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Exactly.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You never see yourself as an outsider.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Shao Heng and I have known each other since we were kids.

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The place where my tea house is rented is the roof of Mr. Qi's house.

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
After Shao Heng took over,

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
he didn't rent our house.

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He even...

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Young Master,

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
you're here so early.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Madam...

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I just got home from drinking.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
She won't know I'm here.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
She won't like me.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't ruin my reputation.

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Listen to her.

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you don't want to marry her,

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
marry a man who is loyal and loyal.

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If you're not my husband,

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'd rather not marry her.

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So we misunderstood Mr. Qi.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It seems that Mr. Qi is really a person who loves his wife.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Mrs. Qi is a widow.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
She raised Qi Shao Heng.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She has high standards for her husband.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm afraid she won't accept

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
a woman as beautiful as Sister Luan'er.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If I were her husband,

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'd marry her.

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But I'm not.

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't want to drag her down.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've already decided to break up with her

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and let her marry a suitable man.

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A lover shouldn't give up on a loverless man.

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
She's already determined.

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How can you give up so easily?

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll think of a way

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
to keep you two apart.

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Ke,

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Mr. Qi and Mrs. Liu are deeply in love.

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You must find a way

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to make their lovers be loyal and loyal.

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Mr. Qi,

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
what about Qi Shao Heng

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
who only tells his own story

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and drags the marriage down?

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What can he do?

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Then you tell me.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What can you do

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
to make your mother feel at ease

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and make her lover feel at ease?

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
A man can run away

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
just to...

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sister Luan'er,

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
don't listen to these nonsense.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
A wife is a wife.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
A runaway is a concubine.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm a matchmaker.

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can't run away.

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You've met your old heart

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
when you met me.

179
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Since Mrs. Qi likes to be on good terms,

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
we'll break her heart.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I can make you

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
a different person.

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Mrs. Qi will be your confidante.

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Come with me.

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ke, I'll go with you.

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't follow me.

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The less people know, the better.

188
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't let Deng Mei Guan know

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
that I'm a bad guy.

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's go.

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Why are you going?

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm going home after watching the fun.

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's go.

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's go.

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Brother Luo,

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
why are you here?

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm born with passion.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I love watching the fun.

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You like watching the fun.

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's great.

201
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What I have is fun.

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We're really...

203
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Heaven and earth.

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No, no.

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Heaven and earth.

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Only lovers

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
can use this word.

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Sister, I...

209
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes, yes.

210
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's talk about business.

211
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I have a question

212
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
that I hope you can answer.

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Do you know how to make tea?

214
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
My family has been running a tea stall for many years.

215
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I know a little.

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I why I'm into tea.

217
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But where is it?

218
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I want to find the studio.

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's go to see the studio.

220
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

221
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You like tea,

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,760
I'll keep it.

223
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
It's impossible.

224
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,080
Sister Leng'er,

225
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,120
don't be so formal.

226
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,760
It's just some questions.

227
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,000
But we're going to

228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,480
show Madam Qi

229
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
a proper etiquette.

230
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,360
All the ladies in the capital

231
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,720
are good at making tea.

232
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,800
Making tea and tea

233
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,160
are your strengths.

234
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,680
And with the questions,

235
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,640
Madam Qi will

236
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,280
take you as a lady.

237
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,000
And with my pretty face,

238
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,280
I'll make sure Madam Qi is satisfied.

239
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,080
I see.

240
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,320
For Shao Heng,

241
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm willing to learn.

242
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,720
What can I do for you?

243
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,040
Take Miss Liu

244
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,280
to pick some good clothes.

245
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,880
Miss, follow me.

246
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,240
This way, please.

247
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,000
Brother Lu,

248
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,720
is Sister Leng'er

249
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,920
being bullied by you?

250
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,240
I'm afraid she's not.

251
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,360
I'm afraid she's not.

252
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,480
I'm afraid she's not.

253
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,560
I'm afraid she's not.

254
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm afraid she's not.

255
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
I'm afraid she's not.

256
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
I'm afraid she's not.

257
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
I'm afraid she's not.

258
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,400
You've been bullying her.

259
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
She's so stingy.

260
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,920
She didn't ask you how to pay the bill.

261
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,200
A'he is right.

262
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,960
Brother Lu,

263
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,960
are you crazy?

264
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,640
You want to know?

265
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,360
Once you've done this,

266
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,920
I'll reward you with my life.

267
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
It's a deal.

268
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,600
It's a deal.

269
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,680
Last time, you covered the bill for the engagement.

270
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,880
That was my brother's exclusive deal.

271
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,120
Why didn't you cover it?

272
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,640
I trust you.

273
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,080
Of course I don't need to cover it.

274
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,640
Let's go change into new clothes.

275
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,840
Brother Lu,

276
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I feel like there's something missing.

277
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
What's missing?

278
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
The wedding dress.

279
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,720
What's missing?

280
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,720
Father.

281
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,240
No need.

282
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,560
Don't think too much.

283
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,360
I mean, Luan'er is a father who needs a decent father.

284
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,440
I think you're the one who's thinking too much.

285
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
You're not a official.

286
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,280
Shouldn't you be sincere?

287
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,760
I'm thinking of this way

288
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
to save my parents from prison.

289
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,640
You know I'm in a situation where I can't listen to you.

290
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,040
It's really hard.

291
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,360
Just pretend I didn't hear you.

292
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,880
So cute.

293
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,240
Brother Lu, why aren't you willing to help me?

294
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,640
Don't you want to help me?

295
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,960
Because I want to be a bride.

296
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,320
I really have no choice.

297
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,360
I...

298
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,800
Sir,

299
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,560
I have a favor to ask of you.

300
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Are you willing or not?

301
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,920
Yes.

302
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,560
I'm willing...

303
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,240
or not?

304
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,680
Since they've all begged you,

305
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,600
just say yes.

306
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm willing. I'm willing.

307
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,000
Sir.

308
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,840
The marriage of the Grand Commandant's daughter,

309
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,600
did Qi Shao Heng agree?

310
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,080
That Qi Shao Heng

311
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,960
has a strange temper.

312
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,880
I found out that he has a crush on someone else,

313
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,920
so he's determined not to marry the Grand Commandant's daughter.

314
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,000
But don't worry, sir.

315
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,440
The Shifak has arranged a blind date for the girl.

316
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,760
I will definitely get rid of them.

317
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
You really

318
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,640
can control Qi Shao Heng?

319
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,280
This damn Shifak

320
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,800
actually made me so shameless.

321
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,120
Wait and see.

322
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,000
I will definitely get you.

323
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,080
I also need to change into a silver armor today.

324
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,160
Now only you can shock Qi Shao Heng.

325
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,560
I remember you said you like to make people happy.

326
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,360
I also want to be with you.

327
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,040
If you can make a happy moment,

328
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,640
you will be able to make it happen.

329
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,920
I'm willing to do it.

330
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,360
I'm willing to do it.

331
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,680
I'm willing to do it.

332
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,960
I'm willing to do it.

333
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
If the happy moment is not fulfilled,

334
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,560
I will help you today.

335
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,640
I will repay you with my life.

336
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,160
It's a deal.

337
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,680
It's a deal.

338
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,880
Tell me.

339
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,320
What are you selling in this alley?

340
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,680
Madam.

341
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,320
I have a business to introduce to you.

342
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,880
What business?

343
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,800
What do you want?

344
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,640
To satisfy your desire,

345
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,880
we will have a harmonious relationship.

346
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,280
We will be together forever.

347
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,120
Stop talking.

348
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,000
Go and read it.

349
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,560
It's written in the post.

350
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,760
But the business of the Escort is really good.

351
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,720
It's good to have a business.

352
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,720
Madam.

353
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,000
The couple were on the way to the capital.

354
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,640
They want to think about it.

355
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,920
After thinking about it,

356
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,200
only the Escort can help them.

357
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,640
I think the young lady is suitable for her age.

358
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,720
She looks beautiful.

359
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,800
So I want to invite you to meet her.

360
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,360
She has a daughter.

361
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,800
You are so smart.

362
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,120
You can do business without delay.

363
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
Madam, it's a pity.

364
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,320
Since Mr. Qi entrusted me with the marriage,

365
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,000
I can take you to see the young lady.

366
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,120
It's not wrong.

367
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,840
You are right.

368
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
Please.

369
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,600
No.

370
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,320
Do you want to change or not?

371
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,280
I want what.

372
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,280
And me?

373
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,400
And you?

374
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,080
Look at Your Highness,

375
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,880
do you like this baby?

376
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,080
What's it?

377
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,000
Your Highness.

378
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,760
Your Highness.

379
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Your Highness.

380
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Your Highness, this is the lady you invited.

381
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,560
Please sit. I'll serve you a cup of tea.

382
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Your Highness, this lady looks so pretty.

383
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,960
Your Highness, why don't you sit down and taste the tea?

384
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,360
The tea tastes better when it's served on a tea mat.

385
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,760
Okay.

386
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:17,560
I think this lady is the Lady Qi from the Escort of Wei Yuan.

387
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,560
Uncle, I think it's more appropriate for me.

388
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,360
Madam, this uncle bought some paintings and needlework in the capital.

389
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,160
He wants to ask the Escort to help him deliver them,

390
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,560
so that they won't be too insecure when they return to their hometown.

391
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Then, is this lady a lucky girl?

392
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,960
Have you ever married into her family in your hometown?

393
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,160
Yes.

394
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,560
I don't know why, but I think this lady has some face-dye.

395
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,360
I think I've seen her somewhere.

396
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,760
Face-dye is good. It means you two are fated.

397
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,560
I've been married long ago, but I'm not yet married.

398
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,360
It's a pity.

399
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Uncle will leave for his hometown tomorrow.

400
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm like an old friend to Lun'er. I really can't bear to part with him.

401
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,960
As a beauty,

402
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,760
if you can find me a good wife,

403
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,360
that would be great.

404
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,960
I think so too.

405
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,360
When Lun'er married into the capital,

406
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Uncle went back to his hometown and sold all his property and land.

407
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,560
Then he returned to the capital to reunite with his daughter. Isn't that great?

408
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,360
My story is perfect.

409
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,560
The old saying goes that he was caught in a robbery and was robbed.

410
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,160
It's good that he disappeared.

411
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,560
Go to the upper floor and turn right.

412
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,560
The last room is the one Shi Meiguan asked me to invite you to.

413
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,760
Shi Meiguan, what's the matter?

414
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
She asked Lun'er to leave and me to come.

415
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,360
Then no one will be able to call her back.

416
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Of course, it's for Lun'er's marriage.

417
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,760
Shi Meiguan has a special interest in a very good family for your daughter.

418
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
I especially invited you to take a look.

419
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,560
That's great.

420
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,360
I'm so happy.

421
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,160
It's okay. Go.

422
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,360
Okay.

423
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Shi Meiguan, do you have a suitable family?

424
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,760
Of course, I do.

425
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,360
I just don't know what you think.

426
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,760
I'm very satisfied with this lady.

427
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,360
Really?

428
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,560
Lun'er. Lun'er.

429
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,960
Lun'er.

430
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,560
Lun'er, you're already here.

431
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,560
This dress is really pretty.

432
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,160
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

433
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,560
Shi Meiguan, I heard that you came to talk about my daughter's marriage.

434
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,560
This uncle,

435
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,160
you must have gone to the wrong house.

436
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,560
Come with me to the next room.

437
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,360
No, I'm not.

438
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,960
I'm not going to the wrong house.

439
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,160
Let's go to the next room.

440
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,960
No, it's Deng Meiguan who told me

441
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,560
that she asked me to come to see Shi Meiguan.

442
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,560
She said she wanted to talk about my daughter's marriage.

443
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,760
I'll take you to the next room.

444
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,560
Wait.

445
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,160
Your surname is Liu.

446
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,360
My family has a piece of land that I can use for you until now.

447
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
Is it right or not?

448
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,160
I think this lady is a tea stall owner.

449
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,960
All of you are really acting in a good play.

450
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Madam, it's not like that. Listen to me. It's really not like that.

451
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,560
Enough!

452
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,160
I...

453
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,760
Yes, Madam.

454
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,960
I'm the daughter of a tea stall owner.

455
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm not a ghost.

456
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
You're so good, Liu Lun'er.

457
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,560
My family is willing to let your family live in a good land.

458
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
You dare to pretend to be a ghost and lie to me.

459
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,160
You even tried to marry into the Qi family.

460
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,360
Mother,

461
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,960
all of this is a misunderstanding.

462
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,560
Lun'er isn't that kind of person.

463
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,760
It's all my idea.

464
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,360
I wanted to marry into the family, so I let her...

465
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,160
Shut up!

466
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,960
Come home with me right now!

467
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,360
Mother.

468
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,160
Madam!

469
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,960
Shao He!

470
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,760
Lun'er!

471
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,560
I...

472
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,960
I'm sorry.

473
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
It's all my fault.

474
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,360
Come.

475
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,960
I didn't expect that at the last moment,

476
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
I received news from the Deng Mei Guan.

477
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,160
It's all my fault for being not careful.

478
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,160
I've implicated Lun'er.

479
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,960
Ake, don't blame yourself too much.

480
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,760
I was careless.

481
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,560
But there's no point in getting hurt.

482
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,760
What's the point?

483
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,560
At least Mr. Qi isn't hiding it anymore.

484
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,160
No.

485
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,160
It's all my fault.

486
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,760
I shouldn't have thought of it.

487
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,960
I shouldn't have betrayed him.

488
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,360
No. It's all my fault.

489
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,960
I shouldn't have been so weak-minded.

490
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,760
I was deceived at such a young age.

491
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,360
Are we in a meeting of our own?

492
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
If I'm wrong, it's my fault too.

493
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,760
It's all my fault.

494
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,360
I forgot that my mother told me about the Deng Mei.

495
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,360
Ake, thank you.

496
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Actually, I'm happy today.

497
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,760
I've tried my best.

498
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,360
If I can't marry Shao He in this life,

499
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,560
I won't regret it.

500
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,760
Lun'er,

501
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
don't you hate or be angry

502
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,760
and not angry at that stubborn Madam Qi?

503
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,160
I don't hate, I'm not angry, and I can't be angry.

504
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,560
She's a good mother.

505
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,960
She raised Shao He alone.

506
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,160
Although Shao He looks crazy,

507
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,360
he's very kind.

508
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,160
He can be like this because Madam Qi's teachings are good.

509
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,760
How can I blame a mother

510
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,960
who wants to protect her son?

511
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,960
I heard you compliment Madam Qi like that.

512
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,560
If one day she's in danger,

513
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,760
can't you block her way?

514
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,160
I can.

515
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,960
What did you say?

516
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,560
I'm willing to sacrifice my life for her, to protect her.

517
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Who told her that she's the mother of the person I love?

518
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
If she's wrong,

519
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Shao He will be sad.

520
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,560
If Shao He's sad,

521
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,760
I'll be unhappy too.

522
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,360
I know it's wrong to lie, and lying is bad.

523
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,160
But I have no choice.

524
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,560
I can't just watch two people in love not being together.

525
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,360
Brother Lu, I have an idea.

526
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Why do I feel it's not a good idea?

527
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,960
I'm sorry.

528
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,760
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm sorry.

530
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
I'm sorry.

531
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,760
I'm sorry.

532
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm sorry.

533
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
I'm sorry.

534
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
I'm sorry.

535
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
I'm sorry.

536
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,760
I'm sorry.

537
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
I'm sorry.

538
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
I'm sorry.

539
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
I'm sorry.

540
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,760
I'm sorry.

541
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,360
Mr. Leng.

542
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,960
Hello, Mr. Li.

543
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Notang.

544
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
What are you doing here?

545
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,360
You've been like this for a long time.

546
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,960
Mr. Huo.

547
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,160
Hello, Mom, how are you doing?

548
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,060
You've been sending sentry16 nonstop fight.

549
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,160
Right.

550
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,960
Mr. Huo, it's desde 587,

551
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
so please have fun.

552
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,160
Thank you, it's from my heart.

553
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Then I'll see you in private for the time being.

554
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,840
At this time, Luan'er will stand up for you.

555
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,480
A beauty to save her wife.

556
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,320
My feelings for my future mother-in-law.

557
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,800
Understand?

558
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,080
Pretending to be a Han bandit?

559
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,680
I...

560
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,400
I don't have any face, right?

561
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,080
I have no one to beg.

562
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,800
I can't beg my brother who is a beggar.

563
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,720
Let me think about it.

564
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,280
Lu'er

565
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,120
But I will help you.

566
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Thanks, Brother Lu.

567
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,160
I knew that

568
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,160
you would help me.

569
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,360
But

570
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,600
this is an unexpected thing.

571
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,160
Aren't you afraid of...

572
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,440
Sister Luan'er,

573
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
let me ask you one more time.

574
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,200
Are you really

575
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,000
willing to stand up for Mrs. Qi?

576
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,520
I'm willing to.

577
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,680
I'm willing to, too.

578
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,880
The Qi family has been renting the land to us for free for years.

579
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,760
Only then can we live in harmony.

580
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,000
Even if we're to be broken into pieces,

581
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,880
we must repay the Qi family.

582
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,160
Brother Lu, look.

583
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
They're all talking about the lung.

584
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,280
Why don't they believe it?

585
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,280
Last time, I only did it for my parents.

586
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,520
But this time, it's different.

587
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,600
If we can't move Madam Qi this time,

588
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,400
they'll really be unable to get married.

589
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,400
I can help you find a few concubines.

590
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,440
It's just that...

591
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,040
Really?

592
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,840
How should I thank you?

593
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,240
It's just that you have to promise me one thing.

594
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,200
What is it? I'll go right now.

595
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
I haven't thought it through yet.

596
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,880
But I'll tell you when I've thought it through.

597
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,000
It's okay. I'll promise you whatever you say.

598
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:23,840
Okay.

599
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,760
Then, about pretending to be a Han bandit,

600
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,520
just leave it to me.

601
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,560
You're just saying whatever you want.

602
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,200
I've found the Han bandit.

603
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,160
But...

604
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,680
Madam Qi is missing.

605
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,360
How should I

606
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,040
lure Madam Qi out?

607
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,160
Okay. I know.

608
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
I'll go find Qi Shao Heng

609
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
and let him think of a way

610
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,360
to lure Madam Qi out.

611
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,200
Thank you, Brother Lu.

612
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,040
Mother, open the door!

613
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,760
Mother, let me out!

614
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,480
Just stay in the room.

615
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,000
Don't go see that tea-maker.

616
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,640
Mother, what did I do wrong?

617
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
You've taught me to be responsible since I was a child.

618
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,360
I like Luan'er. Luan'er likes me too.

619
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,840
Is it wrong for me to marry her?

620
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,120
She's so vain.

621
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,720
She even dared to pretend to be a Han bandit.

622
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,280
Did I ever tell you

623
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,120
that I hate people who are not honest?

624
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,840
Mother! Mother!

625
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,800
Mother!

626
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,680
It's not what you think.

627
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,160
Mother!

628
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,040
Who is it?

629
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,880
Mr. Qi.

630
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,840
If you really want to marry her,

631
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,440
then take your mother to the Qifu Mountain tomorrow.

632
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,640
Lu Chi?

633
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,560
What tricks are you playing?

634
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,280
Just do as I said.

635
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,880
I can guarantee your family's business

636
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,120
and your marriage.

637
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,960
Why should I believe you?

638
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,240
I'm just a bit over-confident

639
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,320
with those who are related to my own luck.

640
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,080
And you are lucky.

641
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,680
You're a happy guest of the law and order department.

642
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,080
You've done everything you can.

643
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,840
You almost failed to test the killer, Shang Diao.

644
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,480
Why don't you take your mother

645
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,840
to the Qifu Mountain tomorrow?

646
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,840
Maybe there's still a chance.

647
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,480
Okay.

648
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,080
I'll believe you this time.

649
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,640
I'll think of a way tomorrow

650
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,080
to take my mother to the Qifu Mountain.

651
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,440
Lu Chi.

652
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,000
Don't forget what you said.

653
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
It's a deal then.

654
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,320
Stop.

655
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,880
This is the way Lu Chi came up with.

656
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,320
What a big battle.

657
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,240
Qi Shaoheng, you're dead.

658
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,840
Ke, how about we go back?

659
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,520
I don't think it's a good idea.

660
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,720
No.

661
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,080
It's too late.

662
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,280
So many people.

663
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,280
I don't believe it.

664
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,200
Why did Brother Lu get so many helpers?

665
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,440
Why are there so many people?

666
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,360
Where's Brother Lu?

667
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,680
I don't believe it.

668
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,000
No.

669
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,600
Young Madam is in danger.

670
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,760
Sister Luan.

671
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,880
Luan.

672
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,360
Give it to me.

673
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,160
Don't come over.

674
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,240
They're too competitive.

675
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,520
What are you doing?

676
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,840
Hurry up.

677
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,640
Run.

678
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,120
Let go of me.

679
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,040
Let go of me.

680
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,960
Brother Lu, save me.

681
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,200
Brother Lu.

682
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,720
Brother Lu.

683
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,040
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

684
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,000
They really want to kill us.

685
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,120
What are you doing?

686
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,440
I'm scared.

687
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,760
Fan Cao.

688
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Hurry up!

689
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Are you okay?

690
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
I'll take care of it.

691
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
I'll be the reporter.

692
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,800
I'll get the

693
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
family out of here.

694
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Yes.

695
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
Get up.

696
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
Fortunately, it's just a flesh wound.

697
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Madam!

698
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Madam!

699
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
Are you okay?

700
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Madam, go help Shao He!

701
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Mother!

702
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
Luo Er, are you okay?

703
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Help him up.

704
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
Be careful.

705
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Just a few women

706
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
can hurt my men.

707
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Tell me.

708
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Am I too incompetent

709
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
or does Qi Shao Heng

710
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
have the ability to control the sky?

711
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
I'm incompetent.

712
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
I deserve to die.

713
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
It's all the fault of that Shifak.

714
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
I don't know when

715
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
a man with great martial arts

716
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
will show up.

717
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
A man with great martial arts?

718
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
What's his background?

719
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,760
I've sent someone to investigate.

720
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
It's settled.

721
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,760
Why don't we

722
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
take the Qi family

723
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
and the Shi family

724
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
to the Shi family?

725
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
You're stupid.

726
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
You're a stupid donkey.

727
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
You can't do it at once.

728
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
They've already got the defense.

729
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
It'll be harder next time.

730
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
At this time,

731
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Qi Shao Heng or Tao Shi

732
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
suddenly died.

733
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Everyone knows

734
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
that the murderer is someone else.

735
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
If you don't do it well,

736
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
it will cause the internal force to think.

737
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
I understand.

738
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
You stupid donkey.

739
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
I ordered you to use the lotus sound

740
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
to capture the Qi family.

741
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
You failed.

742
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
I ordered you to kill

743
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
the Qi family.

744
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
You failed.

745
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760
What do I want you for?

746
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
I deserve to die.

747
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
It's okay.

748
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,760
Now Dengmei Pass is a guard.

749
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,760
The whole capital

750
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
is under the control

751
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,760
of the big and small officials.

752
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
It can help me

753
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,760
to cooperate with the Qin family

754
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,760
in a joint effort.

755
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
A'ke.

756
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
It's okay.

757
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
I'm here.

758
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Come in.

759
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
Master.

760
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
This is the medicine for calming the spirit.

761
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Shi Xiaoniang's spirit

762
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
is the medicine for calming the spirit.

763
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
If Shi Xiaoniang wakes up,

764
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
she can take it.

765
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
I see.

766
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Go.

767
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Master.

768
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Your wound...

769
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
It's okay.

770
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Help me prepare a new wound.

771
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Yes.

772
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
Xiao He.

773
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Xiao He.

774
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
Xiao He.

775
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Xiao He.

776
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
The End

777
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
A'ke.

778
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
You recognize me.

779
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Brother Lu.

780
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Of course I recognize you.

781
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Are you Brother Lu?

782
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Take the medicine first.

783
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
Brother Lu.

784
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
Are you hurt?

785
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
I'm good at martial arts.

786
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Who can hurt me?

787
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Lie down and have a good rest.

788
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
But I saw blood.

789
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
I'm really not hurt.

790
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,760
It should be the blood of the hitman

791
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,760
that was on my clothes.

792
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,760
I've changed the dressing.

793
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Look.

794
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
I'm fine.

795
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
Fortunately, you're fine.

796
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
But when she wakes up,

797
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
she can't mention the injury.

798
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
She can't scare her.

799
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Yes.

800
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
But...

801
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Master.

802
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
You're badly hurt.

803
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Should we go to a doctor?

804
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,760
I'm fine.

805
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Just a little bit.

806
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,760
Take some of the medicine we made.

807
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
I'll take A'ke to the doctor later.

808
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
By the way,

809
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
I have to go to the hospital.

810
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
I'll go to A'ke.

811
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
By the way,

812
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,760
go to the He's Mansion to inform the doctor.

813
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Tell them that Xibao is injured today.

814
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
A'ke will be back after the surgery.

815
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Yes.

816
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Brother Lu.

817
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
I've been out for a long time.

818
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
Don't worry.

819
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
I've asked Manager Li to inform the He's Mansion

820
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
that you should play in Xibao Pavilion for a while.

821
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
Sleep for a while.

822
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
I'll go out for a while.

823
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Brother Lu.

824
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
You must be tired.

825
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Go back and have a rest.

826
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
I'll stay for a while.

827
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
I should go.

828
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Brother Lu.

829
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
I'll go out for a while.

830
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,760
I'll stay for a while.

831
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
I'll stay for a while.

832
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,760
I'll stay for a while.

833
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
I'll stay for a while.

834
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
I'll stay for a while.

835
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Okay.

836
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
Why is there blood?

837
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
No.

838
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
I'm not injured.

839
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Could it be Brother Lu's blood?

840
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Why didn't he tell me?

841
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
Lady Shi Xiang.

842
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
You're awake.

843
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
Golden medicine.

844
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
Brother Lu is indeed injured, right?

845
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Lady Shi Xiang.

846
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,760
Brother Lu especially told me

847
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,760
that you were bleeding.

848
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
He didn't want you to know.

849
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Don't tell anyone that I told you.

850
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Don't let Brother Lu down.

851
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Don't worry.

852
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Go back and have a rest.

853
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
I'll go deliver the medicine.

854
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
Brother Lu was injured for saving me.

855
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
He really is a good person.

856
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
But how should I repay him?

857
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:09,760
I know this meeting is the grace of fate

858
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Every time I see you

859
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,760
I only have a cute stubbornness

860
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Although I can't remember

861
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,760
every word of your words

862
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,760
I still remember

863
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,760
the time when we were young

864
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
I still remember

865
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
the time when we were young

866
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
Although I can't remember

867
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,760
every day of the difficult times

868
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,760
I never forget the first time

869
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,760
I saw you

870
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
Even if this love is endless

871
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
no life, no day, no night

872
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
no matter how far it is

873
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,760
as long as you are here

874
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,760
no fear, no fear, no worries

875
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,760
I'll be by your side

876
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,760
No matter the world or the world

877
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,760
whether it will appear or not

878
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,760
I'm willing to be with you

879
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,760
to protect you

880
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,760
Even if I can't remember

881
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
every word of your words

882
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I still remember

883
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,760
the time when we were young

884
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,760
I still remember

885
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
the time when we were young

886
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,760
Even if the world or the world

887
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,760
will be the same as before

888
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,760
Please remember the time when we were young

889
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,760
we were young

890
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:46,760
I'm willing to be with you

891
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,760
I'm willing to be with you

892
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,760
I'm willing to be with you

893
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,760
I'm willing to be with you

894
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,760
I'm willing to be with you

895
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,760
I'm willing to be with you

896
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,760
I'm willing to be with you

897
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm willing to be with you

898
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,760
I'm willing to be with you

899
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
I'm willing to be with you

900
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
I'm willing to be with you

901
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,760
I'm willing to be with you

902
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,760
I'm willing to be with you

903
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,760
I'm willing to be with you

904
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,760
I'm willing to be with you
