Have we met somewhere before?

19
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,980
My friend here is an avid reader.

20

She's read almost every novel

Neighboring Hermit's Junshan Collection?

26

You just angered me

27

by mentioning him.

28
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,520
I finally managed
to buy the Junshan Collection,

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,500
but when I opened it,

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,400
it was clearly just a reprint
of the old version.

31

It's been a month,
and he hasn't written a single new word.

32
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:50,170
Don't let me find out
who Neighboring Hermit is.

33
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,230
Because if I do,

34
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,540
I'll capture him

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,910
and lock him in my study.

36
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,400

38

[List of Male Guests
at the Xibao Flower Assembly]

179
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,510
in front of each young lady

181
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,730
is a glass lamp engraved with her name.

182
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,550
Gentlemen whose names
are listed on the scroll

183
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,930
may step forward one by one.

[List of Male Guests
at the Xibao Flower Assembly]

185
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,910
If a young lady takes interest,

186
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,510
she may light her glass lamp.

187
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,050
Then she can ask the gentleman questions
to test his talents and knowledge.

188
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,240
If she remains interested
after hearing his answers,

189
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,640
she can keep her lamp lit.

190
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,760
Otherwise, she may extinguish it.

191
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,210
What if too many young ladies

192
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,530
are interested in me?

193
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,850
That's a good question.

194
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,330
Each gentleman

195
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,010
can choose one lady among those

196
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,830
who have lit their lamps for him.

197
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,540
Invite her to stroll the garden and chat.

198
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,670
If he finds no match, he can simply pass.

199
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,380
Then he won't be able
to find anyone, right?

200
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,730
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

201
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,750
Then he won't be able to find anyone.

202
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,710
If you can't find anyone you like here,

203
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,110
go to the lakeside,

204
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,930
write down your names,

205
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,360
put them in lanterns,
and throw them into the water.

206
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,250
Let fate decide.

207
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,080
See whose lantern
you'll pick up from the water

208
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,290
and who'll pick up yours.

209
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,210
Perhaps that will also
lead to a fated encounter.

210
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,240
What if a man picks up a man's lantern?

211
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,120
Or a woman picks up a woman's?

212
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,320
Oh, you!

213
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,450
That's a fair point.

214
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,290
Marriage

215
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,960
is not the only thing in life.

216
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,660
Women have dear friends.

217
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,430
Men have like-minded companions.

218
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,230
If you pick up a lantern
of someone of the same gender,

219
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,130
drink together and chat.

220
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,270
Finding a good friend is also a joy.

221
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,790
-Wonderful!
-Well said!

222
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,480
Wonderful!

223
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,400
That's right!

224
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:30,800
Ketian.

225
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,610
Well said.

226
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,680
Ke really has changed.

227
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,200
Not long ago, she was just focusing
on the people around her,

228
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,480
playing matchmaker just to pass the time.

229
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,220
But today,

230
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,670
she's hosting such a grand gathering.

231
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,750
She may have seemed scatterbrained before,

232
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,030
but she's clearly got her wits

233
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,880
about her now.

234
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,400
But

235
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,640
she's always been muddled
in terms of her own matters.

236
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,950
And she has poor taste.

237
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,890
I don't think so.
I think Ke has great taste.

238
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,180
Just look at Mr. Lu.

239
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,190
Isn't he handsome and charming?

240
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,920
My brother is quite good too.

241
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,620
Kexian is a good man,

242
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,990
but ultimately,
it depends on who Ke likes.

243
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,030
Right?

244
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,050
Now, because everyone

245
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,670
has been so enthusiastic
about the Flower Assembly,

246
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,330
we've had more sign-ups than expected.

247
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,070
So I can't arrange for everyone

248
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,860
to participate in the glass lamp activity.

249
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,180
But to help everyone find a good match,

250
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,950
we've specially added a new segment

251
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,640
for those not selected for it.

252
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,300
Also,

253
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,870
if you didn't get a chance to register,

254
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,130
don't be discouraged.

255
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,950
The Flower Assembly is held every year.

256
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,420
And if there's demand,

257
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,590
we can even host it multiple times a year.

258
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,640
The Official Matchmaking Agency
will help you find a perfect match.

259
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,710
Chief Lu and I

260
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,870
will host the next segment together.

261
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,000
All the prizes
will be provided by Xibao Pavilion.

262
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,990
-Excellent!
-Great!

263
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,320
Now,

264
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,270
let's welcome the young ladies
and gentlemen

265
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,670
participating in the segment to the stage.

266
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,030
Zhu Yizhi?

267
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,760
Everyone, listen carefully.

268
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,820
In the first round,

269
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,160
each young lady will pair with a gentleman

270
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,750
to play arrow-throwing together.

271
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,610
Those who score

272
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,840
will receive a dessert gift box
from He's Bakery.

273
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,270
Ketian, don't be angry.

274
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,660
Once we're back, I'll surely
get you a proper explanation.

275
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,110
Lu,

276
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,080
this part

277
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,390
is intended for single individuals.

278
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,450
That man

279
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,290
is Ketian's fiancé.

280
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,000
He actually signed up behind her back,

281
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,030
went on stage,

282
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,470
and kept staring at other young ladies.

283
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,480
He's completely humiliated Ketian.

284
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,880
He's indeed gone too far.

285
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,820
I'll make him give up later.

286
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,570
Really?

287
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,840
Don't worry, Ke.

288
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,990
Let the arrow-throwing game begin!

289
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,750
Failed again?

290
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,030
I...

291
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,830
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

292
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,590
The second round:
bamboo rings on glass bottles.

293
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,390
The next pair, please come to the stage.

294
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,920
I'll do it!

295
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,710
He dares to go again?

296
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,550
He...

297
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,060
Missed again.

298
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,980
This is so embarrassing.

299
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,290
What's wrong with him?

300
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,370
Step down.

301
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,650
Yeah.

302
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,740
Here.

303
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,630
Now,

304
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,710
the lamp lighting activity
officially begins!

305
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,480
-Great!
-Great!

306
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,630
Each young lady has a glass lamp
in front of her.

307
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,470
If there's a gentleman you like,

308
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,130
you can light your glass lamp.

309
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,090
Lighting it

310
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,500
means you're open to further acquaintance—

311
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,900
to get to know him better.

312
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,310
Extinguishing it
means you're not interested.

313
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,000
If your lamp stays lit until the end

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
and the gentleman feels the same way—

315
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,200
that means
you have feelings for each other—

316
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,240
you'll receive a gift from Xibao Pavilion:

317
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,910
a spring trip to the neighboring city.

318
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,000
-Great!
-Awesome!

319
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,900
Seven days of luxury travel for free!

320
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,270
That's amazing! I want it so badly!

321
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,720
Now, let's welcome the gentlemen.

322
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,540
-Good!
-Good!

323
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,270
Now, let's welcome our first gentleman—

324
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,990
Mr. Lu Zhuxi from Xibao Pavilion.

325
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,370
Greetings, young ladies.

326
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,190
I am Lu Zhuxi.

327
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,390
I enjoy traveling, exploring nature,

328
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,360
reading novels,

329
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,100
and occasionally writing as well.

330
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,470
Just a few words

331
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,950
may not be enough for the ladies

332
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,570
to understand Mr. Lu.

333
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,310
Let's welcome his family to introduce him.

334
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,390
Hello, everyone.

335
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,790
This is my younger brother, Lu Zhuxi.

336
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,120
He is young and values freedom.

337
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,670
He's straightforward and kind-hearted.

338
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,270
His greatest strengths
are his creativity and literary talent.

339
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,000
As for shortcomings,

340
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,960
I haven't thought of any yet.

341
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,470
Now, it's time for questions.

342
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,390
If any young lady has something to ask,

343
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,190
please do.

344
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,910
After hearing Mr. Lu's answers,

345
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,240
you can decide whether to light your lamp.

346
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,470
Mr. Lu,

347
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,570
is Xibao Pavilion
your family's ancestral property?

348
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,010
Do you have inheritance rights?

349
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,829
All ancestral properties
belong to my elder brother.

350
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,720
I do not live off family wealth,

351
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,930
nor do I have inheritance rights.

352
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,980
Mr. Lu,

353
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,160
who is your favorite novelist?

354
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,050
Miss Shi,

355
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,000
I would like to perform something.

356
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,660
I want to recite a poem.

357
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,869
Mr. Lu has volunteered
to showcase his talent.

358
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Please, go ahead.

359
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,020
-Great!
-Great!

360
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,080
Today on stage, I write a poem.

361
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,820
Tomorrow at home, I'll get married.

362
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,770
The day after tomorrow, I'll have a son.

363
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,550
Then I'll see if my wife is pleased.

364
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,680
Very straightforward.

365
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,750
Very interesting.

366
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,060
Good! Very amusing!

367
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,660
Mr. Lu is very humorous, isn't he?

368
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,350
Very humorous.

369
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,580
Indeed.

370
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,750
I'm afraid
only one person understands this poem.

371
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,160
Only one person understands it?

372
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,130
Just one person?

373
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,300
Who is it?

374
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
All right.

375
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,080
Young ladies, decide
whether you want to light your lamp.

376
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,660
Could it be he has someone he likes?

377
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,310
Someone actually lit her lamp.

378
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,890
Can she understand it?

379
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,360
Yanyan, you understand Mr. Lu's poem?

380
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
It's doggerel from the last novel

381
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,470
of Neighboring Hermit.

382
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,820
I didn't expect Mr. Lu
to recite it so fluently.

383
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,860
So it's a poem from a novel.

384
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,380
-Good!
-Good!

385
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,680
Now, let's welcome our second gentleman—

386
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,720
Lu Yi from Xibao Pavilion.

387
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,610
Hello, everyone.

388
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,110
I'm an employee at Xibao Pavilion.

389
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,970
My name is Lu Yi.

390
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,310
Lu Yi is not only my employee,

391
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,370
but also my family.

392
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,810
I know him very well.

393
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,470
He is loyal, honest, smart, and capable.

394
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,640
According to Chief Lu's introduction,

395
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,270
we can see that Mr. Lu is very upright

396
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,960
and responsible.

397
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,790
Those traits are very important

398
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,340
in marriage.

399
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,130
Young ladies, please ask your questions.

400
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,710
Mr. Lu, I want to ask

401
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,710
if you have a house in the capital.

402
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,650
Where exactly is it located?

403
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,810
If you were to marry,

404
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,160
how many betrothal gifts could you offer?

405
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,740
At the moment, I do not own a house,

406
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
but I do plan to purchase one.

407
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,680
I've saved 450 taels of silver, enough

408
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,010
to buy a house with a vegetable plot
in the outer city.

409
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,040
As for the betrothal gifts,

410
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,830
I'm willing to give everything I can.

411
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,110
But if you buy a house,

412
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,070
you won't have 500 taels
for the betrothal gifts.

413
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,980
So I'll pass.

414
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,690
Miss,

415
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,500
having clear goals is good,

416
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,640
but you shouldn't have hurt his feelings
with those harsh words.

417
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,300
Mr. Lu is ambitious

418
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,040
and has good plans for his life.

419
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,170
You may not like him,

420
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,740
but to someone else,

421
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,490
he might be a perfect match.

422
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,740
Thank you for your guidance, Miss Shi.

423
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll keep that in mind.

424
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,360
Young ladies,

425
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,640
as a matchmaker,

426
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,770
I also often wonder—

427
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,590
is it better to be wealthy and noble

428
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,520
or to have a simple, ordinary life?

429
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,100
Today, I want to speak from the heart.

430
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,140
Marriage isn't a transaction.

431
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,990
Marriage is a promise.

432
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,240
A promise is meant to last a lifetime.

433
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,680
At the core of a good marriage,

434
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,960
mutual affection comes first.

435
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,070
Money shouldn't be the primary criterion.

436
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,400
Miss Shi is right.

437
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,680
Yes.

438
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,240
Well said!

439
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,040
That's right!

440
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,740
Well said!

441
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,000
Alright, young ladies,

442
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,600
please make your decisions.

443
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,230
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

444
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,640
Miss Qin'er lit her lamp for you.

445
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,060
I'd like to ask Miss Qin'er—

446
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,320
why did you light your lamp for me?

447
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,650
I... I like a house with a vegetable plot.

448
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,210
Good! Good!

449
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,510
So romantic.

450
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,020
I want a house with a vegetable plot too.

451
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,920
Miss Shi. I also want to perform
something for every...

452
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,460
No.

453
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,330
I want to perform something
for Miss Qin'er.

454
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:38,860
Go ahead.

455
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,120
Great.

456
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,850
-Wonderful!
-Impressive!

457
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,810
Nice martial skills.

458
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,400
That's amazing!

459
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,200
Awesome!

460
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,270
-Impressive!
-Awesome!

461
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,200
Great martial skills!

462
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,360
Amazing!

463
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,480
Miss Shi's Flower Assembly

464
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,680
really is not bad.

465
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,910
Ms... Ms. Li,

466
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,590
would you like to take a walk around?

467
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,820
Amazing, right?

468
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,890
Sure.

469
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,030
Ketian. Would you like to take a walk?

470
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,290
Okay.

471
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,370
Excuse me.

472
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,320
Thank you.

473
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,570
Now I announce

474
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,200
the assembly's lamp lighting activity
has successfully concluded.

475
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,290
-Great!
-Great!

476
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,440
Excellent!

477
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,730
Great!

478
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,060
Everyone,

479
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,880
this time, we have

480
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,230
a total of 6 successful pairings.

481
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,110
Congratulations to them on winning a trip
to the neighboring city.

482
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,720
All the activities of this Flower Assembly

483
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,850
have now concluded.

484
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,450
Now, you are free

485
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,230
to enjoy the Flower Assembly.

486
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,160
May you all find someone you love.

487
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,610
See you at the next Flower Assembly.

488
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,030
-Great!
-Great!

489
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,270
Let's go for a walk over there.

490
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:34,690
Okay.

491
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,850
The Flower Assembly is wonderful.

492
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,690
It was well prepared.

493
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,340
Really?

494
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,300
Let's go.

495
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,840
Give it to me.

496
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,730
This Flower Assembly
is truly a grand occasion.

497
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,490
Ke,
it's all thanks to your brilliant ideas.

498
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,970
I'm sure it's helped many couples
find each other.

499
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,420
And thank you, Lu.

500
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,690
Thanks to everyone who helped me,

501
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,060
I was able to host the event

502
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,090
and make everything run so smoothly.

503
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,350
This Flower Assembly
is the fruit of everyone's hard work.

504
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,470
I want to tell you something.

505
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,250
Lu.

506
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,790
How come I never heard you mention

507
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,950
that you have a younger brother?

508
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,070
It was our first meeting today.

509
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,730
You want to know more about me?

510
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,330
That's... that's not what I meant.

511
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,240
I was just thinking maybe I could
take on another matchmaking case.

512
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,600
He's quite silver-tongued,

513
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,160
full of mischievous ideas.

514
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,420
I wonder which young lady can handle him.

515
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,980
What is love in this world?

516
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,250
Just one soul meant to conquer another.

517
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,820
I think Yanyan and your brother
get along quite well.

518
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,890
Don't worry, Lu.

519
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,530
I'll find a good match for your brother.

520
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,910
What about me?

521
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,050
If you're willing, Lu,

522
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,980
I can find you a good match too.

523
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,880
First of all,

524
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,030
when pursuing a young lady,
you should be proactive

525
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,930
and decisive.

526
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,080
That's not what I meant.

527
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,680
I was trying to say...

528
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,140
Ketian!

529
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,270
Ketian is over there.

530
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,990
Ke?

531
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,290
Kexian, go to Ke now.

532
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,900
I can walk around on my own.

533
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,890
But... but Zhu Yizhi

534
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,830
is nowhere to be seen.

535
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,420
I'm worried about you.

536
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,830
Kexian, just go.

537
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,760
Don't worry, I'm here.

538
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,710
I'll accompany Ketian.

539
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:10,800
Go.

540
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,340
Thank you, Chongshan.

541
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,210
Ke.

542
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,090
Let me take you to a fun place.

543
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,940
Let's go.

544
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,090
So the Flower Assembly is so grand

545
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,390
and so dazzling.

546
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,240
And everyone is smiling,

547
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,490
looking so happy.

548
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,370
Yes, it is beautiful.

549
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,130
Kexian, hurry!

550
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,210
Kexian, look.

551
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,990
There are lanterns over there.

552
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,500
Do you like them?

553
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,410
They're beautiful.

554
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,550
Ketian, I'll go with you
to look for Zhu Yizhi. How about that?

555
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,440
No need. Forget it.

556
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,250
Why?

557
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,400
Look,

558
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,800
Yanyan and Mr. Lu share interests.

559
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,270
They get along very well.

560
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,280
But Zhu Yizhi and me—we are different.

561
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,160
I'm afraid he doesn't like me.

562
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,620
And I...

563
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,140
don't feel much affection for him either.

564
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,510
And we don't share interests.

565
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,950
So why force it?

566
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,420
If we get married in the future,

567
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,880
I'll just turn a blind eye.

568
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,110
Life won't be too unbearable, I suppose.

569
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,960
Ketian,

570
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,200
you shouldn't
make yourself suffer like this.

571
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,290
If he lets you down in the future,

572
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,490
I...

573
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,470
Kexian and I
will be the first to avenge you.

574
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,210
Chongshan,

575
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,500
I know how good you are to me.

576
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,610
Whether he lets me down doesn't matter.

577
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,050
Now I just hope

578
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,470
you can find a girl you truly love.

579
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,840
Don't end up like me.

580
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,300
Ke...

581
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,500
Lu, look!

582
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,720
A shooting star!

583
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,510
Make a wish now.

584
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,500
Hurry up.

585
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,310
May the stars hear me—
I wish Ke and I will never be apart.

586
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,940
May the stars hear me—
may Lu's wish come true.

587
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,820
-What wish did you make?
-What wish did you make?

588
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,610
Wishes can't be told to anyone.

589
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,470
Otherwise, they won't come true.

590
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,000
Alright then, let's keep them secret.

591
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,470
So they'll come true.

592
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,640
-Neighboring Hermit.
-Neighboring Hermit.

593
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,140
Miss Zhu, you go first.

594
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,180
Mr. Lu,

595
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,750
Junshan and Caifeng
didn't end up together.

596
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,110
Should we send a razor blade

597
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,530
to Neighboring Hermit?

598
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,420
We definitely should.

599
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,950
But I think Junshan is too indecisive,

600
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,400
so he deserves to grow old alone.

601
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,140
In the upcoming extra story,

602
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,550
Caifeng will make him suffer.

603
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,690
He'll end up in a wheelchair,
full of regret.

604
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,530
You even know that?

605
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,350
Neighboring Hermit is actually...

606
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,280
my friend.

607
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,160
Really?

608
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,510
You...

609
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,110
You're close friends
with Neighboring Hermit?

610
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,390
That means you must truly understand him.

611
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,330
By the way, a few days ago,
I heard the bookstore's owner say

612
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,220
the extra story has been finished.

613
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,880
It just hasn't been printed yet.

614
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,850
Once it's out in a few days,

615
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,510
let's go buy it together, okay?

616
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,070
Sure.

617
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,850
Mr. Lu.

618
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,220
Since you're good friends
with Neighboring Hermit,

619
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,790
could you please urge him

620
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,240
to update his novel soon?

621
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,060
Okay. I will.

622
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,200
But...

623
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,830
But what?

624
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,530
Miss Zhu, you seem to admire him so much.

625
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,310
Do you...

626
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,110
You want to ask me

627
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,600
if I want to meet him

628
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,100
since I admire him so much?

629
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,890
Let me put it this way.

630
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,980
I love desserts from He's Bakery,

631
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,220
but I've never thought
about getting close to Kexian.

632
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,330
Another example.

633
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,650
I enjoy listening
to Young Master Qiujiang's operas,

634
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,580
but I don't want to see him every day

635
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,000
or spend all my time with him.

636
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,200
Actually, the people and things we like

637
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,820
bring us joy and comfort.

638
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,750
But when it comes to marriage,

639
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,220
just like Ke said,

640
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,310
we should choose someone

641
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,070
with whom we share mutual affection

642
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,510
and are willing
to spend our lives together.

643
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,100
Mr. Lu, do you understand

644
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,560
what I'm trying to tell you?

645
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,360
I understand.

646
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,180
Well, I have one more thing.

647
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,850
What is it?

648
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,190
When would it be convenient for you

649
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,210
to travel with me to the neighboring city

650
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
for sightseeing?

651
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,270
Well...

652
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,480
I need to go back
and ask my grandfather first.

653
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,920
Okay, I'll wait for you.

654
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,670
I'm going to Ke now.

Is this the time to worry about him?

844
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,390
I...

845
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,210
Let go! Don't pull me!

846
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,370
Zhu Yizhi, do you even have humanity?

847
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,450
Ketian.

848
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,700
Be careful! Don't push!

849
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,050
Be careful!

850
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,800
Everyone, stop pushing!

851
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,070
Lu, I need your help.

852
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,870
Everyone, listen to me!

853
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,280
Listen to me!

854
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,560
I am Shi Fa'ke.

855
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,400
I will lead everyone to safety!

856
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
Now listen.

857
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,400
All gentlemen,
assist the young ladies beside you!

858
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,680
Form a line, and walk out safely!

859
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,410
Everyone, follow me!

860
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,430
Line up!

861
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,350
This way!

862
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:06,870
Okay.

863
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,170
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

864
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,190
Over here!

865
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,880
Xianxian.

866
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,300
Xianxian, Pan'er,

867
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,480
I'm glad you're both safe.

868
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,070
Pan'er, go with Xianxian.

869
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,280
He'll get you out safely.

870
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,970
We still need to save the others.

871
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,010
It's very dangerous here.

872
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,590
Take the others and leave first.

873
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,470
Don't worry, Chief Lu.

874
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,420
I'm a constable

875
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,470
and Ke's brother.

876
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,760
I will get everyone out

877
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,540
safely.

878
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,370
It's my duty.

879
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,170
Remember, be careful.

880
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,510
Xianxian,
you must take good care of Pan'er.

881
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,430
Don't worry.

882
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,000
Please take good care of my sister too.

883
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,060
Rest assured, Shi.

884
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,920
I will protect her with my life.

885
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
Come on, let's go.

886
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,450
Let's go!

887
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,180
-This way!
-Let's go!

888
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,710
Keep up.

889
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,900
Hurry. Let's go.

890
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,630
Are you alright?

891
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,420
Are you okay?

892
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,290
I'm fine.

893
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,420
This way.

894
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,090
That way.

895
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,070
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

896
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,800
Over here!

897
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,710
Hurry!

898
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,240
Let's go!

899
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,850
Help!

900
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,560
Is anyone here?

901
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,440
Kexian!

902
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,000
Mr. He!

903
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,190
Kexian, where are you?

904
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,420
Can you hear me?

905
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,380
Kexian!

906
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,610
Ke, don't come over here!

907
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,700
Leave now!

908
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,760
Kexian!

909
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,650
Ke, watch out!

910
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,290
Lu Chi, get her out of here!

911
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,520
No, I must save Kexian.

912
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,750
Ke, trust me.

913
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,230
I will definitely rescue Mr. He.

914
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,800
It's too dangerous to go in now.

915
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,330
Wait for me somewhere safe.

916
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,230
Lu,

917
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,990
be careful.

918
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,350
I'll wait for you and Kexian to come out.

919
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,030
Okay.

920
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,230
Hurry, get up.

921
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,070
Get up.

922
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,270
Why did you come to save me?

923
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:13,190
-I'd save anyone. Let's go!
-I know you like Ke.

924
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,270
Stop talking. Let's get out first.

925
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:18,780
Let's go.

926
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,110
Kexian.

927
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,850
Lu Chi, thanks.

928
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,300
But let me make it clear.

929
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,970
I will never give Ke up to you.

930
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,880
Good, I won't give up either.

931
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,090
Kexian, are you alright?

932
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,290
I'm fine, Ke.

933
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,320
Where is Ketian? Is she okay?

934
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,950
I think they've gotten out now.

935
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,960
Lu, I still don't see Ms. Deng

936
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,950
or Yanyan or the others.

937
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:44,990
I need to go find them.

938
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,430
Ke, calm down.

939
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,750
Wait for Lu Yi to bring the fire brigade.

940
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,000
We'll go after the fire is put out.

941
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,600
It's too dangerous to go now.

942
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
Lu Chi is right.

943
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,490
It's too dangerous in there.
You can't go now.

944
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,770
-Chief!
-Fa'ke!

945
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,180
Hurry!

946
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,110
Chief, the fire brigade is here.

947
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,080
Fa'ke, are you alright?

948
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:01,890
I'm fine.

949
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,180
Lu, look. The fire brigade is here.

950
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,550
The fire will be put out soon.

951
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,510
Let's go find Yanyan and the others.

952
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,280
Okay, but don't take unnecessary risks.

953
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,220
Fa'ke, please be very careful.

954
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,480
Lu Yi,
have the fire brigade put out the fire.

955
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,920
Get Mr. He and Qin'er out first.

956
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,720
Ke and I are going to find the others.

957
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,100
Yes. Be careful, Chief.

958
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,720
Hurry.

959
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,860
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

960
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,680
Let's go.

961
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,010
Come on, let's go.

962
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,340
Hurry!

963
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,850
Over there.

964
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,020
Help!

965
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,050
Help! Someone's trying to kill me!

966
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,340
Help!

967
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,890
Help!

968
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:44,660
Ms. Deng!

969
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:45,190
Help!

970
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,180
Ms. Deng!

971
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,760
Ke!

972
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,960
Ms. Deng, don't be afraid!

973
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,970
I'll get you out of here, Ms. Deng!

974
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,360
Ms. Deng!

975
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,480
Go find someone to save her! Now!

976
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:09,960
Okay.

977
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,360
Go get the fire brigade!

978
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:13,550
Shi Fa'ke.

979
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,730
Ms. Deng.

980
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,930
Don't be afraid. I'll save you.

981
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:23,580
I joined
the Official Matchmaking Agency at 16.

982
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,430
Ms. Deng.

983
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,450
I've worked diligently

984
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,940
and dedicated my entire life to this work.

985
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:38,120
I've arranged marriages for so many,

986
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,430
but I never had a lover or a child myself.

987
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,230
All I wanted
was to become the Chief Matchmaker.

988
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,060
But...

989
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,570
But Heaven

990
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,320
sent your mother to overshadow me.

991
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:58,780
No matter how hard I worked,
I was never as good as her.

992
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,460
Just because

993
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,070
she was born as the heir
to the No.1 matchmaker in the world.

994
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,510
That's not true, Ms. Deng.

995
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,770
No one sees what I've done.

996
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,150
No one even remembers my name.

997
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,750
Even after I became the Chief Matchmaker,

998
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,530
they still wouldn't see me.

999
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,000
All they see

1000
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,590
are you and your mother.

1001
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,680
That's not true, Ms. Deng.

1002
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,920
You're a good marriage broker,

1003
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,760
hardworking and diligent.

1004
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,900
I was immature and often slacked off.

1005
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,070
I admire you the most.

1006
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,120
You never miss work

1007
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,510
and always work hard.

1008
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,410
Ms. Deng, you're a good marriage broker!

1009
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,830
A great marriage broker, Ms. Deng!

1010
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:56,050
Ke, do you mean that?

1011
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,880
I mean every word.

1012
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,400
You and my mother both are
