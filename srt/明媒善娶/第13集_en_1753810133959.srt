I'm not afraid of anything.

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

I'm not afraid of anything.

I'm not afraid of anything.

I'm not afraid of anything.

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The flowers are in the branches.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The strange years.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't know if you have a care.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Some people

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you want to repay

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But there is no way to do it.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A lifetime of love

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is the best way.

A-Kong, it's okay.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm here.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I didn't save Danyi.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
You've done your best.

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't blame yourself.

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,640
Brother Lu.

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
And Yan Yan.

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Let's go find them.

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't worry.

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,800
Zhou Xi hasn't come out yet.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,200
But she's innocent.

40
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,800
Maybe she has found

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
Zhu's wife

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,600
and went to a safe place.

43
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,080
Where are they?

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll take you to find them.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,720
Hurry.

46
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,840
Come on.

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,240
Let me carry you.

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,440
Mr. Lu.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,960
Are you okay?

50
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,400
Does it hurt?

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm fine.

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,800
Where is this?

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,960
Will the fire

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,520
burn over in a while?

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Don't be afraid.

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm here.

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,240
I'll carry you.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,440
Go ahead.

59
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,360
You should be able to get out soon.

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,200
Brother Lu.

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,440
Thank you for today.

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Without you,

63
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,600
I don't know

64
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,120
how things will develop.

65
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,760
Your responsibility

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,240
is to protect the people

67
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,320
who attend the meeting.

68
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
And my responsibility

69
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
is to protect you.

70
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,760
I'll be with you

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
and protect you.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't look at me.

73
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,200
I look ugly when I cry.

74
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
If you don't look ugly,

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll treat Ake

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
as the most beautiful person

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
and my favorite person.

78
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
I'll protect you

79
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
and keep you from getting hurt.

80
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll let you live a peaceful life

81
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,000
and live a happy life.

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,400
Why are you saying these?

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm not saying these out of the blue.

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,600
I've been telling you all the time.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,600
Yanyan.

86
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Ake.

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,800
Brother Lu.

88
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Yanyan.

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,200
You're okay.

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,600
That's great.

91
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm so scared.

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,800
Are you okay?

93
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm fine.

94
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm fine.

95
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,400
Don't move.

96
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Be careful not to hurt your wound.

97
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
I'll take you to the doctor.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,600
Let's go.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,600
Let's go.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,600
It's okay.

101
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,400
It's okay.

102
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,200
It's okay.

103
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,800
He's out.

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,600
He's out.

105
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Brother Lu is out.

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,400
Brother Lu is out.

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
He's out.

108
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,000
Ake.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,800
It seems to be fine.

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Ake.

111
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,400
Ake.

112
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,000
Brother Lu.

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,600
Sister Tao.

114
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Are you okay?

115
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,000
Master.

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,600
Master.

117
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Are you okay?

118
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,200
Don't worry.

119
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm fine.

120
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
Are you okay?

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
We're fine.

122
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,800
Ake.

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,400
Did you see Deng Meiguan?

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
He's the only one left now.

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
I've been looking for him everywhere.

126
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
He's not here.

127
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,000
He's not here.

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
He's not here.

129
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
He's not here.

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
I can't find him anywhere.

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Deng Yi is

132
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,400
no longer here.

133
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,600
We went to the fire station to save him.

134
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
But it's too late

135
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
to check on him.

136
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
How could this happen?

137
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
How could this happen?

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,800
Master.

139
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
I've checked on him.

140
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Except Deng Meiguan,

141
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
all the other people who met him

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
have escaped.

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Thank you.

144
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Thank you, Master.

145
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Thank you.

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Thank you, Master.

147
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,200
Thank you for saving us.

148
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
You're welcome.

149
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
As long as you're safe.

150
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
You're welcome.

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,600
Go.

152
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Take Shifak away.

153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,200
Yes.

154
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,200
I...

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
General Li.

156
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
What do you mean?

157
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
The smoke is so strong here.

158
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
It's a big fire in the city.

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,800
Shifak.

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
As the organizer of the Flower Session,

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,600
you're here to kill someone.

162
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Shouldn't you be obedient?

163
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
General.

164
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
The Fire of Flower Session

165
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
is to catch the person who set the fire.

166
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,400
But you caught an innocent Meiguan.

167
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,600
It's not reasonable.

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,200
How dare you talk like that?

169
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,200
General Li.

170
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
I'm hosting the Flower Session

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,800
when the fire happened.

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
Everyone here can testify for me.

173
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
What evidence do you have?

174
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
I'm the one who set the fire.

175
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There must be a reason for the fire.

176
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,400
You're lying.

177
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
It's better to lie than to be guilty.

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You'll know it after you go back

179
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
and take the investigation.

180
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm not afraid of the shadow.

181
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
I've never done it.

182
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,800
I can take your investigation.

183
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
But I'm telling you.

184
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,800
If you dare to hurt anyone here,

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,400
I'll sue you to death.

186
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
General Li.

187
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
There's a court case.

188
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
The security of the guards is under investigation.

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
Why did the General's Office

190
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
send soldiers to catch the person?

191
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,200
Are you going to ignore the rules

192
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
and take the responsibility?

193
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Lu Chi.

194
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Shifake.

195
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,600
The Flower Session has a big mistake.

196
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
As the organizer,

197
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
shouldn't you take the responsibility?

198
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
The Xibao Flower Session

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,600
is funded by the Xibao Pavilion.

200
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Lu Chi.

201
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,200
You're also guilty.

202
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Lu Chi.

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Yes.

204
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,600
I'm the organizer.

205
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I do have a responsibility.

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll go back with you for the investigation.

207
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,000
Ke.

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
No.

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,200
Since you said so,

210
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,200
come on.

211
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Take her away.

212
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,200
Who dares?

213
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm a witness.

214
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
I can testify for Ke.

215
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,200
Yanyan.

216
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm the granddaughter of Prime Minister Zhu,

217
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,400
Zhu Yanyan.

218
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,400
I saw it with my own eyes.

219
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,600
It's the fire of Deng Meiguan.

220
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,000
I can prove that it has nothing to do with them.

221
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,200
You...

222
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,200
It's not fair.

223
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,800
It's not enough to prove.

224
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
This waist is

225
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,600
from Deng Shoumei.

226
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,200
I witnessed her burning the Flower Session.

227
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
I can testify.

228
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,800
I saved Madam Zhu from the fire.

229
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Where is Deng Shoumei?

230
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
Tell her to come out and confront.

231
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Deng Shoumei

232
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,000
has been buried in the fire.

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Are you trying to blame

234
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
a dead person?

235
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,800
You...

236
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,200
I think Deng Shoumei's death

237
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,200
has nothing to do with you.

238
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,600
What's the truth?

239
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,000
We'll talk about it in court.

240
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Guards, take her away.

241
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,800
Yes.

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
You can't take her away.

243
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,000
You can't take her away.

244
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,200
Grandfather, what are you doing?

245
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
You can't take her away.

246
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
You can't take her away.

247
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
You can't take her away.

248
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,400
Grandfather.

249
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,000
Grandfather.

250
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
You can't take her away.

251
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
What are you doing?

252
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,200
Get down.

253
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,000
Grandfather.

254
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,200
Yanyan, are you hurt?

255
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm not hurt.

256
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,400
Grandfather,

257
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,000
help Ke to justice.

258
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
I saw

259
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Deng Shoumei

260
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
burning the meeting place.

261
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
General Li

262
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
insisted on asking Ke for justice.

263
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,200
Yanyan, don't worry.

264
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Prime Minister Zhu, take care.

265
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
General Li,

266
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,400
this case should be handed over to Fuya.

267
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Which law

268
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,000
do you follow to take the body away?

269
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Guards, take her away.

270
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,000
Guards, take her away.

271
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,600
Guards, take her away.

272
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Guards, take her away.

273
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
Guards, take her away.

274
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Guards, take her away.

275
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,400
Prime Minister Zhu is right.

276
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,800
I was too hasty.

277
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,000
So this case

278
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
should be handed over to Fuya.

279
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,000
Let's go.

280
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,000
Great.

281
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,200
Great.

282
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Great.

283
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,200
Great.

284
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
It's okay.

285
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
Grandfather is here.

286
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,200
It's okay.

287
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
Thank you, Prime Minister Zhu.

288
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,400
Thank you all for

289
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,600
helping me

290
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
when I was in danger.

291
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,400
Thank you for your kindness.

292
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,600
Please go back and have a rest.

293
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,000
Thank you.

294
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,000
Thank you, Chief Guard.

295
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Thank you, Chief Guard.

296
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you, Chief Guard.

297
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thank you, Chief Guard.

298
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you, Chief Guard.

299
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Thank you, Chief Guard.

300
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,000
Brother, I have something to do.

301
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,800
I'll go first.

302
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,600
You...

303
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,800
Slow down.

304
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,600
Ke, don't be sad.

305
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,000
Liu De and Qingshan are here.

306
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,000
It's not a lie.

307
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,400
This is my first time

308
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
hosting the flowers show.

309
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Ke,

310
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
we'll hold

311
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,000
a bigger one next year.

312
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Yes.

313
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll go every day.

314
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,800
I support you.

315
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,200
Okay.

316
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,000
It's a deal.

317
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,800
Brother, if you're tired,

318
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,800
send Officer Li back to have a rest.

319
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,800
Okay.

320
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
Brother, your foot is injured.

321
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,400
I'll send them back first.

322
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,600
Luo,

323
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,600
if you send Tiantian,

324
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
who will send Ke?

325
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,600
I'll send him.

326
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
Brother, look.

327
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
They'll send me back.

328
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Don't worry.

329
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,800
Officer Li, please.

330
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,200
Let's go.

331
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,400
Let's go.

332
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Brother,

333
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,200
your leg is badly injured.

334
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
You need to be treated.

335
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,600
Luo,

336
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,400
send Boss He back to have a rest.

337
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,600
The best doctor will take care of him.

338
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,400
No need.

339
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,800
I can send Ke back.

340
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,200
Boss He, don't force yourself.

341
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
If you don't treat your wound in time,

342
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
you'll get sick.

343
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Brother,

344
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Luo is right.

345
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
You need to be treated.

346
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
If you're free,

347
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I'll go to Heji to see you and Tiantian.

348
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Don't worry.

349
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Qin, Luo,

350
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,800
please.

351
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,400
Go.

352
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Sister, don't worry.

353
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
I'll go.

354
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,600
Let's go.

355
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Brother Luo,

356
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,000
we're walking so slowly.

357
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,800
When will we get home?

358
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Not yet.

359
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
The slower, the better.

360
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,200
Brother Luo,

361
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
thank you.

362
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,800
The more beautiful the flowers are,

363
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,800
the less regretful I'll be.

364
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,800
I see the flowers in the branches.

365
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Brother Luo,

366
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
you're injured.

367
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Does it hurt?

368
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,400
It's okay.

369
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
I'll go.

370
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
What's the matter?

371
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Brother Luo,

372
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
from now on,

373
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
I'll be with you,

374
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
protect you,

375
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
and be with you.

376
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Luo,

377
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,200
thank you for bringing my sister back.

378
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
It's getting late.

379
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,800
I won't invite you to tea.

380
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Brother Luo,

381
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,800
Tiantian is waiting for us.

382
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Don't worry.

383
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Go in.

384
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Go.

385
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Go.

386
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Don't let anyone else worry.

387
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
I'll go in first.

388
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
I wonder how he is now.

389
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Who is it?

390
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Lian Yan, it's me.

391
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Are you okay?

392
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Every time I meet you,

393
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
I can be a flower in the wind.

394
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
I'm also recalling

395
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
the fear you've unleashed.

396
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,800
I thought I was not meant to be.

397
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Our fate has been destined.

398
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Why are you here?

399
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
I secretly escorted you back.

400
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
I'm worried about you.

401
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I'm waiting at the roof.

402
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm a little worried about you.

403
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
So you...

404
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
You've been at the roof?

405
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Did you walk too fast?

406
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Did you get a cold?

407
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm fine.

408
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
I'm fine.

409
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Are you hurt anywhere?

410
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm fine.

411
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
How's your injury?

412
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
I'm fine.

413
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I'm afraid you were scared last night.

414
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I'm a little worried.

415
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
So I came to ask you.

416
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
You're so silly.

417
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
This is the medicine for my special injury.

418
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Here you go.

419
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
You prepared the medicine for me?

420
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Hurry up.

421
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Remember to apply the medicine on time.

422
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Okay, I'm leaving.

423
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
You're useless.

424
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
You're useless.

425
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
How can you forgive me for my incompetence?

426
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
I'm killing you now.

427
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Can you solve the problem?

428
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
It's all Zhu Xiangyang and Zhu Yan Yan's fault.

429
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
If so,

430
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
who blocked your way

431
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
should pay the price.

432
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Do I have to teach you this?

433
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Yes.

434
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I understand.

435
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
I'm so angry.

436
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
I'm so angry.

437
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
It's here.

438
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
It's Deng Mei Guan who set the fire.

439
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
He didn't do anything good

440
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
but set the fire in the department store.

441
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Is he crazy?

442
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I've been working with him

443
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
in the official media office for more than ten years.

444
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I know he's very angry

445
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
with me and the world's first Mei.

446
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
But I didn't expect

447
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
he would be so confused.

448
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
He wasn't a big villain.

449
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
He was just too stubborn

450
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
and he didn't do anything right.

451
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Congratulations.

452
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
I envy you.

453
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
You're so lucky.

454
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Shu,

455
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
what do you mean?

456
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Nothing.

457
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
I just envy you.

458
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I envy you for being born in the world's first Mei

459
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
and studying in the Cloud Garden.

460
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
We Mei Guan

461
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
can't compare to you in our whole life.

462
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Shu,

463
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
it's just a responsibility

464
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
to be the Mei Guan.

465
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
It's about leading the Mei Guan

466
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
to fulfill the wishes of the people.

467
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Well said.

468
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
I wonder

469
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
if I'll be able to do that

470
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
in my whole life.

471
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
I look ugly when I cry.

472
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Not ugly.

473
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I think Ake is the most beautiful person

474
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
and my favorite person.

475
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I'll always protect you

476
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
and keep you safe

477
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
so that you can spend your whole life

478
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
in peace and happiness.

479
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Ake,

480
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
from now on,

481
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
let me be with you,

482
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
protect you,

483
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
and be with you.

484
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Shu,

485
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
you...

486
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Ake,

487
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
you must be tired.

488
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Go back to your room and rest.

489
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Daughter,

490
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
are you scared?

491
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Why are you laughing?

492
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
You two little rascals,

493
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
where are you going?

494
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Where are you going?

495
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
We're not going.

496
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
If you don't come back with Ake,

497
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
how can I tell you?

498
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Father,

499
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
don't scold them.

500
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
I asked Brother to send Manager Li.

501
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Tian Tian and Brother Xian got hurt.

502
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Ake also went to send them.

503
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
They've been working all night.

504
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Father and Mother,

505
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
you should rest.

506
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
We'll go to rest too.

507
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Go, go, go.

508
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Go, go, go.

509
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Go, go, go.

510
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
You two little rascals,

511
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
you're not familiar with each other.

512
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
I'm here.

513
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Come on.

514
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
I'll go and get you some food.

515
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Go.

516
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Go.

517
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
What are you doing?

518
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Go.

519
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Go.

520
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Go.

521
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Go.

522
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Go.

523
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Go.

524
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Go.

525
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Go.

526
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Go.

527
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Go.

528
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Go.

529
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Go.

530
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Go.

531
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Go.

532
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Go.

533
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Go.

534
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Go.

535
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Go.

536
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Go.

537
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Go.

538
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Go.

539
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Go.

540
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,880
Mother.

541
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,080
I cannot rest assured of you. I came to visit you.

542
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,000
Today, I made you feel wronged.

543
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,960
There are so many people talking for me. I won't feel wronged anymore.

544
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,000
Mother, in the past, I wanted the label the most,

545
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Because when I saw you wear it, you were very bright.

546
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,400
But now I know that the world's first beauty is not only honor,

547
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
but also responsibility.

548
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,300
The beauty is done. The beauty is done.

549
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,000
I only wanted you to remember these eight words first.

550
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,400
When you grow up,

551
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,600
you will understand and shoulder the responsibility.

552
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,000
I didn't think you would understand so quickly.

553
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,200
Ake, if you want to continue walking down this path,

554
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,000
you will surely meet people of all kinds and dangers.

555
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,600
If that's the case, are you still willing to continue?

556
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,400
I am your daughter and the most important successor in the world.

557
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,000
Even if there is no way, I will still find a way.

558
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,600
You are good at saying big words.

559
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,400
But on this path, your father, mother, big brother, second brother,

560
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,600
we will all accompany you and continue walking together.

561
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Yes. And Brother Lu too.

562
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,600
He will accompany me and protect me and help me solve all kinds of problems.

563
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,200
Is that so?

564
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,400
Mother, actually Brother Lu has been helping me.

565
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Yesterday, the flowers were so big.

566
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,000
Ake, you must be hungry.

567
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,400
I will tell them to make you something delicious.

568
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,200
Mother.

569
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,000
Jin hall

570
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,000
You came out after getting hurt?

571
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,280
I just hurt my head.

572
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,840
Your back injury has not been healed yet.

573
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,600
Just rest for a few days.

574
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,600
I've asked Lu Yi to go to the pharmacy

575
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,600
to get the medicine for a fever.

576
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,000
Thank you, brother.

577
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,000
Master.

578
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,000
Come in.

579
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,040
Master, are you okay?

580
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,240
I'm fine.

581
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,560
The fire of the Hundred Flower Society

582
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,840
is not a small matter.

583
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,280
Now that Deng Meiguan is dead,

584
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,320
the Queen of Five will certainly find another way to deal with it.

585
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,720
Ake has repeatedly destroyed his plan.

586
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,800
The Queen of Five will definitely not let him off.

587
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,920
Lu Yi,

588
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,320
keep an eye on Ake

589
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,560
and ensure his safety.

590
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,560
Yes.

591
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,520
At this time,

592
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,920
I have to remind that person

593
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,280
to make an early decision.

594
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,440
Brother,

595
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,600
there are so many medicines.

596
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,040
I can't finish them all by myself.

597
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,000
This bottle is for you.

598
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,520
I'll send the rest to Ake.

599
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,120
You...

600
00:23:51,760 --> 00:24:10,320
You're so

601
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,280
I can only say it

602
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,800
to make him more worried.

603
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,720
It's not my nature.

604
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,640
This Wan Hu Lu.

605
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,320
It seems that I have to help him.

606
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,640
Zhu Xi.

607
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,920
Don't be a fool.

608
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,280
I'm not.

609
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,720
Brother, don't wrong me.

610
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,000
Brother Lu is so good to me.

611
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm also very happy.

612
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,160
I can't just be distracted.

613
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,160
I have to find the person who has an engagement with me first

614
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
and explain it clearly.

615
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,080
Brother Lu.

616
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,920
Brother Lu.

617
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,480
Could it be Brother Lu?

618
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,080
Brother Lu.

619
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,160
Ake.

620
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,560
Brother Lu.

621
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,640
Brother Lu.

622
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,880
Brother Lu.

623
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,880
Brother Lu.

624
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,840
Brother Lu.

625
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,200
How many young concubines did Brother Lu

626
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,800
meet by tão time

627
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,680
to greet you at the LOL meal?

628
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,160
I don't want to talk about them carefully.

629
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
But I'm afraid that I'll be re eighth to

630
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,040
meet you in person.

631
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,640
If it was our sometime long time ago,

632
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,440
I wouldn't be able to meet Ake at all.

633
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,360
Why don't you get in first

634
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,640
since I don't want to make things worse.

635
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,160
I'm here to deliver your medicine.

636
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,160
You must have absorbed a lot of opium

637
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,440
in your fire field today.

638
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,440
There are some medicine for the lung,

639
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,960
some medicine for the heat,

640
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,480
and some medicine for calming your mind.

641
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,600
So many medicines?

642
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,000
Thank you, Brother Lu.

643
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,680
You're so nice to me.

644
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,400
Ke.

645
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,080
I'm sorry.

646
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,880
I'm sorry.

647
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,760
I'm sorry.

648
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,640
I'm sorry.

649
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,440
I'm sorry.

650
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,240
Ke.

651
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,920
Actually, today I still...

652
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,720
Brother Lu.

653
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,480
I...

654
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,480
I have a doubt.

655
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,000
What is it?

656
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,400
Yesterday, Deng Yi said

657
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,840
he was involved in the trap.

658
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,320
It means someone instigated him to set fire.

659
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,280
That's right.

660
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,800
Who could it be?

661
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,480
He's so ruthless.

662
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,760
He instigated Deng Yi to set fire.

663
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,040
And why did he stay in the fire

664
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,720
after he set fire?

665
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,400
Actually, I met a man in black yesterday.

666
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,200
I think

667
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,960
it's the chief behind the scene

668
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,480
who sent someone to kill Deng Mei.

669
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,040
Then,

670
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,760
who's behind the scene?

671
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,440
Wu An Hou.

672
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,560
Wu An Hou?

673
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,040
My mother rejected his request before.

674
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,880
Is this the bad news?

675
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,560
Tao Shou Mei is the best in the world.

676
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,720
She has achieved countless wishes.

677
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,400
You should have known it

678
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,520
when you were in the base.

679
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,720
I was so worried.

680
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,680
I was so worried.

681
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,720
I was so worried.

682
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,760
I was so worried.

683
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,720
I was so worried.

684
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,760
I was so worried.

685
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,560
I knew

686
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,840
that no matter how many officials

687
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,400
would come to the door

688
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,840
to congratulate Tao Shou Mei's daughter.

689
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,920
That's the wish

690
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,120
my mother has made countless times.

691
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,480
Does Wu An Hou

692
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,360
want to control Guan Mei Ting

693
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,880
through my mother

694
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,160
and control the marriage

695
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,600
of these people through Guan Mei Ting?

696
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,160
Yes.

697
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,320
He wants to grow up

698
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,440
his career

699
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,640
through Guan Mei Ting.

700
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,560
He pulled Tao Shou Mei's tail

701
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,920
and helped Deng Mei.

702
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,600
But you broke his plan

703
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,720
again and again.

704
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,400
He was so cruel to you.

705
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,760
Even if he can't burn you to death,

706
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,040
he can make you suffer.

707
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,760
It's so horrible.

708
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,600
No wonder my mother said

709
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,040
this road is not easy to walk.

710
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,320
So that's what it means.

711
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,880
Ke.

712
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,400
Are you afraid?

713
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,920
How can I be afraid?

714
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,240
I want him to see

715
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,080
that the first few bones in our world

716
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,440
are not so easy to be cut off.

717
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,280
I won't allow Guan Mei Ting

718
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,960
to be sacrificed by others.

719
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,600
Ke.

720
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,880
You are so brave.

721
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,320
I will protect you.

722
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,560
Thank you, Brother Lu.

723
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,960
Actually, I...

724
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,440
Tang.

725
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,640
Are you asleep?

726
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,080
Come on.

727
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,000
Hide.

728
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,640
This way.

729
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,720
Hurry.

730
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,560
Tang.

731
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,480
I'm here.

732
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,280
I'm here.

733
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,160
I'm here.

734
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,480
Aunt made some ginseng soup.

735
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,760
I'll bring it to you.

736
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,720
Just leave it there.

737
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,000
I'll drink it later.

738
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,720
Tang.

739
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,800
Why are you standing by the window?

740
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,600
I'm hot.

741
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,800
I'm cool.

742
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,440
Go to have a rest.

743
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,400
Lu...

744
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,920
It's too late.

745
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,760
You should go to bed early.

746
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,240
You should go to bed early too.

747
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,520
See you tomorrow.

748
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,600
Close the door.

749
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,640
Don't get cold.

750
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,760
Okay.

751
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,920
I'm drunk.

752
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,640
Ke.

753
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,440
You came early to clean up?

754
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,880
Deng Yi used to come early.

755
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,080
He used to clean up.

756
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,000
Now Deng Yi is gone.

757
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,440
I'll clean up.

758
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,160
It's a pity that Deng Shoumei

759
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,160
is so smart.

760
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,080
But he doesn't understand.

761
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,720
I've been in Guanmei Hall for years.

762
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,200
I know he doesn't like your mother.

763
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,720
But I didn't expect

764
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,840
he could do such a stupid thing.

765
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,440
Forget it.

766
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,040
He's gone.

767
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,400
My mother was sad for him last night.

768
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,200
Ke.

769
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,080
You and your mother are good people.

770
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,160
By the way,

771
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,760
Zhao Meiguan.

772
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,760
This is the official document from the government office.

773
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,600
The protest is about to start this year.

774
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,880
Don't waste money.

775
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,360
The government office will register all men

776
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,560
who are not married yet

777
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,600
at their age.

778
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,680
If that's the case...

779
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,640
Guanmei Hall Lawyer, please take the invitation.

780
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,200
Yes.

781
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,080
Guanmei Hall Lawyer, please take the invitation.

782
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,960
Why did he take it?

783
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,320
Why did he take it?

784
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,360
It's so early.

785
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,800
What's the matter?

786
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,240
Ke.

787
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,080
This is yours, too.

788
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,880
Here you are.

789
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,000
Ke.

790
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,920
You're the famous person in Guanmei Hall now.

791
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,320
Everyone.

792
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,360
I have a favor to ask you.

793
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,240
So many invitations to Shoumei Hall.

794
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,880
I can't do it alone.

795
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,880
If I do it alone,

796
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,280
I'm afraid it will delay the wedding of Xi Ke.

797
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,160
Our Guanmei Hall is a whole.

798
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,760
I hope everyone can get a invitation

799
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,840
and explain the situation clearly.

800
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,640
Then record the situation in Xi Ke's house

801
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,600
and the requirements.

802
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
We can do these invitations together.

803
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,120
We can share the money together.

804
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,000
It's great.

805
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,960
It's great.

806
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,920
Thank you, Ke.

807
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,640
Here.

808
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,760
Take it.

809
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,960
It's yours.

810
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,200
Here.

811
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,600
So beautiful.

812
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,120
Mr. Shen.

813
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,720
I want to ask for your name.

814
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,480
We can share the name together.

815
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,400
This is my address and your name.

816
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,720
Please take care of the wedding.

817
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,920
Mr. Shen.

818
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,200
I like a young lady.

819
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,280
Mr. Shen, can you ask for my name?

820
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,080
Okay.

821
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,680
I want to ask you to do it for me, too.

822
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,640
Okay.

823
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,480
I want you to do it for me, too.

824
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,120
Let me do it.

825
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,600
Everyone.

826
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,880
Listen to me.

827
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,880
Thank you for your kindness.

828
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,320
But there are so many plum trees.

829
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,480
I can't run here alone.

830
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,560
I'm afraid I'll be late for your wedding.

831
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,040
I've received your requests.

832
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,080
From today on,

833
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,360
we, Guanmei Tian,

834
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,880
will send an excellent plum official

835
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,200
to your house to record the wedding.

836
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,560
I'll be ready

837
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,160
to take you on a blind date.

838
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,200
Okay.

839
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,080
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

840
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,880
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

841
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,520
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

842
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,080
Give it to me.

843
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,080
Okay.

844
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,600
Ke is the most popular plum official

845
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,040
in the capital.

846
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,480
Brother Luo.

847
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,360
I've received so many requests for plum.

848
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,440
How do you plan to clear it?

849
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,680
I'll have two pieces of sweet and red bean paste every day.

850
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,720
Ke is now a backup.

851
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,400
When the plum is over,

852
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,840
the plum position is vacant.

853
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,920
Now you're one step closer to your dream.

854
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,920
Mr. Shen.

855
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,560
You're so young and so benevolent.

856
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,000
I think you're the only one

857
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,280
who can take the plum position.

858
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,440
Mr. Shen, please ask for my name, too.

859
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:55,880
Okay.

860
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,520
Thank you.

861
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,480
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

862
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,760
Is it plum?

863
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,520
Brother Luo.

864
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,440
Actually, I've thought about it.

865
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
It's not important

866
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,960
if I can be the plum.

867
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,600
Everyone loves to take care of our plum court.

868
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,520
Relying on us plum officials

869
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,440
is what makes me happy.

870
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,000
My dream

871
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,400
was to guard this plum court for my mother.

872
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,080
But now,

873
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,480
I want to guard this plum court

874
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,640
for myself and all the guests.

875
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,720
As long as I'm in the plum court,

876
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,960
I'll take the responsibility

877
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,120
and tell everyone

878
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,000
to guard this plum court.

879
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,520
Brother Luo.

880
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,880
I have work to do.

881
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,240
Wait for me.

882
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,200
Okay.

883
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,560
I'll go buy some sweet and red bean paste.

884
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,000
Come on.

885
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,200
Mr. Wang's marriage is so hard to say.

886
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,320
His information is...

887
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,200
Shi Wa Ke.

888
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,240
They're all here.

889
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,200
Is Shi Wa Ke here?

890
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,280
Shi Wa Ke.

891
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,200
Is Shi Wa Ke here?

892
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,920
Shi Wa Ke.

893
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,200
Come here.

894
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,640
Come on.

895
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,840
Look.

896
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,960
They're all here.

897
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,960
Mr. Zhou.

898
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,080
What's the matter?

899
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,800
Tell me.

900
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,320
Well.

901
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,240
My marriage with Tiantian

902
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,360
is coming soon.

903
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,880
I saw the flowers show

904
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,840
you hosted.

905
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,120
It's good.

906
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,080
Not bad.

907
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,040
So I want you

908
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,040
to host the wedding for us.

909
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,160
Tiantian told me

910
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,840
you're best friends.

911
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,760
So she must be willing to host the wedding.

912
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,360
About the money,

913
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,960
you're in this relationship.

914
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,480
We're still talking about money.

915
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,080
Right?

916
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,800
You've been studying for more than ten years.

917
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,640
You're still young.

918
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,200
You're going to marry Yao Yi without a name.

919
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,560
What a coincidence.

920
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,320
The government is fighting for Yao Yi.

921
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,720
You're going to marry Tiantian.

922
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,880
I'm afraid no lady is willing to marry you.

923
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,240
That's why you're marrying Tiantian

924
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,520
to avoid Yao Yi, right?

925
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,480
So what?

926
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,400
We're engaged.

927
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,000
I can marry him as I want.

928
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,400
In that case,

929
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,200
I've prepared a marriage certificate for you.

930
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,640
Please sign it.

931
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,360
Here.

932
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,720
You're thoughtful.

933
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,560
Marriage certificate?

934
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,800
Who wants to get married?

935
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,520
Mr. Zhou.

936
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,000
I prepared this marriage certificate for you.

937
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,440
After you sign it,

938
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,960
you'll have nothing to do with Tiantian.

939
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,880
From now on, you'll be married

940
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,400
and have a good life.

941
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,960
Bullshit.

942
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,640
I'll never cancel the marriage.

943
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,200
I told you to cancel it.

944
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,720
Cancel it.

945
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,600
Cancel it.

946
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,560
Cancel it.

947
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,080
I told you to cancel it.

948
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,000
Cancel it.

949
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,080
Fine.

950
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,000
Mr. Zhou.

951
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,200
You don't know the rules of our Guanmei Hall, do you?

952
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,680
You...

953
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,360
The marriage certificate of canceling the marriage

954
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,120
is as effective as

955
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,040
the official document of the Guanmei Hall.

956
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,800
I asked you to sign it to save your face.

957
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,600
Shiba Ke.

958
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,360
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

959
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,600
You think you can talk like a pig?

960
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,320
You...

961
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,040
A man

962
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,320
can't do that to a woman.

963
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,600
Let go of me.

964
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,600
Who are you? Let go of me.

965
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,040
Shi Meiguan.

966
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,360
How do you deal with this crazy man?

967
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,040
Cut his hand

968
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,560
or cut his leg?

969
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,400
Well...

970
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,400
I have to think about it.

971
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,480
Cut his hand

972
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,920
or cut his leg?

973
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,040
It's so hard for me to choose.

974
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,800
Say it.

975
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,920
We're all friends.

976
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,640
Shi Meiguan.

977
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,840
I know I'm wrong.

978
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,360
I'll sign it now.

979
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,400
Mr. Zhu.

980
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,760
Won't it be too hard?

981
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,680
No, no.

982
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,880
I'm willing to do it.

983
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,960
You just let him let me go.

984
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,560
I'll sign it now.

985
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,560
Take it away.

986
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,320
Sign it. Sign it.

987
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,040
I'll let you go.

988
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,240
Hurry.

989
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,960
Where's the pen?

990
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,320
You can bite your finger.

991
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,520
Let's press it together.

992
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,320
I...

993
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,360
No, no.

994
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,160
It's hard to bite my finger.

995
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,520
Hurry up.

996
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,560
I...

997
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,200
I'll bite it.

998
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,000
I'll bite it.

999
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,080
Okay.

1000
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,080
Okay, okay.

1001
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,280
Okay, Mr. Zhu.

1002
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,600
When I sign the other one,

1003
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,360
I'll send it to your home.

1004
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,360
Get out.

1005
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,920
Okay.

1006
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,920
Thank you for your help.

1007
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,000
By the way,

1008
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,760
I'm going to send this to Tiantian.

1009
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,040
Or you can go with me.

1010
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay.

1011
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,960
Let's go.

1012
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,840
Tiantian.

1013
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,720
I'll help you with the engagement.

1014
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,960
You're a beauty in the middle of life and death.

1015
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,120
When Zhu Yizhi was in a big fire,

1016
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,320
he left you alone to escape.

1017
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,200
He's so cruel.

1018
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,360
The engagement is important.

1019
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,840
But the one who marries a woman who loves you and treats you well

1020
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,960
is the most important.

1021
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,920
I didn't expect that I couldn't keep my parents' engagement.

1022
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,560
Tiantian.

1023
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,480
I'll make the decision for you this time.

1024
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,520
The happiness of your second half is the most important.

1025
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,560
I hope

1026
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
you can find someone you really like.

1027
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,160
Brother.

1028
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,640
I and Zhu Yizhi will break the engagement.

1029
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,760
From now on,

1030
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'll never be a part of this engagement

1031
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,360
and neglect my happiness.

1032
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,560
Tiantian.

1033
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,440
Don't be afraid.

1034
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,160
I'll find you a good wife.

1035
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,400
I'll help you.

1036
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,280
Okay.

1037
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,560
I'll help you.

1038
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,160
I'll help you.

1039
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,360
I'll help you.

1040
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,800
I'll help you.

1041
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,320
I'll help you.

1042
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,680
I'll help you.

1043
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,880
I'll help you.

1044
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,080
I'll help you.

1045
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,960
I'll help you.

1046
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,360
I'm not

1047
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,080
being controlled by an empty agreement.

1048
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,960
Brother Lu.

1049
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,520
People

1050
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,000
shouldn't be so cold-hearted.

1051
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,640
They should look at the people around them.

1052
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,480
Come with me.

1053
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,640
Okay.

1054
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,000
Brother Lu.

1055
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,560
Do you know why I brought you here?

1056
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,640
This marriage tree is famous in the capital.

1057
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,320
Rumor has it that the two names

1058
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,200
are engraved on the stone

1059
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,120
and the ribbon is hung on the tree.

1060
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,120
Then it becomes a beautiful marriage.

1061
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,320
I know this meeting

1062
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,160
is the grace of fate.

1063
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,200
Every time I see you,

1064
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,960
I only feel the love and stubbornness.

1065
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,000
Although I can't remember

1066
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,600
every difficult day,

1067
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,760
I never forget the first time

1068
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,880
we met.

1069
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,920
Even if love is endless,

1070
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,480
never-ending,

1071
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,480
no matter the wind or the moon,

1072
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,680
as long as you are never gone,

1073
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,160
I'll always be with you.

1074
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,520
No matter the world or the fire,

1075
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,040
I'll always be with you.

1076
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,160
I'll protect you with my life.

1077
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,360
I used to be a human being

1078
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,720
and I promised to follow my dream.

1079
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,480
But now I know

1080
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,880
marriage is not only about promises,

1081
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,080
but also about love and hate.

1082
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,040
There's fate and fate.

1083
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,560
So today,

1084
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,080
I'll return the marriage

1085
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,080
between me and my brother to you.

1086
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,120
No matter the world or the fire,

1087
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,480
I'll always be with you.

1088
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,680
Please remember the youth

1089
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,120
I used to have.

1090
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:29,880
I'll always be with you.

1091
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,440
A man should not be left alone.

1092
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,680
He should look at his surroundings.

1093
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,120
So today,

1094
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,640
I'll return the marriage

1095
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,680
between me and my brother to you.

1096
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,640
Brother.

1097
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,800
Brother.

1098
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,680
It's been an hour already.

1099
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,200
Did you make your promise?

1100
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,400
What did I say?

1101
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,080
Bloody!

1102
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,320
Brother was infections for half an hour

1103
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,080
before opening and servers are finished.

1104
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,760
laf touches your hip as long as there are two hands,

1105
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,760
that's enough for me.

1106
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,640
YourJing Yu

1107
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,560
fell into a meltdown.

1108
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,440
Greetings, Bad Brother.

1109
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,000
You can just know each other

1110
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,840
Don't do this

1111
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,920
That's not what I mean

1112
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,320
You and my wife have experienced a lot

1113
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,120
To determine each other's feelings

1114
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,840
Such a big thing

1115
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,040
Of course, there must be a clear expression

1116
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,120
My wife

1117
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,280
The one who cares most

1118
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,600
But it's the person in my heart

1119
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,800
Precious to myself

1120
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,880
These are all in my sketchbook

1121
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,480
It makes sense

1122
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,360
Manager Li

1123
00:44:48,560 --> 00:45:09,400
This is

1124
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:09,960
Remember

1125
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,520
This card

1126
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:15,760
what

1127
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,120
What are you talking about?

1128
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,640
You're indeed going to tell my father.

1129
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,060
I've been paying attention for you so many times.

1130
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,340
Let me mention it first.

1131
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:11,420
Do you know about the

1132
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,080
work cancelling activity in thistalismans in my customs?

1133
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,080
I'm just saying that Lu Zhuoxi is not reliable.

1134
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,080
She said that she's a trickster and a traitor.

1135
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,080
Could she also say that

1136
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,080
the young lady likes to play the flute?

1137
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,080
I shouldn't have believed her.

1138
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,080
No.

1139
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,080
I came too early.

1140
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,080
Brother Lu!

1141
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,080
Ke, you're so cool.

1142
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,080
Ke!

1143
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:50,080
I know this meeting is the grace of fate.

1144
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,080
Every time I see you,

1145
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,080
I only feel the love and stubbornness.

1146
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,080
Although I can't remember

1147
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,080
every difficult day,

1148
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,080
I never forget the first time

1149
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,080
I saw you.

1150
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,080
Even if this love is heartless,

1151
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,080
silent, day or night,

1152
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,080
it doesn't matter if it's a stormy month.

1153
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,080
As long as you are never afraid,

1154
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,080
never afraid of worries,

1155
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,080
and never afraid of worries.

1156
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,080
No matter if this world is on fire,

1157
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,080
or if there will be any changes,

1158
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,080
I'm willing to face it with my own hands.

1159
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,080
I'm willing to face it with my own hands.

1160
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:44,080
I'm willing to face it with my own hands.

1161
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:49,080
Even if I can't see you as I see you,

1162
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,080
in front of me or in front of me,

1163
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,080
I'm still wholehearted.

1164
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:59,080
I only miss you all day.

1165
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,080
Even if the sky is blue or the sky is blue,

1166
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,080
I don't care about the past.

1167
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,720
Please remember the youth that once

1168
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,080
was so bright.

1169
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:21,080
From now on, I don't want to part with you.
