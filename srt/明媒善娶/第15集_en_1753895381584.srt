The flowers are in the branches.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The years are passing by.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know why

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you're worried.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Some people

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
want to repay

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but they have no money.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
To live a life

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
is the best way.

The Long Ballad

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 18

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ake, you're here.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Brother Lu, do you think

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
if we don't see each other for a long time

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and see each other again, we'll be happier than before?

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why don't we see each other for a long time?

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's just... For example,

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have something to do, you have something to do.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We won't bother each other.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Your thing is my thing.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You don't bother me, I don't bother you.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What does it mean?

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Do you know that I need

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
a quiet moment

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and a feeling of missing you?

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ake, are you annoyed with me

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and want to stay away from me?

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm talking about things, you're talking about the play.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We're not talking about

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
one thing.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then what is Ake talking about?

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why did you send Lu Yi to follow me?

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not following,

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
it's protecting.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's no movement after noon today.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's so abnormal.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There must be something wrong.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have to be careful

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to keep an eye on Ke'er's eyebrows.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But I'm afraid

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you'll be afraid of me if I tell you.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So I let Lu Yi

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
protect you secretly.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I thought

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
you sent someone to keep an eye on me

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
to find out where I am.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Brother Lu,

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I won't

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
blame you for nothing anymore.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's okay to blame me.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But in the future,

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
don't talk about missing you

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and not bother each other.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay, I know.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a deal.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay,

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
it's a deal.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Uncle called me here.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What can I do for you?

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Lu Zhu Xi from Xibao Pavilion

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
went to the mansion of Zhu Lao Pi

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
to propose marriage.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If his granddaughter

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
really marries that rascal,

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll be ashamed.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, I know what to do.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll go.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Give it to me.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ke, don't be angry.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Is the betrothal gift not enough?

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Besides the betrothal gift,

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
how about I add some shops?

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But,

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
how can you

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
value betrothal gifts more than your marriage?

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why?

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You rascal.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How much time have I spent on your wedding?

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're sitting here drinking tea and getting cold.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You're not in a hurry.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Brother Lu,

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
isn't it?

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It'll be over soon.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I can't run away.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Go.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Second Master.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Second Master,

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I brought back the things you want from the mountain.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you for your kindness.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm grateful.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But I need to go back and pack up.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
My marriage is important.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Please don't worry.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Lu Yi, let's go.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's go.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Go.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Is the wind okay?

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Come.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This time,

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it's twice as strong as last time.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I wonder if you're satisfied.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Brother Lu,

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you're really well prepared this time.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Although you said you wouldn't let us down

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
for the betrothal gift,

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
what's the use of you and me?

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Lu Zhu Xi has been in the house for days.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I wonder what he's doing again.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Sister Pan'er,

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
please ask Mr. Lu out.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We should go.

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Brother.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What's this bag?

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Lu Yi.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You asked Lu Yi to go back to the mountain

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
to get these?

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What's this?

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The ghost is moving.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Snow is falling on the mountain.

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Brother practices martial arts every day.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He wears clothes and clothes.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He still keeps a diet and medicine.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He's a foodie.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He's a good boy.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's lucky to have you.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So you still have these.

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I...

146
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Stop reading.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
These are for Yan Yan.

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What?

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can't even read this?

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
After Yan Yan finishes reading,

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll show you the part of writing the song.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can only show Yan Yan.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Brother,

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
let her do it.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She's been mad at herself

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
for crying several times a day

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
because she was afraid of the dark.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Brother.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Forget it.

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm not reading it.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I've recorded my life

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
from childhood

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and the beautiful memories

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
after meeting Yan Yan

165
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and happiness

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
in the mountain.

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I want to show these

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to Yan Yan and Mr. Xiang

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
so that they can know me better.

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then,

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Mr. Xiang can trust me

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and give Yan Yan to me.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Your book

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
is more precious

175
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
than those treasures.

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't worry.

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This wedding will be a success.

178
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yan Yan.

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is all the records

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
of Zhuxi's past?

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Not only the past,

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but also the thoughts

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
after meeting you.

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I just took a look.

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But Mr. Lu

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
didn't let me read it again.

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He said he wanted Yan Yan

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to be his first reader.

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
gave his own

192
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
unprotected to you.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He really loved you

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and was touched.

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Brother,

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
how can you say

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
such a cruel thing?

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I hope Yan Yan

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
can read it

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and feel the love

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
after reading it.

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I hope Yan Yan

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
can know me better

204
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and know my love for you.

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll go

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and ask my grandfather to come out.

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Wait.

208
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's go together.

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This time,

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
we can definitely

211
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
impress Mr. Xiang.

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.

213
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's go.

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Grandfather,

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yan Yan is here.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Grandfather.

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Grandfather.

218
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Grandfather.

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Grandfather.

220
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Grandfather.

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,320
Brother Zhu

222
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
Grandfather.

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Grandfather.

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Grandfather.

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,500
Grandfather, don't leave me behind.

226
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,880
Grandfather! Grandfather!

227
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,380
Don't leave me, grandfather.

228
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,100
Grandfather! Grandfather!

229
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,720
Come!

230
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,340
Little child.

231
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,940
Master exact,

232
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,100
go find the doctor!

233
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,540
No need.

234
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,440
Be good, practice.

235
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
Master exact,

236
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,860
who is at fault here?

237
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
Brother, Yan Yan has returned to his room.

238
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
Is there anything else I can do?

239
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
Judging from the body's toughness,

240
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,340
it's been a few hours.

241
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,340
Yan,

242
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,340
what...

243
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,340
What happened?

244
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,340
Brother,

245
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,340
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
I'm sorry.

247
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,340
I'm sorry.

248
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Yan Yan.

249
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,340
This is...

250
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,340
Uncle.

251
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,340
Yan Yan, don't be afraid.

252
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,340
I'm here.

253
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,340
Uncle.

254
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
Don't go.

255
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,340
Yan Yan,

256
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,340
I'm here.

257
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,340
Don't be afraid.

258
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,340
From now on,

259
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,340
I'll be with you.

260
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,340
I'll always be by your side.

261
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,340
Uncle,

262
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,340
don't leave me.

263
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
Don't be afraid.

264
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,340
I'm here.

265
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,340
Don't be afraid.

266
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,340
I'll always be with you.

267
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
Uncle.

268
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Yan Yan,

269
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,340
don't go.

270
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,340
I'm here.

271
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Yan Yan,

272
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,340
don't go.

273
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,340
I'm here.

274
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,340
Yan Yan,

275
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
don't go.

276
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,340
I'm here.

277
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,340
Yan Yan,

278
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
what if Yan Yan is hurt?

279
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,340
Ke, don't worry.

280
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,340
I'll protect you.

281
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
How dare you!

282
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,340
How dare you!

283
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,340
Who is so cruel?

284
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,340
I heard that

285
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,340
the magistrate gave Wu Anhou a hard time.

286
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
He refused Wu Anhou's marriage proposal.

287
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,340
If there's a mistake,

288
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,340
it's Wu Anhou.

289
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,340
But it's all our guess.

290
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,340
There's no evidence.

291
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,340
Ke,

292
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,340
I'm afraid.

293
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,340
Wu Anhou is already crazy.

294
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,340
I don't know who the next person will be.

295
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,340
I want to protect you.

296
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,340
But I can't be with you all the time.

297
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Brother Lu,

298
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,340
don't worry.

299
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,340
I'll be fine.

300
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,340
But there are some things that can't be done in life.

301
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,340
I'm afraid I'll be separated from you one day.

302
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,340
Brother Lu,

303
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,340
even if there's no separation,

304
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
as long as we're together,

305
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,340
we should cherish each other.

306
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,340
We should be true to each other.

307
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,340
Then we won't have any regrets.

308
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,340
We won't be afraid to be separated.

309
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,340
Not enough.

310
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,340
Not enough?

311
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Then hug me for a while.

312
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,340
Brother,

313
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,340
don't you think it's too strange?

314
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,340
That's the Prime Minister's Mansion.

315
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,340
Even if the guards are not strict,

316
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,340
they shouldn't be so quiet

317
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,340
when the Prime Minister is in danger.

318
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,340
Unless

319
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,340
there's no one to protect them.

320
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,340
Then we can't be together.

321
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,340
I'm afraid

322
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,340
I can't be with you.

323
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,340
I'm afraid

324
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,340
I can't be with you.

325
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,340
I'm afraid

326
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,340
unless

327
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
they've been deployed for a long time,

328
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
they'll decide from the beginning

329
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,340
that if they can't win the Prime Minister's favor,

330
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,340
they'll just kill him.

331
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,340
You're right.

332
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,340
But we don't have enough evidence

333
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,340
to prove everything.

334
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,340
We need to think about it.

335
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,340
The most important thing now

336
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,340
is to protect others.

337
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,340
We can't let more people get hurt.

338
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Brother,

339
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,340
after the death of the Prime Minister,

340
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,340
the Prime Minister's Mansion has only a few servants

341
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340
and a few servants.

342
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,340
If Yan Yan continues to live in the Prime Minister's Mansion,

343
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,340
I'm really worried.

344
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,340
I want to take care of her.

345
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,340
How do you want to take care of her?

346
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,340
I want to take her back to Qian Ya Mountain.

347
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,340
I want to be with her all the time.

348
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
That's right.

349
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,340
Now the enemy is under my control.

350
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,340
It should be the safety of the young lady.

351
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
I agree with you to go back to Qian Ya Mountain

352
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,340
to avoid the wind and light.

353
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,340
Brother, don't worry.

354
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,340
I will take good care of Yan Yan.

355
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
Yan Yan, don't be sad.

356
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,340
I have discussed with my brother.

357
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,340
Take you back to my house first.

358
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,340
No, I won't go.

359
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,340
I want to stay here with my grandfather.

360
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,340
Yan Yan,

361
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
look.

362
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,340
This is what grandfather wrote

363
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,340
before he died.

364
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
He agreed to our marriage

365
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,340
as soon as he died.

366
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,340
He didn't see me

367
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,340
just to test if I really loved him.

368
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Grandfather.

369
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,340
This is the last wish of grandfather.

370
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,340
He just wants you to be safe and happy

371
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,340
for the rest of your life.

372
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,340
Come with me.

373
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,340
I will be by your side

374
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,340
and protect you from the danger.

375
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,340
I will be with you

376
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,340
and keep you safe.

377
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,340
If I leave you

378
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,340
here alone,

379
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
how can I rest in peace?

380
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,340
How can I rest in peace

381
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,340
with the power of grandfather?

382
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
But I...

383
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,340
I have never left here.

384
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,340
I will ask my brother

385
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
to take care of Xiang Yan's mansion.

386
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,340
I will come back with you

387
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,340
after the dust settles.

388
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,340
Yan Yan,

389
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,340
believe me.

390
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,340
You will like my house.

391
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,340
It will be yours.

392
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,340
Zhu Xi,

393
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,340
where is your house?

394
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,340
Qian Ya Mountain.

395
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,340
Qian Ya Mountain

396
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,340
is the Qian Ya Mountain

397
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,340
in the legend?

398
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Yan Yan,

399
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,340
you know that

400
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,340
I am not a bad person.

401
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,340
Qian Ya Mountain

402
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,340
is not like the legend.

403
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
My brother and I

404
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,340
have our mission and responsibilities.

405
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,340
But I can't tell you more.

406
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,340
Please believe me.

407
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,340
I will never let you down.

408
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,340
I know, Zhu Xi.

409
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Zhu Xi,

410
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,340
I know you are a good person.

411
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,340
I know you are a good person.

412
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,340
That's enough.

413
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Yan Yan,

414
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,340
we have never been apart since we were kids.

415
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,340
Take care of yourself after you leave.

416
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,340
Yan Yan,

417
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,340
we will visit you when we are free.

418
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,340
Don't forget,

419
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,340
I will get you married.

420
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
Don't fight.

421
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,340
Write to me.

422
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,340
Take care of yourself.

423
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,340
Do you hear me?

424
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,340
Zhu Xi,

425
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,340
you have someone to take care of.

426
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,340
You should take good care of her.

427
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Brother, don't worry.

428
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,340
I know your way of talking.

429
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,340
Where is my sister?

430
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,340
You are about to have a family.

431
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,340
Why are you still so stubborn?

432
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,340
Oh, right.

433
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
These are your favorite pastries.

434
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,340
You can eat them on the way.

435
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,340
Thank you, my lady.

436
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
Tiantian.

437
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,340
Thank you.

438
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,340
You are welcome.

439
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,340
Yan Yan,

440
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,340
if you need anything, write to us.

441
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,340
I will make you all feel relieved.

442
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,340
I will also

443
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,340
make the ancestors' spirits in heaven rest in peace.

444
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
Although I

445
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,340
can't bear to leave the capital,

446
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,340
and I can't bear to leave you,

447
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,340
I am alone right now.

448
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
I am trying to

449
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
protect myself.

450
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
Instead of making trouble here,

451
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,340
I might as well go to a safe place

452
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,340
and hide.

453
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,340
Yan Yan, once you leave,

454
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
I don't know when we can meet again.

455
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
Ke,

456
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,340
if you miss Zhu Shan,

457
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,340
I can take you to see her anytime.

458
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,340
Alright, it's getting late.

459
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
Let's get going.

460
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
Yan Yan,

461
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
do you remember to miss me?

462
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,340
You must take care of yourself.

463
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,340
Do you hear me?

464
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
You too.

465
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
Yan Yan,

466
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,340
let's go.

467
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,340
I'm leaving.

468
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,340
Yan Yan,

469
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,340
let's go.

470
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,340
Let's go.

471
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
Yan Yan,

472
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,340
let's go.

473
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,340
Yan Yan,

474
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,340
let's go.

475
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,340
Yan Yan,

476
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,340
let's go.

477
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,340
Yan Yan,

478
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,340
let's go.

479
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,340
Yan Yan,

480
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,340
let's go.

481
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,340
Yan Yan,

482
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,340
let's go.

483
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,340
Yan Yan,

484
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,340
let's go.

485
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,340
Yan Yan,

486
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,340
let's go.

487
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,340
Yan Yan,

488
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
let's go.

489
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,340
Ke,

490
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,340
I have something to talk to you.

491
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,340
Brother Lu,

492
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
what are you going to talk about?

493
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,340
I want to talk about my matter.

494
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,540
I'm also responsible for it.

495
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,020
No, no, no.

496
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,100
Brother Lu,

497
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,780
don't say that to me.

498
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,700
I believe you're good people.

499
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,660
These are my secrets.

500
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,860
I'll tell you everything today.

501
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,940
Brother Lu,

502
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,260
I understand.

503
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,700
But

504
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,780
why did you say that?

505
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,500
I want you to know

506
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,820
everything I know.

507
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,660
Because

508
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,860
I want to marry you.

509
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,220
Brother Lu.

510
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,580
I wanted to come back to marry you

511
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,980
when the state of Ming was stable.

512
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,620
But

513
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,660
now the state of Ming is in danger.

514
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,820
The prime minister is in danger.

515
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
This reminds me

516
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,420
that I can't wait any longer.

517
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:11,940
Brother,

518
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,220
I know

519
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,980
you didn't think of getting married so soon.

520
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,020
But I only believe in you.

521
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,700
Brother,

522
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,220
I don't know if you want to marry me.

523
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,220
I do.

524
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,700
I do.

525
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,460
I love you.

526
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,580
The love

527
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,060
is in my hands.

528
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,620
You

529
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,900
are in my dream.

530
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,220
I

531
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,420
Thank you, brother.

532
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,420
I'm willing to see you.

533
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,740
Thank you for agreeing to me.

534
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,940
I finally have waited for this day.

535
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,140
Brother Lu,

536
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,180
I thank you too.

537
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,940
You finally let me wait for this day.

538
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,900
Since childhood,

539
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,500
I met the beggar brother

540
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,020
and made a promise to him.

541
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,620
When I met you after I grew up,

542
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,180
I have long thought

543
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,260
that you are the only one

544
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,060
I love in my life.

545
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,540
Since it's like this,

546
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,820
why should I waste my time?

547
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,500
I do nothing

548
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,140
but to persuade my guests

549
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,260
to cherish the present

550
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,460
and cherish the people in front of me.

551
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,740
I should do the same.

552
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,380
But...

553
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,220
But what?

554
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,620
Don't forget

555
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,220
I have my parents

556
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,940
and two brothers

557
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,540
who care about my sister the most.

558
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,540
Don't worry.

559
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,420
Leave them to me.

560
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,100
Okay.

561
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,380
Leave them to you.

562
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,820
Come on.

563
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,220
Master.

564
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,060
Aren't you winterizing the flowers

565
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,940
for that man today?

566
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,500
Why

567
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:24,940
why did you give them back

568
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,740
without moving them?

569
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,620
It's not that action.

570
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,860
I'm afraid that

571
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,220
people can only follow

572
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,620
It's contain some

573
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,140
crystal waves under the water.

574
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,940
Be careful not to escape

575
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,580
when you water it.

576
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,340
Butsorry noticed that

577
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,740
There must be a reason for it.

578
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,660
He must be planning something big.

579
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:50,860
Lu Yi.

580
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,780
I think he has made his arrangement.

581
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,380
Just keep an eye on the steward's whereabouts.

582
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,380
Yes.

583
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,340
Master.

584
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,900
The street committee is discussing the death of the prime minister.

585
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,700
What's the truth about it?

586
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,260
Don't worry.

587
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,740
He has made an arrangement.

588
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,140
We can only help him to get some information.

589
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,100
Yes.

590
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,180
Manager Li.

591
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,860
Sort out all the property in my name.

592
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,340
And send it to the city.

593
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,660
Master.

594
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,340
What are you doing?

595
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,500
Although we're in danger,

596
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,740
we shouldn't

597
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,500
go to the place where we sell our property.

598
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,900
It's not selling.

599
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,220
It's getting married.

600
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,660
We're in a dilemma.

601
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,420
To protect Ake,

602
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,940
we have to marry him.

603
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,740
I can only rest assured if I stay by his side every day.

604
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,580
I see.

605
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,940
You scared me.

606
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,300
Don't worry.

607
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,340
I'll do it right away.

608
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,700
I'll make sure all the property in your name

609
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
is counted clearly and clearly.

610
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,780
And send it to the city.

611
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,620
As long as Ake is willing,

612
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,780
he can do anything.

613
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,900
Chief Lu.

614
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,100
Don't be nervous.

615
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,100
Just tell him your true feelings.

616
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,060
Okay.

617
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,980
Sorry to keep you waiting.

618
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,900
Gui Fang.

619
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,060
Why are you here today?

620
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,540
Chief Lu is here too.

621
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,260
Why are you here together?

622
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,220
Tao Shoumei.

623
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,340
I'm not here to steal.

624
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,500
Chief Lu made me a matchmaker

625
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,980
to marry Ake.

626
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,300
It's gone.

627
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,620
smoke

628
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,580
Tao Shoumei.

629
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,420
Look.

630
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:10,980
I've been a matchmaker for so many years

631
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,540
The gift list Chief Lu carried

632
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,780
I'm satisfied with your sincerity.

633
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,620
I, Lu Chi,

634
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,900
sincerely beg Ake today

635
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,620
to give up all the wealth

636
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,260
and only protect Ake's safety.

637
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,860
I'll do it.

638
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,300
You rascal!

639
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,540
You really have a bad heart for my daughter.

640
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,180
You...

641
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,580
You two little rascals.

642
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,220
What are you doing, Xunlan?

643
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,300
What are you doing?

644
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,700
I told you to look after your sister.

645
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,380
Enough.

646
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,500
Be quiet.

647
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,300
Mr. Lu, please be polite.

648
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,060
You look talented and graceful.

649
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,940
It's true that you have some fate

650
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,660
for Ake.

651
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,100
I often hear you praise you at home

652
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,100
and say that you help him a lot.

653
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,220
But Ake is still young.

654
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,180
You two have been together for a short time.

655
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,420
As an elder,

656
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,100
I don't know much about your family.

657
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,060
As Ake's mother,

658
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,620
how can you be so careless

659
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,300
in your children's marriage?

660
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,620
After all, our Shi family

661
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,700
only has one daughter.

662
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,740
Aunt, I understand.

663
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,980
Although I've been with Ake for a short time,

664
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,420
we've experienced

665
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,700
something that others haven't.

666
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,620
We share the same thoughts.

667
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,500
Aunt, don't worry.

668
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,420
After marriage,

669
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
I'll continue to support Ake

670
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,500
and make him a good matchmaker.

671
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,540
I won't delay his career.

672
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,100
Please,

673
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,820
Aunt, help me.

674
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,060
Tang Jian, go to the front hall.

675
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,420
Mr. Lu is here with Zhao Meiguan

676
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,820
to propose to you.

677
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,380
But if Aunt and them...

678
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,140
So fast.

679
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,340
Tao Shoumei,

680
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,820
how about asking Ake?

681
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Hello, Zhao Meiguan.

682
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,420
Father, mother, two brothers.

683
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,420
Ake.

684
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,740
Hello, Brother Lu.

685
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,260
You don't have any rules.

686
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,300
You're Meiguan yourself.

687
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
You don't know this kind of thing.

688
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,140
You must show respect to your parents first.

689
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,820
It's not proper for a girl

690
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,860
to show her face.

691
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,660
Mr. Lu,

692
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,940
you know our family well.

693
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,220
We have two sons

694
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,260
and one daughter.

695
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,340
May I ask

696
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,580
what's going on in Mr. Lu's family?

697
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,500
There are only me and my brother Lu Zhu Xi.

698
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,900
My parents are all dead.

699
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,220
They're not related in family.

700
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,540
In the Western Treasures Pavilion,

701
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,780
Lu Yi and Li Pan'er

702
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,820
are like my brothers

703
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,980
and my relatives.

704
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,780
Then where is your ancestor?

705
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,020
Mother,

706
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,140
Brother Lu is an outsider.

707
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,820
I didn't ask you, Shifake.

708
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,540
Go back to your room if you want to talk more.

709
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,100
I'm...

710
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,060
I'm from Mount Qianya.

711
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,700
Mount Qianya?

712
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,780
Is it the Mount Qianya

713
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,820
with many bandits?

714
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,980
Why didn't you say so earlier?

715
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,100
Mother,

716
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,780
Mount Qianya is not what you think.

717
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,620
Brother Lu and his brother Lu Zhu Xi

718
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,460
are all good people.

719
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,300
They never did anything

720
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,420
that hurt others.

721
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,180
Don't believe the rumors.

722
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,140
Ake,

723
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,620
listen to the rumors.

724
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,340
Be strict.

725
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,380
If they didn't do anything bad,

726
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,140
why are people all saying that?

727
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,500
Brother Lu is not a bad person.

728
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,500
Lu Yi is not.

729
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,260
Mr. Lu,

730
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,620
I can't allow you

731
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,220
to be involved in this matter.

732
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,540
Ake is still young

733
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,740
and he's very lucky.

734
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,300
You two have known each other for a short time.

735
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,060
I'm afraid it's not appropriate

736
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,100
to talk about marriage now.

737
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,300
Not to mention Ake,

738
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,620
his two brothers have not married yet.

739
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,900
Since ancient times, they haven't been married

740
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,380
and they are still young.

741
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,620
Mr. Lu, please come back today.

742
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,940
Please go back.

743
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,060
Mother,

744
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,060
Brother Lu and I have known each other for a short time.

745
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,940
When we were young,

746
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,860
Brother Lu was in the capital.

747
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,180
I met him.

748
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,220
At that time,

749
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,940
I wanted to give him our gold medal.

750
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,940
He thought it was too expensive and refused to take it.

751
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,940
So I gave him a little snack.

752
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,140
We agreed

753
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,940
to be my concubine.

754
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,620
Then he came to marry me.

755
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,780
Now he

756
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,700
is here to make an appointment with me.

757
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,540
You don't even listen to your mother?

758
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,260
I just want to marry Brother Lu.

759
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,100
Don't be shy.

760
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,500
How can a woman say such a thing?

761
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:57,980
Ake.

762
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,660
I understand what you said.

763
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,500
I was reckless today.

764
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,980
I hope you can forgive me.

765
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,380
But Ake and I

766
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,700
are the most precious things in the world.

767
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,580
So I won't give up.

768
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,060
I will do my best to protect him.

769
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,980
I will make him happy.

770
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,540
I won't let him suffer for the rest of his life.

771
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,140
I will be with him

772
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,980
until the end.

773
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,860
So I hope you can give me some time

774
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,700
to solve your problem.

775
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,980
Okay.

776
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,380
I hope you can give us an answer soon.

777
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,700
You can go back now.

778
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,940
Mr. Lu, I'll see you off.

779
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,540
Brother Lu, Ake.

780
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,900
Brother Lu, don't...

781
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,220
Are you leaving or not happy?

782
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,140
I told you not to leave so soon.

783
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,500
I have something to tell you.

784
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,100
Don't be unhappy.

785
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,260
My mother values my marriage the most.

786
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,220
She is afraid that I don't understand and will be rude.

787
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,260
So she is testing us.

788
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,260
Do you understand her?

789
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,620
Let me ask you.

790
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,100
What is your true heart?

791
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,900
o

792
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,520
2

793
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,900
In this tea investigate the thing the Mayан King loves today

794
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,500
Translator has a little Faith

795
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,680
It's like a play

796
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,100
You took my life

797
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,500
Don't you dare go

798
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,820
The Heaven is not here

799
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,260
You are the only one for me

800
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
I believe you

801
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:26,420
I don't know who is the legend in the mist

802
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
Greetings, Mr. Zheng

803
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
Ladies and gentlemen

804
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,260
Since Deng Shoumei passed away

805
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,900
You have been working hard

806
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,140
to make the coal case very proper

807
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,900
The government will issue a document tomorrow

808
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,060
Announcing the successor of the coal

809
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,180
At that time, please tidy up

810
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,940
It's all official

811
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,780
Do you understand?

812
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,020
Yes, sir

813
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:04,980
it is good

814
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,420
Did you hear it, Ake?

815
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,020
It seems that the above is still clear

816
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,540
This position of the coal must be yours

817
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,020
You have to pay more attention tomorrow

818
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,220
You represent

819
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,260
The world's first coal face

820
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,180
Zhao Meiguan is overpraised

821
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,220
I will work hard

822
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,260
Shi Meiguan, I'm leaving first

823
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,500
How is it?

824
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,220
It's like a fairy tale

825
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,660
Ake

826
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,740
源哥哥

827
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,100
Do you feel unhappy today?

828
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,620
All is well

829
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,660
Hard to be unhappy

830
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,300
Tomorrow will be the purest day

831
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,940
Congratulations Shoumei

832
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,980
Luis

833
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,180
We

834
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,860
You

835
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,380
Ake

836
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,420
I'm so disappointed.

837
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,500
I only marry you

838
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,700
for this life.

839
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,340
If you believe me,

840
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,900
I'll give you an answer

841
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,900
when I finish what I want to do.

842
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,820
Really?

843
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,820
You won't refuse my mother?

844
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,900
Of course.

845
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,980
I won't refuse my future mother-in-law.

846
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,020
You're going to take the job tomorrow.

847
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,140
Come on.

848
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,900
I'll take you to eat something delicious today.

849
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,380
Okay.

850
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,740
My lady,

851
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,140
why are you at such a early hour?

852
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:39,660
We haven't reached the other

853
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,180
official's house yet.

854
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,120
Tell me

855
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,320
I wonder what you want from the other half.

856
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,920
Do you want to marry someone who is not good enough?

857
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,360
Marriage is about you wanting me to marry you.

858
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,640
Why are you so persistent?

859
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,640
There are people who are prepared for themselves

860
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,480
when they come into the world.

861
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,160
If they are not good enough,

862
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,760
then they are not yours.

863
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,840
Letting go of what you want

864
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,480
and making yourself happy

865
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,920
is also a happy thing.

866
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,360
If you meet someone

867
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,000
who is determined to force you to marry him,

868
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,920
can you tell me your name?

869
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,520
Fang Yue.

870
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,560
The moon is round and slender.

871
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,280
It's round and has four corners.

872
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,200
Your name is very special.

873
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,840
Really?

874
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,200
You sound like a person from the capital.

875
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,280
Where are you from?

876
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,320
Do you have any relatives?

877
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,600
I don't have any relatives.

878
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,680
I came to the capital specially.

879
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,600
You came to the capital specially?

880
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,080
But to meet that person who is not good enough,

881
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,560
I wonder what kind of person

882
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,200
you like?

883
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,000
In my opinion,

884
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,720
he is a man of great martial arts.

885
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,400
He is skilled in riding, archery and horse riding.

886
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,480
He is well-educated and has no enemies.

887
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,880
His identity is a bit special.

888
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,560
He has never been married in the past.

889
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,040
Some people say that he must not

890
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,160
want to give up on the people outside.

891
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,360
But I do know that

892
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,960
he is a great master.

893
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,160
He doesn't want to be bound by the love of his children.

894
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,720
Special identity?

895
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,240
Sang Ou?

896
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,960
Who is he?

897
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,160
Ke.

898
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,840
You came early.

899
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,680
This is...

900
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,480
Zhao Mei Guan.

901
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,240
This is Fang...

902
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,240
Zhao Mei Guan.

903
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,280
Lord Zheng is here.

904
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
Miss Fang.

905
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,000
We have an important meeting today.

906
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,000
Why don't you leave first?

907
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
We will come again tomorrow.

908
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,760
Greetings, Lord Zheng.

909
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,160
Greetings, Nations guy.

910
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,320
Which station?

911
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,160
The No. 1 Citizen of the Su State.

912
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,120
I think

913
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,520
the second optimize

914
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,440
is which station to talk to you.

915
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,320
The two teams aren't on the same track.

916
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,800
The offices are occupied by other people.

917
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,240
I want to be alone.

918
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,520
Is it possible?

919
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,200
Isn't it?

920
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,880
Is it possible?

921
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,480
Yes.

922
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,240
Isn't it?

923
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,520
What's going on?

924
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,320
Fang Yue,

925
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,720
from now on,

926
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,600
you are the guard of the Guanmei Hall in the capital.

927
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,200
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

928
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,440
You're welcome.

929
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,480
If there's nothing else,

930
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,640
I'll leave now.

931
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,200
Goodbye, Mr. Zheng.

932
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,400
Fang Yue

933
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
Fang Yue

934
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,640
down to theキ

935
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,960
and connect it up with you guys.

936
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
I am Fang Yue.

937
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,680
From now on,

938
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,800
please do your best

939
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,080
to make your pointless dark

940
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,720
and make the Guanmei Hall passwords clear.

941
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,560
Yes.

942
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,120
You are the one who is known as the Moon Goddess in Suzhou.

943
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,080
It's true that all the capable people have been transferred here.

944
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,320
I've heard about it before I came here.

945
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,320
The plum-tasting officers in the official plum-tasting hall are quite young, but they have great achievements.

946
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,720
They are very diligent in their work.

947
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,200
I waited in the hall this morning.

948
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,480
The plum-tasting officers were enthusiastic to talk to me.

949
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,800
They were not hesitant at all.

950
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,600
I hope that you can be plum-tasting officers in the future too.

951
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,240
You can run more and walk more.

952
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,600
Be more active when you treat the guests.

953
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,440
Don't give up easily when you encounter difficulties.

954
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,040
Make more friends with the people in the world.

955
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,840
Yes.

956
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,440
Come on.

957
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,280
Come on.

958
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,040
Come on.

959
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,160
Come on.

960
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,880
Come on.

961
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,040
Come on.

962
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,440
Come on.

963
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,240
Come on.

964
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,640
Ake, why aren't you wearing the official uniform?

965
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,920
The new official uniform is on duty.

966
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,560
It's not me.

967
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,560
I'm sorry.

968
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,480
I'm sorry.

969
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,560
I'm sorry.

970
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,440
I'm sorry.

971
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,440
I'm sorry.

972
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,440
I'm sorry.

973
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440
I'm sorry.

974
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,440
I'm sorry.

975
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,440
I'm sorry.

976
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
I'm sorry.

977
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,440
I'm sorry.

978
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,440
I'm sorry.

979
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,440
I'm sorry.

980
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,440
I'm sorry.

981
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,440
I'm sorry.

982
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,840
I know this encounter is the grace of fate.

983
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,040
Every time I see you,

984
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,360
I only feel the cuteness.

985
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:28,360
Although I can't remember every difficult day,

986
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:36,360
I never forget the first time I saw you.

987
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,360
Even if this love is heartless,

988
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,960
no sound, no sun, no night,

989
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
it doesn't matter if it's a stormy month.

990
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,960
As long as you are never afraid,

991
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,960
never afraid, never worried,

992
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,760
I'll be by your side.

993
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,960
No matter if it's a fire or a human world,

994
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,560
whether it will appear or not,

995
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:03,760
I'm willing to protect you with my life.

996
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,360
Even if I can't see you clearly,

997
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,360
I'm willing to give my all to you.

998
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,960
I'll only miss you.

999
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,360
Even if it's a fire or a human world,

1000
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,760
I'll never forget the first time I saw you.

1001
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,360
Please remember the youth that burned in my heart.

1002
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:40,960
From now on, I don't want to part with you.
