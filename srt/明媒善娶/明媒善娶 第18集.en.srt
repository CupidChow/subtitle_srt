5
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,070
She's completely unworthy of you.

9

Cheng Ruoning is certainly contemptible,

10

The simpler the person is, the more likely
she is to achieve great things.

I'm afraid he won't let this go easily.

As long as we still stay in the capital,

74
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,780
he can make things difficult
for Qiujiang and me anytime.

168
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,890
it's better to cut the Gordian knot.

169
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,030

[Cheng's Mansion]

171

I can't do this.

172
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,950
Miss Cheng.

173
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,850
I understand it's difficult for you
to decide now.

174
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,110
But this is the only solution we have now.

175
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,000
If the Cheng family
is still extremely wealthy,

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,580
Marquis Wu'an
will certainly do everything he can

177
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,860
to seize your family's fortune
for himself.

178
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,930
If you and Young Master Qiujiang
are not under protection,

179
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,700
he'll certainly find a chance
to take revenge.

180
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,410
I know.

181
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,330
But all of this is the family property

182
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,610
my father has gained
through his lifelong efforts.

183

I...

184
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,770
I really can't make this decision now.

185
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,880
Could I have some time to think about it?

186

Miss Cheng, I understand how you feel.

187

This is just a piece of advice
from Ke and me.

188

189

Why are you so flustered?

194
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,240
The Cheng family has changed the names

195
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,410
of all their shops today.

196
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,560
The Cheng family has donated
all their assets to the country.

197
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,250
Now they've become royal merchants.

198
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,490
Royal merchants?

199
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,530
The Cheng family's assets
now belong to the royal family?

200
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,750
I've heard that Cheng Ruoning

201
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,840
has donated all the family property.

202
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,630
She said the purpose was to

203
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,750
bring prosperity to Liang State
and provide funds for the army.

204
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,880
That's ridiculous!

205
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,490
So you mean

206
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,360
before I can get the money,

207
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,040
now it's possessed by that person instead?

208
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,000
Cheng Ruoning is just a woman.

209
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,620
How would she come up with such an idea?

210
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,490
Lu Chi and Shi Fa'ke
must be the masterminds.

211
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,320
If I don't kill Cheng Ruoning,

212

I won't be able to vent my hatred!

213

Don't do that! Please reconsider, My Lord.

214
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,540
It's impossible to kill Cheng Ruoning now.

as his sworn sister.

Here is the imperial decree.

Cheng Ruoning,
the only daughter of the Cheng family,

[Imperial Decree]

224

which has greatly comforted my heart.

225

as my imperial sworn sister

Please calm down, My Lord.

235
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,340
It's all because of Lu Chi and Shi Fa'ke.

236
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,890
We should kill them as soon as possible.

237

Whether it's the Cheng family,
Lu Chi or Shi Fa'ke,

no matter how much they struggle,

240

they're just like mantises
trying to stop a chariot.

241

Once I achieve my grand ambition,

242
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,940
they will naturally bow to my power.

How wise you are, My Lord!

244
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,150
Since these people have failed to
recognize my favor,

245

I will surely find the ones
who have discerning eyes

00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,600
[Wang's Wonton]

495
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,840
Miss Shi, do you often come here?

496
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,030
This place

497
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,140
is Lu's and my favorite noodle stall.

498
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,490
Their beef rice noodles
can just melt in your mouth.

499
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,730
You can't find such noodles anywhere else.

500
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,750
In that case, I have to try

501
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,790
these beef rice noodles
which you're strongly recommending

502
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,180
and see what they really taste like.

503
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,310
Sir, three bowls of beef rice noodles.

504
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,320
Okay.

505
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,550
Here, my dear customers.
Your rice noodles are ready.

506
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,320
I'm sorry.

507
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,010
Sir, let me clean that for you.

508
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:18,990
You... You...

509
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,890
Ke, chopsticks.

510
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,350
Sir, here is yours.

511
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,980
Since Mr. Yan's rice noodles were spilled,

512
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,440
please have mine instead.

513
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,240
Mr. Yan, please have mine.

514
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,700
Mine has more beef in it.

515
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,840
Thank you, Miss Shi.

516
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,060
Mr. Yan, are you engaged yet?

517
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,200
No, I'm not.

518
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,420
But I already have someone in my heart.

519
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,590
Why don't you tell me more about it?

520
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,210
If you two are in love,

521
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,620
I'll definitely help you two get married.

522
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,780
Actually, I came here just

523
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,940
to find this person.

524
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,530
I've had a crush on this person for years.

525
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,660
This person
has always been my spiritual comfort,

526
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,720
though I don't know the person's name

527
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,930
or whereabouts.

528
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,710
Nor do I even know
how to find this person.

529
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,500
He has loved that person for years.

530
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,510
He doesn't know the person's name
or whereabouts.

531
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,630
But this person has always been
his spiritual comfort.

532
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,400
How come the person
who this man is looking for

533
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,370
has such a similar situation to me?

534
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,500
When it comes to such matters,

535
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,360
I'm the most experienced.

536
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,850
I can definitely help you
find this person.

537
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,570
Really?

538
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,930
But before that,

539
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,000
I need to get to know you better, Mr. Yan.

540
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,430
Only in this way can I customize the plan.

541
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,610
May I know what you usually

542
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,210
like to do in your spare time?

543
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,170
I only have one small hobby.

544
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
I love Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings.

545
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
You also like Mr. Lin Yuan?

546
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,680
Then we really do have so much in common!

547
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,870
Miss Shi, you also like Mr. Lin Yuan?

548
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,010
Do you like his painting,
Spring Prosperity in the Jade Hall?

549
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,210
That painting is absolutely extraordinary.

550
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,610
It has such a vivid style.

551
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,560
Our family doesn't have
Spring Prosperity in the Jade Hall.

552
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,960
But on my birthday,

553
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,870
my good friend

554
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,290
gave me
"Having Equal Status in Marriage."

555
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,870
Are you interested in seeing it?

556
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,740
My home is just nearby.

557
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,720
Sure. Then let's...

558
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,270

559
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,810
It's getting late.

560
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,310
Sorry for bothering you so much today.

561
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,140
Miss Shi, Chief Lu,
thanks for your generous hospitality.

562
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,940
I'll pay you a visit another day.

563
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,050
Mr. Yan, where are you staying?

564
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,170
Qingfeng Inn.

565
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,900
Since you just came here,

566
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,960
you must be unfamiliar with the roads.

567
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,430
Why don't we escort you back together?

568
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,120
Lu, you...

569
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,940
I'm free, too.

570
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,590
Let's go together.

571
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,060
Hey, we're off.

572
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,580
Take care, my dear customers.

573
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,130
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings

574
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,840
have such delicate
and touching brushstrokes,

575
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
as if carrying countless emotions,

576
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,730
with thousands of words
waiting to be conveyed.

577
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,490
It feels like
with just one stroke of his brush,

578
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,350
all things in this world
fall under his command.

579
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,010
Miss Shi, you're quite right.

580
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,960
I've always felt that

581
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings
are different from others'.

582
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,670
Others always say that the inner spirit
can't be captured in a painting.

583
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,240
But I think in Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings,

584
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,000
the essence
practically leaps off the paper!

585
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,700
Each stroke sparks magic.

586
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,380
This is called
"Pen and Brush pass on to God".

587
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,530
To say Mr. Lin Yuan
wields a "magician's brush"

588
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,020
would be no exaggeration.

589
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,040
How wonderful.

590
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,750
They clearly have the same interest.

591
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,970
Mr. Lin Yuan's every stroke
captures the inner spirit.

592
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,690
Miss Shi, Mr. Lu, thank you

593
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,130
for touring me around
in the capital today.

594
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,420
Lu.

595
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,910
I need to discuss something with Mr. Yan.

596
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,400
Could you wait here for me?

597
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,370
Should I call you Mr. Yan or Miss Yan?

598
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,110
Marriage Broker Shi, I...

599
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,330
I guess

600
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,810
you don't want others
to know your identity,

601
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,470
so I'll still call you Mr. Yan.

602
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,970
Judging by your outfit,

603
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,200
you must have your reasons, huh?

604
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,000
Indeed.

605
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,220
My father has arranged a marriage for me

606
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,350
which I don't like,

607
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,900
so I...

608
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,180
In life,

609
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,240
there are always times
when one has no choice.

610
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,700
But luckily, you've met me.

611
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,500
I'm a professional matchmaker.

612
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,940
Perhaps I can help you solve the issue

613
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,260
about the one you have a crush on.

614
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,040
Really?

615
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,760
Can you really help me with it?

616
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,400
Bringing couples together is my duty.

617
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,790
What's more, we get along so well.

618
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,780
I originally thought that you were a man,

619
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,110
and I had some concerns.

620
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,170
But now that I know you're a woman,

621

Of course,

625
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,770
most importantly,
I'll help you find your beloved one.

626
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,350
Marriage Broker Shi, you're so kind.

627
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,890
Of all my fortunes in the capital,

628
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,150
the luckiest thing for me is meeting you.

629
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,850
However, could you promise me something?

630
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,630
What is it? Just tell me,

631
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,820
as long as it's within my power.

632
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,100
Can you help me keep the secret

633
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
that I'm a woman,

634
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,130
even from that gentleman outside?

635
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,250
Don't worry.

Keeping promises is a matchmaker's virtue.

637

It's getting late now.
I'll come find you tomorrow.

638

Okay. I'll be waiting for you.

Were you out with Mr. Yan again?

Is Lu jealous?

to keep the secret,

I can't tell Lu about it.

Qiyue, actually, I really admire you.

You admire me?

877
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,990
I really admire people like you
who pursue true love

878
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,970
and have the courage
to run away from arranged marriages.

879
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,510
Many clients in my matchmaking cases

880
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,740
are people just like you.

881
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,600
They refuse
to follow their parents' arrangements

882
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,680
and only want to spend their lives
with the ones they love.

883
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,410
That requires a lot of courage.

884
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,320
Ke, actually, all this time,

885
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,070
I've always felt that

886
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,270
no one
would support my way of thinking.

887
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,710
But after meeting you,

888
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,800
I've found that you're different
from others,

889
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,130
especially from other marriage brokers.

890
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,180
You genuinely care about your clients

891

and work hard for those who are in love.

892
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,560
My greatest gain
from coming to the capital this time

893
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,870
is that I've met you.

894
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,780
Actually, I just want to
find someone like-minded,

895
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,970
like Mr. Lin Yuan.

896
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,280
What? Mr. Lin Yuan?

897
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,700
Have you two met before?

898
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,860
No.

899
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,370
Do you know each other?

900
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,460
No.

901
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,160
Then do you know his full name?

902
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,480
I don't know any of these details.

903
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,280
But I only know that I admire him,

904
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,680
and I understand the emotions
in his paintings.

905
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,990
He's the right person.

906
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,890
Qiyue, you don't even know him.

907
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,580
How do you know he's the right person?

908
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,350
It's actually quite magical.

909
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,620
I got one

910
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,220
of Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings by accident.

911
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,030
I was attracted to
that painting at first sight.

912
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,710
In that painting,

913
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,240
I seemed to see someone
who was a bit lonely

914
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,390
but also very interesting.

915
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,110
I've experienced

916
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,880
that kind of loneliness, too.

917
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,370
So I think he and I can
understand each other.

918
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,880
Qiyue.

919
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,210
I understand all this spiritual connection
you're talking about.

920
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,670
But what if

921
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,520
Mr. Lin Yuan is already married
and has children?

922
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,850
What should you do then?

923
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,080
Then I'll accept my fate and let go of it.

924
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,510
But Ke,

925
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,260
I can see

926
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,360
a hint of childlike innocence
in his paintings.

927
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,490
He must be around my age.

928
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,050
Qiyue, these are all just your guesses.

929
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,820
Nobody knows what the reality is.

930
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,660
Ke.

931
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,750
I've carefully studied
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings,

932
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,080
and I've noticed
he has never painted a wife

933
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,010
or children.

934
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,180
The figures in his painting
of "Having Equal Status in Marriage"

935
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,580
aren't from our dynasty.

936
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,530
They must be from his imagination.

937
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
Mr. Lin Yuan

938
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,830
clearly has never been married,

939
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,410
let alone having children.

940
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,850
So, when he painted these scenes,

941
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,130
he couldn't do it quite proficiently.

942
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,480
However,

943
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,180
not only do we not know
where to find Mr. Lin Yuan,

944
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,770
but I also think that your idea

945
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,080
is a bit impulsive.

946
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:34,860
Ke.

947
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,790
Are you unwilling to help me now?

It's not that I don't want to help you.

I want to know
if he's the same as what I've imagined.

about the princess of the vassal state?

As for the appearance
of the vassal state's princess,

I've asked some men
to spread misinformation.

the princess's portrait.

Are you also unable
to find the information?

We haven't found anything yet.

977
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,910

Before leaving,
the princess of the vassal state said

981
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,430
she would never marry His Majesty.

982
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:06,010
She claimed that she came here
to look for someone called Mr. Lin Yuan.

983
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,740
Since she's running away from marriage
and has someone she wants to marry,

984
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,890
I believe she will go to
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

985

00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,330
Now that I'm dressed as a man,

994
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,090
what is there to be afraid of?

995
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,480
Come on. Let's drink.

996
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,130
Alright.

997
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,210
Excuse me.

998
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,340
Hello.

999
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,680
Is there anything I can help you with?

1000
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,320
Has anything happened
in Gaoyou State recently?

1001
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,740
The country has been peaceful lately
with no interesting news.

1002
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,220
That's good then.

1003
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,120
This is strange.

1004
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,960
Why hasn't Father sent anyone
to look for me?

1005
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:43,210
Has he given up the idea of
marrying me off for two countries' peace?

1006
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,270
Did my departure

1007
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,820
finally make him come to his senses?

1008
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,170
Then I must be much safer now, huh?

1009
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,590
I won't need to disguise myself anymore.

1010
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,850
Lu.

1011
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:02,860
Ke, you're here.

1012
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,000
Lu,

1013
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,130
will you help me with anything?

1014
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,780
If you need anything,

1015
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,960
I'll certainly do whatever I can.

1016
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,590
Then can you help me find Mr. Lin Yuan?

1017
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,020
You... You want to find Mr. Lin Yuan?

1018
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,160
What's wrong?
So you don't want to help me now?

1019
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,110
Why do you want to find Mr. Lin Yuan?

1020
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,420
That's a secret.

1021
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,670
Okay. I promise you.

1022
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:35,940
But you have to...

1023
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,010
Lu, I knew you were the best!
