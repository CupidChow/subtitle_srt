00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,130
Ke, it's alright now.

4
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm here with you.

5
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,080
I couldn't save Ms. Deng.

6
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,440
You did your best. Don't blame yourself.

7
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,370
Lu, what about Yanyan?

8
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,620
Let's go find Yanyan and the others.

9
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,450
Don't worry,

10
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,480
Zhuxi hasn't come out yet either.

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,940
But he knows martial arts,

12
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,840
maybe he's already found Miss Zhu

13
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,040
and taken her somewhere safe.

14
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,420
Where could they be?

15
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,990
I'll take you to find them right now.

16

Ke.

18

Come, let me carry you.

19
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,070
Mr. Lu, are you alright?

20
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,480
Does it hurt?

21
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,220
I'm fine.

Where are we?

23
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,710
Will the fire reach us soon?

24
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,240
Don't be afraid. I'm here with you.

25
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,660
I'll hold your hand.

26
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,410
Move forward
and we should be able to get out soon.

Your duty

31

is to protect those
attending the Flower Assembly,

32

and my duty is to protect you.

33

always protecting you.

35
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,650
Don't look at me.

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,760
I look awful when I cry.

37

No, you don't.

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,230
I think you're the most beautiful person,

39

and the one I love most.

40
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,490
I will always protect you,

never let you come to any harm,

so that you can live peacefully
and happily for the rest of your life.

43

Why are you suddenly saying all this?

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,650
It's not sudden.

45

I can't find her anywhere.

attending the meeting has escaped.

General Li, what is the meaning of this?

97

The smoke here is billowing to the sky,

98
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,090
visible even from the city center.

Shi Fa'ke.

100
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,380
As the organizer
of the Flower Assembly,

101
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,920
you're disregarding
human lives and committing crimes.

102
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,909
Shouldn't you be punished?

103
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,790
General,

104
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,409
of course the arsonist should be arrested
for the fire at the Flower Assembly,

105
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:46,070
but what reason do you have to arrest
an innocent marriage broker?

106
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,210
Who gave you the right to speak here?

107
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,340
General Li,

108
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,540
when the fire broke out,

109
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,030
I was hosting the Flower Assembly.

110
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,690
Everyone present can testify for me.

111
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,090
What evidence do you have

112
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,850
that I'm the one who committed arson?

113
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,310
You must have
accomplices working with you.

114
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,430
Slanderous lies!

115
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,880
Whether it's slander
or deserved punishment,

116
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,000
you all must come with me

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,260
and we'll find out after investigation.

118
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,110
The innocent have nothing to fear.

119
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,500
I have done nothing wrong

120
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,850
and am willing
to accept your investigation.

121
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,980
But I'm warning you,

122
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,940
if you dare harm anyone here,

123
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,420
I will certainly report
this injustice to the Emperor.

124
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,240
General Li,

125
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,570
cases are to be
tried at the magistrate's office,

126
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,860
and the Imperial Cavalry Bureau
handles security matters.

127
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,080
Why is the Military Headquarters
sending troops

128
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
to arrest people?

129
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,090
Are you going to disregard court protocol

130
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,680
and exceed your authority?

131
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,560
Lu Chi.

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,480
Shi Fa'ke,

133
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,380
with such a major incident
at the Flower Assembly,

134
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,540
as the organizer,

135
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,620
shouldn't you take responsibility?

136
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,580
The Flower Assembly
was funded by Xibao Pavilion.

137
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,860
Lu Chi, you cannot escape blame either.

138
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,340
That's right,

139
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,300
I am the organizer.

140
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,630
I do bear responsibility.

141
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,880
I'll go with you for questioning.

142
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,490
Ke,

143
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,220
no!

144
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,080
Since Miss Shi has admitted it herself,

145
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,930
guards, take her away.

146
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,820
Who dares!

147
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,970
I am a witness.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,320
I can testify for Ke.

149
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,800
Yanyan.

150
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,260
I am Lord Zhu's granddaughter, Zhu Yanyan.

151
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,540
I saw with my own eyes
that Ms. Deng started the fire.

152
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,070
I can prove these
two had nothing to do with it.

153
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,630
You!

154
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,920
Words alone are not enough proof.

155
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,900
This waist token

156
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,800
dropped from Chief Matchmaker Deng.

157
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,130
[Chief Matchmaker]

158
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,580
I witnessed her setting fire
to the Flower Assembly with my own eyes.

159
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,530
I can testify.

160
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,230
I was the one who rescued
Miss Zhu from the fire.

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,400
Then where is Chief Matchmaker Deng?

162
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,799
Have her come out to face questioning.

163
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,169
Chief Matchmaker Deng
has perished in the fire.

164
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,180
Are you trying to pin all the blame

165
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,260
on a dead person?

166
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,240
I suspect Chief Matchmaker Deng's death

167
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,250
is connected to all of you.

168
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,740
The truth of the matter

169
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,230
will be revealed in court.

170
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,410
Guards, seize them!

171
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:55,960

If someone sees us out here,

535
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,080
it would be even harder to explain.

536

What's troubling you?

552
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,320
Yesterday Ms. Deng said

553
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,710
she was led astray,

554
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,510
which proves someone
ordered her to set the fire.

555
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,190
That's right.

556
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,610
Who could this person be?

557
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,150
Someone so ruthless

558
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,590
to make Ms. Deng set a fire.

559
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,940
And after setting the fire,

560
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,550
why didn't she leave
but stayed at the scene?

561
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,010
Actually, yesterday
I saw someone in black,

562
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,810
but the scene was chaotic,

563
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,790
and I was busy
rescuing people, couldn't pay attention.

564
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,350
I think

565
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,290
the mastermind behind this

566
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,740
sent someone to silence Ms. Deng.

567
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,020
Then who could be behind all this?

568
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,750
Marquis Wu'an.

569
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,530
Marquis Wu'an?

570
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,150
My mother refused his request before,

571
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,190
could this be the cause of the trouble?

572
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,640
Chief Matchmaker Tao
is the No.1 matchmaker in the world,

573
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,570
who has arranged countless marriages.

574
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,680
You should have realized
on your coming-of-age ceremony

575
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,200
how many officials and nobles came

576
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,930
to congratulate her daughter.

577
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,920
That's the reputation
my mother earned from her matchmaking.

578
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,280
Could it be that Marquis Wu'an

579
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,610
wants to control the agency
through my mother,

580
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,960
and then through the agency,

581
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,250
control these people's marriages?

582
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:56,900
Yes,

583
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,260
he wants to use
the Official Matchmaking Agency

584
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,880
to strengthen his power
through arranged marriages.

585
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,350
After failing to win
over Chief Matchmaker Tao,

586
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,920
he supported Ms. Deng instead.

587
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,290
But you repeatedly

588
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,460
ruined his plans.

589
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,230
So he decided to kill you.

590
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,680
Even if the fire couldn't kill you,

591
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,740
it could still ruin your reputation.

592
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,710
That's terrifying!

593
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,990
No wonder my mother
said this path isn't easy.

594
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,170
So that's what she meant.

that the backbone
of the No.1 matchmaker in the world
