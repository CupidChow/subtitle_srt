00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
The Lord of The investors

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The Love by Hypnotic

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 16

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ke.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ke.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is my new blood.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Please taste it.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Brother Xian, what a coincidence.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I have an appointment with someone to go out.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why don't you let my mother taste it for you?

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's Lu Chi.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm leaving.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You go in.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Brother Lu.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ke.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is for you.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Brother Lu.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why do you spend so much money?

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I have a lot of jade medals at home.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is a special jade medal I made for you.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can take whatever you like

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
under the Lushan Leaf under this jade medal.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is too precious.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
As long as Ke likes it.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I like everything you give me.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have carved this on the jade.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hang it on the wall.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The love never changes.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The weather is so nice today.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Look.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Brother Lu, they...

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It seems that I have a new beauty.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When will it be our beauty?

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Come.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Come.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Zhu Xi, what are you looking at?

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Nothing.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I was distracted.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Look there. Let's go there.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Eat it.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Eat it from here?

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It should be fine.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Zhu Yan Yan.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Lu Zhu Xi.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Ke, try it.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is our new tea.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's delicious.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's delicious.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's delicious.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's delicious.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's delicious.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Come.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I asked Manager Li to prepare this for you.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's not bad, right?

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The beautiful scenery.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Young Master Lu, you are back.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Why are you back so early?

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Brother, Sister.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Young Master Lu, where did you go?

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Lu Zhu Xi, where did you go?

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I went out for a walk.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Since there is nothing else, I will go back to my room.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Do you have anything to say?

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay. I admit it.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Can't you admit it?

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I asked Yan Yan to go to the marriage tree outside the city.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you really like Yan Yan?

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I like her.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But I don't know what Yan Yan's heart is like.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Sister, can you help me find out?

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't worry.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I will help you ask about Yan Yan's heart.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just wait for my news.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Then thank you, sister-in-law.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm leaving.

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You...

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't talk nonsense.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm looking for Zhu Xi.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay. Follow me.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Miss, it's Xi Xi who is here.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
A Ke, you are here.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yan Yan, I'm here to see you.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Sit down.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Young Master Lu just told me...

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What did he say?

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He said he likes you.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But I don't know what Yan Yan's heart is like.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A Ke, we are really close.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And we have a lot of common topics.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So if I bring Young Master Lu to propose to you,

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
will Yan Yan have no objection?

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
A Ke.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay, I won't bother you.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Leave the rest to me.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is the book that the neighbors...

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
haven't written for a month.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But this book is different from the previous ones.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It was written by a young man...

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
who was a beggar.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
A beggar?

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What else?

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's a pity.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
A young man...

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
can't do anything after he's ruined.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He's so cold and cold.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
A Ke, I'm telling you.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I saw him begging in the capital.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I was so sad.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But fortunately, he met a little girl...

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
who gave him snacks.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Then he got over the difficulty.

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Then he met an outsider.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The outsider adopted him.

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then he had a master, a friend...

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and a little brother.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Although this little beggar...

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
is smart and good at literature and martial arts,

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
he has a secret.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
A beggar?

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Snacks?

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's the secret?

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's the marriage between the little girl...

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
who gave him snacks.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They made a deal.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
After the little girl got married,

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
they made a bet.

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But time has passed.

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't know if the little girl...

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
remembers him or not.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Does she remember the promise?

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The man next door is making a fuss.

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now it's written that the man is Chi Lu.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He's going to find the little girl.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Chi Lu?

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The man is Chi Lu.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He has a brother.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
His name is Xizhu.

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yanyan.

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let me borrow this drawing book.

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm going to do something important.

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Take it.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you remember the marriage between me and Mr. Lu?

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Brother Lu, I'll ask you.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't lie to me.

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I can only answer yes or no.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ask me, Ake.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The beggar brother I gave you when you were a kid.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Is it you?

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But how did you know?

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Are you the man next door?

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Then how did the man next door know about the little brother?

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Because the man next door is Zhu Xie.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Brother Lu.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You once prayed in the capital.

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Then I relied on the little girl to send you the snack.

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I met your adoptive father and was adopted by him.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
After growing up,

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
you came to the capital.

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You want to see the little girl who once gave you the snack?

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I won't go.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't want to see you.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm going to marry that little girl.

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't want to see you.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm going to marry that little girl.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Although he doesn't remember me,

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
he still remembers me.

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm going to marry that little girl.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm going to marry that little girl.

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm going to marry that little girl.

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Even if I marry that little girl,

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
she still can't recognize me.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But hopefully,

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
even if she doesn't remember me,

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
she still can't recognize me.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
She still remembers me.

208
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Do you accept me?

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Brother Lu.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Old man.

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You scared me.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know what to do.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You are my brother.

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Brother Lu.

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You are my brother.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Now it's good.

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I will return all our marriage.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
To the heavens.

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What should I do?

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Will he take our marriage away?

223
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,560
You're all that I can hold in my hands

224
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,560
Falling into the dream

225
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,360
I've waited for you in the end

226
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,380
And have made all the mistakes you've ever made

227
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,520
From the start

228
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,200
It never changes

229
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,360
I can't untie the knot

230
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,880
And I've let you down

231
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,240
I feeläs

232
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,000
Can't tell if it's bitter or sweet

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,920
Life after life, life after life, we are in the same boat

234
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,480
This is the end of the world, please change to the end

235
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,000
The love letter is so hard to write

236
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,880
Found it

237
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,840
The love letter is so hard to write

238
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,280
The love letter is so hard to write

239
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,880
The love letter is so hard to write

240
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,600
The love letter is so hard to write

241
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Why is this color so dark?

242
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
No no no

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,880
Why do I feel something is wrong today?

244
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,960
The clothes are not right

245
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,320
The color of the mouth is not right

246
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,200
Sister Tang

247
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,840
I have changed three types of mouthpieces for eight sets of clothes

248
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,160
Qing

249
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,800
This one, how about this one?

250
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,920
Sister Tang, your skin is smooth and your face is like peach blossoms

251
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,280
It's already very beautiful

252
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,000
Really?

253
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,880
Then I'll go like this

254
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,320
Hurry up, Mr. Lu is waiting for you

255
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,920
Hurry up

256
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,800
If you like it, you must come often

257
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,520
Must

258
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,280

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,240
Brother Lu

260
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,200
Sister Pang'er

261
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
Brother Lu, Brother Lu

262
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,600
You know your brother Lu

263
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,640
Why don't you sit down and have a cup of tea first?

264
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Sister Pang'er, don't hit me

265
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,520
Is Brother Lu here?

266
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,360
I'm here

267
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,540
Everyone

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,440

269
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,760
This is the number you dome

Thank You

271
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,640
What is the combination of evidence and evidence?

272
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,440
Besides

273
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,160
Findker

274
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,000
Hurry up

275
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,520
Someone to call

276
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,920
I'm proud of myself

277
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,880
I didn't expect you to be so good at it

278
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,360
Let's go

279
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,480
Come on

280
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Where are we going?

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,120
It's noon

282
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,200
We'll have lunch at lunchtime

283
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,240
Let's go

284
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,640
Buy some sour plum soup

285
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,440
Then we'll go to the barbecue chicken I ordered yesterday

286
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,960
The opposite of the barbecue chicken is the rice noodle shop

287
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,720
We'll have a meal there

288
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
After that

289
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,560
I'll take you to the garden to see the flowers

290
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,040
After that, we'll go to the west

291
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,120
If you're hungry

292
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,880
We'll have some wontons

293
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,560
I'm Santo

294
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,680
But it still isn't the right place

295
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,520
Uncle

296
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,960
I'm late

297
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,560
You won't blame yourself

298
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Let me see.

299
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,600
It's cute.

300
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,280
What's this?

301
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,040
Look.

302
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,920
It's a puppy.

303
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,640
How is it?

304
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,320
It's cute.

305
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,240
It's okay.

306
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,240
How about

307
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,400
we go and have a look?

308
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,280
Okay.

309
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,880
Brother Lu Yi.

310
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,560
Miss Qian Er.

311
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,800
Have you ever ridden a horse before?

312
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,960
I've never ridden one before.

313
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
I'm a little scared.

314
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,040
Don't be scared.

315
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,520
Come on.

316
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,240
I'll take you.

317
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,320
She's a good girl.

318
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,840
Be careful.

319
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,760
Is it okay?

320
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,280
Yes.

321
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,240
Let's go back.

322
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,080
Let's go.

323
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,840
Let's go.

324
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,480
Let's go.

325
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,080
Let's go.

326
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,840
Let's go.

327
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,560
Why are we here so soon?

328
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,920
If you hadn't disappeared,

329
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,560
I would have picked you up tomorrow morning.

330
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,960
Oh no.

331
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,560
My brother is back.

332
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,760
Hurry up.

333
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,880
You...

334
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,960
Where did you go?

335
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
What did you say?

336
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,360
I'm your big brother.

337
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,840
How dare you talk to me like that?

338
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,040
Big brother.

339
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
We're each other.

340
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,480
Sit down and be good.

341
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,280
Wait a minute.

342
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,000
When they get in,

343
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,840
you go out first.

344
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,480
You're so stupid.

345
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,200
You let me see first.

346
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,880
They don't know me.

347
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,920
Why do they keep covering me?

348
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,760
How about I go and say hello to them?

349
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,120
No.

350
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,680
Don't go out.

351
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,360
Leave me alone.

352
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,640
Then you leave me alone.

353
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Then you give me some space.

354
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,280
Brother.

355
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,960
Brother.

356
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,080
Where did you go?

357
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,680
We didn't go anywhere.

358
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,200
Let's go.

359
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,760
Nothing happened?

360
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,040
Wait.

361
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,960
It turns out that something is hiding from me.

362
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,280
I'm so stupid.

363
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,080
I'm so stupid.

364
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,920
I'm so stupid.

365
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
I'm so stupid.

366
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm so stupid.

367
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
I'm so stupid.

368
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm so stupid.

369
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,680
I'm so stupid.

370
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm so stupid.

371
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,520
I'm so stupid.

372
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,720
You're hiding something from me.

373
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,600
Wait.

374
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,880
What's wrong, Ke?

375
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,760
What did you hear?

376
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,880
Ke, don't go.

377
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,520
Ke.

378
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,040
Tiantian.

379
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,000
Brother.

380
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,360
Why haven't you slept yet?

381
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
When did you come back so late?

382
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,560
If you don't come back, I can't sleep in the southwest.

383
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,640
Brother.

384
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,360
You're the best.

385
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,240
I want to be with my brother forever.

386
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,240
What are you talking about?

387
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,080
You will get married sooner or later.

388
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,560
I will be nice to you.

389
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,640
Brother.

390
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
I don't want to get married.

391
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,120
I want to be with you forever.

392
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,600
Brother.

393
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,080
When will you marry?

394
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,480
When you marry Ke to our family.

395
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,000
Ke.

396
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,520
I want to marry Ke soon.

397
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,680
But...

398
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,760
If you marry Ke to our family,

399
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,280
we can live together.

400
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,360
Then we can play together every day.

401
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,680
Even if Ke lives here,

402
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,640
you have to live in the Shi family.

403
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,920
Brother.

404
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,320
What are you talking about?

405
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
It's so late.

406
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,760
I'm going to rest.

407
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,640
You should sleep early.

408
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,440
I won't talk to you.

409
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,920
I wish you a good dream.

410
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,040
It's so weird.

411
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,640
Brother ate roast chicken alone.

412
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,520
And he went to drink plum soup.

413
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,040
He must have gone to see some lady.

414
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,240
Sister Tan'er is also a girl.

415
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,480
Sister Tan'er left early.

416
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,680
Maybe they are not together.

417
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,600
I can't hide anything.

418
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,800
Brother is also weird.

419
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,880
Why does he smell of pastries?

420
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000
He went to empty his hands when he came back.

421
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,520
Did he go to drink?

422
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,520
Forget it.

423
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,720
I will catch him one day.

424
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,920
Don't cry.

425
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,840
Don't cry.

426
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,880
Brother Lu.

427
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,240
Why are you here?

428
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
It was too sweet.

429
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,440
How can I sleep?

430
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,680
You are so talkative.

431
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
I have something to tell you.

432
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,280
I will be busy recently.

433
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,360
Why?

434
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Your brother's wedding should be prepared.

435
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,160
And my two brothers are also in trouble.

436
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,400
I know about Zhu Xi's wedding.

437
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,280
But what about your two brothers?

438
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,720
They went on a date today.

439
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,840
It seems that I have to work harder.

440
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,360
Otherwise, I will be in trouble.

441
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,200
I will be in trouble.

442
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,920
Otherwise, I will be in trouble.

443
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,040
I...

444
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Nonsense.

445
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,200
Sister Tang.

446
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,200
Are you asleep?

447
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,280
Qin'er is here.

448
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,000
Brother Lu.

449
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
You should go now.

450
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Stop it.

451
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,800
You won't be able to sleep if you keep talking.

452
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,440
I can't sleep.

453
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:16,880
Go.

454
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:17,960
Go.

455
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,960
I will close the window.

456
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,240
Go.

457
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,160
Sister Tang.

458
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
I can't sleep.

459
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,040
I want to sleep with you tonight.

460
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,600
Okay.

461
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,880
But...

462
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,840
Why are you so flustered?

463
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,880
It's too hot.

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,040
Let's open the window and take a breath.

465
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,640
No.

466
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,160
It's windy at night.

467
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,320
It's easy to catch a cold.

468
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,280
Let's go to sleep.

469
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,240
How was your sleep last night?

470
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,040
It was okay.

471
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
But you can't eat too much before you sleep.

472
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,840
It's good for your sleep.

473
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,640
Please remember my instruction.

474
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,160
I have a favor to ask.

475
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,560
Lu Zhu Xi is a good man.

476
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,120
Can you tell me

477
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,120
about it?

478
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,400
I'm willing to do it.

479
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,960
Ke.

480
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,280
You know Zhu's wife the best.

481
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
How much money do I need to prepare for her?

482
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,240
Yanyan doesn't value money.

483
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,080
The most important thing is

484
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,360
to have a good relationship.

485
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,920
If you can get along with each other,

486
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,000
and Mr. Lu is in love with you,

487
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,560
you can get Yanyan's heart.

488
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,560
But Zhu's house is the Prime Minister's house.

489
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,840
It's a high position.

490
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,120
It's necessary to have a good etiquette.

491
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,240
Brother Lu.

492
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
This is the etiquette I prepared.

493
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Just prepare it like this.

494
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,160
Manager Yu.

495
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,480
Chief.

496
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,520
What can I do for you?

497
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,280
This is the betrothal gift for Zhu Xi.

498
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,360
Prepare it according to this gift list.

499
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,520
Yes.

500
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,920
Sister Pan'er, wait.

501
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,320
I wonder what you think about this betrothal gift.

502
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,440
I don't know much about Zhu Xi.

503
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
I have no idea.

504
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,200
I mean

505
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,680
what you think about your betrothal gift.

506
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,280
I don't know.

507
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
Don't ask me.

508
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,000
I have no idea.

509
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,640
You don't know.

510
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,280
Then I'll ask my brother.

511
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,920
It seems that I guess it right.

512
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:40,920
Brother.

513
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,320
You are here, too.

514
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,080
I was careless.

515
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,360
You should call me sister-in-law.

516
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,480
Brother Lu.

517
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,760
You are a talkative brother.

518
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,280
It seems that I should work harder.

519
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,360
I saw Manager Li

520
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
taking out a list with a red face.

521
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,440
Are you two discussing something big?

522
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,800
It's all for you.

523
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,960
For me?

524
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,320
This list

525
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,640
is all for my future sister-in-law.

526
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,360
Really?

527
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,400
Brother and sister-in-law, you treat me so well.

528
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,640
Mr. Lu.

529
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,080
I know you and Yan Yan are in love.

530
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,040
But the Prime Minister's Mansion is different.

531
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,400
The etiquette is thorough and the betrothal gift is complete.

532
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,400
I know.

533
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,400
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

534
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,520
Sister-in-law, call me Zhu Xi.

535
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,000
Zhu Xi.

536
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,400
I know Yan Yan's character.

537
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,960
He doesn't care about the Jinqian family.

538
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,280
He just hopes that

539
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,960
someone can understand him

540
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,640
and spend his life with him.

541
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
So, Zhu Xi.

542
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,960
Can you promise me

543
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,040
that you will be good to Yan Yan in the rest of your life?

544
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,080
I can.

545
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Not only in this life,

546
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,360
I will spend my life with him

547
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,280
in the next life and the next.

548
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,200
And,

549
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,000
Yan Yan likes to read books.

550
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,720
Especially those who like the people in the next mountain.

551
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,400
You should write more for him.

552
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,600
Sister-in-law.

553
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,480
Not only do I write more for him,

554
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,960
I'm willing to write for him every day.

555
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,920
That's good.

556
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,200
When we're ready to get married,

557
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,400
we'll go to propose.

558
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,120
Thank you for your help.

559
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,240
I won't bother you.

560
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,200
I'm leaving.

561
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,800
You...

562
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,560
You...

563
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,240
Cos...

564
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,520
You...

565
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,920
Why are you here?

566
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,480
I came to see you.

567
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,760
But

568
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,440
there are many people in the house during the day.

569
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,960
You should go back after you see them.

570
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm not leaving.

571
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,960
You are always

572
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,000
with the painting of the people in the next mountain.

573
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,120
But I

574
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,120
even see you.

575
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,240
I think you

576
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,520
like her more.

577
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,480
Don't talk nonsense.

578
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,240
My brother

579
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,280
has started to prepare a wedding gift for me.

580
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,280
He will come to my house to propose to me

581
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,760
before the wedding.

582
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,320
By then,

583
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,520
I can be with you

584
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,640
day and night.

585
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,520
I see.

586
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,720
Yan Yan.

587
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,600
We are going to make up.

588
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,000
Before the wedding,

589
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,840
I want to confess something to you.

590
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,120
I...

591
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,960
Are you

592
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,040
just like the painting?

593
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,520
You have a little sister who is deeply in love with you.

594
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,920
Actually...

595
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,520
Actually,

596
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,400
there is someone

597
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,040
who always cares about me.

598
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,400
Yan Yan.

599
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,000
Then why are you

600
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,200
so entangled with me?

601
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,000
Lu Zhu Xi.

602
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
I only want the one I love.

603
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,320
Don't come to me

604
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,000
in the future.

605
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,120
Yan Yan.

606
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,640
I'm just kidding.

607
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,640
No.

608
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
I'm not kidding.

609
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,600
You...

610
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,640
Yan Yan.

611
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,600
Look at this.

612
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,200
I don't want to see it.

613
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,360
Yan Yan.

614
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
Look at this print.

615
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,760
This...

616
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,440
Isn't this the print of the next mountain?

617
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,840
How can you...

618
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,600
Are you

619
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,600
the next mountain?

620
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,240
I said there is someone

621
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,680
who cares about me.

622
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,960
I'm not lying, right?

623
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,000
You...

624
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,960
How can you do this?

625
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,480
You know I admire the next mountain.

626
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
You made it in the morning.

627
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,000
And you are still joking.

628
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,520
I'm just kidding.

629
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,760
Yan Yan.

630
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,640
Hello, Prime Minister Zhu.

631
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,400
This is the second son of Xibao Pavilion,

632
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,360
Lu Zhu Xi.

633
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
He brought a betrothal gift

634
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,320
to marry you.

635
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,480
Greetings, Prime Minister Zhu.

636
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,760
I'm Lu Zhu Xi.

637
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,200
I'm a man from the next mountain.

638
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,800
I have a family of businessmen.

639
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
I'm interested in you.

640
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,080
I'm willing to marry you.

641
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,920
I'm willing to marry you.

642
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,160
We will be married in the future.

643
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,480
We will know each other.

644
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,040
Please help me.

645
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,160
Prime Minister Zhu.

646
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,240
Since my mother became an official,

647
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,840
you have been my guest.

648
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,800
And I'm your best friend.

649
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,440
I've always wanted to

650
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,240
choose someone to love and care for

651
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,880
for you.

652
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,280
Now I really

653
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,960
meet this man.

654
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,840
I'm willing to protect you.

655
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,720
You don't have to say anything

656
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,360
about the marriage.

657
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,440
Our relationship

658
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,800
is good.

659
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,440
You and your mother

660
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,080
are good friends.

661
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,880
But I want to ask

662
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,880
this Mr. Lu some questions.

663
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,920
Please go ahead, Prime Minister.

664
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,000
My family has been officials for generations

665
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,560
and prime ministers for generations.

666
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,000
Xibao Pavilion

667
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
has a lot of wealth.

668
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,480
I don't care about it.

669
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,560
We have a lot of money and power.

670
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,840
We have everything.

671
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,520
Everything in the world

672
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,880
is as precious as our Yan Yan.

673
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,240
Mr. Lu will write a few books.

674
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,480
He will say sweet words.

675
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,520
He wants to ask for the only daughter

676
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,200
of our Prime Minister's Mansion.

677
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,040
Prime Minister, I...

678
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,480
Prime Minister Zhu.

679
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,120
Yan Yan lost his parents when he was a child.

680
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,320
His stepmother was very sad for him.

681
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,000
You love him

682
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,000
and raised him by your side.

683
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,720
I know.

684
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,880
Yan Yan is your pearl of honor.

685
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,680
He always has what he wants.

686
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,200
You love him so much.

687
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,040
Why do you care about the person who wants to marry you?

688
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,080
Do you have money, power and power?

689
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,040
What you care about

690
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,320
is whether Yan Yan can be happy

691
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,840
and live a peaceful life.

692
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,240
I think

693
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,040
Mr. Lu must know your feelings.

694
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,240
Don't worry, Prime Minister.

695
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,040
I won't let Yan Yan suffer.

696
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,880
I will be by Yan Yan's side every day

697
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,560
and care about him.

698
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,920
This matter

699
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,840
will be discussed another day.

700
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,760
Please go back first.

701
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,080
I will see you off.

702
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Please go back.

703
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,800
Grandfather didn't agree.

704
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,680
What should I do?

705
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,480
What should I do?

706
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,080
Is everything going well?

707
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,680
Zhu Xi.

708
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,800
Don't be too sad.

709
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,080
You know that

710
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,680
you care about your granddaughter the most.

711
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,000
You should think carefully

712
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,440
about your granddaughter.

713
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,360
It's not something that can be done at once.

714
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,920
Besides,

715
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,080
you didn't say no.

716
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,800
Don't be sad.

717
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,440
Yan Yan was in a difficult time when he was young.

718
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,360
But he is still optimistic and cheerful.

719
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,920
When we get married in the future,

720
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,920
I can only treat him better.

721
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,680
I will marry Yan Yan in this life.

722
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,120
And this life

723
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,200
is only grandchildren of animals.

724
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,120
If you make me react like that,

725
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,400
I will be a good vulgar bagger

726
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,520
with no choice.

727
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,880
Yan Yan didn't want to marry you.

728
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,480
Why would he marry a sociopath?

729
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,160
He is your father.

730
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,200
He knows you are a saint when you work for him.

731
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,320
It must make him penny- realization.

732
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,140
She had a Who?

733
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,400
Who?

734
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,520
and refused Xibao Pavilion.

735
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,640
You're angry, right?

736
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,680
Yanyan.

737
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,520
What do you think

738
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,080
to tell your grandfather?

739
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,240
Grandfather.

740
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,240
I do like Childe Lu.

741
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,560
He's not a good student.

742
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,920
He has thousands of gold and silver.

743
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,880
He's just a merchant.

744
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,280
The family is not right.

745
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,280
Have you thought about

746
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,760
what it means to marry him?

747
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,560
Grandfather.

748
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,280
It's not a carefree job.

749
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Besides,

750
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,120
the one I want to marry is a good person.

751
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,280
He's not a good student.

752
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,280
Grandfather, I agree with you.

753
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,720
I'll only talk about his character.

754
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,160
When he's married,

755
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,320
he's a good man.

756
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,240
What about his future?

757
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,120
How long can he last?

758
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,360
Grandfather.

759
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,120
Grandfather.

760
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,560
Do you remember

761
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,040
the dangerous thing at the Flower Pavilion?

762
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,360
He saved me from the fire

763
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,560
and didn't hesitate.

764
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,080
He was so decisive in the crisis.

765
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,960
I believe he's a reliable man.

766
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,040
With such experience,

767
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,480
it can prove his character.

768
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,880
But it's not enough to prove his heart.

769
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,720
A man should have the courage

770
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,200
to go forward without giving up.

771
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,800
Grandfather.

772
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,600
If he's sincere,

773
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,600
he should prove it to me

774
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,840
instead of letting my dear granddaughter

775
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,600
to express his love for him.

776
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,640
If he can pass my test,

777
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,520
I'll talk about other things.

778
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,960
Grandfather.

779
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,080
I believe he can pass your test.

780
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,640
Mr. Lu.

781
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,120
Dear.

782
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,880
Yan Yan.

783
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,360
I'm here.

784
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Yan Yan.

785
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
Mr. Lu.

786
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,140
You're finally here.

787
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,400
So you're waiting for me.

788
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,840
I brought you this.

789
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,640
Wow!

790
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,520
It's so cool.

791
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,360
I wrote a new chapter of the book

792
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
and sent it to you.

793
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm afraid you'll get tired of reading it.

794
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,160
Thank you.

795
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,240
I didn't expect

796
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,360
my long-time wish

797
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,520
to finally come true.

798
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,880
Yanyan,

799
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,320
I...

800
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,560
I want to ask...

801
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,960
Do you want to ask

802
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,520
my feelings for you?

803
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,240
I told Brother and Shimei Guan

804
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,200
today.

805
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,560
You have to marry me.

806
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,920
I won't change my mind.

807
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,520
Do you know

808
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,200
my feelings for you?

809
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,920
I, Zhu Yanyan,

810
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,760
will marry only

811
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,320
Lu Zhu Xi in this life.

812
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,040
I won't change my mind.

813
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,800
The End

814
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,360
Zhao Mingguan,

815
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,200
count it.

816
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,760
How many

817
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,960
did we make this month?

818
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
I've counted it.

819
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,080
You made 12 orders this month.

820
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,560
I made three orders.

821
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,520
There's at least one order

822
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,960
for each of us.

823
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
Look, look.

824
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,360
So many.

825
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
I have such a good performance

826
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,240
because of the love and care of all my colleagues.

827
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,040
Ke, you're modest.

828
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,800
You're a real beauty.

829
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,480
You'll be a woman sooner or later.

830
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,120
I think Guan Mei Ting should be

831
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,880
promoted to the position of the beauty.

832
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,760
No, no, no.

833
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,880
Zhao Mingguan,

834
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,200
I don't think so.

835
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,840
I just want to be a beauty.

836
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,280
Look, after the beauty is gone,

837
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,240
we can do things

838
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,880
more easily and actively.

839
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,880
This month,

840
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,520
there are all beauty cases.

841
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,600
No one is missing.

842
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,880
That's right.

843
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,760
Ke is so amazing.

844
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
So amazing.

845
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,400
I'll work harder in the future.

846
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,720
I hope you can

847
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,560
support me and help me.

848
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,760
Help each other.

849
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,920
Let's make more beauty cases together.

850
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,440
Yes.

851
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:45,960
Okay.

852
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,200
Brother Lu.

853
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,720
Why is Ke so happy?

854
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,120
Brother Lu,

855
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
guess how many beauty cases

856
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,760
I've done this month?

857
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,720
Twelve.

858
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,560
How do you know?

859
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,560
I'm so embarrassed.

860
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,920
I've done every beauty case with you.

861
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,600
I've counted

862
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
all the cases for you.

863
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,680
I'm worried

864
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,520
when you're happy

865
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,520
when others are happy.

866
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,680
Brother Lu,

867
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,840
I'm hungry.

868
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Let's go eat.

869
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,840
Let's go.

870
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,200
Let's go.

871
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,680
Brother Lu,

872
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,160
before you turn мой,

873
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,240
I want to be your girlfriend.

874
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,880
I don't want to worry about you.

875
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:54,640
I'm

876
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,840
right here.

877
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,880
K myself.

878
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,760
K,

879
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,480
I'm right here for you.

880
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,240
Brother Lu,

881
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
I want to wait for you to come back before I close the door.

882
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,240
So that you won't sneak in.

883
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Brother, are you in a bad mood today?

884
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Because Ke is not here?

885
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Ke hasn't been here for days.

886
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,240
If he doesn't come, you can go to him.

887
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Forget it.

888
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
He is busy.

889
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,240
It's not good for me to disturb him.

890
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,240
But I heard from Ke recently.

891
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Ke always goes to Xi Bao.

892
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
He also said he would help Lu Chi's brother to tell him.

893
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,240
Brother, you can't let Lu Chi take the lead at this time.

894
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
If so,

895
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
it's his own choice.

896
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Brother Lu, thank you.

897
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
Go back and rest early.

898
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
You too.

899
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Ke.

900
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
Go away.

901
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
You.

902
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
Brother, brother.

903
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,240
You tell me first.

904
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Where did you go?

905
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
I...

906
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
Brother.

907
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,240
Look at the moon tonight.

908
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
It's beautiful.

909
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
Yes.

910
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
Look at the moon.

911
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,240
It's so big.

912
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,240
Go away.

913
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
Brother, brother.

914
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
I'm leaving first.

915
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
Lu Chi.

916
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
You.

917
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
Don't let me see you again.

918
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
Ke.

919
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,240
Ke.

920
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,240
I'm sleeping.

921
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,240
Oh no.

922
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
How can I keep an eye on Ke?

923
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,240
He seems to have gone back with Lu Chi.

924
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
Not like.

925
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,240
Just like.

926
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
Don't worry, brother.

927
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
We have our father.

928
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,240
Right.

929
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
We have our father.

930
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
No big problem.

931
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,240
You.

932
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,240
Brother Lu.

933
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Ke, you're here.

934
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,240
Brother Lu.

935
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,240
Do you think

936
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,240
if we don't see each other for many days

937
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,240
and see each other again

938
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,240
we will be happier than before?

939
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,240
Why don't we see each other for many days?

940
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,240
I know this meeting

941
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
is the grace of fate

942
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,240
Every time I see you

943
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,240
I only have

944
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
a lovely stubbornness

945
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
Although I can't remember

946
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,240
every difficulty

947
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
I have to face

948
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
I will always remember

949
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
the time we spent together

950
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,240
I will always remember

951
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,240
the time we spent together

952
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,240
I will always remember

953
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
the time we spent together

954
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,240
I will always remember

955
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,240
every difficult day

956
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
but I never forget

957
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
the first time

958
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,240
we met

959
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Even if this love is heartless

960
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,240
and ungrateful

961
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,240
no matter how far it is

962
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,240
as long as you are not afraid

963
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,240
no worries

964
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,240
no worries

965
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,240
I will always be by your side

966
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,240
no matter the fire and the world

967
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,120
Help me

968
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,240
Some brain

969
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:16,160
Medical

970
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,240
Help me

971
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,440
Meat

972
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,640
Money

973
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:31,120
I don't care if it's love or mourning

974
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:37,760
Please remember the youth that you used to have

975
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:46,760
From now on, I don't want to part with you
