1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,860
Then it's around 18

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of being

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
a little bit hesitant

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The blush on your face

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and your flustered heart

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Who is willing to be

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the one to be

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the one to be

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's better to be

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the one who is

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
always so cool

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The song of falling

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is better to be

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the one who is

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the one who is

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm already at the end of my life

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The years are passing by

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you have any worries

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Some love is like

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
a hug

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but it's not fair

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
To love someone for life

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
is the best way

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Some people can't be rejected

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Fang Shoumei, I won't agree

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I won't marry someone

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't like

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Please go back

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Please go back

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Fang Shoumei, wait

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You know that

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Chengxiang has someone she likes

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why do you change the title for her?

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Wu Anhao wants to marry her

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm her matchmaker

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I should get her a wedding

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why do you do this?

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Did someone force you?

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I told you

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Chengxiang has someone she likes

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And she entrusted the marriage to me

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Shi Meiguan

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There is no rule for one matchmaker

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Chen Ruoning is good

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
if he can marry the one he likes

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If they are not meant to be

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
why can't I be in the matchmaker?

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I think we should help each other

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and be able to get married

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's our duty to help each other

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and be happy

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Deng Yi, the matchmaker

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
has no rule for one matchmaker

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And we should help each other

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and be able to get married

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Shi Meiguan

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you have anything else to say?

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why is it Wu Anhao?

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He is not a matchmaker

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Do you know his character?

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
As a matchmaker, we should be equal

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Whether we are officials or common people

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
As long as we find the matchmaker

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
we should do our best

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and do our best

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Besides, Wu Anhao's talent

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and family background are enough to match you

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But is the love of Miss Cheng

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
not important?

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Fang Shoumei, I will make Miss Cheng

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
be with the one she likes

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My lord has known you for a long time

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He wants to invite you to his mansion

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No need

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I have nothing to do with you

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please go back

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
My lord just wants to know

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
more about Miss Cheng

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If Miss Cheng doesn't want to go

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
it's okay

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think it's the same

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to invite some close people

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to Miss Cheng's mansion

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Be careful

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Be careful of fire

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Boss Cheng, it's late

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why are you here?

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's go

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Go

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Go

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Go

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Go

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Go

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Leave Jin Du with these silver, right now

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't let me see you again

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't sing in front of the road

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Anyway

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't want to hear anything

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
about you

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But what did the guard say to you?

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I actually

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't you understand what I said to you?

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Leave Jin Du at once

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't miss you anymore

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That person can help me to revive my family

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and to shock those relatives of the Chailang Sect.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you stay in the capital,

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
what if I get the news of my confession to you before,

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I won't be able to get married.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't want your money.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If you say so,

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will leave.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You must take care of yourself.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Be quick.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I will go to the capital.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I will go to the capital.

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I will go to the capital.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I will go to the capital.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will go to the capital.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I will go to the capital.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I will go to the capital.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I will go to the capital.

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I will go to the capital.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I will go to the capital.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will go to the capital.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will go to the capital.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I will go to the capital.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I will go to the capital.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I will go to the capital.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I will go to the capital.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I will go to the capital.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I will go to the capital.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I will go to the capital.

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I will go to the capital.

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I will go to the capital.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I will go to the capital.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I will go to the capital.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I will go to the capital.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I will go to the capital.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I will go to the capital.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I will go to the capital.

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I will go to the capital.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I will go to the capital.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I will go to the capital.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I will go to the capital.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I will go to the capital.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I will go to the capital.

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I will go to the capital.

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I will go to the capital.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will go to the capital.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I will go to the capital.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I will go to the capital.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I will go to the capital.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I will go to the capital.

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I will go to the capital.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I will go to the capital.

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,160
C else the page in my Mountains

163
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
is much ab 금 than this page in yours.

164
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
I have written some code brew for you.

165
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,160
I have written some code brew for me.

166
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Well, even I'm not a man.

167
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Even I'm not a man.

168
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,760
I…

169
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,760
I even can tyre you.

170
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,540
That canvas

171
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,540
is easier to hate.

172
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
What does it mean?

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,640
No.

174
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,640
Ake is in danger.

175
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,480
Starting tomorrow,

176
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,480
I'll guard him with all my might.

177
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,560
Brother Lu.

178
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,080
Ake.

179
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,520
Look what I brought you.

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,840
It smells so good.

181
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,240
I'll take you to the city today.

182
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,200
No.

183
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,440
I'm going to find Mr. Qiu Jiang today.

184
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,520
Fang Shoumei hasn't given up on

185
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:27,720
the

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,400
love of the world.

187
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,520
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

188
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,880
Where are you going?

189
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,440
I'll leave the capital today

190
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,400
for Ruining.

191
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,200
For Miss Cheng?

192
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,480
How could she let you leave?

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,520
You've waited for each other for ten years.

194
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,560
Now that you're in love,

195
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,960
why are you leaving now?

196
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,560
Shimi Guan.

197
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,960
Don't waste your time.

198
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,200
Ruining asked me to leave.

199
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,640
I'll leave right away.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Give me some more time.

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,240
I'll ask her.

202
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,800
Shimi Guan.

203
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,160
Brother Lu.

204
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,480
Take me to the city.

205
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,080
Okay.

206
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,320
Miss Cheng.

207
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,960
Miss.

208
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,040
Miss.

209
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,840
Miss Cheng.

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,960
Shimi Guan...

211
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,800
Miss Cheng.

212
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,320
Why is Mr. Qiu Jiang leaving?

213
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,440
He said he left because of you.

214
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,360
Is there anything wrong with you?

215
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,320
Did someone force you to do this?

216
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,040
No.

217
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
If you don't tell me the truth,

218
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,280
everything will be too late.

219
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,200
Tell me.

220
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,200
Brother Lu and I can help you.

221
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
You're no match for him.

222
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,120
I just want him to leave.

223
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,760
The farther the better.

224
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,040
The farther the better.

225
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,400
It's not dangerous if he leaves.

226
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,760
Is this person

227
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,520
Marquis Wu An?

228
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Miss Cheng.

229
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,200
Marquis Wu An is not a good person.

230
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,640
Even if Mr. Qiu Jiang leaves,

231
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,840
he won't be safe.

232
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,240
He'll be in danger.

233
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,360
No.

234
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,840
I have to stop Mr. Qiu Jiang.

235
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,480
Shimi Guan.

236
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,320
I was right.

237
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,760
This Shimi Guan is really a man of character.

238
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Next time he comes,

239
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,480
no matter where I am,

240
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,640
don't need to report.

241
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
Just bring him to me.

242
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,840
Yes.

243
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Brother Lu.

244
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,680
Hurry.

245
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,960
Take me to Mr. Qiu Jiang.

246
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,480
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

247
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,000
You've misunderstood Miss Cheng.

248
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,920
Marquis Wu An forced her to save her.

249
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,880
He had no choice but to let you leave the capital.

250
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,000
He's afraid that Marquis Wu An will know his thoughts.

251
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,240
You'll be in danger.

252
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
He really loves you.

253
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,120
So the person that Ruining said

254
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
is him.

255
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,480
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

256
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,920
Why don't you go to the capital first?

257
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,040
I'll be there in a minute.

258
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,160
I'll be there in a minute.

259
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,040
I'll be there in a minute.

260
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
I'll be there in a minute.

261
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll be there in a minute.

262
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll be there in a minute.

263
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll be there in a minute.

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll be there in a minute.

265
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,960
Why don't you go to Qianya Mountain to hide yourself?

266
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,160
Yes.

267
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,760
Brother Lu's friends are there.

268
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,840
They'll take care of you.

269
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm not going.

270
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,960
You're not going?

271
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,280
If I didn't know this,

272
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,920
I wouldn't have gone back to the capital.

273
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,680
Now that I know this,

274
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,880
even if I die,

275
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,160
I will never put Ruining in danger alone.

276
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,760
So I will never leave.

277
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,760
If that's the case,

278
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,920
Brother Lu.

279
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,440
Let's send him back.

280
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,040
But I'm afraid that

281
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,320
Mr. Qiu Jiang's original residence can't be resettled.

282
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,800
Leave it to me.

283
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,120
I'll arrange a safe place for Mr. Qiu Jiang

284
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,880
to stay for a few days.

285
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,160
We'll talk about it when we find a way.

286
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,720
Okay.

287
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,360
That's decided then.

288
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,160
Qiu Jiang.

289
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,280
Thank you for your carelessness.

290
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,440
Your Highness.

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,360
Not the beautiful maid.

292
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,720
It's our guest who συνvents you with your visitors.

293
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
Who are you?

294
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,680
Tiheng.

295
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,360
Princess.

296
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,040
Our heghter is a magnanimous person

297
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,240
who doesn't like to concert folks to their joys and sorrows.

298
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,720
I will let my lady know

299
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,520
the ways of our Hou's Mansion.

300
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,640
I will see her.

301
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,240
Really?

302
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,760
I have nothing to be afraid of.

303
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
I'll see her right away.

304
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,560
My lord,

305
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,960
the prime minister's wife is here.

306
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,800
Please come in.

307
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,920
My lady, please sit.

308
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,920
Have a taste of the snow mountain tea

309
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,240
I prepared for you.

310
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,480
Here.

311
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,480
My lady,

312
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,400
you are really a goddess.

313
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,360
I often hear

314
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,320
rumors about you in the capital.

315
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,480
To be honest,

316
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,080
I dreamt of talking to you

317
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,400
all the time

318
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,760
and becoming your confidante.

319
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,840
Please.

320
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,240
Thank you, my lord.

321
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm not thirsty.

322
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,680
Today, I saw the beauty of your beauty

323
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,080
and fell in love with you.

324
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,800
I was thinking

325
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,200
if I'm lucky enough to marry you,

326
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,680
I will love you and protect you.

327
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,440
With me,

328
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,640
I promise no one will bully you again.

329
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
As long as I'm here,

330
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,880
you can enjoy your life

331
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,760
and be the wife of the Marquis.

332
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,000
I will take care of the family.

333
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,320
It seems that

334
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
the Marquis doesn't like me,

335
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,320
but our family business.

336
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,640
You are really a quick-tempered woman

337
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,880
and a straightforward person.

338
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,240
Let me ask you.

339
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,280
In the life of the Marquis,

340
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
which woman doesn't want you?

341
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
I don't want her.

342
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,880
I've made up my mind

343
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,360
to be single and old.

344
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,080
Little lady,

345
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,400
think about it.

346
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,840
I'll ask Fang Shoumei

347
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,200
to propose to you in a few days.

348
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Let me remind you.

349
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,440
It's hard to tell.

350
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,160
You can't keep going on by yourself.

351
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,080
Little lady,

352
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,960
I can beg her

353
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
or force her.

354
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,920
It depends on which one you like.

355
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,960
천年

356
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,920
Ke.

357
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,720
Don't worry.

358
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,640
We don't have anyone

359
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
familiar with the idea.

360
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,880
No one can find him.

361
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,600
I'll figure it out

362
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,760
and find another plan.

363
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,040
Brother Lu.

364
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,400
It's getting late now.

365
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,800
You should get some rest now.

366
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,000
I never feel sorrowful

367
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,280
to be with you.

368
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,480
Neither do I,

369
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,800
because I'm with you.

370
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
This sentence seems to only appear in my dream.

371
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Does it hurt? Do you still want to dream?

372
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
It really hurts.

373
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
I don't want to be a burden to you.

374
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
I won't be a burden.

375
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Brother Lu.

376
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
I hope that all the relatives in the world

377
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
can be embraced in this simple and happy way.

378
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I will help you, Brother.

379
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Brother Lu, don't forget tomorrow.

380
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
I will go to the X-ray department to find you.

381
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Let's discuss what to do next.

382
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Okay.

383
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
I'll go first.

384
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
The X-ray Department

385
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Our young lady has ordered

386
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
the maid to come to see the young lady.

387
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
No need to inform her.

388
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Young lady!

389
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Young lady!

390
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Little bitch!

391
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Let me go!

392
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
I will die without these troubles.

393
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I don't want to die.

394
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Marry the Queen.

395
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Young lady, don't be like this.

396
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Let's think of a way.

397
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Maybe we can find a way to get her back.

398
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
The problem will be solved.

399
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Yes, young lady.

400
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Please come down.

401
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Come down.

402
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Prime Minister.

403
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Don't be so hard on yourself.

404
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Mr. Qiu Jiang told me before he left.

405
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,800
He would rather die than be with you.

406
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
You are not afraid of death.

407
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
What's the problem that can stop you?

408
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
He really said that.

409
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
He is very responsible.

410
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
He has a lot of strength.

411
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
He really said that.

412
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Don't worry.

413
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Brother Lu and I will help you find a way.

414
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Eat more.

415
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
What should we do?

416
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
The young lady of the Cheng family is going to die.

417
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
We can't think of a way.

418
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I think

419
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
the story of Mr. Qiu Jiang's story will come true.

420
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
They are in love.

421
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
They will go with the wind.

422
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
The best way

423
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
is to make Wu An Hou give up.

424
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
But

425
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,800
how can we make Wu An Hou give up?

426
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Let him lose.

427
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
He will be convinced.

428
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
I heard that

429
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Wu An Hou died early.

430
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
He must be old and ugly.

431
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
He can't compare to Mr. Qiu Jiang.

432
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Actually, Wu An Hou

433
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
is not as old as us.

434
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Thank you, Brother Lu.

435
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
I have an idea.

436
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Come on.

437
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Let's eat.

438
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Eat.

439
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
This is good.

440
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Take it.

441
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Okay.

442
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
It doesn't taste good.

443
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Brother Xian.

444
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Brother Xian.

445
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Tian Tian.

446
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
I'm here to deliver the business to you again.

447
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Ke.

448
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
It's Ke.

449
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Why are you here to bother us?

450
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Brother Xian.

451
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
I need 300 pancakes.

452
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Tomorrow afternoon,

453
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
there will be a small company from the Baihua Art Hall to pay.

454
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
One ticket for each.

455
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I'll leave this to you.

456
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
I have something to do.

457
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I'm leaving.

458
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Ke.

459
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
I...

460
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Tian Tian.

461
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Help me prepare.

462
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Brother.

463
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Give him whatever he wants.

464
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
I dare not say anything to him.

465
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Okay.

466
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Say less.

467
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Ke must be in a hurry.

468
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
A-Lan, A-Fang.

469
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Bring me the flour.

470
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Okay.

471
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Come on.

472
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Take a look.

473
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Take a look.

474
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Okay.

475
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Take a look.

476
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Thank you.

477
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Sir.

478
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Take a look.

479
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Hello.

480
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Take a look.

481
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Okay.

482
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
It's so delicious.

483
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Dear viewers.

484
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Boss Cheng is treating everyone to pancakes.

485
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
With the passbook you have,

486
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,800
you can go to He Ji to get a piece of pancakes.

487
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Recently, He Ji has launched many new pancakes.

488
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
You can buy them with all your money.

489
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Boss Cheng is so generous.

490
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
But what's the joy in the Cheng family?

491
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Yes.

492
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Yes.

493
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Don't worry.

494
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Now, I'm going to announce the joy.

495
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
If you, Madam Cheng,

496
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
are at the age of marriage,

497
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
in a few days,

498
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,800
you will hold a wedding competition in the Flower Hall.

499
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Anyone who is capable can sign up.

500
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Boss Cheng is going to announce the joy.

501
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Cheng Ruoning, the head of the capital,

502
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
why does he have to announce the joy in the competition?

503
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Yes.

504
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Yes.

505
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Everyone, you heard it right.

506
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
It's Cheng Ruoning.

507
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Anyone who wants to participate

508
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
can write down the name, age, and surname

509
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
and send them to the official media.

510
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
The official media will select them one by one.

511
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Those who are selected

512
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
can participate in the wedding competition.

513
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Sign up!

514
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Sign up!

515
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Sign up!

516
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Sign up!

517
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Sign up!

518
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
Sign up!

519
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Sign up!

520
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Sign up!

521
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
If you want to spread the news,

522
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
the official media

523
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
will receive a lot of post-mortem introduction.

524
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
You should know that

525
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
I only sent 300 letters of letter of marriage.

526
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
So many people.

527
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
What should we do?

528
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Don't worry.

529
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
I will select the best competitors

530
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
from the 300 people.

531
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
But these people

532
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
are the only ones I want to marry.

533
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Don't be afraid.

534
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
I have my own arrangement.

535
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Take a rest after you clean up.

536
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Okay, Manager.

537
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I'm so tired.

538
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
These days,

539
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
whenever I come to the store to get wedding cakes,

540
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I will buy something else.

541
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Business is good.

542
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Business is good.

543
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
It's all Ake's contribution.

544
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Okay.

545
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
You should take a rest.

546
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
I'll do it here.

547
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Yes.

548
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Business is good.

549
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
It's all Ake's contribution.

550
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Brother Xiang.

551
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
I need to talk to you.

552
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Don't rush.

553
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Take your time.

554
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Tomorrow,

555
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
can you go to the Bihua Art Museum

556
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
to attend Cheng Ruining's selection competition?

557
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
No.

558
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
It's Fak.

559
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
You are so heartless.

560
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Why do you want my brother to go on a blind date again?

561
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
It's not a blind date.

562
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
It's helping others.

563
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Helping others is a good thing.

564
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Ting Ting,

565
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
saving lives is a great blessing.

566
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
And it's all a show.

567
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Cheng Ruining has someone he likes.

568
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
I have named both Brother Xian and Brother Lu.

569
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
They are my killer sisters.

570
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Okay, I'll go.

571
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Really?

572
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
That's great.

573
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I have something to do.

574
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
I'll go first.

575
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
You...

576
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
18th class.

577
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
You are heartless.

578
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Brother, look at him.

579
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
You are so loyal.

580
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
You are not Xia Yinchuan.

581
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
You are here to get married.

582
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
You are so ungrateful.

583
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
You want to go on a blind date again?

584
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Brother,

585
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
do you want to be like this forever?

586
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
You can go anywhere you want.

587
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Enough, Ting Ting.

588
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Didn't Ake say

589
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
that he just went to help.

590
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
It's not a real blind date.

591
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Enough.

592
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Don't you want to rest?

593
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Go.

594
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Go.

595
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Go.

596
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
You are so ungrateful.

597
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Brother Lu.

598
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Are you done with your duty?

599
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Brother Lu,

600
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
listen to me.

601
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Tomorrow,

602
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
you must go on stage

603
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
for the wedding ceremony

604
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
at the Bihua Hall.

605
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Brother Xian and I have discussed it.

606
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
He will go on stage too.

607
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
So Boss He has agreed to it?

608
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Why don't you

609
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
ask me first?

610
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
Brother Lu,

611
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
you are a fool.

612
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Of course, it's because of you.

613
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
You will definitely help me.

614
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Yes.

615
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
I will help you.

616
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Today is Boss Cheng's competition.

617
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Hurry up.

618
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Hurry up.

619
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Let's go.

620
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Is this Cheng Xiao Niang's wedding?

621
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
It's so beautiful.

622
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
What's this?

623
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
It's out.

624
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Cheng Xiao Niang is out.

625
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
It's so beautiful.

626
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
So beautiful.

627
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Please come in.

628
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Marquis of Wu'an is here.

629
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Marquis of Wu'an is here.

630
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Marquis of Wu'an.

631
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
So these two

632
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
are my opponents today.

633
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,800
It seems that I will win today.

634
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Please sit down.

635
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Since everyone is here,

636
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
let's start the competition.

637
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
I announce that

638
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Cheng Ruonin and Cheng Xiao Niang's

639
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
wedding competition

640
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
will officially begin.

641
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Today,

642
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
there are four young men in the competition.

643
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
How can there be four?

644
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
What's going on?

645
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I don't know.

646
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
There are

647
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Lu Chi Lu,

648
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Marquis of Wu'an,

649
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
He Ke Xian He,

650
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
and

651
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

652
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

653
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

654
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
He is the famous man of Baihua Hall.

655
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
He is

656
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
the famous man of Baihua Hall.

657
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
He is not necessarily

658
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
a good man.

659
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
He is so handsome.

660
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Boss Cheng.

661
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Do you want to

662
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
make a big deal?

663
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Don't be so proud.

664
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
He is the boss.

665
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
He is the boss.

666
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
He is the boss.

667
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
He is so handsome.

668
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Marquis of Wu'an.

669
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
You need to have an identity.

670
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
You need to have a background.

671
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
You need to have power and power.

672
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
You need to be rich and strong.

673
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
How can you compete with a little white face?

674
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Under the circumstances,

675
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
what did the two of them

676
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
do wrong?

677
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
They have to be in line.

678
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Yes.

679
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Everyone, be quiet.

680
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Today's wedding competition

681
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
is to choose a good match

682
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
for Cheng Ruonin and Cheng Xiao Niang.

683
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
What kind of young man

684
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
do you think

685
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
is suitable for Cheng Xiao Niang?

686
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
He is handsome.

687
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
He has power and power.

688
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
The Cheng family is rich and powerful.

689
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
For Cheng Xiao Niang,

690
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
money is not important.

691
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Of course, it is not the most important.

692
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
What kind of girl

693
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
does Cheng Xiao Niang want?

694
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Cheng Xiao Niang has read books.

695
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
She wants to find someone

696
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
who can talk to her

697
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
and get angry with her.

698
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Yes.

699
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
I think so.

700
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
Cheng Xiao Niang is alone.

701
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
She has a big family.

702
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
She wants to be a good wife.

703
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
She wants to be a good husband.

704
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
She wants to be a good wife.

705
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
She wants to be a good husband.

706
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Cheng Xiao Niang has a big family.

707
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
She has a good career.

708
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
But her family is very poor.

709
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
So she needs the warmth of her family

710
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
and the care of her lover.

711
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,800
So she needs a good family

712
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
who can take care of her.

713
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
And this person

714
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
can't be poor.

715
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Otherwise, if Cheng Xiao Niang

716
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
has different ideas,

717
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
she won't have common language.

718
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
A couple can be loved by hundreds of people.

719
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
That's right.

720
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Honestly, only rich people

721
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
can have common hobbies.

722
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
I really envy Cheng Xiao Niang.

723
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
I think it's reasonable

724
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
that the poem is not official.

725
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
The gold and silver are not enough.

726
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
If there are too many, they won't go.

727
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
If you don't bring them, you won't go.

728
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
You need to have a

729
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
warm and caring person.

730
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
That's right.

731
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
Everyone.

732
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
There are three rounds in this competition.

733
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
The score system is implemented.

734
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
The winner and the second and third place

735
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
are decided by Cheng Xiao Niang.

736
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
The one with the highest score

737
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
will be the winner.

738
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
The winner can directly

739
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
marry Cheng Xiao Niang.

740
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Good.

741
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Good.

742
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Good.

743
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Good.

744
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Congratulations.

745
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
By the way,

746
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
there's one more thing.

747
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
The most important thing about loving someone

748
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
is to never leave her.

749
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Be loyal.

750
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
So once the competition starts,

751
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
you need to complete all the steps.

752
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
If you quit halfway,

753
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
the score will automatically clear.

754
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,800
You will lose the right to marry Cheng Xiao Niang.

755
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
I announce that

756
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
the first round of competition

757
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
will officially begin.

758
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Cheng Xiao Niang is from a rich family.

759
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
She knows how to play the zither and calligraphy.

760
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
If she can make a good match

761
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
with her future husband,

762
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
it will be even better.

763
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
So in this round,

764
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
we will play zither, calligraphy and calligraphy.

765
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
You can choose one of the four

766
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
to compete.

767
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Please choose.

768
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
I choose calligraphy.

769
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
I choose

770
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
calligraphy.

771
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
The first round of competition begins.

772
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
I choose

773
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
calligraphy.

774
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
I think it's weird.

775
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
This is so hard.

776
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
I think it's weird.

777
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Yeah.

778
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
This is so weird.

779
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I think it's weird.

780
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I think it's weird.

781
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
I think it's weird.

782
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Who?

783
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Why is it so hard?

784
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
It's so hard.

785
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
It's really hard.

786
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
It's so hard.

787
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
It's so hard.

788
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
The game is over.

789
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Please draw the picture

790
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
and give the score to Qin Ying.

791
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Please, Miss Cheng Xiao.

792
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
What Mr. Lu is doing is an autumn painting.

793
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
The color is bright and lively.

794
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
Although it's autumn,

795
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
it doesn't look dull.

796
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Instead, it's full of life

797
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
and it's a masterpiece.

798
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Good.

799
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Good.

800
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Good.

801
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Good.

802
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Good.

803
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Is this the book written by the Marquis?

804
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Yes.

805
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
The way the Marquis wrote is so good.

806
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,800
There are endless changes in the rough.

807
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
It's also a masterpiece.

808
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Good.

809
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Marquis is good at writing.

810
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Marquis is good at writing.

811
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
Good.

812
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
But the words of the Marquis

813
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
are from the 48th book of the state of Guanzi.

814
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
This book is all about the way to govern the country.

815
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
But the Marquis is talented and good at making up stories.

816
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
But I don't know it.

817
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Right.

818
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Who's father and daughter

819
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
would talk about this in the house?

820
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
It's really hard to understand.

821
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Who said it's not?

822
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
It's about governing the country.

823
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Right.

824
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Right.

825
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
The sound of the zither of Mr. Qiu Jiang

826
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
is like a jade plate.

827
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
It's as beautiful as the spring breeze.

828
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
As for the music of the Marquis,

829
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
it needs to be quiet.

830
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
According to the judgment of the young lady,

831
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
the winner of this round is Mr. Lu.

832
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Right.

833
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
He's really good.

834
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
Good.

835
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Good.

836
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Mr. Lu is good at painting.

837
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
He's very active.

838
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
He's 3 points.

839
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Marquis Wu'an is good at calligraphy.

840
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
But he's not good at writing.

841
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
He's 2 points.

842
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Mr. Qiu Jiang is very good at playing the zither.

843
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
He made the young lady very drunk.

844
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
He's 1 point.

845
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Mr. He is very good at playing the zither.

846
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
He's 5 points.

847
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
If you want to win the heart of the young lady,

848
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
you need to grab her stomach first.

849
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,800
If her future husband can make a good dish,

850
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
it will be a great success.

851
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
So we'll compete with Chu Yi in this round.

852
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Bastard.

853
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
I'm the Marquis.

854
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
How could I do such a vulgar thing?

855
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,800
I can find a famous cook for the young lady.

856
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Besides, which man is willing to work with the pot all day?

857
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Right.

858
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Why can't a man cook for the people he loves?

859
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
The food doesn't absorb the spring water.

860
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Now, the cook can cook soup for the people he loves.

861
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,800
The young lady who is spoiled can cook soup for the people she loves.

862
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Why can't a man cook for the people he loves?

863
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
You're just a street vendor.

864
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Of course you don't care.

865
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,800
I've never been in the kitchen.

866
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
The dishes don't need to be exquisite.

867
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
The most important thing is the intention.

868
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,800
If you think it's difficult, you can give up.

869
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Okay, I'll give up this round.

870
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Marquis, have you thought it through?

871
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,800
You'll get zero points in this round.

872
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
You...

873
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Please.

874
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Even if I'm in, I'm still a book.

875
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Why should I be embarrassed?

876
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Marquis is so wise.

877
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Let's go.

878
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,800
I've always thought that the autumn will be full of spring water.

879
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,800
I didn't expect the people in the house can cook a good dish.

880
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Men should do such a good thing.

881
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Marquis is a man who does great work.

882
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,400
How can we do this?

883
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,200
I didn't expect that all three of you have unusual cooking skills.

884
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,200
Then I hope that Lady Cheng can try some of these.

885
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,000
To ensure the fairness of the competition,

886
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
we will also select three people from the audience to try them.

887
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,200
This dish of Mr. Qiu Jiang

888
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,800
tastes very good.

889
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
It has a very...

890
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,600
home-cooked taste.

891
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,600
Mr. Lu's cooking skills are unique.

892
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,600
This chicken is very delicious.

893
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
But this tofu...

894
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,600
What's wrong with this tofu?

895
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,000
It's sweet and delicious.

896
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,600
It's made with the taste of the Chinese food.

897
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Mr. He is indeed the owner of the He Ji Bings.

898
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,800
The pastries he made are not only strong in appearance,

899
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,200
but also have a unique taste.

900
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,000
The final decision of Lady Cheng is that

901
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,800
Mr. He has excellent skills and is even better.

902
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
The winner is...

903
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,600
Good!

904
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,000
The dishes Mr. Qiu Jiang made have a home-cooked taste.

905
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
The second place goes to...

906
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Mr. Lu Chi, the third place goes to...

907
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,600
the chicken.

908
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,200
Because His Lordship made any dishes,

909
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,000
the chicken is the most delicious.

910
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The second place goes to...

911
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,800
Because His Lordship made any dishes,

912
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
the chicken is the most delicious.

913
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,400
His Lordship is currently behind.

914
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Your Lordship, you must work hard.

915
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
You're being too petty.

916
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,600
Your Lordship, please calm down.

917
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,400
The teacher just announced the rules and I mentioned it.

918
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
If we withdraw all the money, the atmosphere will be clear.

919
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Your Lordship, you won't have any chance to marry Lady Cheng again.

920
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,400
Please think twice.

921
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Next is the last round of this competition.

922
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Read, think, and solve.

923
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,600
What does that mean?

924
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,800
The girl's mind is quite delicate.

925
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,000
The saying is that if you want to win someone's heart, you must be with him.

926
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
No matter how good the chess is,

927
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,600
no matter how delicious the dishes are,

928
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
if you don't understand Lady Cheng's mind,

929
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,000
it won't work either.

930
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Next, Lady Cheng will ask a question.

931
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The four young masters, please answer truthfully.

932
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,600
This round, I'm sure it's you.

933
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,600
Whoever has the same mind as Lady Cheng,

934
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,200
will be the winner of this round.

935
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,600
Using this method to choose a husband and wife with the same mind?

936
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,000
This is definitely not wrong.

937
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yes, yes, yes.

938
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,200
This round is about who has the same mind as Lady Cheng.

939
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,000
Then, may I ask which opera and opera line is Lady Cheng's favorite?

940
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,800
This is too difficult.

941
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,200
Four of you, please answer.

942
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,600
The first person to finish writing the marital agreement is the Marquis.

943
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,800
Let's start with the Marquis.

944
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,600
You must give up if you can't bear to give up.

945
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,400
Even if you can't tell the difference, you must give it up.

946
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,600
Good!

947
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,200
Next, Mr. He.

948
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,400
The bird's love is blowing into the courtyard.

949
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,200
The spring is like a thread.

950
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Next, Mr. Lu.

951
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
The horse is swaying on the wall.

952
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,000
The horse is swaying on the wall.

953
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The horse is swaying on the wall.

954
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
This is really a good one.

955
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The last one, Mr. Qiu Jiang.

956
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,400
The bird's love is blowing into the courtyard.

957
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,600
The bird's love is blowing into the courtyard.

958
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
That's good.

959
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Then, let's announce Lady Cheng's answer.

960
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,000
The answer of Lady Cheng is

961
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,400
to attract the concubines to be angry.

962
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,800
She can't be bothered to be so hard on her.

963
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,000
She can't even make a love letter.

964
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,400
The last one is not bad at all.

965
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,600
This can't be a good one, right?

966
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
It's cheating.

967
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,000
Cheating?

968
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,400
Just now, the teacher and the teacher's assistant especially told us to be careful.

969
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Moreover, we have seen so many people.

970
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,800
How can we be cheating?

971
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,000
That's right.

972
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,200
We can't be cheating.

973
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,000
That's right.

974
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,200
Mr. Qiu Jiang, you have won three points.

975
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Good.

976
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Mr. Lu and Mr. He have done well.

977
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
You have won one point each.

978
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Good.

979
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,600
Marquis of Wu'an didn't get a point.

980
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,800
The third round of competition has ended.

981
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,000
Okay.

982
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
The four candidates have scored the following points.

983
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
Mr. Qiu Jiang has scored six points.

984
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,800
Mr. Lu Chi has scored five points.

985
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,400
Marquis of He Ke Xian has scored four points.

986
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,600
Marquis of Wu'an has scored two points.

987
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,400
So, the winner of this competition is

988
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,600
Mr. Qiu Jiang.

989
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Good.

990
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Congratulations.

991
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Congratulations.

992
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Congratulations.

993
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,400
According to the rules of the competition,

994
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
I will write a marriage contract for the two of you.

995
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,600
The two of you have already made the marriage contract.

996
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,600
You may marry Miss Cheng one day.

997
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Wait.

998
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Wait.

999
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,000
Miss Cheng, let me ask you.

1000
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Are you really going to marry this Mr. Qiu Jiang?

1001
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,800
Be careful. If you fail,

1002
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
you will become a dead man.

1003
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,200
He not only wants to marry me,

1004
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
but also,

1005
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,200
I must live with him for the rest of my life.

1006
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,400
Come.

1007
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,800
This marriage was completed under the supervision of everyone.

1008
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,600
And everyone's blessings were granted.

1009
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,800
I hope that the candidates

1010
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,800
will not take revenge for failing the election.

1011
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,800
That's right.

1012
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Men are so generous.

1013
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
That's right.

1014
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,800
That's right.

1015
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
That's right.

1016
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That's right.

1017
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Good.

1018
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Well said.

1019
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Shi Fa Ke,

1020
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
wait and see.

1021
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Go.

1022
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Move aside.

1023
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Move aside.

1024
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Move aside.

1025
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Congratulations on your marriage.

1026
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Thank you both.

1027
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Qiu Jiang, you are so brave.

1028
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Thank you for your help.

1029
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
You don't have to thank us.

1030
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,200
If you insist on thanking us,

1031
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
thank me.

1032
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Thank you for your help.

1033
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Ke, don't be so polite to me.

1034
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
I can help you.

1035
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Of course.

1036
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Brother Xian, you helped me a lot.

1037
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,400
You performed well on the stage today.

1038
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
You are talented, handsome,

1039
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
and you can make desserts.

1040
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,400
You are so talented.

1041
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,400
You are the most worthy of marriage in the capital.

1042
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Ke, you really think so?

1043
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
Of course.

1044
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
I guess our official media's card

1045
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,400
will be broken by you.

1046
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,600
I'll leave you to it.

1047
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Ke, I have something to do.

1048
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,600
I'll leave first.

1049
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
Okay.

1050
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
I'll thank you tomorrow.

1051
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,600
Okay.

1052
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,600
Let's go.

1053
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,600
Let's go.

1054
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800
Let's go.

1055
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
Today was a smooth one.

1056
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Brother Lu,

1057
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
if it wasn't for Qiu Jiang,

1058
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,800
who is really in love with Miss Cheng,

1059
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,800
I think you would win the points.

1060
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,800
No.

1061
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,800
You are the only one I want in this life.

1062
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,800
Brother Lu,

1063
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
you should work harder.

1064
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
I won't let Ke wait for the super-event.

1065
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,800
Who is waiting for the super-event?

1066
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
I'm the one who is in a hurry.

1067
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,800
I'm in a hurry to do what the stage said.

1068
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,640
canned food

1069
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:37,640
joined tots

1070
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,560
I know this meeting

1071
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,560
is radioactive word that means luck

1072
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:58,600
Every time I see you, I only feel the cuteness

1073
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Although I can't remember every day of the difficult days

1074
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:12,600
I never forget the first time I saw you

1075
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,600
Even if this love is not lucky, not good, not sunny, not night

1076
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,600
No matter the wind and the moon, as long as you are here

1077
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,600
I will be with you forever

1078
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:33,600
No matter the fire and the world, I will be with you forever

1079
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:39,600
I will protect you with my life

1080
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,600
Even if I can't see you clearly

1081
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:49,600
I will be with you forever

1082
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,600
I will protect you with my life

1083
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:01,600
No matter the sea or the sky, I will be with you forever

1084
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:07,600
Please remember the youth that you used to be

1085
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:15,600
From now on, I don't want to part with you
