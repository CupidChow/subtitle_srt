There wasn't much to do
at the Official Matchmaking Agency today,

the tongue sometimes,

how could a marriage be without any bumps?

188
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,960
Then what should be done
when there are bumps?

Must they separate?

190

If I were still working
at the Official Matchmaking Agency,

If reconciliation is possible,

you should certainly
try your best to mediate.

don't force them to stay together.

208

Forcing them to remain bound

209
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,380
will only create a resentful couple.

I should have visited earlier,

00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,410
If I don't handle it,

337
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,150
Ms. Deng will surely
mock and harass my mother.

338
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,520
If I do handle it,

339
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,420
she'll definitely use this against me,

340
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,160
drive me out of
the Official Matchmaking Agency,

341
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,020
and ruin my mother's reputation.

342
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,610
Ms. Deng is vicious and cruel,

343
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,430
truly difficult to deal with.

344
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,560
I've always respected her as an elder.

345
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,860
Who knew she would turn on me so suddenly?

346
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,610
If that's the case,
just advise reconciliation.

347
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,740
That's impossible.

348
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,930
Hua Yuerong deliberately
came to provoke Yingying.

349
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,490
It seems those rumors
weren't false after all.

350
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,300
I must deal with these scoundrels myself.

351
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,600
Listening to only one side
leaves you in the dark.

352
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,150
We might as well
hear Xu Ao's side of the story.

353
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,480
I was thinking the same.

354
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,940
But I've waited for several days

355
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,410
and he hasn't returned.

356
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,390
Since he's close with Hua Yuerong,

357
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,110
we might as well
wait for him at Flower House.

358
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,910
That's right.

359
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,740
But if we go empty-handed,

360
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,080
it would seem like
we're there to confront him.

361
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,410
Why don't we bring a gift

362
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,910
to congratulate him on his promotion?

363
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,270
Then let's go to Xibao Pavilion
to choose something.

364
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:21,800
Alright.

365
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,270
Look, it's over there.

366
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,910
Is that it?

367
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,980
That's the one you mentioned, right?

368
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,650
Let's go take a look over there too.

369
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,460
Mr. Shi, do you like my handkerchief?

370
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,170
Mr. Shi, you're so strong!

371
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,210
You made me twist my ankle.

372
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,540
I didn't touch you,

373
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,240
don't try to frame me.

374
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,270
You suddenly pulled my handkerchief

375
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,030
and stepped aside.

376
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,550
You...

377
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,360
Are you trying to tease me on purpose?

378
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,170
My reputation is at stake now.

379
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,170
Now I've twisted my ankle

380
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,110
and suffered your humiliation.

381
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,420
I'm going to your home right now

382
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,750
to have Chief Matchmaker Tao settle this.

383
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,510
Let's go then.

384
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,680
Li Pan'er,
what exactly are you trying to do?

385
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,140
Well, at the moment,

386
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,670
I can't walk properly.

387
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,200
But we have so much work
at Xibao Pavilion.

388
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,740
Mr. Shi, you must take responsibility.

389
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,710
As long as you don't
report this to my mother,

390
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,650
I am at your service.

391
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,349
Actually,

392
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,210
I'm not an unreasonable person.

393
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,460
Once my foot heals,

394
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,010
I won't trouble you anymore.

395
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,350
Let's go.

396
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,900
Move along, everyone.

397
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,530
Haven't you seen someone
helping others before?

398
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,330
Mr. Shi looks so tall and strong,

399
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,660
yet he's afraid of women.

400
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,240
I quit.

401
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,480
You beat me again.

402
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,200
Let's start over.

403
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,530
How about we start over?

404
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,950
Let's restart, okay?

405
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,490
Xianxian.

406
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,790
Weren't you supposed to keep an eye on Ke?

407
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,480
Ke hasn't returned,

408
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,540
so why are you back?

409
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,720
Xianxian, why aren't you saying anything?

410
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,110
I...

411
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,440
I can't explain it clearly.

412
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
It's all because of that young lady.

413
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,320
Son.

414
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,510
Which young lady?

415
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
We can have
your mother arrange the marriage.

416
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This is good news!

417
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,050
Let Ke go.

418
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,070
Yes, Ke can go.

419
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,350
Which young lady is it?

420
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,410
If Mother hears I tangled with
Li Pan'er on the street,

421
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,810
not only am I finished,

422
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,470
but Li Pan'er's reputation
would be ruined too.

423
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,610
But Ke still needs to be watched over.

424
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,080
What should I do?

425
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,600
My life is so difficult.

426
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,060
So difficult!

427
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,640
Son, what's going on with you?

428
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,750
Which young lady has

429
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,140
cracked that stubborn skull of yours?

430
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,400
Tell me, which family?

431
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,150
I didn't,

432
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,680
I haven't,

433
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,640
don't talk nonsense.

434
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,160
What do you mean "nonsense"?

435
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,000
How dare you speak like that?

436
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,830
Is that how you talk to your father?

437
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,030
Xianxian, explain yourself properly.

438
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,130
Father, brother.

439
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,730
I...

440
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,590
I did flirt with her.

441
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,170
What? Flirt?

442
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,870
No.

443
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,310
That's not it.

444
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,350
It's Ms. Li who said I flirted with her.

445
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,510
It's nothing, nothing.

446
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,920
Ms. Li must have been instructed by Lu Chi

447
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,060
to say such things.

448
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,870
Isn't she actually coveting
my strong and mighty presence?

449
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,350
Son.

450
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,110
Do you have some misunderstanding

451
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,510
about what "strong and mighty" means?

452
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,550
Or perhaps Ms. Li's eyesight

453
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,540
is the problem?

454
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,100
What do you mean?

455
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,330
I mean,

456
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,860
how could she
possibly be interested in you?

457
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,090
That does make sense.

458
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,340
This color looks a bit better.

459
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,360
None of these seem quite right.

460
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,520
Pan'er,

461
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,390
what do you think I should give as a gift?

462
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,660
Miss Shi, don't worry,

463
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,860
our Chief

464
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,760
probably has it all planned out.

465
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,740
Pan'er.

466
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,100
What happy news have you heard

467
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,030
that makes you smile so brightly?

468
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,610
Was I smiling?

469
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,690
Maybe the honest guy
is just too interesting.

470
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,300
Honest guy?

471
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,500
Who are you talking about?

472
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,300
[Heaven Rewards the Diligent]

473
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,140
Mr. He.

474
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,210
Thank you.

475
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,030
Kexian.

476
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,630
Ke?

477
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,340
What are you doing here?

478
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,680
Ms. Li, I apologize for the intrusion.

479
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,370
It's fine.

480
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,610
Here are the desserts you ordered.

481
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,950
I'll leave you two to chat.

482
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,310
This way, please.

483
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,220
Kexian, you're just in time.

484
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,120
I'm going to meet Commander Xu Ao.

485
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,200
What do you think
I should bring as a gift?

486
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,720
Why don't you come back with me,

487
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,030
and we can pick out
some exquisite desserts.

488
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,240
Ketian isn't still angry with me, is she?

489
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,470
If I come back with you,

490
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,270
she won't throw me out, will she?

491
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,930
She's not angry anymore.

492
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,360
She's been talking about you every day.

493
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,040
But bringing food,

494
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
isn't that too ordinary?

495
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,150
How about this gift?

496
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,520
Lu, what kind of scroll is this?

497
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,160
No matter what kind of scroll it is,

498
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,690
Xu Ao is a military officer,

499
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,450
how could he be given
paintings and calligraphy?

500
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,640
This brushwork looks
very similar to Mr. Lin Yuan's style.

501
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,740
It just doesn't have a signature or seal.

502
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,700
But this piece

503

shows stronger
and more masterful brushwork

504
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,920
than his previous ones.

505
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,630
It might just be an imitation.

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,600
How can you give someone

507
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,240
a painting without a signature?

508
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,300
Kexian, you're mistaken about this.

509
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,410
Mr. Lin Yuan's works are worth a fortune.

510
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,210
And Xu Ao has just been promoted.

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,710
If I were to give him an authentic piece,

512
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,170
it might look like a bribe.

513
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,900
This imitation has good artistic concept

514
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,330
and excellent technique.

515
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,530
As a gift exchanged between friends,

516
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,480
it's tasteful

517
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,280
and doesn't violate any laws.

518

to some important matters.

Xu Ao is really like
what Liu Yingying described?

of the No.1 matchmaker in the world.

Liu Yingying to initiate a divorce.

Ms. Deng, you've delayed

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,620
my sworn brother's important matter
due to your selfish interests.

548

If my sworn brother blames us for this,

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,570
Ke.

671
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,750
Where has your usual keen observation

672
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,650
gone to?

673
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Think carefully about what just happened.

674
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,160
I was so furious with Xu Ao
that I couldn't think straight.

675
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:21,960
Wait.

676
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,000
When Xu Ao was talking with Hua Yuerong,

677
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,480
the door was left open.

678
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,960
Could it be

679
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,430
that Hua Yuerong heard footsteps

680
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,350
and deliberately staged everything?

681
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,090
Very likely.

682
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,200
When Xu Ao asked Hua Yuerong
to see us out,

683
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,920
it was just like how you speak to Ms. Li,

684
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,820
though your tone is actually much kinder.

685
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,760
If Xu Ao truly had feelings for Ms. Hua,

686
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,270
he would treat her with constant care,

687
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,030
not the way he does now.

688
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,850
Could we have misjudged Xu Ao?

689
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,960
Is Hua Yuerong really
the one causing trouble?

690
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,840
It's possible.

691
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,130
So we should find out the truth

692
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,070
and give Xu Ao a chance to explain himself

693
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,680
before making any decisions.

694
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,210
We mustn't act on impulse

695
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,920
and break up a marriage.

696
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,000
Lu, you're absolutely right.

697
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,330
I was indeed too emotional just now.

698
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,780
Would you be willing

699
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,750
to help me uncover the truth

700
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,230
before making a judgment?

701
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,000
Of course.

702
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,600
Let's go.

703
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,240
Is he crazy?

704
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,460
Climbing over the wall
to get into his own home?

705
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,610
He might...

706
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,950
He climbed over the wall to get home,

707
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,550
then climbed back out again.

708
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,210
What on earth is he up to?

709
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,880
Perhaps he has some personal difficulty
he can't talk about.

710
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,000
I feel like he's just like
the cheating spouse

711
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,760
you often see in literature.

712
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,880
The more I watch him,
the more suspicious he seems.

713
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,740
Alright, let's follow him first.

714
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,510
Let's go.

715
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,430
Lu, please don't let go of me.

716
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,650
I don't want to lose my life

717
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,610
before we even discover the truth.

718
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,010
I won't let go,

719
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,720
but you must promise me something.

720
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,510
No matter what you see or hear later,

721
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,570
you must stay calm,

722
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,940
or our lives will be in danger.

723
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,550
I wouldn't get upset over some jerk,

724
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,970
just don't let go of me.

725
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,780
My Lord, have you delivered the rouge yet?

726
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:03,980
I've sent it

727
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,720
and left it on the dressing table
she uses frequently.

728
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
My Lord, you needn't worry too much.

729
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,380
Just do as I say,

730
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,970
and everything will work out fine.

731
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,760
Lu, they...

732
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,330
Don't worry, Ke,

733
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,350
he's just drunk.

734
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,100
Hua Yuerong, what are you
planning to do to Xu Ao?

735
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,230
Lord Xu and I
are merely drinking companions

736
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,160
with nothing improper between us.

737
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Xu Ao is an imperial official

738
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,050
and a married man.

739
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,220
With your beauty,

740
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,760
you don't need to do this.

741
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,740
It's a long story.

742
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Not telling you is for your own good.

743
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,340
Please go back, both of you.

744
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,650
Ms. Hua, you...

745
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,310
Ke,

746
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,490
let's go.

747
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,150
Pan'er,

748
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,090
do you have any better rouge in your shop?

749
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,130
Of course we do.

750
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,250
Wen.

751
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,300
Actually,

752
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,590
this is a sample

753
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,780
specially ordered by a customer.

754
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,440
There was only one box
of the actual product,

755
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,760
and the buyer picked it up yesterday.

756
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,210
Miss Shi, you can only have a look.

757
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,370
I'm afraid it's no longer available.

758
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,110
This color is beautiful.

759
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,929
Ms. Li,

760
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,590
you've been hiding such a nice item

761
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,850
and won't sell it to me.

762
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,909
I wonder who

763
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,260
specially ordered such beautiful rouge?

764
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,110
It was...

765
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,409
Xu Ao.

766
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,570
Commander Xu.

767
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,050
It's him?

768
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:42,889
He must have bought rouge

769
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,030
as a gift for that person.

Madam, Miss Shi is here.

772
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,920
All of you, please leave first.

773
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,650
Yes.

774
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,290
What is this?

775
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,150
Yingying, look.

776
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,400
What is this?

777
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,900
Why is it on my dressing table?

778
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,380
What's going on?

779
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,740
Yingying,

780
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,360
if you want to know,
come with me and find out.

[Revelry of Peace]

782
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,050
Bravo!

783

Bravo!

Bravo!

00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,340
Very nice.

786
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,070
Nice dance.

787
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,530
Indeed.

788
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,380
Lu,

789
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,680
you could have brought me here,

790
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,270
why made me stand in the cold outside?

791
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,130
I thought you could
hear more clearly from outside.

792
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,550
Besides,

793
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,010
did you expect me to

794
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,870
hold both of you
while eavesdropping by the window?

795
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,140
Lord Xu, you usually

796
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,870
wait until your wife falls asleep

797
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,000
before coming over.

798
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,080
Why didn't you go back today?

799
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,920
I wonder if she saw

800
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
that box of rouge.

801
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,920
Will she like it?

802
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,630
Yingying has been
increasingly cold to me these days.

803
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,890
I'd better not go back.

804
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,460
I'll wait a few days

805
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,010
until her anger subsides before returning.

806
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,420
Mrs. Xu is so persistent

807
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,240
and still misunderstands you, My Lord.

808
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,240
My Lord, do you

809
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,620
still truly not want to divorce her?

810
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,930
Of course not.

811
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,070
When I was still a nobody,

812
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,250
she followed me without hesitation.

813
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,340
It's all my fault

814
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,510
for not taking good care of her.

815
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,950
But since we made our vows,

816
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,280
I should never leave or abandon her.

817
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,350
Please forgive me, My Lord.

818
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,310
I have something to confess to you.

819
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,600
What is it?

820
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,320
Lord Xu, do you know

821
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,880
why Mrs. Xu asked for a divorce?

822
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,440
Why?

823
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,070
My Lord, you often
visit my Flower House,

824
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,240
so someone forced me to seduce you,

825
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,540
and marry into your household.

826
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,610
But you never crossed the line,

827
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,090
and to protect myself,

828
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,630
I had to lie to Mrs. Xu,

829
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,930
claiming I was pregnant.

830
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,580
What?

831
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,840
This...

832
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,390
No wonder Yingying
suddenly wanted a divorce.

833
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,450
I thought she despised me
for being uncouth

834
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,280
and not taking good care of her.

835
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,970
Xu Ao.

836
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,390
Dear.

837
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,540
Darling.

838
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,640
I have never despised you.

839
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,200
It's just that since our marriage,

840
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,660
I haven't been able
to bear you any children,

841
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
so I feel I've let you down terribly.

842
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,130
Besides, you've been distracted all year.

843
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,890
You haven't been talking to me.

844
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,390
I thought you had grown tired of me.

845
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,820
How could that be possible, Dear?

846
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,350
How could I ever tire of you?

847
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,510
I can't get enough of looking at you.

848
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,350
It's just that I have
important matters on my mind.

849
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,920
I often neglect your feelings.

850
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,530
Children come to us by fate,

851
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,580
and if they don't, it's heaven's will.

852
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,380
As long as I can grow old with you,

853
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,770
I dare not ask for more.

854
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,100
But you're the sole male heir
of three generations.

855
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,000
Your parents, before they passed away,
instructed me

856
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,600
to continue the family line.

857
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,260
How dare I not listen?

858
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,560
My silly wife.

859
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,230
If we truly cannot have one of our own,

860
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,840
and you still insist on having a child,

861
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,400
we could always adopt one.

862
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,210
Lord Xu speaks wisely.

863
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,220
A marriage is built by two people,

864
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,480
how can it depend on children?

865
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,500
If Lord Xu were to
divorce you over children,

866
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,590
then he wouldn't be a good husband anyway.

867
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,630
Miss Shi speaks the truth.

868
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,320
Do you truly feel this way?

869
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,240
I married you because I love you.

870
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,580
I would never divorce you over

871
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,770
this so-called inability
to continue the family line.

872
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,300
To have a husband like you,

873
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,170
I could ask for nothing more.

874
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,530
Madam.

875
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,620
Lord Xu.

876
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,590
I must have a word with you.

877
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,230
You sent rouge
but didn't tell Yingying about it.

878
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,440
If I hadn't overheard,

879
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,300
when would Yingying have seen it?

880
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,920
It's entirely my fault.

881
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,000
It's entirely my fault.

882
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,920
It's my fault.

883
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,300
I shouldn't have distrusted you.

884
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,310
Neither of you is at fault.

885
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:55,950
Blame me

886
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,070
for not eavesdropping earlier.

887
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,070
Ke, what exactly is going on?

888
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,370
Didn't we agree not to meet these days?

889
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,490
Why the rush to send a message

890
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,530
to ask me here?

891
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,930
Don't listen to those rumors out there.

892
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,090
There's nothing between Xu Ao and me.

893
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,190
It's just...

894
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,220
I have difficulties
that are hard to explain.

895
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,470
Just wait for me two or three more days,

896
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,130
once I finish what I need to do,

897
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,910
we can run away together.

898
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,830
Ms. Hua, what's troubling you?

899
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,960
Feel free to tell us.

900
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,140
Ms. Hua, won't you be honest with me?

901
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,200
Miss Shi, Chief Lu.

902
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,850
That letter was written
by Feng himself.

903
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,480
What have you done to him?

904
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,810
Rest assured, Ms. Hua.

905
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,270
Mr. Li is safe and sound.

906
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,040
Yuerong.

907
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,270
Feng.

908
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,960
Chief Lu is here to help us.

909
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,350
He can help us
get out of this predicament.

910
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,330
Lu.

911
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,840
These two share a deep bond.

912
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,970
I believe Ms. Hua has her reasons.

913
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,500
Chief Lu.

914
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,700
For everything before, I was indeed wrong.

915
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,570
I deeply apologize.

916
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,350
The reason I did this

917
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,700
is because I was coerced

918
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,090
and have difficulties I cannot speak of.

919
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,140
Who forced you?

920
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,450
Chief Lu.

921
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,340
Please forgive me
for not being able to tell you.

922
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,640
Don't worry, Ms. Hua.

923
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,520
I promise you

924
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,580
I will safely escort
both of you out of the capital.

925
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,850
Not just the two of us,

926
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,780
but our family of three.

927
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,850
Chief Lu.

928
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,110
Just bring Ms. Liu here,

929
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,720
and once the misunderstanding is cleared,

930
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,520
I can complete my task and leave.

931
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,550
Ms. Hua, you're straightforward.

932
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,830
When the truth comes to light,

933
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,830
I will send people

934
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,170
to escort you and Mr. Li
out of the capital.

935
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,940
Then I thank you, Chief Lu and Miss Shi.

936
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,670
We eavesdropped once

937
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,710
and found out that Lord Xu is innocent.

938
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,410
But Ms. Hua refused
to explain the situation,

939
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,860
fortunately Lu discovered the key person

940
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,920
and persuaded her.

941
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,680
Ke,

942
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,230
you were actually the one who noticed

943
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,830
the twin lotus jade pendant
at Ms. Hua's waist.

944
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,700
This pendant is a unique piece from
Xibao Pavilion's Qixi Festival collection.

945
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,500
There are two identical pieces,

946
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,790
meant for lovers.

947
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,780
Ms. Hua and Xu Ao
are not romantically involved,

948
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,070
so there must be someone else she loves.

949
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,730
I'll keep my word.

950
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,320
Ms. Hua,

951
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,220
I will ensure your family's safety.

952
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,100
Chief Lu, Miss Shi,

953
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,980
you've protected my reputation

954
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,530
and arranged a way out for me.

955
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,890
I am deeply grateful.

956
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,550
When all is said and done,
it's all your fault.

957
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,050
Fine, it's all my fault.

958
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,310
Why is it so hot today?

Mother.

961
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,670
At first, I thought no matter what,

962
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,450
I couldn't let them divorce,

963
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,320
because it would affect your reputation

[No.1 Matchmaker in the World]

965

and the title
of the No.1 matchmaker in the world.

966
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,850
But when I found out Xu Ao was unfaithful,

967
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,350
I couldn't use Yingying's pain

968
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,410
to protect our family's reputation.

969
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,710
So, if what Yingying said had been true,

970
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,190
I would definitely
have helped the two of them get a divorce.

you knew about their divorce matter?

1006
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,210
but I heard you sighing.

1007
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,240
Why don't you tell me
what's troubling you?

1008
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,170
How would you understand?

1009
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,960
At weddings,

1010
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,820
I often wish couples
prosperity and many children.

1011
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,070
Yingying's marriage is secure now,

1012
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,870
but they still have no children.

1013
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,230
It shows that in life,
eight or nine times out of ten,

1014
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,550
things don’t go as planned.

1015
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,150
That's exactly the good news
I wanted to tell you.

1016
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,400
I've found a skilled doctor
who has examined Mrs. Xu,

1017
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,670
and there's a treatment available.

1018
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,240
So you don't need to worry too much.

1019
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,640
Xu Ao loves Liu Yingying,

1020
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,540
and doesn't care
that much about having children.

1021
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,140
Really?

1022
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,890
Thank you for resolving their concerns.

1023
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,240
Lu.

1024
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,920
If you were Xu Ao,

1025
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,000
what would you do?

1026
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,580
I would be the same.

1027
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,060
If I could marry the one I love,

1028
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,880
whether we have children or not,

1029
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,990
my devotion would never change.
