00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,460
Young Master,

7
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,880
your room payment is due.

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
Please wait a moment.

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,520
Sir, please bear with me
for a few more days.

10
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,430
I'll find a way soon.

11
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,230
Please do so as soon as possible.

12
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,640
Mr. Yan, look!

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,040
This is so beautiful.

14
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,630
It'll look great on you.

15
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,310
Boss,

16
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,260
please pack this one,
this one, and this one

17
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,820
for me.

18
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,560
Sure.

19
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,520
What's wrong?

20
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,520
Why the long face all day?

21
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,329
Something troubling you?

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,050
Ke.

23
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,810
Could you lend me some money?

24
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,500
I left in such a hurry,

25
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,360
and there's so much to eat and see here
in the capital.

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,900
I spent all my travel money
without even realizing it.

27
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,100
That's it?

28
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,170
No problem.

29
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,400
However,

30
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,640
this is all I have left today.

31
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,770
Take it for now.

32
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,360
Here.

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,210
Thank you, Ke.

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,140
It's just that after all this time,

35
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,850
there's still no sign of Mr. Lin Yuan.

36
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,500
Searching like this is like
looking for a needle in a haystack,

37
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,560
and I don't know how long it will take.

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,710
Everything in the capital costs money -
food, clothes, lodging, transportation.

39
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,120
I don't know how long
this money will last.

40
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,390
That's easy.

41
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,100
Just check out of the inn

42
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,070
and come stay at my place.

43
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,130
That would save you a lot of expenses.

44
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,160
Ke, you're truly saving me from disaster.

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,020
I will do everything in my power to repay

46
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,020
the kindness you've shown me today.

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,240
But...

48
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,329
Is there a problem?

49
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,540
There is indeed an unresolved issue.

50
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,470
You're dressed as a man now,

51
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,900
and I'm still unmarried.

52
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,050
If I

53
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,340
bring a strange man home to stay,

54
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,010
my brothers and father
would tear the roof off.

55
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,150
Besides,

56
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,750
if Brother Lu finds out

57
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,050
I brought a man home,

58
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,440
I don't know what he would think.

59
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,380
So that's what you're worried about.

60
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,980
That's easy to fix. Let's go.

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,760
Mr. Yan.

62
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,700
No.

63
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,720
Miss Yan, you look absolutely stunning
in this outfit.

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,140
It's fine now, right?

65
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,250
Of course it is.

66
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
Dear, it's my turn now.

67
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,320
Father, Mother, I'm back.

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,470
Ke.

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,300
Ke.

70
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,650
And who is this young lady?

71
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,200
Let me introduce her to everyone.

72
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,640
This is my new friend,

73
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:51,470
Yan Qiyue.

74
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,420
Greetings, Uncle and Aunt.

75
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,680
Greetings, everyone.

76
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,320
Qiyue, this is my eldest brother,
Shi Xianxian,

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,530
my second brother, Shi Chongshan,

78
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,390
and my little cousin, Shi Qin'er.

79
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,950
Nice to meet you, Miss Qiyue.

80
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,480
So you're Cousin's friend.

81
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,170
Miss Qiyue, you're so pretty.

82
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,050
Greetings Eldest Brother, Second Brother,

83
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,330
and hello to you, Qin'er.

84
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,300
Where are you from, Miss Qiyue?

85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm from out of town.

86
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,010
From out of town.

87
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,470
Mother, she came to visit the capital.

88
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,070
She has no relatives here.

89
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,410
I didn't feel at ease

90
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,560
letting such a pretty girl

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,760
wander around alone.

92
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,760
Mother.

93
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,010
Could she stay with us for a few days?

94
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,590
Since she's your friend,

95
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,810
she's certainly welcome in our home.

96
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,550
I'll tell the servants

97
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,560
to tidy up the room in the east wing.

98
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,860
You can stay there.

99
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,950
It's close to Ke's room,

100
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,590
so it'll be convenient for you two.

101
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,659
Thank you so much, Uncle and Aunt.

102
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,760
Sorry for imposing on you.

103
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,200
It's no trouble.

104
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,290
Just treat this as your own home.

105
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,240
Besides Ke,

106
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,270
you can also ask these two for help
if you need anything.

107
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,070
That's right, Miss Qiyue.

108
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,000
Feel free to come to us for anything.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,510
Miss Qiyue is Ke's friend,

110
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,040
which makes you a friend of our family.

111
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,690
Please don't stand on ceremony.

112
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,510
Thank you, Eldest Brother
and Second Brother.

113
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,040
Come, I'll show you around.

114
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,080
Go on, go on.

115
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,440
Let's go.

116

117
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,690
Master.

Reporting to Master.

119
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,030
Miss Shi didn't meet Mr. Yan today.

120
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,430
But, she brought

121
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,270
a young and beautiful lady home today.

122
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,180
A young lady?

123
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,090
Ke has been quite active lately.

124
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,620
Ms. Li,

125
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,960
the two Shi brothers

126
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,480
seem quite interested in that young

127
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,640
and beautiful lady.

128
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,030
Why are you telling me

129
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,920
about this?

130
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,290
What does it have to do with me?

131
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,470
It doesn't have anything to do with you?

132
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,360
That young lady is getting close

133
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,940
with the whole Shi family.

134
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,520
Does it really have nothing
to do with you?

135
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,190
These new fabrics that just arrived
are all pretty good in quality.

136
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,630
Sort them out later

137
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,710
and put them away.

138
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,560
Okay.

139
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,130
Alright.

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Ms. Li, how have you been lately?

141
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,030
Mr. Shi, are you here to buy something?

142
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,350
Yes,

143
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,430
you reminded me, I almost forgot.

144
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm here to purchase some items.

145
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,610
Ms. Li, please go on with your work.

146
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,270
Would you like to buy some rouge,
Young Master?

147
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,430
This is rouge, right?

148
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:54,870
Yes.

149
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,270
Which one sells the best?

150
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,800
This one
is more popular among young ladies.

151
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,950
Good, Miss Qiyue will definitely like it.

152
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,360
Wrap it up.

153
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,890
Alright.

154
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,610
This one too,

155
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,800
wrap this up as well.

156
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,460
Certainly.

157
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,180
What else do young ladies like?

158
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,810
You might want to look at these
round fans here.

159
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,310
Alright. This one,

160
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,140
wrap this up too.

161
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,770
Alright.

162
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,950
Miss Qiyue will definitely like it.

163
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,640
Who told you to put this here?

164
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,900
Does it look good here?

165
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,630
In the future, do not do things
I didn't order you to do.

166
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,240
Yes.

167
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,000
Take it away now!

168
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,370
Making decisions all by yourself.

169
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,750
Sister Pan'er, why are you upset?

170
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Is something bothering you lately?

171
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,799

Maybe I can help you.

672

The thing I'm thinking about

673
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,960
is very complicated.

you can't help me.

681
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,930
The person I like

682
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,350
is like

683
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,120
a fleeting dream to me.

684
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,840
I've never met him,

685
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,740
don't even know where he is,

686
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,880
but I just like him.

687
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,480
This feeling

688
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,680
must be hard to understand, right?

689
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,070
I understand.

690
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,409
Actually, the feeling of liking someone

691
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,190
is probably the same for everyone.

692
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,199
But I think

693
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,060
as long as you try your best to pursue it,

694
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,120
even if it doesn't work out in the end,

Shall we go to the snack street next time?

Ke, why aren't you sleeping yet?

726
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,080
Today, Chief Matchmaker Fang
received an imperial decree

727
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,710
to escort the princess to a vassal state
for her marriage.

728
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,110
To be as excellent as her,

729
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,030
I still need to work much harder.

730
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,740
What's so enviable about escorting
a princess to marriage?

731
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,450
Did they ever
ask for the princess's opinion?

732
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,910
A princess is a person too.

733
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,550
Why can't she marry someone
she truly loves?

734
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,190
They all speak of righteousness
and morality,

735
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,320
claiming to serve the country
and the people,

736
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,390
but they're really
just using the princess as a pawn,

737
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,990
manipulating her however they please.

738
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,080
What's up with you?

739
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,430
Why are you so worked up?

740
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,750
It's nothing.

741

Are you in a bad mood?

742
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,970
You can talk to me about it.

743
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,210
I just haven't found Mr. Lin Yuan yet,

744
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,260
and

745
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,160
I couldn't even get his new work.

I'll help you.

747
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,840
But I'm afraid that it'll all be in vain.

748
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,030
But...

749
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,120
Haven't you ever had an impossible dream?

750
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,250
Of course I have.

751
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,500
I was born into the family
of the no.1 matchmaker in the world.

752
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,720
Since childhood, I believed that

753
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,920
I would become the no.1 matchmaker too.

754
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,290
But back then,

755
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,270
I couldn't even complete
one matchmaking case per month.

756
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,800
I could only think about
my little beggar boy.

757
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,730
I wanted him to fulfill his promise

758
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,860
so I could marry him.

759
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,050
But I didn't even know his name

760
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,390
or where he lived.

761
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,370
What about now?

762
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,150
How is it now?

763
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,400
Now,

764
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,730
I've become a real marriage broker,

765
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,620

I think I understand now.

Things that everyone thinks are impossible

769
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,840
seem to work out if you just persist
