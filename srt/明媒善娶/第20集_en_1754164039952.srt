Made by Mirage

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,760
It wasn't possible to film her in public.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The Love by Hypnotic

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 18

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Father, mother, and brother.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Brother, tomorrow I'm going to

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
exchange the wedding invitation

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
for brother and sister Pan'er.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What do you think?

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Good.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What a good thing.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Of course it's a good thing.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But Xianxian,

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
you're used to

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
playing with the gun.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You should know how to care for people

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and treat Manager Li well.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Do you hear me?

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mother, I have a father.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I've seen good examples.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll be a good husband in the future.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Boss, I'm telling you.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Men should be above all.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But at home,

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
you should be able to go.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Able to go.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Congratulations, Brother Shi.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Congratulations, Brother Datang.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's eat.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Take the guests out.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Please sit here.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ake and Mr. Yan are here.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Boss is in the study.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Sister Pan'er, I'm not going to see him today.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm going to see you.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Me?

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Do you know what day it is today?

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Today is the eighth day.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What special day is it?

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Today is the eighth day.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The wedding, the ceremony, the wedding,

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the opening ceremony.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The eldest son of the family, Shi Qianxian,

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
is asked to be the official media officer.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He is asked to be the official media officer.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Please take care of him.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Sister Pan'er, you don't know.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
My brother wants to drag me here

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
in the middle of the night.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Then,

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll take care of Sister Pan'er's change.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Ake, wait for me.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll go get it.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This...

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Is this the engagement?

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He handed over the change to me.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll take it back.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is it.

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So, the marriage in the capital

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
is so particular.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Not only that,

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
we also need to get married,

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
have a ceremony, and have a wife.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We can only get married when the time comes.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Marriage is a big thing after all.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We can't miss any of the wedding.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
After we get married,

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
we can cherish each other.

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's go. I'll take you to Xiebao.

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's go.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Try it.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It smells good.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Ake,

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
change.

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Great. I'll go and get Brother's wedding.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I wonder if Sister Pan'er...

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, no, no. It's Sister-in-law.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I wonder if she has any thoughts

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
about the wedding.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The master is not married yet.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
How can I be the first?

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ake, you're here. Why don't you go upstairs?

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Brother Lu.

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The people of Xiebao

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
will be taken away by your Shi family.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's up to you.

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Since everyone is here,

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
why don't you take Mr. Yan upstairs?

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll do as you say.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Brother Lu, lead the way.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
These flowers.

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
They are all beautiful.

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Mr. Lu, you have a good taste.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The Xiebao Pavilion is famous for its calligraphy and painting.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's easy to hide flowers.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You have a good taste.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm lucky to see

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
so many works of Mr. Lin Yuan today.

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You have a good eye.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mr. Lin Yuan's painting style is unique.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There must be a reason.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Even if people who don't know how to paint can't help but wonder.

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is also Mr. Lin Yuan's original intention.

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I hope that the painting

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
is not only a treasure

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
in the noble family,

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
but also a treasure for the whole family.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Brother Lu, you know a lot.

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Your style

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
is very high-pitched.

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mr. Lin Yuan doesn't like to use a brush

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
to paint.

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He thinks that using a brush like this

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
will be more complicated

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and affect the mood of the painter.

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mr. Lu,

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I understand what you think.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Mr. Lu,

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
are you good at painting?

150
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Today,

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
can I read your masterpiece?

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I just finished a painting today.

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why don't you ask Ke

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and Mr. Yan to give me some advice?

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Brother Lu, please take us to see it.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This handwriting

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
is so familiar.

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Mr. Lu,

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
is this the one you just finished?

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Ke, this is clearly

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Mr. Lin Yuan's handwriting.

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Impossible.

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is painted by Brother Lu.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Although the handwriting is similar,

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
it is a little different from Mr. Lin Yuan's.

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And the painting is better than Mr. Lin Yuan's.

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Mr. Lu,

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
you are Mr. Lin Yuan, right?

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No.

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Mr. Yan, why do you say that?

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The handwriting of this painting

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
is clearly the same as Mr. Lin Yuan's.

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can't be wrong.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mr. Yan is wrong.

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I am not Mr. Lin Yuan

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and I don't know Mr. Lin Yuan.

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Brother Lu, how could you be Mr. Lin Yuan?

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Brother Lu,

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
you are really not Mr. Lin Yuan?

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Ke, I am not Mr. Lin Yuan.

182
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Do you remember

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
when we first met,

184
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
you and I enjoyed Mr. Lin Yuan's painting together?

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Mr. Yan,

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Brother Lu said he is not Mr. Lin Yuan.

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He must not be Mr. Lin Yuan.

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Brother Lu and I will help you find him together.

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can't find him.

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't waste your luck.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
How can we not find him

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
unless...

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Unless you are Mr. Lin Yuan.

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am not.

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why do you have to find Mr. Lin Yuan?

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Because I want to marry him.

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I want to marry him.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I want to marry him.

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Because I want to marry him.

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Mr. Lin Yuan is a man.

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Qi Yue, why did you...

202
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ke, thank you for hiding the secret for me.

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I know that

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
it's hard to find a true love.

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's hard to find a true love.

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I will find it.

207
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I will find it.

208
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I will find it.

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I will find it.

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I will find it.

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I will find it.

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I will find it.

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's hard to find a true love.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's hard to find a true love.

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Everything needs to be honest.

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So I have to be honest.

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But I am really not Mr. Lin Yuan.

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Qi Yue, let's go change.

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Brother Lu, let's talk another day.

220
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's go.

221
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Ke.

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Qi Yue.

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You first.

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay, I'll go first.

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Qi Yue, do you really think

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Brother Lu is Mr. Lin Yuan?

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I think he is.

228
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Qi Yue, you just said it with one word.

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You said Brother Lu is Mr. Lin Yuan.

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Isn't that too hasty?

231
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And he is like Mr. Lin Yuan

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
who speaks like a man.

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He is like a man.

234
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You only saw a few of his paintings.

235
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You don't know his personality.

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Ke, believe me.

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He must be Mr. Lin Yuan.

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You promised me before.

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If I can find Mr. Lin Yuan, it means I have a relationship with him.

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You said you would help me.

241
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Right?

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Qi Yue, I did say that.

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Ke, I know.

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Maybe Mr. Lu is your favorite person.

245
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But I came to the capital

246
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
to find Mr. Lin Yuan.

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He didn't know that

248
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
someone else liked him.

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Now he knows that

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
you should give him a chance to choose.

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And a chance to fight for it.

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Brother.

253
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Ke,

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the weather is good today.

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's go out and have a walk.

256
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Go to the snack street?

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't want to go.

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Ke, you

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
are looking at the wrong way.

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Come on.

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I...

262
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I was looking at the wrong way.

263
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was looking for inspiration.

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Ke,

265
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
can you tell me what's wrong?

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes.

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I will help you.

268
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Thank you, brother.

269
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I did have a problem.

270
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What's wrong?

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's hard to beat us.

272
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Right? Yes.

273
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I mean, if

274
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
you two like the same person,

275
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
what will you do?

276
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Impossible.

277
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No.

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I mean,

279
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
my sister and I

280
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
like the same person.

281
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What should I do?

282
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Impossible. Which sister?

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Who?

284
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Forget it.

285
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Brother, Ke,

286
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm leaving.

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Uncle.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Who also likes Lu Chen?

289
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Do you think

290
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
we should inform him?

291
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Ke told me

292
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
that my brother is his family.

293
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So we are a family.

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Right?

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's go to the snack street.

296
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Brother.

297
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Brother.

298
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Why are you here today?

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Lu Chen,

300
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
you are in trouble.

301
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What's wrong with Ke?

302
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's not Ke.

303
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's you.

304
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No.

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Ke's good sister

306
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
likes you.

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Ke

308
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
is very useful to me.

309
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm not a good sister.

310
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Ke is useful.

311
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Thank you for your notice.

312
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But there must be some misunderstanding.

313
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I will handle it.

314
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I won't let Ke worry.

315
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Of course.

316
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We trust you.

317
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Hope you can handle it.

318
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Hope you can handle it.

319
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Brother Lu.

320
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mr. Lin Yuan.

321
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Qi Yue.

322
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What should I do?

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't look.

324
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I look ugly when I cry.

325
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Not ugly.

326
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think Ke is the most beautiful person.

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He is also my favorite person.

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I will always protect you.

329
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I won't let you hurt me.

330
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No.

331
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No matter if Brother Lu is Mr. Lin Yuan,

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I won't let him go.

333
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Why are you here?

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I miss you.

335
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But now

336
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
someone else is missing you.

337
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Ke, I'm not Mr. Lin Yuan.

338
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No matter what I do,

339
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
you are the only one

340
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I love.

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Brother Lu.

342
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I believe you.

343
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I won't let you go.

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But

345
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I love Mr. Lin Yuan.

346
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He won't give up on Qi Yue.

347
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't want to give Qi Yue

348
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
to someone who is not a normal person.

349
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Ke, in my opinion,

350
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Qi Yue is not a real person to Mr. Lin Yuan.

351
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Although I am similar to Mr. Lin Yuan,

352
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I can't tell the difference.

353
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If he can't even see this,

354
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
how can he like me?

355
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Notebook?

356
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes.

357
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Ke,

361
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
what are you doing?

362
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm just enjoying the flowers.

363
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Ke, where did you get

364
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
so many of Mr. Lin Yuan's new works?

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Are you sure

366
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
they are all Mr. Lin Yuan's works?

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I can't be wrong about Mr. Lin Yuan's notes.

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
These five paintings are all

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
from Mr. Lin Yuan.

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Look at this.

371
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
In these five paintings,

372
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
there is no one of Mr. Lin Yuan's true works.

373
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't believe it.

374
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
If you don't believe it,

375
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
look at this.

376
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Brother Lu is so amazing.

377
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He drew it himself.

378
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Qi Yue can't see it at all.

379
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
How could this happen?

380
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Qi Yue,

381
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
you said you love Mr. Lin Yuan.

382
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But you can't even tell

383
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
if they are real or fake.

384
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't know what you are trying to do

385
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
with these paintings.

386
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
If you are going to deny

387
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
my feelings for Mr. Lin Yuan in this way,

388
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
it's not fair.

389
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Qi Yue, the painting is the same.

390
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But your match is unique.

391
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The person you love

392
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
should be real

393
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and not fake.

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If you like a person's painting,

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
it's so unreasonable to marry him.

396
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What if

397
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
he thinks differently from you?

398
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Are you sure

399
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
you love Mr. Lin Yuan

400
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
instead of

401
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
the person you imagine?

402
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Qi Yue,

403
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you have seen Brother Lu many times.

404
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But you don't have

405
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
any feelings for him.

406
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Do you really think

407
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
he is the same as you think?

408
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Are you really willing

409
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
to marry Lu Chi?

410
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I really

411
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
have no feelings for him.

412
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But when you know

413
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
he is Mr. Lin Yuan,

414
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
you said you wanted to marry him

415
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
instead of Lu Chi.

416
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You don't even know

417
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
a person I want to marry.

418
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You haven't met him.

419
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
How do you know he is the one you love

420
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and want to marry?

421
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Are you going to

422
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
have a night with his painting

423
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and his name?

424
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Ke,

425
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
you are right.

426
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Maybe I should think

427
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
what I want.

428
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's okay.

429
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't worry.

430
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I promised you

431
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I would help you

432
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
make it happen.

433
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
My Lord.

434
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
My Lord.

435
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Why do you

436
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
insist on buying

437
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Mr. Lin Yuan's painting?

438
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Our money is short.

439
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Now it's even more

440
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
expensive.

441
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I have my own plans.

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
My Lord,

443
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Fang Shou Mei is gone.

444
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Who else can marry

445
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
that princess?

446
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What did I say?

447
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You are not

448
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
as smart as a donkey.

449
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
My Lord.

450
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Did Wu An Hao make any noise?

451
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No.

452
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's so quiet.

453
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Don't be careless.

454
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The quieter it is, the more likely it is to be hidden.

455
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
My Lord, don't worry.

456
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
We are all awake.

457
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But someone has bought

458
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Mr. Lin Yuan's painting.

459
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Is there something wrong?

460
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It must be that woman again.

461
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't worry about her.

462
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
My Lord,

463
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
there is one more thing.

464
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The one above

465
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
has been out of the palace.

466
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
An imperial servant

467
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:21,000
artifacts comparison

468
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,360
who knows how a US citizen

469
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
is who who knows

470
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
what an important man is

471
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,760
Mr. Huang, you don't have to see me off.

473
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,600
Brother, let me do it.

475
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,000
Brother, you're here.

476
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,120
Brother Xian.

477
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,240
Tiantian.

478
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,800
Brother Xian, it's okay.

479
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,680
Go ahead.

480
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay.

481
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,600
I'm busy.

482
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,720
Brother Chunshan,

483
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,720
sit inside.

484
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,080
Sit.

485
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,120
Thank you.

486
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,000
Tiantian.

487
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,120
How are you doing lately?

488
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm fine.

489
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,480
What about you, Brother Chunshan?

490
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,880
I've been having trouble sleeping

491
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
since last night.

492
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,640
What's wrong?

493
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,840
Are you sick?

494
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,400
I'm not feeling well.

495
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,160
I haven't seen you for days.

496
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,640
I feel a little uncomfortable.

497
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
You've seen me.

498
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,840
Here.

499
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,720
Try it.

500
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,320
My brother's new dessert.

501
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,080
Okay.

502
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,120
I haven't seen Ke for days.

503
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,840
Is he busy with a new case?

504
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,200
No.

505
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,480
He's been having trouble with Lu Chi recently.

506
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,520
Brother and I are worrying about it.

507
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,040
Brother is worrying about Mr. Lu.

508
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,560
You didn't like him much before.

509
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,520
I didn't like him before.

510
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,040
I thought he was a stranger

511
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,760
and dared to be a nuisance to Ke.

512
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,240
But I later thought he was a good guy

513
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,840
and a responsible person.

514
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,920
I can rest assured to entrust Ke to him.

515
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,440
You've had enough.

516
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,240
Please go back.

517
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:23,920
Tiantian.

518
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,000
Why are you suddenly...

519
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,960
Go away.

520
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,880
You've already decided on your brother-in-law.

521
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,800
Go to Xi Bao's place for dessert.

522
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,600
I didn't.

523
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,400
Lu Chi...

524
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,960
Where's Ke?

525
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,400
He left so soon?

526
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,080
What's wrong?

527
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,680
Brother.

528
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,800
Why don't you confess to Ke?

529
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,200
That heartless guy from Chichong Mountain

530
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,400
is so arrogant

531
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,080
that he thinks Lu Chi is a good guy.

532
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,280
Tiantian.

533
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,000
I think

534
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,400
Brother is a worthy person.

535
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,360
I'll be your father.

536
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,640
No matter what happens to Ke and I,

537
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,000
you two must be good.

538
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,040
Don't make trouble because of me.

539
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,440
Brother.

540
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,680
You're my only family.

541
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,800
I've thought about it.

542
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,720
Before you find your happiness,

543
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,840
I won't marry you.

544
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,920
What are you talking about?

545
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,160
How can you waste your life because of me?

546
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
Your happiness is my happiness.

547
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,280
So you're going to give up on Ke?

548
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,480
Maybe it's because I'm not good enough.

549
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
So you're mad at him and give up?

550
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,680
My brother

551
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,800
is a man who wants to marry a ranking man

552
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,600
and has been in the ranking for many times.

553
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,480
You're not worse than Lu Chi.

554
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,680
You're gentle, kind,

555
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,320
and considerate.

556
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,680
You know Ke.

557
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,040
You're tolerant.

558
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,280
You're a good girl.

559
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,680
You're a good girl.

560
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,920
You're a good girl.

561
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,520
I've seen all of these.

562
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
In my opinion,

563
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,280
you're the most suitable for Ke.

564
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,920
But you have to let him know your feelings.

565
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
But Ke

566
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,520
would think so?

567
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,640
What does Ke think?

568
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Whether he likes you or not is his business.

569
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,520
Brother.

570
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,840
You have to work hard at least once.

571
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,480
You have to work hard at least once.

572
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,080
You have to work hard at least once.

573
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,560
You have to work hard at least once.

574
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,440
Don't let yourself regret it.

575
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,560
If you can't,

576
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,840
we can think of a way from Uncle Tao and Aunt Tao.

577
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,080
If we can,

578
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,560
we can appreciate each other.

579
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,840
Okay.

580
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,400
I'll work hard again.

581
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,800
Okay.

582
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,520
Come.

583
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,400
Brother Xian, Tian Tian.

584
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,360
You're here.

585
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,800
Uncle, aunt.

586
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,800
Brother, brother.

587
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,480
Come, come.

588
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:33,960
Sister Qin.

589
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,400
Sit.

590
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,160
Sit.

591
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,640
Come on.

592
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,960
Why do you bring so many things?

593
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,720
Brother, give it to me.

594
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,080
Yes.

595
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,320
You two are thoughtful.

596
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,560
Uncle, aunt.

597
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,360
I have a favor to ask you today.

598
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,360
What is it?

599
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,400
Tell me.

600
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,680
I grew up with Ke.

601
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,920
I know him,

602
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,160
appreciate him,

603
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,720
and admire him.

604
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,800
I want to take care of him for a lifetime.

605
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,120
So I'm here today

606
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,840
to express my gratitude to you.

607
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,360
I'm relieved to give Ke to you.

608
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,920
Brother Xian.

609
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,040
Aunt Tao knows you're a good boy.

610
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,840
We all appreciate

611
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,800
your kindness to Ke.

612
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,800
But as parents,

613
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,880
we can't help him.

614
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,800
We should listen to Ke's opinion.

615
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,080
What do you think?

616
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,080
Yes, yes.

617
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,440
Aunt Tao is right.

618
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
The marriage

619
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,880
depends on Ke.

620
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,200
Ke's love is the most important thing.

621
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,000
Right?

622
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,360
We should ask Ke first.

623
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,520
Sister Tang.

624
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
Something happened.

625
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,040
Brother Xian brought many gifts.

626
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Is it the new dessert he sent?

627
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:05,840
No.

628
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,320
He's here to propose.

629
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,920
What?

630
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,280
You can ask Ke and Brother Xian.

631
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,360
They're all here.

632
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,320
Ke.

633
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,640
I have a girl I like.

634
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,760
Brother Xian thought so?

635
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,960
But I only treat him as my brother.

636
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,680
It'll be a waste of time.

637
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,960
No.

638
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,720
I have to explain it to him.

639
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,720
Miss.

640
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,400
Your invitation.

641
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,320
This is the ticket to Jiangning.

642
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,520
Brother Xian

643
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,080
can't explain it to him.

644
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,440
If I go out now,

645
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,080
I'll only ruin his reputation.

646
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,040
I have to think about

647
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,560
how to explain it to him.

648
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,040
The song on the stage

649
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,440
is the story of Mr. Qiu Jiang

650
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,960
and Mr. Cheng.

651
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,200
Such a love

652
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,960
is so interesting.

653
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,640
You just found out now.

654
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,800
The song on the stage

655
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,560
Ke.

656
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,920
As you said,

657
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,000
Mr. Cheng is the fan of Mr. Qiu Jiang.

658
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,960
Yes.

659
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,640
Why can Mr. Cheng

660
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,840
marry Mr. Qiu Jiang

661
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
but not Mr. Lin Yuan?

662
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,640
Great.

663
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,400
Great.

664
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,400
Great.

665
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,880
It's so interesting.

666
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,720
Qi Yue, I have something to do.

667
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
I'll go to the wedding ceremony.

668
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,560
OK.

669
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,480
You go.

670
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,120
I want to go around.

671
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,360
Ke.

672
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,680
You're here.

673
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,120
Come in.

674
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,680
I just made the cake.

675
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,680
I feel you smell it every time.

676
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,960
Brother Xian.

677
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,840
I have something to tell you.

678
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,000
It's OK.

679
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Let's eat the cake first.

680
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
We'll talk about it later.

681
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,520
Brother Xian.

682
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,200
I grew up with you

683
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,480
and Tiantian.

684
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,760
In my heart,

685
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,480
Tiantian is my good sister.

686
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,800
You are my brother.

687
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,120
You are my brother forever.

688
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,720
But apart from that,

689
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,560
I have no other feelings for you.

690
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,120
Every difficult day,

691
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,200
I never forget the first time

692
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,480
I saw you.

693
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,280
Even if this love is endless,

694
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,760
no life, no day, no night,

695
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,720
it doesn't matter this wind and moon.

696
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,760
Ke.

697
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,880
As long as you are never afraid,

698
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,400
never hesitate, never fear,

699
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,680
and always be concerned,

700
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,120
every time I see you,

701
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,760
no matter this world or fire,

702
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,560
I feel special.

703
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,560
And Tiantian,

704
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,680
I will protect you with my life.

705
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,880
Every time I see you,

706
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
I make the cake myself

707
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,560
and feel happy.

708
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,520
I feel very happy.

709
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,280
I've been waiting for you to grow up.

710
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,440
But I still love you.

711
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,360
I love you

712
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,920
as a man and a woman.

713
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Because I don't want to be your brother.

714
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,640
I want to marry you.

715
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,360
I want to take care of you forever.

716
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,120
Please remember the past.

717
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,480
I'm sorry, Brother Xian.

718
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
I can't accept your love.

719
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,480
You will meet someone who really likes you.

720
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,640
You will meet someone you really like.

721
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,680
You will meet someone you really like.

722
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,000
It's so beautiful.

723
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Little lady.

724
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,200
Where are you going in such a hurry?

725
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,880
It's pretty.

726
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
What are you doing?

727
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,440
We have no money to spend.

728
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,920
Let's save some money.

729
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,960
Don't go, little lady.

730
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,360
Save some money for us.

731
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,640
Take the money and leave.

732
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,680
Don't think about it.

733
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,080
I see you are so skilled.

734
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,480
You are just trying to rob us.

735
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,640
What kind of man are you?

736
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,880
Where is the nonsense?

737
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,600
I want you to see

738
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,560
what kind of man you are?

739
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
You.

740
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,680
Alright, run away.

741
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,080
Hurry

742
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,000
Robbed.

743
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,800
Someone robbed the money.

744
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,080
Cut off the actuion.

745
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,000
Please stop, 절대 stop.

746
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,360
Get off.

747
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,360
Thank you for saving me today,

748
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,840
and I'm very grateful.

749
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,480
Don't mention it.

750
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,240
What's wrong?

751
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,640
Do you have something to say?

752
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
I wanted to say

753
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,560
that we're sorry.

754
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,720
What did you 30 years ago say?

755
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,720
I want to say

756
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,360
I don't know when

757
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,560
I can see you again

758
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,800
If we are destined to meet, we will meet again

759
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,200
Then we are destined to meet again

760
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,200
Then I will go in first

761
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,680
You had not tell me

762
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,880
You are willing to go to Jingdu

763
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,760
Other than doing our best

764
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,640
I have no option

765
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,880
But it is better to keep quiet

766
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,480
This is an official note

767
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,880
I feel I would notice a差

768
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,280
So all you have to do is a great deal

769
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,240
Great deal

770
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,760
Going home

771
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,880
Then even the först is my father

772
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,680
So everything matters

773
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,720
Komilong

774
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,800
In a few days,

775
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,600
Mr. Lin Yuan will hold a painting exhibition.

776
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,320
Master.

777
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,480
Master, is this true?

778
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,680
I didn't receive any news.

779
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,920
They've all posted it

780
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,200
at the gate of Xibao Pavilion.

781
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,120
How can they do this?

782
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,160
Calm down.

783
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,720
Master,

784
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,320
they've all bullied us.

785
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,360
What are you going to do?

786
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,800
This is not an easy task.

787
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,400
The organizer must not know

788
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,680
Mr. Lin Yuan's real identity.

789
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,960
Let's wait and see.

790
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,040
Then we'll catch the mastermind behind the scenes

791
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,000
and see what he's up to.

792
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,240
Yes.

793
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,960
Brother.

794
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,640
Brother.

795
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,280
I've got good news.

796
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,000
Look.

797
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,600
Is this the good news you're talking about?

798
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,320
It's spread all over the capital.

799
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,400
I'm so happy.

800
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,000
Mr. Lin Yuan is holding an exhibition.

801
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,200
I really can't wait to come to the capital

802
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,800
and find him.

803
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,000
Yes.

804
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,400
Maybe this is the one

805
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,720
that will never forget.

806
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,400
It seems that Mr. Lin Yuan and I

807
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,360
are destined to meet.

808
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,240
Yes.

809
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,120
We are.

810
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,360
Brother Lu is not Mr. Lin Yuan.

811
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,640
I must go to the exhibition.

812
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,040
Maybe I can meet Mr. Lin Yuan.

813
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,480
I'll go back to get ready.

814
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,880
But why is Mr. Lin Yuan

815
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,520
holding an exhibition all of a sudden?

816
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,480
Your Majesty, the painting is here.

817
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,440
Please have a look.

818
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,640
Open it.

819
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,600
This is interesting.

820
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,120
Two Chinese ghosts.

821
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,560
Which one is real

822
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,880
and which one is fake?

823
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,160
It seems that to catch these demons and ghosts

824
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
and show their true form,

825
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,000
I must be the real Chinese ghost.

826
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,120
I'm going.

827
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,400
No need.

828
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,240
The fox seems to be in a strange state.

829
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
Young Master.

830
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,240
Look at that one.

831
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
Miss Qi Re.

832
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,160
What a coincidence.

833
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,840
What a coincidence.

834
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,240
You also come to the flower market?

835
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,480
Yes.

836
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,200
It's better to meet by chance.

837
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,560
How about I accompany you

838
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,800
to find some flowers?

839
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
Young Master, look.

840
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
This cat-painting painting is really interesting.

841
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,080
When the cat is hunting,

842
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,920
it will raise its butt and make a sound.

843
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,360
But you painted a rat.

844
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,840
I think Mr. Lin Yuan

845
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,640
has never seen a cat-painting rat.

846
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,880
He just painted it casually.

847
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
No.

848
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,360
You painted it

849
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,720
with a clear intention.

850
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,600
You are very considerate.

851
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,200
You are sure that this rat can't escape.

852
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,360
That's why you painted this picture.

853
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,680
Gu Shan Shui.

854
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,400
He actually knows it.

855
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,160
Then what does Gu Shan Shui mean?

856
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,160
Gu Shan is a poisonous water.

857
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,080
The loneliness in your heart

858
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,360
can only be cleared with a brush.

859
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,200
Miss Qi Re.

860
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,560
Let's take a look at that painting.

861
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,440
Mr. Lin Yuan is painting this painting.

862
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,160
He should be in a better mood.

863
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,760
Really?

864
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,080
It seems that

865
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,560
Mr. Huang also knows

866
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,640
Mr. Lin Yuan's painting.

867
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,200
We are really meant for each other.

868
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,720
I feel that I am living a fast life today.

869
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,960
I am so happy to

870
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,280
enjoy painting with Mr. Huang.

871
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,120
You can enjoy painting with Miss Qi Yue.

872
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,440
I am also very happy.

873
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,080
Is it because

874
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,480
I am so happy

875
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,240
after seeing so many paintings

876
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,440
of Mr. Lin Yuan?

877
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,640
Or is it because

878
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,680
the one who enjoys painting with me

879
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,680
is Mr. Huang?

880
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,240
That's why I am so happy.

881
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,560
Miss Qi Yue.

882
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
What's wrong?

883
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,600
Nothing.

884
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,840
I am just a little worried.

885
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,200
I am worried about you.

886
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,400
I am worried about you.

887
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,360
I am here in the capital

888
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,760
because of Mr. Lin Yuan.

889
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,400
I am so happy

890
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,280
because of Mr. Lin Yuan.

891
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,480
Miss Qi Yue.

892
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,480
Let's go.

893
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Okay.

894
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,840
Please.

895
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,600
Mr. Lin Yuan is really talented.

896
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,800
After seeing so many of his paintings,

897
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,240
I understand him even more.

898
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,440
His loneliness,

899
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,360
his joy,

900
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,280
his worries,

901
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,360
his generosity.

902
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,480
I must find Mr. Lin Yuan.

903
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,680
Senior Brother.

904
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,360
Huang...

905
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,680
Senior Brother, there is no one here.

906
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,080
You don't have to do this.

907
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,040
Sit.

908
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,760
Junior Brother, how are you doing?

909
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,480
Senior Brother, you called me like this

910
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
reminds me of the scene

911
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,880
when we were learning

912
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,520
art in Mount Qianya.

913
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,240
Mount Qianya is the place

914
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,560
where my father set up the security lock.

915
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,080
We grew up together.

916
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,640
We are like brothers.

917
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,840
We are like brothers.

918
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,160
We are like brothers.

919
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,880
We are like brothers.

920
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,880
My family is ruined.

921
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,480
My adoptive father sent me to Mount Qianya.

922
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,920
My adoptive father married us three.

923
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,640
We are like brothers.

924
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,200
We will never forget it.

925
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,200
Senior Brother.

926
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,840
Now the capital is in a dark place.

927
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,240
I can only trust and rely on you.

928
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,240
Don't worry.

929
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,000
I will fight with you

930
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,440
to clear all the troubles.

931
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,120
You have always been good to me.

932
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,480
But these years,

933
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,000
you have really suffered.

934
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,840
I can only bear the burden

935
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,280
of the people in Mount Qianya.

936
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,560
We must get rid of

937
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,120
the imperial uncle's party

938
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,360
and the imperial family.

939
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,160
We must get rid of the future troubles.

940
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,760
The world is in danger.

941
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,000
I will take responsibility for all of this.

942
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,320
Besides,

943
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,080
I didn't come here

944
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,560
for official business.

945
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,800
You didn't come here for official business?

946
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,680
Why didn't I hear

947
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,880
what you said?

948
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,320
I came to the capital

949
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,600
to look for the young people.

950
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,880
The young people who saved my life.

951
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,120
I remember.

952
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,560
The young people who gave you

953
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,200
the golden snack.

954
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:52,920
How is it?

955
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,720
Did you find them?

956
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,560
Do you want me to send more people for you?

957
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
Don't act rashly.

958
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
I have found them.

959
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,040
So Senior Brother didn't come here

960
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,720
just for me.

961
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,840
He also wants to look for your young sister.

962
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:09,920
Tell me.

963
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,800
Am I going to have a sister-in-law?

964
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,880
All right.

965
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,800
Let's not talk about this now.

966
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,200
I heard that you often go out of the palace recently.

967
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,720
Is there anything new

968
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,600
that Marquis Wu An does?

969
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:51,380
Associate 중

970
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,920
I've never forgotten the first time we met

971
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,920
Even if this love is heartless, silent, day or night

972
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,920
It doesn't matter if it's a stormy night

973
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,920
As long as you are never afraid, never afraid, never worried

974
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,920
I'll guard the coffin

975
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,920
No matter if it's the fire or the mortal world

976
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,920
Will there be any borders?

977
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,920
I'm willing to protect you with my life

978
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,920
Even if I can't look at you like the sky

979
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,920
I'm willing to give my all

980
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,920
I'll only miss you

981
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,920
Even if the sky is blue or the sea is blue

982
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,920
I don't care about the past

983
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:13,920
Please remember the youth that once burned

984
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,920
From now on, I don't want to part with you
