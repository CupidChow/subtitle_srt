00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I can't express my feelings.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My face is red, my heart is confused.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Who is willing to?

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's better to be honest than to be a coward.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't regret it.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
See the peach blossoms in the branches.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Strange years, I don't know if you have any worries.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Some people want to repay but have no money.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Life is the best way.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 16

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's done.

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm here to invite you to meet Tao Shoumei.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You want to ask my mother to sign?

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You can entrust your marriage to me.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm in a hurry today.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
After that, I'll be the best heir.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I still do what you ask me to do.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But I have to talk to Tao Shoumei.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm too busy today.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll talk to you later.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mr. Luo, please give me a ceremony.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay?

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
After I become the best in the world,

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
don't regret it.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
First Officer,

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
pay respect to Yeping且 relaxing the nuns.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Ladies andiro are here.

34
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,000
It has an interesting theme.

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Yi Chang Lord came here

36
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,720
to hold the final만 from Taoist.

37
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,560
Oh my god.

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,440
That's not true.

39
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,600
What If Taoism forest appearance

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,080
just like the Çaoyang disc is?

41
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,560
That would acquire the Cooperative.

42
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,220
It looks just like Dad talking about

43
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,040
the association with ténghe.

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
He is just not a dude.

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,380
That's not true.

46
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,340
Look again.

47
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,460
This is still not a temple of Taoism.

48
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,640
Even though it was not the temple of Taoism,

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,900
I can still feel their Pitts principle and

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,040
spiritual experience they left.

51
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,120
They are still mysterious.

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,520
They can be c nightmare.

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
What do you want me to do

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,600
if I want to steadfastly

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,360
flatten them?

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,600
Who is different from you?

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,880
You're way worse than me

58
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,740
Come on

59
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,080
Come on

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,440
Who are you?

61
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,460
Come on

62
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,120
Oh dear

Get some rest

64
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,620
Well well

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,640
What are you doing?

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,260
What are you doing?

67
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,180
Bye-bye adsorption

68
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,380

Master

70
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,420
Of course

71
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,300
Hanyuan

72
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,820
Ge

73
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,500

74
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,820

I will pass this gold medal to you.

78
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,860
You must work hard to get more money.

79
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,180
You must not humiliate the most beautiful name of our Guanmei family.

80
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,460
One day, you must bear this gold medal.

81
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,140
Mother, I will not let you down.

82
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,180
Congratulations, Director Gao, you have a good future.

83
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,820
Congratulations, Boss Xu.

84
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,580
Thank you all for coming to the ceremony today.

85
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,060
Please drink some wine and invite everyone to come.

86
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,700
Come, come, come. Everyone, please come with my brothers.

87
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,180
Please.

88
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,540
I...

89
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,060
Mother.

90
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,620
Let me introduce you. This is a friend of mine, named Lu Chi.

91
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,700
Let's go.

92
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,380
The Dongbing government has ordered to arrest the head of the Guanmei Hall, Tao Shi.

93
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,260
This...

94
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,580
All the officials, step aside.

95
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,660
Who are you?

96
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,420
My family's bae is the late emperor's son.

97
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,740
Have you misunderstood?

98
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,260
Tao Shi, you used the authority of the head of the Guanmei Hall

99
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,660
to use the betrothal gifts to hide the evidence.

100
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,860
So it really was you.

101
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,940
This... This must be a misunderstanding.

102
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,380
This is a false accusation.

103
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,500
My late emperor was the first to be promoted to the first position in the world.

104
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,580
He was loved by the people and never did anything harmful to the people.

105
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,260
You said I hid the evidence.

106
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,620
May I ask where the evidence is?

107
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,500
There are several evidence in the betrothal gifts that the Guanmei Hall was sealed.

108
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
I have personally examined them.

109
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,580
These betrothal gifts were personally hand-picked by Tao Shi.

110
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,540
They are not fake.

111
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,060
This is the evidence.

112
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,220
What do you want?

113
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,980
Step back!

114
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,060
If you don't step back, I'll kill them both.

115
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,900
And take them away with the whole family.

116
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,460
Go! Go!

117
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,060
Brother!

118
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,380
What are you doing?

119
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,140
What are you doing?

120
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,380
Don't kill him!

121
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,300
Let us go!

122
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
I swear to you!

123
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,100
Xianxian, please.

124
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,460
I swear to you!

125
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,140
General, the criminal is here.

126
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,380
My lord, my brother is the bailiff.

127
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,700
My brother is a businessman.

128
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,060
Why do you arrest them?

129
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,500
A woman in the Taoist School must be arrested in the outside world.

130
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,700
Guards, check if there are other stolen items in the master's mansion.

131
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,700
Search!

132
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,460
Yes!

133
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,580
Don't move!

134
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,300
Master!

135
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,620
Let me go!

136
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,860
Let me go!

137
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,940
What are you doing?

138
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,460
Don't do this! Stop!

139
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
Let me go!

140
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,220
Pull!

141
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,420
Another one.

142
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,660
Pull!

143
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,220
My leaf opened!

144
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,740
My leaf open!

145
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,540
Your Majesty,

146
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,660
it's Party A of instrumental firearms feedback.

147
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,160
You really我們已經知道

148
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,980
where the surrender command inspired.

149
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,720
369 I saw all of them.

150
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,540
Your Majesty,

151
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,380
I can tell from this explanation

152
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,480
that 100 years ago,

153
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,380
thedoors were blown up.

154
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,840
It's impossible forście

155
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,680
to let the King's soldiers

156
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,320
fall victim to this.

157
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,280
Re 빵.

158
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,940

159
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,060
from Jinzhen Sect.

160
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,340
Then I'll entrust you

161
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,060
the responsibility of the most beautiful person.

162
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,380
Remember it today in advance.

163
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,820
Remember to

164
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,760

165

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,700
We must protect

167
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,140
our most precious tried ever.

168
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,740
Mother!

169
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,740
Take the Taoist and the Shi family to Nan Ding.

170
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
Yes.

171
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,740
No.

172
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
No.

173
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,740
Mother.

174
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,740
Take care.

175
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Father.

176
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
Mother.

177
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
That's right.

178
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,740
Ake.

179
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,740
Ake.

180
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,740
Mr. Lu.

181
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,740
Why are you still here?

182
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
Such a big change has happened.

183
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
I heard that you were going to accompany Ake.

184
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
Ake.

185
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
Don't be afraid.

186
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
I'll take you home.

187
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
Why are you crying?

188
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,740
Shi Fak.

189
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Can you be a little more generous?

190
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
You are now the most beautiful heir.

191
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Tang Jin.

192
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,740
What should we do?

193
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,740
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,740
I'm sorry.

201
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
Shi Fak.

204
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,740
I'm the only one left now.

205
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,740
My mother asked me to send the guest off.

206
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
How about this, Tiantian?

207
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
You accompany Ake to send the guests off.

208
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
I'm going to inquire

209
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,740
where Taoist and the Shi family are being taken to.

210
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Brother, don't worry.

211
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,740
I will accompany Ake.

212
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
I have a favor to ask of you.

213
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Other than asking me to be the vice president for the rest of my life,

214
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,740
everything else is easy to say.

215
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,740
Tomorrow, I want to ask the members of the Qianjin Club to meet for a long time.

216
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,740
You want to ask them to help?

217
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Okay, leave it to me. Don't worry.

218
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,740
Qing'er, go with Tiantian. Go.

219
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Let's go.

220
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Thank you for being with me just now.

221
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,740
I was unable to attend to family matters.

222
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Please come in.

223
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
You're too kind, Junior Sister.

224
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,740
No matter the wind and the moon,

225
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,740
as long as you are never absent,

226
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,740
I will always be here,

227
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,740
no matter the fire and the people.

228
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,740
I live in the river.

229
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
I don't have to rush to accompany you.

230
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,740
I remember the youth that once burned my body.

231
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:43,740
I don't want to meet you again.

232
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
I'm not able to attend to you today.

233
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Please forgive me.

234
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Ake, you won't need this gift for a while.

235
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
I'll take it away.

236
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
Yes, yes.

237
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,740
I'll take it.

238
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
Ake, Miss, you should say less.

239
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,740
Don't get involved again.

240
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Ake, let's go.

241
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
What are you doing?

242
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,740
The General's Office has been sealed.

243
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,740
It's none of your business. Get out of here.

244
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,740
Wait.

245
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,740
You two take this first.

246
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,740
When you come out, you can take it.

247
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,740
Forget it. You two come out quickly.

248
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Where's my gold medal?

249
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,740
Where's the gold medal my mother gave me?

250
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,740
Ake, your gold medal is here.

251
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,740
I just kept it for you.

252
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,740
My mother is the most beautiful girl in the world.

253
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,740
I'm the most beautiful girl in the world in the future.

254
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,740
I won't let my mother down.

255
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,740
Ake, you will be the most beautiful girl in the world.

256
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,740
Thank you, Brother Lu.

257
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
This is the gift I gave you.

258
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
I was supposed to give it to you just now.

259
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,740
But I'm not able to do it now.

260
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,740
This is the letter of the family you wrote when you were the first to be crowned as the first beauty in the world.

261
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,740
I'm returning it to you today.

262
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,740
This is the best gift I've ever received.

263
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,740
I will definitely be a good beauty.

264
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,740
I believe that you will become the best beauty in the world.

265
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,740
Brother Lu, thank you for helping me today.

266
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
You should go back and rest early.

267
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,740
I have a word to help someone to the end.

268
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,740
Brother Lu,

269
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,740
everyone is avoiding my family.

270
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Why do you need to rush to help me?

271
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,740
You are really a good person.

272
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,740
Don't worry.

273
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,740
I will definitely find someone to fix the plaque of the Shi family.

274
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
Thank you, Brother Lu.

275
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,740
In the past, the Shi family was very busy.

276
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
When my parents were in trouble,

277
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,740
I was the only one to support them.

278
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,740
I didn't let my ancestors down.

279
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,740
I didn't let my mother down.

280
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,740
I will be the best beauty in the world.

281
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
The Shi family's ancestors are up there.

282
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,740
Please bless Ake to help him become the real beauty.

283
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Brother Lu,

284
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
although you usually say big words,

285
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
I didn't expect you to be so loyal.

286
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,740
I will remember the person who helped me today.

287
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,740
Come out quickly.

288
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,740
The General's Office is urging us.

289
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
Ake, don't worry.

290
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,740
I will stop them.

291
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,740
Brother Lu, don't be so arrogant.

292
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,740
Don't worry.

293
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,740
Regarding martial arts,

294
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
there is no one in this world who can match me.

295
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,740
I don't want to get you into trouble.

296
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
Let's go.

297
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
Leave it to the mountains.

298
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
I'm not afraid of being killed.

299
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Go.

300
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Let's go.

301
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,740
Brother Lu,

302
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,740
thank you for today.

303
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,740
Ake, I will live next door.

304
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,740
Why don't you come with me today?

305
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,740
No, no, no.

306
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,740
You have helped me a lot.

307
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,740
I will help you no matter how troublesome I am.

308
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,740
I will temporarily live in the He family.

309
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,740
I will be your wife.

310
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,740
I will be your wife.

311
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,740
I will temporarily live in the He family.

312
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,740
Don't worry.

313
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
If I find a way,

314
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,740
I will go to the He family to find you.

315
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Take care.

316
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,740
I'm leaving now.

317
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,740
Come out.

318
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
Mountain Master.

319
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,740
Why did the General's Office arrest you?

320
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
I heard that

321
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
the housekeeper of the Marquis Manor in Wu'an House

322
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
asked for a set of guards.

323
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,740
He wants to persuade Young Master Qi

324
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
to get married to the Marquis of Wei Yuan Escort.

325
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,740
The guard is not a good match for the guest.

326
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,740
The housekeeper always

327
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,740
looks very bad.

328
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
I remember that

329
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,740
General Li Yao of the General's Office

330
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,740
has a close relationship with the Marquis of Wu'an.

331
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,740
You know it.

332
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,740
They do have a close relationship.

333
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
And they always obey the order.

334
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Qu'an Qi Mei.

335
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,740
Qi Mei.

336
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
It seems that I have to destroy the real thing

337
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
to save the parents of the Marquis.

338
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
Quan Mei Ting.

339
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,740
I was right.

340
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
Mountain Master.

341
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,740
Do you want me to go to the Ice House again?

342
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,740
No need.

343
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
I will handle it myself.

344
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,740
You go to the Imperial House to take care of it.

345
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,740
The guards are well-behaved.

346
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,740
Let them live comfortably.

347
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,740
By the way, you can use the Xibao Pavilion

348
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,740
to explore the style of the guests today.

349
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,700
See who is willing to protect the

350
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
Shi family and help them.

351
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
I will report to you as soon as possible.

352
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Yes.

353
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,700
Uncle, Shanshan,

354
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
and Tang Jing.

355
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
What should I do?

356
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,740
Go.

357
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
Brother.

358
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,740
Where is Ke?

359
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,740
Brother Xian.

360
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
Brother Xian, you are back.

361
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
What did Mr. Zheng say?

362
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
Mr. Zheng said that

363
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,740
Tao Yi is in the prison of the General's Office.

364
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
But Mr. Zheng promised that

365
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
he would find a way to save him.

366
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
But it can only be

367
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
the family's fate.

368
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Brother Xiang.

369
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,740
I know your big and big responsibility.

370
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,740
We are a family.

371
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,740
What do you mean by that?

372
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,740
Yes.

373
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,740
Don't cry.

374
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
You are embarrassing me.

375
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
Don't cry.

376
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
Tomorrow, I will go with you

377
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
to meet those Misses.

378
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
We have been saving people

379
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,740
in the Qianjin Club for so many years.

380
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,740
It's time to use them.

381
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
Okay.

382
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
What's that sound?

383
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,740
Let's go and have a look.

384
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:35,440
I didn't hear the sound of the

385
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
funeral.

386
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
Idiot.

387
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,740
Stupid donkey.

388
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,740
You can't even do such a small thing.

389
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
You are not a good person.

390
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
You are not a good person.

391
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
You are not a good person.

392
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,740
You are not a good person.

393
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,740
You are not a good person.

394
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
You can't even do such a small thing.

395
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,740
Why should I keep you?

396
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,740
Don't be angry, My Lord.

397
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
Don't be angry, My Lord.

398
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,740
The General's Office has sent people

399
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,740
to guard the warehouse overnight.

400
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,740
I really don't know

401
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,740
how the good government affairs

402
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,740
will go wrong.

403
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740
I want to see

404
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
who is the one who is acting up.

405
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,740
Anyway, now

406
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
Taoist priest is in prison.

407
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
The most important thing now

408
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
is to keep the media company.

409
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,740
You are right.

410
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Once the Dengmei Guanyi is appointed,

411
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,740
the marriage of the Qi family and the Tai Fu family

412
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,740
will be held in a few days.

413
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
But how should we deal with

414
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Taoist priest, his husband and his son?

415
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,740
It's not easy to deal with the government affairs.

416
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,740
Lord Zheng is going to the General's Office

417
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,740
to report the people.

418
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
If things go on like this,

419
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
things will get worse.

420
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
Taoist priest is quite famous in the capital.

421
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
If we kill him now,

422
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,740
he will definitely alert the enemy.

423
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,740
Then...

424
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,740
If Lord Zheng reports the people,

425
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,740
we will give him

426
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,740
the two sons of Taoist priest.

427
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,740
Taoist priest's husband

428
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,740
will stay in the General's Office for a few days.

429
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,740
After the marriage of the Qi family

430
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
is settled,

431
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
we will make a decision.

432
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,740
What are you hesitating about?

433
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,740
There is only one chance.

434
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,740
If it weren't for the Lord's appreciation,

435
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,740
I'm afraid you won't have this chance in your life.

436
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,740
Okay.

437
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,740
If you really have a way

438
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,740
to make me sit in that position,

439
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,740
then I will do as you said.

440
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,740
Dengmei Guanyi is a very kind person.

441
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
Lord.

442
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
What do you want me to do?

443
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,740
No matter what means,

444
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,740
you must make the daughter of the Tai Fu family

445
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,740
marry the Wei Yuan Escort.

446
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
The Qi family?

447
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
Are you talking about

448
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
Qi Shao Heng from the Wei Yuan Escort?

449
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,740
It's him.

450
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
Go and do it now.

451
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,740
Don't make any mistake.

452
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,740
But Qi Shao Heng has been unwilling to marry his wife.

453
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
This case

454
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,740
is one of the most difficult cases to handle in the capital.

455
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,740
Before,

456
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,740
he had a matchmaker to come to the door

457
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,740
and even broke his leg.

458
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,740
He even resigned from his post.

459
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,740
Lord, I'm afraid...

460
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,740
You have already entered the position of Meng Mei.

461
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,740
But you don't do your job for the Marquis.

462
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,740
Lord, I'm sorry.

463
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,740
Don't worry.

464
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,740
I will do my best.

465
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,740
Please rest assured

466
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,740
that I will do this well.

467
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,740
Tang Hu Lu.

468
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,740
Tang Hu Lu, the rich and powerful.

469
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,740
Tang Hu Lu.

470
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
Tang Hu Lu.

471
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,740
Tang Hu Lu, the rich and powerful.

472
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,740
Tang Hu Lu, the rich and powerful.

473
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,740
Take care.

474
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,740
Tang Hu Lu, the rich and powerful.

475
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Tang Hu Lu.

476
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
Come here.

477
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
Come here.

478
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
Have some tea.

479
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
Wait a moment.

480
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
Here.

481
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,740
Where is that young lady from Li's family?

482
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,740
That young lady from Li's family is very nice.

483
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,740
She is very gentle

484
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,740
and has good family conditions.

485
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,740
She is very rich.

486
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,740
She is very rich.

487
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,740
Very rich?

488
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,740
She is very nice.

489
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
It's okay.

490
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,740
Actually, I'm fine.

491
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,740
You are very generous.

492
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,740
Thank you.

493
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
You are welcome.

494
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,740
Then I will go and talk to her.

495
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
Okay.

496
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,740
I will not bother you.

497
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,740
It's okay.

498
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
It's okay.

499
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,740
It's okay.

500
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,740
Tian Tian.

501
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,740
Is the time you asked for, right?

502
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,740
I am busy.

503
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Don't worry about it.

504
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,740
They are coming.

505
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,340
Let's go.

506
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,980
Sister Pan'er.

507
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,180
Why are you alone?

508
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,100
Where are they?

509
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,620
It's decided.

510
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,220
It's been an hour.

511
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,180
Don't mention Qianjin.

512
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,780
I don't know what happened today.

513
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,060
She doesn't even have one of the concubines.

514
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,060
I'm afraid that you two will be anxious.

515
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,220
So I bring you some tea

516
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,660
to cheer up your relatives.

517
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,860
How can it be?

518
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,620
I usually have some relations with

519
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,660
the five Qianjin of Master Zheng's family.

520
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Even if they don't come,

521
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,220
Yanyan will come.

522
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,540
It's true that the tree fell and the lake fell apart.

523
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,620
My mother just got into the prison for a few days.

524
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
There is no final decision yet.

525
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,420
The sister and sister are so close.

526
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,700
They just broke up.

527
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,260
I don't believe it.

528
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,900
Even if other people don't come,

529
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,940
what about Yanyan?

530
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,300
Yesterday when I went to see Yanyan,

531
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
although her stepmother looked ugly,

532
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,540
Yanyan promised me personally

533
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,180
to discuss with us.

534
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,260
No.

535
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,580
I'll go to the House of Blessing to ask about it.

536
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,620
Tingting.

537
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,140
Go back first.

538
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,860
Wait for my news.

539
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,260
I'll go to see Yanyan personally.

540
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,220
I'm the teacher of the Guanmei Hall.

541
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,900
The first Taoist daughter in the world,

542
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,980
the teacher of the House of Blessing.

543
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,860
Please help me to call her.

544
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,820
Is there anyone?

545
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,820
Is there anyone?

546
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,180
Is there anyone?

547
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,700
Even Yanyan doesn't want to see me.

548
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,940
It seems that no one cares about me.

549
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,460
Lady, please step aside.

550
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,460
You're blocking my way.

551
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,260
Mrs. Wang is delivering goods from Xibao Pavilion.

552
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,820
Please check the goods.

553
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,740
Wait a moment.

554
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,940
It's not that there's no one.

555
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,620
I just don't want to care about me.

556
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,780
I don't want to care about me.

557
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,220
Go in.

558
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,580
The lady is waiting for the food.

559
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,220
Mrs. Wang.

560
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,540
I'm a teacher.

561
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,820
I want to see Yanyan.

562
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,140
It's not your fault.

563
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,780
My lady is not feeling well.

564
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,780
I don't see her today.

565
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,660
Wait.

566
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,100
The goods from Xibao Pavilion can be delivered.

567
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,220
Why can't I see her

568
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,140
when I'm not feeling well?

569
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,340
I just want to say a few words to Yanyan.

570
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,300
I won't do anything else.

571
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
Lady.

572
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,580
Now that Guanmei Pavilion is not your mother's business,

573
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,660
you should know some human emotions.

574
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,300
Let's go.

575
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,140
Brother Lu.

576
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,780
Even Yanyan doesn't want to see me.

577
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,940
Follow me.

578
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,820
Brother Lu.

579
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,420
Where are you taking me?

580
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,340
Ke.

581
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,300
Do you know that it's better to beg for help than to beg for help?

582
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,540
I have no other choice.

583
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,460
Even if I go to beg for the Jade Emperor's land,

584
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,300
I'll still go.

585
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,580
But no one will talk to me.

586
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,300
You don't have to bother the Jade Emperor's land.

587
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,900
Why don't you beg me?

588
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,340
Maybe I can do it.

589
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,860
Forget it.

590
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,100
You're an outsider.

591
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,860
You have no foundation in the capital.

592
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,500
Not everyone in the General's Manor can talk.

593
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,860
You don't have to take the risk.

594
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,140
I'll go now.

595
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,540
I happen to have a fellow countryman

596
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,980
who is in charge of the Grand Commandant's Manor.

597
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,740
Today, I can let one person in.

598
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,820
Don't you want to see your parents?

599
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,580
Really?

600
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,620
Yes.

601
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
There's not much time.

602
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,180
Just say it.

603
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,420
Thank you.

604
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,460
Father.

605
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,420
Mother.

606
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,180
Mother.

607
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,780
What's wrong with you?

608
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,380
Mother, don't scare me.

609
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,460
Don't touch me.

610
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,660
Don't scare me.

611
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Ke.

612
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,460
Don't be anxious.

613
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,060
I've never been hurt.

614
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,020
I'm fine.

615
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,900
I'm fine.

616
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,780
I'm fine.

617
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,740
I'm fine.

618
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,780
I'm fine.

619
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,620
I'm fine.

620
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,420
I'm fine.

621
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,340
I'm fine.

622
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,340
I'm fine.

623
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,180
I'm fine.

624
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,060
I'm fine.

625
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,420
Everyone is hurt.

626
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,820
No one can pay her off today.

627
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,260
It's your father.

628
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,020
Last night, he helped me

629
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,820
guess a whole evening teddy bear.

630
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,980
Well…

631
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,140
I finally got a chance to rest.

632
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,460
And you're making trouble again.

633
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,780
You stun Lakeset friends.

634
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,420
Stop bothering me.

635
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,940
Mother, you scared me to death.

636
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,100
I'm here by your side.

637
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,740
Don't worry.

638
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,700
I'm fine, fine.

639
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,340
Mother, Father,

640
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,140
where are my two brothers?

641
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,020
Today, the Lord Zheng of Fuya

642
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,220
came to mention your brother and second brother.

643
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,180
I don't quite understand.

644
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,300
When they caught us,

645
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,580
they were so confident.

646
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,940
No one can leave.

647
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,900
Now they're laughing like a tiger.

648
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,100
They're serving us delicious food and drinks every day.

649
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,060
And they let your two brothers go.

650
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,420
Isn't that crazy?

651
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,900
What are they doing?

652
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,620
Maybe Brother Xian gave them money.

653
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,020
Brother Xian is a good boy.

654
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,540
Father, Mother, I miss you so much.

655
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,020
Ke.

656
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,500
Can you give me an order

657
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,700
to finish the task?

658
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,140
I'll send the guests off

659
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,540
and keep the memorial tablet safe.

660
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,580
Mother, I'll find out who wronged you.

661
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,580
I'll save you two.

662
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,860
No.

663
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,980
I'm doing the right thing.

664
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,540
I'm not afraid of anyone's slander.

665
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,780
Don't get involved in this.

666
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,620
Why?

667
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,100
You have to listen to your mother.

668
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,020
The person who framed you is in the dark.

669
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,660
Your mother and I are in jail.

670
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,820
If you investigate now,

671
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,380
and force her to jump the wall,

672
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,420
and do something to you,

673
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,820
what should we do?

674
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,420
Yes.

675
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,740
You have to be obedient.

676
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,540
As long as you keep

677
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,380
the memorial tablet of Guanmei Hall,

678
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,900
it will keep

679
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,940
the dignity of the first memorial tablet in the world.

680
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,140
Do you understand?

681
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,700
Mother, don't worry.

682
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,620
I'll keep the memorial tablet of Guanmei.

683
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Be a famous official

684
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,860
like mother.

685
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,540
My lady, it's time.

686
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,380
Let's go.

687
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,260
The headquarters lost the material last night.

688
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,980
The commander is blocking the news

689
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,180
and investigating everywhere.

690
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,940
We can't stay long today.

691
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,500
We'll take good care of

692
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,820
Mr. Shi.

693
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,060
Okay.

694
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,140
Father, mother, I'm leaving.

695
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,260
Father.

696
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Don't bully mother.

697
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,740
Let's go.

698
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,300
Be careful

699
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,420
outside.

700
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,340
I'm leaving.

701
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,260
Go.

702
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,420
Bye.

703
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,300
Go. Be careful.

704
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,580
Brother Lu, I'm back.

705
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,900
Brother Lu, where are you?

706
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,260
Brother Lu.

707
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,660
Are you feeling better after seeing your mother?

708
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,300
Why are you so mysterious?

709
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,780
You scared me.

710
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,300
Brother Lu,

711
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,580
the Yuzhu said

712
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,780
the headquarters lost the material last night.

713
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,100
It's not a new thing.

714
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,300
No. It's a new thing.

715
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,100
The headquarters are blocking the news.

716
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,460
How did you know?

717
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,780
I know a lot.

718
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,180
Mr. Zheng was entrusted by Boss He

719
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,900
to bring it to me.

720
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,020
The headquarters let your two brothers

721
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,700
go back to the headquarters.

722
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,020
I also know that

723
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,060
you can interrogate the outside

724
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,140
after you pay the bail.

725
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,700
Don't worry.

726
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,980
Why did the headquarters

727
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,660
lose the material without any reason?

728
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,820
Could it be...

729
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,380
Could it be that you were behind it?

730
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,340
No.

731
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,340
You don't have to say it.

732
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,260
I know it.

733
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,660
The headquarters lost the material.

734
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,580
They deserve it.

735
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,860
It has nothing to do with us.

736
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,020
I just want to ask you

737
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,580
if you asked Brother Yuzhu

738
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,300
to treat my parents well.

739
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,100
Ke.

740
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,820
I want to give you a little advice.

741
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,180
I know Brother Lu is my benefactor.

742
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,860
Please go ahead.

743
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,180
The so-called stolen goods of the headquarters

744
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,700
are the things of the Qi family

745
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,540
in the Weiyuan Escort.

746
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,860
My parents are innocent.

747
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,660
Tao Shao Mei is innocent and innocent.

748
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,500
But now the lost goods

749
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,420
can make the Qi family

750
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,620
say they love your parents.

751
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,020
Then they have no reason to detain them.

752
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,300
But I have no

753
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,580
relationship with the Qi family.

754
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,300
The young master of the Qi family

755
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,660
is not married yet.

756
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,500
I have an idea.

757
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,900
My mother asked me to go back to the Guanmei Hall

758
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,740
to keep my position.

759
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,340
I can take this opportunity

760
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
to tell the Qi family about my marriage.

761
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,420
If I say it's a marriage,

762
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,780
and then ask the Qi family to say it's a relationship,

763
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,220
how can she not help me?

764
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,380
Ke is really smart.

765
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,860
The government has ordered

766
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,060
that from today on,

767
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,780
I will take Tao Shi

768
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,620
to the Guanmei Hall to keep the position of the Mei.

769
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,900
Greetings, Chief Mei.

770
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,860
Now,

771
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,940
I will start the ceremony.

772
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,300
Where is the law?

773
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,460
I haven't started the ceremony yet.

774
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,940
How dare you?

775
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,900
You used to rely on your mother, Tao Shi, as your Chief Mei.

776
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,900
You have been ungrateful.

777
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,180
Now Tao Shi is not

778
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,620
able to keep the position of the Mei.

779
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,260
He is now under pressure by the law.

780
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,620
How dare he be so arrogant?

781
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,660
Today, I will let him learn

782
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,100
how to be a good person.

783
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,260
From now on,

784
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,580
I will count to three.

785
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,460
If the law department doesn't go to the Guanmei Hall to keep the position,

786
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,980
then there will be no one on the Guanmei side.

787
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,420
Three, two, one.

788
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,020
I'm coming. I'm coming.

789
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,700
I'm coming.

790
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,180
Master Deng,

791
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,660
I have something urgent to do at home today.

792
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,860
So I came a little late.

793
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,820
Now that I'm the Chief Mei of the Guanmei Hall,

794
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,020
I can't be like your mother.

795
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,900
Besides, I taught you to remove your name.

796
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,860
The law department is just as you want.

797
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,340
I...

798
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,260
Master Deng.

799
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,220
Master Deng, please spare me.

800
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,020
My parents just got arrested.

801
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,420
I can't lose my job.

802
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,660
From today on,

803
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,020
I will be a good Mei.

804
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,460
I will never let anything happen to me.

805
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,180
I have a case of Mei.

806
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,420
Qi Shao Heng from the Wei Yuan Escort

807
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,260
has always been the Chief Mei of the Guanmei Hall.

808
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,820
Give me his case.

809
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,340
I will make Mrs. Qi satisfied

810
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,660
and let the Guanmei Hall be famous.

811
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,020
Ke, are you crazy?

812
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,180
Qi Shao Heng, he...

813
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:33,940
You...

814
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,340
Stop dreaming.

815
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,820
Qi Shao Heng is my guest now.

816
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,380
From today on,

817
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,700
you don't want to receive any case from the Guanmei Hall.

818
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,780
What's that?

819
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,580
Deng Yi, why are you telling him?

820
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,340
I'm the Chief Mei of the Guanmei Hall.

821
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,140
Why should I explain to you

822
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,580
how I will act?

823
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,060
Like what?

824
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,140
Like what?

825
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,980
For the past 5 years,

826
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,380
we have cared deeply

827
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,820
for Doc cryptocurrency.

828
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,380
I remember

829
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,880
how much I appreciated it like

830
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,940
100 percent.

831
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,100
100 percent?

832
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,420
Auntie!

833
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,180
When I was young,

834
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,820
I used to be little,

835
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,060
and I almost expected

836
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,220
she would be so sad.

837
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,980
But I can no longer

838
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,500
look at the reputation

839
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,980
of our Chinese Jerusalem now.

840
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,580
I actually expected this

841
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,420
from her.

842
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,060
I'm sorry.

843
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,140
Shi Fak,

844
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,540
I'm telling you.

845
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,300
Even if I give you this beauty case today,

846
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,260
so what?

847
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,660
Do you think

848
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,740
you can really make this beauty case?

849
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,780
Besides,

850
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,180
you're a criminal's family now.

851
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,820
The Guanmei Hall can't tolerate you.

852
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:42,940
Aunt Deng,

853
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,460
can you give me another chance?

854
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,820
I must be a good beauty.

855
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,140
Aunt Deng, I beg you.

856
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,460
I beg you.

857
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,620
Give me another chance.

858
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,300
Aunt Deng.

859
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,380
Let go of me.

860
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,060
Ake.

861
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,260
Aunt Deng.

862
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,940
Aunt Deng,

863
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,100
this jade bracelet

864
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,500
was given to me by the late emperor Xie Mei.

865
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,980
It's really priceless.

866
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,100
If you have to drive me out of Guanmei Hall,

867
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,820
I can't care about our son's feelings anymore.

868
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,620
Shou Mei,

869
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,860
it's not easy to collect the damaged jade bracelet.

870
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,420
Leave Ake alone.

871
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,700
Just...

872
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,900
Just treat him as a good man.

873
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,660
He said the jade bracelet is the jade bracelet.

874
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,340
You said it's the jade bracelet.

875
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,780
Give me the evidence.

876
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:32,580
Come on.

877
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,580
Aunt Deng,

878
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,100
how can I lie to you?

879
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,300
I just hope

880
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,820
you can give me a chance

881
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,780
to live.

882
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,620
Didn't your mother say

883
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,260
the Guanmei Hall doesn't treat the good men.

884
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,940
I can't break the rule.

885
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,140
We are all here to witness it.

886
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,500
If you can't

887
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,500
complete a case this month,

888
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,220
you can wait to be expelled.

889
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,180
Hello.

890
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,100
See you next time.

891
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:01,740
Yang,

892
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,980
it's hot in summer.

893
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,220
Make more fritters.

894
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,660
Qin Er,

895
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,180
you are really a talent.

896
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,140
I'll invite you to my shop to work in the future.

897
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,220
Tiantian.

898
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,140
Tiantian.

899
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,500
You are digging my family's food behind my back.

900
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,260
Brother.

901
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,900
You are back.

902
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,340
Thank you for helping us two out.

903
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,300
But my parents are still in jail.

904
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,220
We need to think of a plan together.

905
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,660
Why are you so fast?

906
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,300
I was waiting for you a few days ago.

907
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,860
Now you want me to get out of here.

908
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,380
How can I keep my Guanmei...

909
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:37,900
Brother.

910
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,420
Brother Lu,

911
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,460
why are you here?

912
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,180
Let's go.

913
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,380
I'll show you the fun.

914
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,420
The encounter is the grace of fate

915
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,420
Every time I see you

916
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,260
I feel stubborn and lovely

917
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,260
Although I can't remember

918
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,900
every difficult day

919
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,380
I never forget

920
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:46,180
the first time I saw you

921
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,980
Even if there's no love, no love

922
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,380
no life, no people, no night

923
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,340
it doesn't matter if it's a storm

924
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,860
as long as you are here

925
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,460
I will be there for you

926
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,100
I will be there for you

927
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,220
No matter it's a fire or a human world

928
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,940
I will be there for you

929
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:14,140
I will protect you with my life

930
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,780
Even if I can't love you as I love you

931
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,700
I will protect you with my life

932
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:25,700
I will protect you with my life

933
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,460
I will only miss you

934
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,860
No matter it's a fire or a human world

935
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,260
I will be there for you

936
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:41,900
I will protect you with my life

937
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:51,260
From now on, I don't want to part with you
