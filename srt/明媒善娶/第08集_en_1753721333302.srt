00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
fortune

00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,120

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,820
Jin 사건

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,780
A girl is a duplicator

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,020
An young male with no session

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,020
Who is the one who is shy to express

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,020
The blush of the blushed face

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,020
The confused heart

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,020
Who is willing to?

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,020
It's better to be honest and frivolous

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,020
Falling is better

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,020
See the flowers in the branches

13
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,020
Strange years

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,020
I don't know if I have a care

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,020
Some people want to repay

16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,020
But there is no way

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,020
Life is the best way

18
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,020
The Long Ballad

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,020
Episode 16

20
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,020
Brother Lu, Li Yang is prepared

21
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,020
The tea is not ready yet

22
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,020
The tea is not ready yet

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:13,200
Tomorrow's

24
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,020
I

25
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,020
Daughter, you don't have to make it difficult for him

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,020
I just don't want you to meet a bad person

27
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,020
General Li's rumors are quite

28
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,020
Maybe someone is jealous and talk nonsense

29
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,020
As long as he is not a bad person

30
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,020
Daughter, be careful on the road

31
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,020
I'm leaving

32
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,020
God, please wait

33
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,020
I have something to tell you

34
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,020
What else do you have to say

35
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,020
Say it

36
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,020
General Li is a violent woman

37
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,020
And he killed innocent people

38
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,020
Have you really never heard of it

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,020
It's because I thought you can

40
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Look at people with ordinary eyes

41
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,020
And you don't forget the rumors

42
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,020
I didn't expect you to be so lucky

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,020
I have a lot of rumors in the capital

44
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,020
The rumor is so popular

45
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,020
I know better than anyone

46
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,020
I just believe what I see

47
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,020
You believe what you see

48
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,020
I think it's okay

49
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,020
If he is kind

50
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,020
He should always be like this

51
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,020
Why don't you go back with me

52
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Let's take a look again

53
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,020
If he is really kind

54
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
It's good to feel

55
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,020
I'm looking for a good person for you

56
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,020
Okay, I'll go back with you

57
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,020
It's good to feel

58
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
I'm looking for a good person for you

59
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,020
Shen Tongyun

60
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
Where did you meet the poor man

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,020
Just because of him

62
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
What right do you have

63
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
To enter my room

64
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,020
Talk to me here

65
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
Yes, yes, yes

66
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,020
General, calm down

67
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
This man

68
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,020
It's the law firm

69
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,020
Deliberately bring you a disgusting general

70
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,020
Fortunately, I didn't expect the law firm

71
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
I won't give up

72
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,020
Discussed the right words with the general

73
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,020
But to be honest

74
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
General is really right today

75
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,020
There are people who are right

76
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,020
If it were normal

77
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,020
I would have chopped them into meat

78
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,020
And fed them to dogs

79
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,020
General Li

80
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,020
General Li, calm down

81
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,020
Calm down

82
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,020
Why are you angry?

83
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,020
After Shen Tongyun entered the door

84
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,020
If the general is not happy

85
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,020
Let the general scold, right?

86
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,020
General Li, listen to me

87
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,020
If you can't stand it, you will mess up

88
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
Mess up?

89
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,020
After it's done

90
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
What's the place?

91
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,020
If the general is not satisfied

92
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
I will be responsible

93
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,020
I will definitely help the general to find another wife

94
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
What do you think?

95
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,020
General, calm down

96
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,020
You just left

97
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
He said something bad

98
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,020
Want to marry another wife

99
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,020
I'm afraid after marriage

100
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,020
He won't treat you well

101
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,020
Miss Shen, are you still not awake?

102
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
Lu Chi

103
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
Who are you

104
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,020
Why are you trespassing my room?

105
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
I'm Lu Chi

106
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,020
I'm the new boss of the tea house

107
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,020
I heard that the people below are clumsy

108
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,020
And made the general's robe dirty

109
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,020
I specially prepared the most famous soup powder of the street

110
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,020
To apologize to the general

111
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,020
Please forgive me

112
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,020
You

113
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,020
You want to die

114
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
You

115
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,020
Stop

116
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,020
General Li

117
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
Hurry up

118
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,020
Shen Tongyun

119
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,020
You are here to die

120
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,020
Shen Tongyun

121
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,020
This is too early

122
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
So small

123
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,020
Miss Shen, you saw it

124
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,020
Whether to hand yourself to such a person

125
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,020
Should also be decided

126
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,020
General Li is a talented man

127
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,020
He is extraordinary

128
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,020
Shen Tongyun has a bad temper

129
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,020
Dare not to give up

130
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,020
Let's just do this marriage

131
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,020
No

132
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,020
All of you can testify for me

133
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
It's me, Shen Tongyun

134
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,020
I don't deserve General Li

135
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,020
So we broke up

136
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,020
No, no, no, Miss Shen

137
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,020
Don't be cheated by Shifak

138
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,020
All of this

139
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,020
Shifak and Lu Chi

140
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,020
They did it together

141
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,020
Yes

142
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,020
I was framed

143
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,020
I designed it

144
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,020
But I designed it

145
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
Because someone lied to me

146
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,020
That's why I want him to show his true face

147
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
But no matter

148
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,020
Why didn't you design Miss Shen

149
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,020
I

150
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,020
You let General Li pretend to think

151
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
Hide the violent mood

152
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,660
You tricked me into being a thief.

153
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,060
You're a dangerous person.

154
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,220
You're lying to me.

155
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,140
You...

156
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,500
I can hear you.

157
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,940
Sure.

158
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,020
Everyone thinks you're a woman of good character.

159
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,300
You're not a man of bad character.

160
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,500
I didn't plan to marry you.

161
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,700
General Li.

162
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,660
General Li.

163
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,820
You scared me.

164
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,580
Brother Lu.

165
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,660
Are you okay?

166
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,660
I'm fine, Ake.

167
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,700
Don't worry.

168
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,940
I told you I'm here.

169
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,380
I'll help you.

170
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,180
Don't worry, my lady.

171
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,540
I'll make sure you're safe.

172
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,220
I won't force anyone to be my wife again.

173
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,020
Brother Lu.

174
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,940
Wang Xiucai is at the next store.

175
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,420
Let's find another way while we're at it.

176
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,620
Okay.

177
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,180
Don't follow me.

178
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,260
General Li.

179
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,180
General Li.

180
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,020
General Li.

181
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,940
That flower-eating Shen Tongyun.

182
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,580
He's there.

183
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,940
I wonder what he's looking at.

184
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,940
He must be looking at a man.

185
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,220
He's so excited.

186
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,300
He's running out.

187
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,340
Shen Tongyun is really a man of good character.

188
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,460
Who would marry him?

189
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,860
You can't slander Yun'er.

190
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Who are you?

191
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,500
It's none of our business.

192
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,260
Why should you slander him?

193
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,260
Does he like your young master?

194
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,980
Is he going to marry your family?

195
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,740
He's not married yet.

196
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,540
He just wants to marry a handsome young master.

197
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,380
And he's cooperating.

198
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,060
Everyone knows he's a man of good character.

199
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,660
He's just a little bit of a smarty-pants.

200
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
You're just ruining his reputation.

201
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,740
How dare you say that he's a man of bad character?

202
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,180
Why are you yelling at us?

203
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,340
He can't marry anyone.

204
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,180
No one would marry a woman like him.

205
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,660
Who says he can't marry anyone?

206
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,300
Who says no one would marry him?

207
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,660
I'm willing to marry him.

208
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,700
One hundred, one thousand.

209
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,180
I'm willing to marry Shen Tongyun

210
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,580
with all my might.

211
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,460
I'll treat him like a treasure.

212
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,860
I'll protect him for the rest of my life.

213
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,260
Ensign, the wall is broken.

214
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,260
Your Highness,

215
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,500
it's not as good as before.

216
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,020
Is it creator-like?

217
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,660
isn't the beauty of your heart

218
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,860
really beautiful?

219
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,940
The one who truly loves you

220
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,260
will always protect you

221
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,820
even if he can't get you.

222
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,940
Today,

223
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,260
you've met the handsome man on the outside,

224
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,700
but you're very stubborn inside.

225
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,740
You should know

226
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,700
how precious good heart is.

227
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,140
You're handsome and handsome.

228
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,580
You're a gentleman.

229
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,540
Only those who have a good heart

230
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,780
can protect you for life.

231
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,060
Thank you, Master.

232
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
I'll leave now.

233
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,820
Ke,

234
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,060
is there no chance

235
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,860
for Wang Soo Chan?

236
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,860
You don't know women.

237
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,020
I...

238
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,260
I really don't know.

239
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,660
Wang Soo Chan, happy birthday.

240
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,300
I'll take you to the Shen Mansion tomorrow to propose.

241
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,060
Shi Meiguan,

242
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,820
don't joke around.

243
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,460
I've already given up on the chance.

244
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,540
What are you talking about?

245
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,620
If you don't give up on the chance,

246
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,820
what about Lady Shen?

247
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,900
Shi Meiguan,

248
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,860
Yun'an has already agreed to it.

249
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,300
She didn't agree.

250
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,860
She's a woman.

251
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,620
Does she want to marry you on the street?

252
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,740
Besides,

253
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,220
you're not a handsome man.

254
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,860
She's been with you for many years.

255
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,460
And she hesitated over and over again

256
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,220
because you hesitated about the marriage.

257
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,860
It shows that you're different in her heart.

258
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,220
But

259
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,780
she can't let go of her obsession.

260
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,220
Tomorrow,

261
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,540
you should pack up

262
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,500
and change your clothes.

263
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,260
We'll go to propose to her.

264
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,860
The marriage will be done.

265
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,500
Thank you, Shi Meiguan.

266
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,100
I think

267
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,420
Lady Shen must be moved.

268
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,380
Now, all that's left is...

269
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,700
Shi Meiguan,

270
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,820
sorry to keep you waiting.

271
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,740
You didn't understand what I said.

272
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,140
I told you to pack up

273
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
and change your clothes to propose to her.

274
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,940
You didn't understand.

275
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I'm sorry.

276
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,540
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,740
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,940
I'm sorry.

279
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,500
You didn't understand.

280
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,020
I...

281
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,540
I've changed my clothes before.

282
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,860
What's the difference between

283
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,980
your new clothes and the old ones?

284
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,220
But this one

285
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,140
is new.

286
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,500
I've never worn it before.

287
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,980
Forget it.

288
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,020
Come with me.

289
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,020
Let's go.

290
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,500
Hurry up.

291
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:33,140
The

292
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,700
a new style of men's clothing.

293
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,460
Just keep it on.

294
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,900
Give her whatever she wants.

295
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,780
Don't be too hard on her.

296
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,620
Yes.

297
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,140
And,

298
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,260
don't ask her for money.

299
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,540
I understand.

300
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,460
Don't worry.

301
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,260
All right.

302
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,260
It's your turn.

303
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,740
You seem to care more about Manager Li.

304
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,140
I always treat everyone the same.

305
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,100
Yes, we do.

306
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,500
But you care more about Miss Shi.

307
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,060
You're taking her as your wife.

308
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,100
What else?

309
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,500
Do you have any objections?

310
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,260
I...

311
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,940
I'm not going to do it.

312
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,660
Let's get down to business.

313
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,140
Li Yang returned after killing Yu.

314
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Any news from him?

315
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,260
He hasn't taken action yet.

316
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,940
But he knows about it.

317
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,100
He's a good friend of Li Yang.

318
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,620
He even praised our mountain master for being a good man.

319
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,340
He said he would send a message to him the next day.

320
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,060
I'm busy with my business.

321
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,460
He must have something to do.

322
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,660
Forget it.

323
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,340
I'll go check on A'ge.

324
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,700
The clothes of Xibao Pavilion

325
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,460
are really clean and clean.

326
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,020
It's very refreshing.

327
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,700
I understand.

328
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,900
Thank you for your advice.

329
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,820
It's such a formal day.

330
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,660
I should have chosen a better dress.

331
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,620
That would show my importance.

332
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,180
But I don't know how to do it.

333
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,020
Please help me choose one.

334
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,060
Wang Xiucai, you're so straightforward.

335
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,660
You care about the clothes.

336
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,020
You can choose whatever you like.

337
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,020
Miss Shi, our master said

338
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,020
you can choose whatever you want.

339
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,020
Just take it as your home.

340
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,820
Don't be polite to our master.

341
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,740
Should I forgive him or not?

342
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,420
Forget it.

343
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,820
I'll talk about it after the wedding.

344
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,220
Wang Xiucai, you're elegant.

345
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,220
You should choose a low-key and elegant dress.

346
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,300
And you should wear some accessories.

347
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,340
The material should be more expensive.

348
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,100
How about this one?

349
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,580
Sure.

350
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,500
Mr. Wang, come with me.

351
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,780
This one is so beautiful.

352
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,300
This one is made of gold thread.

353
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,660
Will Wang Xiucai's dress be too gorgeous?

354
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,820
I didn't say I'd give it to him.

355
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,100
Some people are really unkind.

356
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,420
I don't want to be friends with them.

357
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,060
Is Ake still mad at me?

358
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,220
Miss Shi, you have a unique taste.

359
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,860
Wait.

360
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,300
I feel something is missing.

361
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,940
Wait a minute.

362
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,260
Miss Shi, this is pearl powder.

363
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,220
Yes, we should use pearl powder.

364
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,780
This..

365
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,700
The face is much smaller now.

366
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,820
The type of person in god's clothing still remains only to stick to such dress in theeless vise.

367
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,220
He is right.

368
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:39,940
Come on.

I have heard that

374
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,940
it is a must-win for all of us.

375
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,260
We all need to wear it today.

376
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:54,780
Well.

378
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Thank you for your advice, Junior Sister.

379
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Can you also give me some advice?

380
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,760
Then, before the Shen Family's young lady got married,

381
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,760
the Shen Family's area is hundreds of miles away.

382
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,360
Please avoid it, Chief Lu.

383
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,960
Or else, you'll dig our wall.

384
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
A hundred miles away?

385
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,560
Isn't that too far?

386
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,960
Is it hard on you, Chief Lu?

387
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,360
Let's go.

388
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,960
Let's go.

389
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,560
Let's go.

390
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,160
Let's go.

391
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,960
Let's go.

392
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,560
Let's go.

393
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,360
Let's go.

394
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,360
Let's go.

395
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Junior Sister,

396
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,360
this is...

397
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,760
Let's take a look at the silkworms first.

398
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,360
Then, we can pick up the steel.

399
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,960
This...

400
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,560
Yu'er.

401
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,560
I brought you a painting today.

402
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,760
Come and take a look.

403
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,960
This is Mr. Gu Shan's painting.

404
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,560
Gu Shan is my old friend.

405
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,360
I asked him to paint it long ago

406
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
to celebrate your wedding.

407
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,360
I just didn't expect that I would be so lucky.

408
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,760
Yu'er.

409
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,960
I came here to propose to you today.

410
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
If you allow me,

411
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,560
I will love you for the rest of my life,

412
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,560
protect you,

413
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
and make you happy.

414
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,560
If I don't allow you,

415
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,960
will you not give me this painting?

416
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,560
Yes.

417
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,760
This painting

418
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,360
is meant to be your wedding.

419
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,960
If you are willing to marry me,

420
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,960
this painting

421
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,760
is one of the wedding gifts.

422
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,960
If you...

423
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,560
If you get other good men,

424
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,760
this painting

425
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,160
is my gift.

426
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Lady Shen.

427
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,760
Wang Xiucai has loved you for years.

428
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
He has been testing you.

429
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,360
You can't miss such a good man.

430
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,760
Look at the steel.

431
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,360
Draw it.

432
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
I will get it right away.

433
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,760
Next is the wedding invitation.

434
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
You can ask your parents

435
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
to set the wedding date.

436
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,960
No need to bother.

437
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,560
My father has been hoping that I will get a good husband.

438
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,760
Today, it's as he wishes.

439
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,560
I will get it right away.

440
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,560
What is your plan?

441
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,360
Three days later is the auspicious day.

442
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
You can help me with the wedding.

443
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,360
Three days?

444
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,360
Lady Shen,

445
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,160
isn't it too soon?

446
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,160
No, no.

447
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,560
Well,

448
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
I have loved you for years.

449
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,760
I can't delay it.

450
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,960
Please help me.

451
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,760
Please help me.

452
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
Thank you.

453
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,760
Go.

454
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Thank you.

455
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,360
Brother Yuan,

456
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,560
show me this painting.

457
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:11,960
Yun'er.

458
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,160
Three days.

459
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
It's really more than I expected.

460
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,160
Ke,

461
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
what's wrong with you?

462
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,960
Did you encounter any trouble?

463
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,360
Or are you not feeling well?

464
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,160
Why is it my wedding?

465
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,360
If I don't get married,

466
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
I will be anxious.

467
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,160
Once I get married, I will be anxious.

468
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,360
I am anxious every day.

469
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,160
I have to get married in three days.

470
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,960
What should I do?

471
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,960
What are you afraid of?

472
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
I am here.

473
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,160
You can't help me with this.

474
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,360
Only Brother Xian can help me.

475
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,560
Wait.

476
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,760
Wait.

477
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,760
I am not kidding.

478
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,560
Before Shen Tongyun gets married,

479
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,360
you have to avoid Xian.

480
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,160
You can't show up.

481
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
You don't avoid Xian.

482
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,960
Why should I avoid Xian?

483
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,960
It has nothing to do with me.

484
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,160
Remember.

485
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,160
Avoid Xian.

486
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,160
Don't follow me.

487
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Tiantian,

488
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,760
Shen Tongyun's wedding is done.

489
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,960
It doesn't matter if we get married.

490
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,360
If we help him to recite the chess and wash the cake in three days,

491
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,160
we will have a good chance to go to the capital.

492
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,960
Don't even think about it.

493
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,160
It's impossible to recite thousands of cakes in three days.

494
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,960
Don't reject me so soon.

495
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,360
I will give you more money.

496
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,760
What if your husband helps you?

497
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,160
Brother Xian,

498
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,760
please help me.

499
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,760
Don't dream about it.

500
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,760
I promise you.

501
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
As long as we work day and night,

502
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,560
we will make it.

503
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,360
Great.

504
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,160
I know you are my and Lady Shen's benefactors.

505
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,760
Boss He, don't be too hard on me.

506
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
As your sister said,

507
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,560
thousands of cakes can't be made.

508
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,760
As long as I promise Ake,

509
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,360
I will make it.

510
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
But I don't know

511
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
what Mr. Lu can do for Ake.

512
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,960
There are many guests in Shen's family.

513
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,360
I will help Ake to write the wedding invitation.

514
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,960
So many wedding invitations.

515
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,760
Are you really willing to help me?

516
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,560
Of course.

517
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,160
I have never lied to you.

518
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
The three of us

519
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,560
must work together.

520
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,960
We will make Lady Shen's wedding

521
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,960
smooth and grand.

522
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
What a secret.

523
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,560
The son of Wang family.

524
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,560
The daughter of Shen family.

525
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,160
The marriage is forever.

526
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,760
The same name.

527
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,760
The same brush.

528
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,360
The same name.

529
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,360
The same brush.

530
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,960
Only the engagement of the white-headed

531
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,160
and the marriage of the innocent.

532
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,360
The old and the young.

533
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
The same heart forever.

534
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,760
The old and the young.

535
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,160
The wedding for others.

536
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,960
The night is long.

537
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,760
Ake.

538
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,560
I will find a way

539
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,160
to stop you from doing this.

540
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,960
Why are you here?

541
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,560
I saw you

542
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,160
and you got beaten up again.

543
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,560
I did what I should do.

544
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,360
If you want to do it,

545
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,360
I have to do it.

546
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,360
You...

547
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,160
Forget it, Mr. Lu.

548
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,960
You helped me a lot.

549
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
You helped me

550
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,160
to make the marriage smooth.

551
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,960
I am grateful to you.

552
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
I will do my best

553
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,760
to help you.

554
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,360
I will do my best.

555
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,760
I will do my best.

556
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
I will do my best.

557
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,560
I will do my best.

558
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,760
To help me

559
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,360
to get rid of Li Yang,

560
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,560
I should thank you.

561
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,560
Ake.

562
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,560
You are not angry with me anymore?

563
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,360
Of course I am angry.

564
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,560
But now I am not angry anymore.

565
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,560
If my two brothers

566
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,960
didn't hurt you secretly,

567
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,360
you wouldn't have the chance to pretend to be sick.

568
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,360
After all,

569
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,360
it's my two brothers' fault.

570
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,360
Ake.

571
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,560
I...

572
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,360
Mr. Lu.

573
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,960
You forgot why I am angry?

574
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,160
You should be polite.

575
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,760
Don't think about it.

576
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,760
Shi Fak, you are engaged.

577
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:44,560
How can you be so

578
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
a little angry?

579
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,360
I was just pretending.

580
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
I am not.

581
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
It's you guys

582
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,760
who did it.

583
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,560
Ake.

584
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,560
We are not.

585
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,560
What are you guys?

586
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,360
He is helping me now.

587
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,760
If he is injured,

588
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,560
I will tell you.

589
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,160
Second Brother.

590
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,960
I am sleepy.

591
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Help me to bed.

592
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,160
Mr. Lu is afraid of dark,

593
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,960
let's go together.

594
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
I am not afraid of dark.

595
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,160
Wait,

596
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,360
I said

597
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,160
Brother Lu is not injured.

598
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,960
Burn your hand.

599
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,160
This is a secret.

600
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,480
Don't let them know.

601
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,760
Send Brother Lu out.

602
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,560
Do you hear me?

603
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,840
Mr. Lu, it's so late.

604
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,920
Are you sleepy?

605
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Your Highness,

606
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,760
you two are going to the capital.

607
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,560
Your parents are going to the capital.

608
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Today is your wedding day.

609
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,760
The ceremony is over.

610
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
Congratulations.

611
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Congratulations.

612
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
Congratulations.

613
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Yu'er's mother died early.

614
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
I'm taking care of my mother.

615
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
I'm taking care of my mother.

616
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
I'm taking care of my mother.

617
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
I'm afraid I can't take care of Yun'er.

618
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
I'm afraid I can't take care of Yun'er.

619
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,760
I can't help but pamper her.

620
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,760
Now someone is really good to her.

621
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
I'm relieved.

622
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Father-in-law, don't worry.

623
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
I will be good to Yun'er.

624
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Let her be happy.

625
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
Good.

626
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Good.

627
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Good.

628
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Junior Sister.

629
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
Lord Shen,

630
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
what are you doing?

631
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
You're killing me.

632
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Junior Sister,

633
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
you can afford this.

634
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
My marriage with Yun'er's mother

635
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
is the beauty of your mother's Peach Family.

636
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Today, you have a good marriage for Yun'er.

637
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
I'm so grateful.

638
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
The best beauty in the world.

639
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
There are people behind it.

640
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
It's not a lie.

641
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
This is my duty.

642
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Lord Shen is right.

643
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,760
They are in love.

644
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
I'm happy for them.

645
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Well said.

646
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Ke.

647
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
Ke.

648
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Let's go.

649
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
Brother Ren.

650
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Lord Shen,

651
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
what's wrong with you?

652
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Don't miss the auspicious time of the wedding.

653
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Lord Shen, don't be afraid.

654
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
I don't want to go back on my word.

655
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
I just want to

656
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
feel the happiness of the wedding.

657
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
I was obsessed with the beautiful appearance

658
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
and missed many turns.

659
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Today, I know

660
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,760
the true heart is far beyond the appearance.

661
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
I will definitely

662
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
shake hands with Brother Ren

663
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
to repay your kindness.

664
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
I should thank you.

665
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
You are involved in the case.

666
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
I am involved in the punishment.

667
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
You hugged me.

668
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,760
I am sincerely grateful to you.

669
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Mother, I understand you.

670
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
You are a matchmaker

671
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
not for the sake of your reputation

672
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
or the reputation of your family.

673
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
I just want to

674
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
make a good match

675
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
and be with you forever.

676
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
This kind of

677
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
priceless sense of honor

678
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
that comes from the heart

679
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,760
is what I should protect.

680
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,760
You are the most matchmaker in the world.

681
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
I am a matchmaker

682
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,760
in the world.

683
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Brother,

684
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
I will take this love

685
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
and live with you.

686
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
I just hope that one day,

687
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,760
I can also be with you forever.

688
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,760
I just want to be with you forever.

689
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Shi Meiguang!

690
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Shi Meiguang!

691
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Where is Shi Meiguang?

692
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,760
Be careful.

693
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
Shi Meiguang!

694
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Where is Shi Meiguang?

695
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Please drink the Xie Meijiu

696
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,760
that I brought to the Great Water Mirror.

697
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
Go.

698
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Shi Meiguang,

699
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
don't drink it.

700
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Brother Lu,

701
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
what are you going to do?

702
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
I know your alcohol level very well.

703
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Drink a cup of wine.

704
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Wait.

705
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Why is this scene so familiar?

706
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
If you can't remember,

707
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
how about...

708
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
By the way,

709
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
I remember now.

710
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
I promised to do

711
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
a few things for you.

712
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
I haven't done it yet.

713
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Whether I forgive you or not,

714
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
I will keep my promise.

715
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
I wanted to owe you

716
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
for what you promised me that day.

717
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
I will tell you

718
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
after I have thought it over.

719
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
But Ake,

720
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
what should I do

721
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
to make you forgive me?

722
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
You didn't think it over.

723
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
I have thought it over.

724
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
What do you want?

725
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
You

726
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
will treat me to a month's snack.

727
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
You can't do it again.

728
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
I will forgive you.

729
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
It's a deal.

730
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
It's a deal.

731
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Ake,

732
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
you are being unreasonable again.

733
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,760
I'm afraid you will regret it.

734
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
I will never regret it.

735
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
From tomorrow on,

736
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
I will see you at the gate of your house.

737
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Okay.

738
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
My Lord, please spare my life.

739
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
My Lord, please spare my life.

740
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
I will send someone

741
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
to kill everyone

742
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
and find the composition

743
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
at all costs.

744
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
If I can't find it,

745
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
I will burn it

746
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
and kill it.

747
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Burn it and then?

748
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Then?

749
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Then, I will tell that person

750
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
to pursue me

751
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
or to remind him

752
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
that I took the map

753
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
to take the throne.

754
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
I'm stupid.

755
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
I'm stupid.

756
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
I just want to

757
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
solve the problem for you.

758
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
You are a stupid person.

759
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
Now, Li Yang

760
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
and Shen Tongyun's marriage

761
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
is in a mess.

762
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
At this time,

763
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
killing and burning the house

764
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
is like telling the world

765
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
that it was done by Li Yang and me.

766
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Now,

767
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
although the composition is not found,

768
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
as long as

769
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
the commander of the Bureau of Jinqi

770
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
is in my hands,

771
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
then,

772
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
I will be

773
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
the final winner

774
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,760
in the imperial city.

775
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
My Lord,

776
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
you are really a genius.

777
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,760
You are really a genius.

778
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Are you

779
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
a person who

780
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
is responsible for this?

781
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,760
Stupid.

782
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
That person

783
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
knows his temper

784
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
and personality.

785
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
His reputation is already bad.

786
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
How could it be him?

787
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Get up.

788
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
Get up.

789
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,760
Watch and see.

790
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Whoever takes the throne

791
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
will be mine.

792
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
If Guan Meiting

793
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,760
arranges a good marriage for him,

794
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
I will take this person

795
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
and squeeze him to death.

796
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Immortal,

797
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
I am not a good daughter.

798
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
I am here to

799
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
arrange a good marriage for you.

800
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Today,

801
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
you two have already got married.

802
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
Ake,

803
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
you are back.

804
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Mother.

805
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
You...

806
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
You are drinking again.

807
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Mother,

808
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,760
I have learned to be smart this time.

809
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
When someone is drinking,

810
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
I will hide.

811
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
You won't blame me

812
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
for coming back late, right?

813
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
I am busy with the wedding

814
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
and I came back

815
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
after sending the guests away.

816
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
I know you are smart.

817
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
I won't blame you.

818
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
I know you love me the most.

819
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
It is really my ancestors' blessing.

820
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Mother,

821
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
I said I would arrange

822
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Shen Tongyun's marriage.

823
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Are you happy?

824
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Of course I am happy.

825
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
Silly child.

826
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
My ancestors don't have the time

827
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
to care about this.

828
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
You have worked hard

829
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
and arranged a good marriage.

830
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
You did a good job.

831
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
I am honored to have you.

832
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
I am so happy.

833
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Do you hear that, ancestors?

834
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
My mother praised me.

835
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
This child...

836
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Mother,

837
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
I don't know if the ancestors helped me or not.

838
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
But the neighbor,

839
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Brother Lu,

840
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
helped me a lot.

841
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
Although last time he...

842
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
But it was brother and father

843
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
who bullied him first.

844
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
I know.

845
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,760
It is true that your father

846
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
and two brothers

847
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
have gone too far.

848
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
Since they helped you,

849
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
you should thank them.

850
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
Mother, I know.

851
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
I will promise you

852
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,760
to be a good matchmaker.

853
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
You must remember

854
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
the eight words

855
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
that Mother Shicheng said.

856
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Mother, don't worry.

857
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
I have done it.

858
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
I have done it.

859
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,760
I will remember it.

860
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
You are my good daughter.

861
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Wait.

862
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Lu Chi helped Shen Tongyuan's marriage?

863
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Ake made up with her?

864
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
The most important thing is

865
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
that Mother said she would thank him.

866
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Father, what should we do now?

867
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
I don't understand it.

868
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
Anyway, your mother has agreed.

869
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,760
We can't make your mother unhappy, right?

870
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
But remember one thing.

871
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,760
Ake is our love.

872
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,760
We can't let others do it.

873
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
No.

874
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
I tell you two,

875
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
keep an eye on him every day.

876
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Keep an eye on Lu Chi.

877
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Okay. I will do it.

878
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
I will follow them every day.

879
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
I will help them.

880
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Lu, you do it.

881
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
Okay.

882
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Come on.

883
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Follow Ake.

884
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Come on.

885
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
What are you doing?

886
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Why are you so angry?

887
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
You said

888
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
you waited for me at my door this morning.

889
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
My father didn't bother you.

890
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
He was very kind to you.

891
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Not really.

892
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
He just ignored me

893
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
and left.

894
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
You don't understand.

895
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
You lied to them last time.

896
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
They didn't drive you away.

897
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
They are kind to you.

898
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
That's true.

899
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
I hope

900
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,760
they can keep being kind to each other.

901
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
So that no one will bother me

902
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
with my one-month snack plan.

903
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Ake.

904
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Ake.

905
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
Ake.

906
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Where are you going?

907
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
I will go with you.

908
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
Brother.

909
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
You don't want to go on a trip?

910
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
It's okay.

911
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,760
I will go on a trip and go with you.

912
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
You guys,

913
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
go over there.

914
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Yes.

915
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
Ake, Brother.

916
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Let's go together.

917
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
Okay.

918
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Let's go.

919
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
Boss, give me a boat.

920
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
Okay.

921
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
It's just right.

922
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
Thank you.

923
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Give me one more.

924
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Here.

925
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Give me one more.

926
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Is it good?

927
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Who is it?

928
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
It's Shen Xiao Niangzi.

929
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
This is Brother Bu Kuan.

930
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Look,

931
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,760
this is my husband.

932
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
Isn't he handsome, cool, and has a great temperament?

933
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
He is quite elegant.

934
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Put him on.

935
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Don't be so high-profile.

936
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,760
I'm not handsome, cool, and has a great temperament.

937
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
You are.

938
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,760
You are handsome, cool, and has a great temperament.

939
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,760
I am.

940
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
I am.

941
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
I am.

942
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
I am.

943
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
I am.

944
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
I am.

945
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
I am.

946
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
I am.

947
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
You are extraordinary.

948
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Brother Bu Kuan, am I wrong?

949
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Am I right?

950
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
No.

951
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Let go of me.

952
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
You are too thin.

953
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Listen,

954
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
control yourself.

955
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,760
If you keep bothering the passers-by,

956
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
you will be arrested and sent back to your mansion.

957
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Brother.

958
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Goodbye.

959
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Why are you laughing?

960
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,760
I said that Shen Xiao Niangzi is cool and has a great temperament.

961
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
I just said what I thought.

962
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
What's wrong with being beautiful?

963
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Yes.

964
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
But I didn't laugh at him.

965
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Everyone knows the beauty of love.

966
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,760
I just didn't expect that your brother is so powerful.

967
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
And he is so afraid of girls.

968
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
What did you say?

969
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,760
I said that Brother Shi has left.

970
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
We can go to eat soup and rice.

971
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
What are you waiting for?

972
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
Go now.

973
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Go.

974
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
Go.

975
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,760
Baihua Art Hall.

976
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
I have to go and have a look.

977
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,760
The dance of Baihua Art Hall is very wonderful.

978
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
Especially the boss, Mr. Hua.

979
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
It's even more beautiful.

980
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
It's really good.

981
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
Master.

982
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,760
Can you take me to that

983
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Baihua Art Hall to find something?

984
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
I have something important to tell Mr. Li.

985
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Master.

986
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Are you going to take Mr. Li back?

987
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
You...

988
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,760
I want to take A Ke.

989
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
You go.

990
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Master.

991
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
This is the account of this month.

992
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Please have a look.

993
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Today,

994
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Shi Qianqian always follows me and A Ke.

995
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
It's all the same.

996
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
I heard that he is afraid of the spirit of a girl.

997
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
I guess you have a way to lure him away.

998
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Yes, I understand.

999
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
This little lady is really beautiful.

1000
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,760
You are so beautiful.

1001
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
I'm so happy.

1002
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
I'm so happy.

1003
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Brother Lu.

1004
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
Where is this place?

1005
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
It doesn't look like a place to eat.

1006
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
There are not only delicious food here.

1007
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
There are also beautiful things.

1008
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Follow me.

1009
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Look.

1010
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
Look.

1011
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Look at the stomach.

1012
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Look at the stomach.

1013
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
Good.

1014
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
Good.

1015
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
Good.

1016
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Good.

1017
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
It's so beautiful.

1018
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
It's so beautiful.

1019
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,760
It's so beautiful.

1020
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
It's so beautiful.

1021
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
Come.

1022
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
Brother Lu.

1023
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
I think this is beautiful.

1024
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,760
How do you like it?

1025
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
It's good.

1026
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
It's good.

1027
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Men are really lucky.

1028
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
They really like beauty.

1029
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,760
Actually,

1030
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,760
I was just teasing you.

1031
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
His smile is not as good as Ake Chen's.

1032
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,760
He doesn't have any true feelings in dancing.

1033
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
That's what I'm talking about.

1034
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
This is a very sweet theme.

1035
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
I heard that

1036
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,760
there are often no more guests

1037
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,760
in this flower garden.

1038
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,760
So the venue is cancelled.

1039
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,760
But I can only see him in the daytime.

1040
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
That's right.

1041
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,760
Especially that sub-commissioner Xu Ao.

1042
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
I've seen him several times.

1043
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
He always goes to the room upstairs.

1044
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,760
They must have something to do.

1045
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Right?

1046
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,760
He's young and successful.

1047
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Now he's in the middle of the day.

1048
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
He must be in a good mood.

1049
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,760
Men

1050
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
should relax at night.

1051
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
It's normal.

1052
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
It makes sense.

1053
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Come on.

1054
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
Let's toast.

1055
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
Brother Lu, let's go.

1056
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,760
Don't listen to nonsense.

1057
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
Let's go.

1058
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,760
Don't listen to nonsense.

1059
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
Miss, look.

1060
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,760
Ake.

1061
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Why are you angry?

1062
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
A group of people

1063
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
is the most annoying to slander others.

1064
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,760
I know Xu Ao they say.

1065
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,760
My mother protected him.

1066
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,760
Although he is poor,

1067
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
he is a righteous person.

1068
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
A person knows his face but not his heart.

1069
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,760
After so long,

1070
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,760
maybe he has changed.

1071
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Impossible.

1072
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
My mother has many people in her eyes.

1073
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
She won't look at the wrong person.

1074
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,760
Yes.

1075
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,760
Tao Xiaomei's eyes won't leave.

1076
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,760
Ake.

1077
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Don't be so stingy.

1078
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,760
My mother is the best in the world.

1079
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,760
She did nothing.

1080
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
But she didn't get married.

1081
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
They are a good match.

1082
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
By the order of the emperor,

1083
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,760
I'm going to the palace to make a decree.

1084
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,760
The new chess player is not only a threat to Xu Ao.

1085
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,760
Xu Tian is going to the mountain.

1086
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,760
By the order of the emperor,

1087
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,760
I'm going to the palace to make a decree.

1088
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,760
By the order of the emperor,

1089
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,760
I'm going to the mountain to make a decree.

1090
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
The new chess player is not only a threat to Xu Ao.

1091
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
Xu Tian is going to the mountain.

1092
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
By the order of the emperor,

1093
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,760
What did I say?

1094
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
Xu Ao is a senior.

1095
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
Miss Liu was married to the wrong person.

1096
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
I know the truth.

1097
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,760
I know the truth.

1098
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,760
I know the truth.

1099
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
I know the truth.

1100
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
I know the truth.

1101
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
I know the truth.

1102
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,760
I know the truth.

1103
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
I know the truth.

1104
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,760
I know the truth.

1105
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
I know the truth.

1106
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I know the truth.

1107
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,760
I know the truth.

1108
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
I know the truth.

1109
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,760
I know the truth.

1110
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:16,760
I know this meeting is the grace of fate.

1111
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,760
Every time I see you,

1112
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,760
I only have a cute stubbornness.

1113
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,760
Although I can't remember every day of the chaos,

1114
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:37,760
I never forget the first time I saw you.

1115
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
Even if this love is heartless,

1116
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
no sound, no day, no night,

1117
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,760
no matter the wind and moon,

1118
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,760
as long as you are not afraid,

1119
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,760
no number, no worries, no worries.

1120
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
I will guard the coffin.

1121
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,760
No matter the fire and the mortal world,

1122
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,760
whether there will be any border,

1123
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:04,760
I am willing to protect you with my life.

1124
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,760
Even if I can't love you as I love you,

1125
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,760
I will love you with all my heart.

1126
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,760
I will love you all my life.

1127
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,760
No matter the fire and the mortal world,

1128
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,760
I will love you with all my heart.

1129
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:32,760
Please remember the youth that burned in the past.

1130
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:40,760
From now on, I don't want to part with you.
