00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,940
After what happened today,

5
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,750
I've come to
understand Luan'er's character.

6
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,430
Regarding your marriage...

7
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,039
Madam, it's not what you think.

8
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,680
I was out of my mind today

9
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,310
and hired someone to pose as a robber,

10
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,840
just to gain your approval.

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,520
But somehow,

12
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,850
my plan backfired

13
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,780
and nearly cost you
and Shaoheng your lives.

14
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,150
I know I've betrayed your trust.

15
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,240
I dare not mention
my marriage to Shaoheng anymore

16
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,690
I only ask for your forgiveness, Madam.

17
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,640
Come.

18
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,240
Luan'er, don't talk nonsense.

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,760
Those assassins today were ruthless.

20
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,100
They nearly took your life.

21
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,100
How could they possibly be hired by you?

22
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,560
Those four who escaped

23
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,090
were probably hired by her,

24
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,550
but those who tried
to kill us mother and son

25
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,570
have absolutely nothing to do with her.

26
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,579
Madam.

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,950
Shaoheng.

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,450
You insisted I go burn incense,

29
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,020
and things were strange all along the way.

30
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,510
I bet you had a hand in this too.

31
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,020
-Mother, Iâ€¦
-Your mother is not old.

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,490
Luan'er is injured now,

33
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,460
and in the future,

34
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,180
she probably can't
carry water or brew tea.

35
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,010
I think we might as well
close the teahouse.

36
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,620
Mother, how can you say such things?

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,970
Luan'er was injured trying to save you...

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,450
This is all my own fault.

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,540
I blame no one else.

40
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,200
Please don't worry, Madam.

41
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,800
My son may be a bit of a scoundrel,

42
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,750
but he still has some conscience.

43
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,910
In the future,

44
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,780
if he dares to mistreat you,

45
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,240
I'll beat him for you.

46
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,220
Mother, you've agreed!

47
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,360
Hurry up and prepare the room.

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,230
Oh right, remember to find Shi Fa'ke.

49
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,550
You children,

50
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,200
conspiring together on such a rotten plan,

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,930
all just to get married, right?

52
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,430
Now everything is settled,

53
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,450
so the wedding

54
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,300
should be arranged as soon as possible.

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,360
Thank you, Mother.

56
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,160
I'll go prepare right away.

57
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,070
Let's go.

58
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:01,970
Let go.

59
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,480
You're so clumsy.

60
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,330
I'll take care of Luan'er.

61
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,390
You go handle the important matters.

62
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,690
Lu, I...

63
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,959
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,839
Did I hurt you?

65
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,020
I don't know how to repay your kindness.

66
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,950
You already know?

67
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,270
If you want me to know, I'll know.

68
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,790
If you don't want me to know,

69
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,190
I'll pretend not to know.

70
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,270
But your kindness

71
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,020
will always remain in my heart.

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,100
I don't want to bestow favors.

73
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,560
It's better if you forget.

74
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,490
Anyway, you still have
one thing to promise me.

75
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,070
I...

76
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,940
Hey, you two,

77
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,920
could you stop being all lovey-dovey here?

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,990
For saving your life,

79
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,390
you should repay him
by becoming his bride.

80
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,930
Qi Shaoheng, stop talking nonsense.

81
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,340
Miss Shi,

82
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,400
how am I talking nonsense?

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,890
You two, I'm getting married.

84
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,650
Doesn't it feel like a dream?

85
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,610
Miss Shi, shall I pinch you

86
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,040
so you can feel it's real?

87
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,320
No need.

88
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,770
It's fortunate that this incident

89
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,830
has led to your marriage with Luan'er,

90
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,740
which is truly a cause for celebration.

91
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,410
However, Lu,

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,450
didn't you just hire
some porters to put on an act?

93
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,220
Why would they try
to harm us in broad daylight?

94
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
The Qi family runs an escort agency,

95
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,980
so they're bound to have some enemies,

96
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,380
which isn't surprising.

97
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,230
I suppose so.

98
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,390
Anyway,

99
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,080
your marriage is settled now.

100
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,670
Mrs. Qi is very magnanimous,

101
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,750
not blaming us

102
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,150
and even approving your marriage.

103
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,310
Of course.

104
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,670
Thanks to Luan'er
who sacrificed herself to save my mother.

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,930
Of course, of course.

106
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,320
Miss Shi's brilliant plan

107
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,950
deserves a lot of credit too.

108
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't mention it.

109
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,360
I'll never dare think of

110
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,200
such a terrible idea again.

111

I see yours isn't bad either.

You...

115
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,120
Then I'll trouble you, Miss Shi,

116
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,520
to arrange my wedding as soon as possible

117

with all the proper
betrothal gifts and ceremonies.

118
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,730
Farewell.

119
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,520
Wait, Mr. Qi.

120
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,910
I have a favor to ask of you.

121
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,570
Our family

122
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,290
has never robbed
your family's silver or valuables.

123

My parents are
still wrongfully imprisoned.

124
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,710
I know you're a victim,

125
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,940
and so are my parents.

126
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,840
Therefore,

127
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,340
I beg you to go to the Military
Headquarters and tell the truth,

128
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,270
so my parents can be released soon.

129
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
It's the right thing to do.

130
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,150
Those villains today

131
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,130
are likely our family's true enemies.

132
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,700
Miss Shi, you're honest and kind,

133
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,540
and I've also heard
about Ms. Tao's character.

134
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,780
I'll go to the Military Headquarters
right now to plead your case,

135
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,550
and clear your family's name.

136
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,230
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

137
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,690
I'll go get the Information Card
and Betrothal Letter for stamping now.

138
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,640
Lu, aren't you going?

139
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,440

Ms. Deng,

142
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,680
aren't you curious about

143
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,140
how I successfully arranged
Qi Shaoheng's match?

144
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't care how you did it.

145
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,010
I merely kept you
here out of old friendship,

146
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,530
letting you idle away
at the Official Matchmaking Agency.

147
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,870
From now on,

148
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,020
the Agency won't assign
you any more matchmaking cases.

149
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,810
Ms. Deng, you call this old friendship?

150
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,220
Don't call me Ms. Deng.

151
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,180
Call me Chief Matchmaker Deng.

152
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,740
I am now the Chief Matchmaker
of the Official Matchmaking Agency.

153
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,900
I understand.

154
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,370
If the Agency
won't assign me cases, so be it.

155
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,950
That won't stop me.

157
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,660

158

I've brought it for Miss Shi.

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,140
which would you like to hear first?

162
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,169
Would you prefer to speak now,

163
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,370
or never speak again?

164
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,260
Which do you choose?

165
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
The good news is,

166
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,450
the Ms. Tao and the Shi father
and son will soon be released from prison.

167
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,120
The bad news is that one

168
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,250
says he's being
pressured to marry by court officials,

169
